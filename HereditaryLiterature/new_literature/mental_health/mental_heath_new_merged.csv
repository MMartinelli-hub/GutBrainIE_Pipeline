32163822,The gut microbiota and mental health in adults.,"A growing body of evidence point toward the bidirectional gut microbiota-brain axis playing a role in mental health. Most of this research is conducted on animals why we in this review summarize and comment upon recent studies evaluating the gut microbiome in mental health in humans. Further support for the relevance of the bidirectional gut microbiota-brain communication in mood disorders has been presented, such as the effect of probiotics on brain connectivity and mental health outcomes and pregnancy related stress on gut microbiota in the newborn child. However, the heterogeneity between studies precludes conclusions regarding differences in microbiota composition in mental disease and health and many of the studies are limited by a cross-sectional design, small sample sizes and multiple comparisons. Thus, well-designed longitudinal studies with larger sample size, accounting for confounders are needed.",Current opinion in neurobiology,2020,Ellionore Järbrink-Sehgal; Anna Andreasson
33271426,The gut microbiota in anxiety and depression - A systematic review.,"Growing evidence indicates the community of microorganisms throughout the gastrointestinal tract, (i.e., gut microbiota), is associated with anxiety and depressive disorders. We present the first systematic review of the gut microbiota in anxiety disorders, along with an update in depression. Consideration of shared underlying features is essential due to the high rates of comorbidity. Systematic searches, following PRISMA guidelines, identified 26 studies (two case-control comparisons of the gut microbiota in generalised anxiety disorder, 18 in depression, one incorporating both anxiety/depression, and five including symptom-only measures). Alpha and beta diversity findings were inconsistent; however, differences in bacterial taxa indicated disorders may be characterised by a higher abundance of proinflammatory species (e.g., Enterobacteriaceae and Desulfovibrio), and lower short-chain fatty acid producing-bacteria (e.g., Faecalibacterium). Several taxa, and their mechanisms of action, may relate to anxiety and depression pathophysiology via communication of peripheral inflammation to the brain. Although the gut microbiota remains a promising target for prevention and therapy, future research should assess confounders, particularly diet and psychotropic medications, and should examine microorganism function.",Clinical psychology review,2021,Carra A Simpson; Carmela Diaz-Arteche; Djamila Eliby; Orli S Schwartz; Julian G Simmons; Caitlin S M Cowan

32772900,Gut microbes in neurocognitive and mental health disorders.,"As individuals age, the prevalence of neurocognitive and mental health disorders increases. Current biomedical treatments do not completely address the management of these conditions. Despite new pharmacological therapy the challenges of managing these diseases remain.There is increasing evidence that the Gut Microbiome (GM) and microbial dysbiosis contribute to some of the more prevalent mental health and neurocognitive disorders, such as depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), schizophrenia, bipolar disorder (BP), and dementia as well as the behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. <b>Methodology:</b> Scoping review about the effect of gut microbiota on neurocognitive and mental health disorders.This scoping review found there is an evolving evidence of the involvement of the gut microbiota in the pathophysiology of neurocognitive and mental health disorders. This manuscript also discusses how the psychotropics used to treat these conditions may have an antimicrobial effect on GM, and the potential for new strategies of management with probiotics and faecal transplantation.This understanding can open up the need for a gut related approach in these disorders as well as unlock the door for the role of gut related microbiota management. KEY MESSAGES Challenges of managing mental health conditions remain in spite of new pharmacological therapy. Gut dysbiosis is seen in various mental health conditions. Various psychotropic medications can have an influence on the gut microbiota by their antimicrobial effect.",Annals of medicine,2020,Tyler Halverson; Kannayiram Alagiakrishnan
32899236,"Alcohol Addiction, Gut Microbiota, and Alcoholism Treatment: A Review.","Alcohol addiction is a leading risk factor for personal death and disability. In 2016, alcohol use caused 2.2% of female deaths and 6.8% of male deaths, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were 2.3% in female and 8.9% in male. Individuals with alcohol use disorder are at high risk of anxiety, depression, impaired cognition performance, and illicit drug use and are comorbid with liver disease, such as alcoholic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis, which is a major cause of personal death and disability worldwide. Psychological interventions, such as cognitive behavior therapy and motivational interviewing, as well as medical treatments, such as disulfiram, naltrexone, acamprosate, and nalmefene, are used for the treatment of alcohol addiction in Europe and the United States. However, the effect of current interventions is limited, and the need for additional interventions is substantial. Alcohol use impairs the intestinal barrier and causes changes to the intestinal permeability as well as the gut microbiota composition. Emerging studies have tried to reveal the role of the gut-brain axis among individuals with alcohol use disorder with or without alcohol liver disease. Bacterial products penetrate the impaired intestinal barrier and cause central inflammation; changes to the gut microbiota impair enterohepatic circulation of bile acids; alcohol abuse causes shortage of vital nutrients such as thiamine. Several studies have suggested that probiotics, through either oral administration or fecal microbiota transplantation, increased intestinal levels of potentially beneficial bacteria such as bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, improving the levels of liver-associated enzymes in patients with mild alcoholic hepatitis, and demonstrating beneficial psychotropic effects on anxiety and depression. In addition to medications for alcohol addiction, gene editing therapy such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) may be another potential research target. Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), which are associated with ADH and ALDH genes, are major enzymes involved in alcohol metabolism, and gene editing approaches may have the potential to directly modify specific genes to treat alcoholism caused by genetic defects. Further research is needed to study the effect of the combined treatment for alcohol addiction.",International journal of molecular sciences,2020,Shao-Cheng Wang; Yuan-Chuan Chen; Shaw-Ji Chen; Chun-Hung Lee; Ching-Ming Cheng
32149335,The Role of the Gut Microbiota in Dietary Interventions for Depression and Anxiety.,"There is emerging evidence that an unhealthy dietary pattern may increase the risk of developing depression or anxiety, whereas a healthy dietary pattern may decrease it. This nascent research suggests that dietary interventions could help prevent, or be an alternative or adjunct therapy for, depression and anxiety. The relation, however, is complex, affected by many confounding variables, and is also likely to be bidirectional, with dietary choices being affected by stress and depression. This complexity is reflected in the data, with sometimes conflicting results among studies. As the research evolves, all characteristics of the relation need to be considered to ensure that we obtain a full understanding, which can potentially be translated into clinical practice. A parallel and fast-growing body of research shows that the gut microbiota is linked with the brain in a bidirectional relation, commonly termed the microbiome-gut-brain axis. Preclinical evidence suggests that this axis plays a key role in the regulation of brain function and behavior. In this review we discuss possible reasons for the conflicting results in diet-mood research, and present examples of areas of the diet-mood relation in which the gut microbiota is likely to be involved, potentially explaining some of the conflicting results from diet and depression studies. We argue that because diet is one of the most significant factors that affects human gut microbiota structure and function, nutritional intervention studies need to consider the gut microbiota as an essential piece of the puzzle.","Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2020,Tracey L K Bear; Julie E Dalziel; Jane Coad; Nicole C Roy; Christine A Butts; Pramod K Gopal
31628992,"Exercise, diet and stress as modulators of gut microbiota: Implications for neurodegenerative diseases.","The last decade has witnessed an exponentially growing interest in gut microbiota and the gut-brain axis in health and disease. Accumulating evidence from preclinical and clinical research indicate that gut microbiota, and their associated microbiomes, may influence pathogenic processes and thus the onset and progression of various diseases, including neurological and psychiatric disorders. In fact, gut dysbiosis (microbiota dysregulation) has been associated with a range of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's and motor neuron disease, as well as multiple sclerosis. The gut microbiota constitutes a dynamic microbial system constantly challenged by many biological variables, including environmental factors. Since the gut microbiota constitute a changeable and experience-dependent ecosystem, they provide potential therapeutic targets that can be modulated as new interventions for dysbiosis-related disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases. This article reviews the evidence for environmental modulation of gut microbiota and its relevance to brain disorders, exploring in particular the implications for neurodegenerative diseases. We will focus on three major environmental factors that are known to influence the onset and progression of those diseases, namely exercise, diet and stress. Further exploration of environmental modulation, acting via both peripheral (e.g. gut microbiota and associated metabolic dysfunction or 'metabolopathy') and central (e.g. direct effects on CNS neurons and glia) mechanisms, may lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches, such as enviromimetics, for a wide range of neurological and psychiatric disorders.",Neurobiology of disease,2020,Carolina Gubert; Geraldine Kong; Thibault Renoir; Anthony J Hannan
33087991,Human Gut Microbiota and Mental Health: Advancements and Challenges in Microbe-Based Therapeutic Interventions.,"Gut microbes play prime role in human health and have shown to exert their influence on various physiological responses including neurological functions. Growing evidences in recent years have indicated a key role of gut microbiota in contributing to mental health. The connection between gut and brain is modulated by microbes via neural, neuroendocrinal and metabolic pathways that are mediated through various neurotransmitters and their precursors, hormones, cytokines and bioactive metabolites. Impaired functioning of this connection can lead to manifestation of mental disorders. Around 1 billion of the world population is reported to suffer from emotional, psychological and neurological imbalances, substance use disorders and cognitive, psychosocial and intellectual disabilities. Thus, it becomes imperative to understand the role of gut microbes in mental disorders. Since variations occur in the conditions associated with different mental disorders and some of them have overlapping symptoms, it becomes important to have a holistic understanding of gut dysbiosis in these disorders. In this review, we consolidate the recent data on alterations in the gut microbes and its consequences in various neurological, psychological and neurodegenerative disorders. Further, considering these evidences, several studies have been undertaken to specifically target the gut microbiota through different therapeutic interventions including administration of live microbes (psychobiotics) to treat mental health disorders and/or their symptoms. We review these studies and propose that an integrative and personalized approach, where combinations of microbe-based therapeutic interventions to modulate gut microbes and in-use psychological treatment practices can be integrated and based on patient's gut microbiome can be potentially adopted for effective treatment of the mental disorders.",Indian journal of microbiology,2020,Helianthous Verma; Sonika Phian; Priya Lakra; Jasleen Kaur; Sanjukta Subudhi; Rup Lal; Charu Dogra Rawat
30415609,"Fermented foods, the gut and mental health: a mechanistic overview with implications for depression and anxiety.","Mental disorders including depression and anxiety are often comorbid with gut problems, suggesting a bidirectional relationship between mental health and gut function. Several mechanisms might explain this comorbidity, such as inflammation and immune activation; intestinal permeability; perturbations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis; neurotransmitter/neuropeptide dysregulation; dietary deficiencies; and disturbed gut microbiome composition. The potential of modulating the microbiome-gut-brain axis, and subsequently mental health, through the use of functional foods, is an emerging and novel topic of interest. Fermented foods are considered functional foods due to their putative health benefits. The process of microbial fermentation converts food substrates into more nutritionally and functionally rich products, resulting in functional microorganisms (probiotics), substrates that enhance proliferation of beneficial bacteria in the gut (prebiotics), and bioactive components (biogenics). These functional ingredients act biologically in the gastrointestinal tract and have the ability to modify the gut microbiota, influence translocation of endotoxins and subsequent immune activation, and promote host nutrition. This narrative review explores the theoretical potential of the functional components present in fermented foods to alter gut physiology and to impact the biological mechanisms thought to underpin depression and anxiety. Pre-clinical studies indicate the benefits of fermented foods in relieving perturbed gut function and for animal models of depression and anxiety. However, in humans, the literature relating to the relevance of fermented food for treating or preventing depression and anxiety is sparse, heterogeneous and has significant limitations. This review identifies a critical research gap for further evaluation of fermented foods in the management of depression anxiety in humans.",Nutritional neuroscience,2020,Hajara Aslam; Jessica Green; Felice N Jacka; Fiona Collier; Michael Berk; Julie Pasco; Samantha L Dawson
33144709,Diet and depression: exploring the biological mechanisms of action.,"The field of nutritional psychiatry has generated observational and efficacy data supporting a role for healthy dietary patterns in depression onset and symptom management. To guide future clinical trials and targeted dietary therapies, this review provides an overview of what is currently known regarding underlying mechanisms of action by which diet may influence mental and brain health. The mechanisms of action associating diet with health outcomes are complex, multifaceted, interacting, and not restricted to any one biological pathway. Numerous pathways were identified through which diet could plausibly affect mental health. These include modulation of pathways involved in inflammation, oxidative stress, epigenetics, mitochondrial dysfunction, the gut microbiota, tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism, the HPA axis, neurogenesis and BDNF, epigenetics, and obesity.

32816830,"Does Fibre-fix provided to people with irritable bowel syndrome who are consuming a low FODMAP diet improve their gut health, gut microbiome, sleep and mental health? A double-blinded, randomised controlled trial.","A diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) is an effective way to reduce gut symptoms in people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This diet reduces the intake of fermentable fibres, leading to changes of the gut microbiota and insufficient fermentation in the large bowel, resulting in reduced production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as butyrate, which has unfavourable implications for gut health, sleep and mental health. This study will examine the effect of Fibre-fix, a supplement containing a mix of dietary fibres, on the human gut microbiome composition, fermentative capacity, sleep, quality of life (QOL) and mental health of people with IBS who consume a low FODMAP diet (LFD).A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, study design is proposed to examine whether Fibre-fix added to an existing LFD may help modulate gastrointestinal function, improve markers of sleep, mental health and promote QOL in patients with IBS. Participants will provide stool and blood samples, daily bowel symptoms diaries and 3-day diet records. Additionally, they will complete validated questionnaires relating to FODMAP intake, sleep, mental health and QOL before and after a 3-week intervention. Gut health will be assessed via faecal microbiome composition, faecal pH and SCFA levels. Alteration of sleep will be recorded using an actigraphy device worn by all participants over the whole study. Multivariate analysis will be used to examine the gut microbiome and repeated measures Analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used for dependent variables from questionnaires related to bowel symptoms, stool type, sleep, mental health and QOL to assess the differences between intervention and control groups after adjustment for confounding variables.Ethics approval was obtained from the Human Research Ethics Committee of Edith Cowan University (2019-00619-YAN). Results will be disseminated in peer-review journal publications, and conference presentations. Participants will be provided with a summary of findings once the study is completed. If Fibre-fix is shown to result in favourable changes in gut microbial composition, SCFA production, sleep and mental well-being without exacerbating symptoms, this will provide additional dietary management options for those with IBS following an LFD.ACTRN12620000032954.",BMJ open gastroenterology,2020,Ran Yan; Mandy Murphy; Angela Genoni; Evania Marlow; Ian C Dunican; Johnny Lo; Lesley Andrew; Amanda Devine; Claus T Christophersen
32918633,Early Life Stress and the Development of the Infant Gut Microbiota: Implications for Mental Health and Neurocognitive Development.,"We review the state of the literature examining associations between early life stress (ELS), gut microbiota, and neurocognitive development and mental health in animals and humans. We identify gaps in current models and areas for future research.ELS is associated with changes in gut microbiota, which correspond to changes in affective and cognitive functioning in both animals and humans. Some of these ELS-induced psychological changes can be remedied by supplementation with probiotics in early life, suggesting a potential area for intervention for ELS-exposed children. Prenatal stress exposure is rarely studied in humans in relation to gut microbiota, but animal work has suggested important associations between prenatal stress and fetal programming that should be tested in humans. The gut microbiota plays an important role in the association between ELS, neurocognitive development, and mental health.

32130662,Current Perspectives on Gut Microbiome Dysbiosis and Depression.,"The human gut microbiome partakes in a bidirectional communication pathway with the central nervous system (CNS), named the microbiota-gut-brain axis. The microbiota-gut-brain axis is believed to modulate various central processes through the vagus nerve as well as production of microbial metabolites and immune mediators which trigger changes in neurotransmission, neuroinflammation, and behavior. Little is understood about the utilization of microbiome manipulation to treat disease. Though studies exploring the role of the microbiome in various disease processes have shown promise, mechanisms remain unclear and evidence-based treatments for most illnesses have not yet been developed. The animal studies reviewed here offer an excellent array of basic science research that continues to clarify mechanisms by which the microbiome may affect mental health. More evidence is needed, particularly as it relates to translating this work to human subjects. The studies presented in this paper largely demonstrate encouraging results in the treatment of depression. Limitations include small sample sizes and heterogeneous methodology. The exact mechanism by which the gut microbiota causes or alters neuropsychiatric disease states is not fully understood. In this review, we focus on recent studies investigating the relationship between gut microbiome dysbiosis and the pathogenesis of depression.

32459708,The role of the gut microbiota in the pathophysiology of mental and neurological disorders.,"In recent decades, the concept of the gut microbiota as a potential novel therapeutic strategy for mental health has emerged. The tiny microbes inhabiting our gut communicate through a bidirectional communication signaling with the brain that influences gut physiology, brain function and behavior. Accumulating evidence suggests that perturbation of the gut microbiota contributes to the pathophysiology of mental illnesses including autism, depression and anxiety as well as neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. This review will highlight recent findings in both human and animal studies indicating how changes in the gut microbiota can impact the pathophysiology of such diseases.

33171595,PROVIT: Supplementary Probiotic Treatment and Vitamin B7 in Depression-A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Gut microbiota are suspected to affect brain functions and behavior as well as lowering inflammation status. Therefore, an effect on depression has already been suggested by recent research. The aim of this randomized double-blind controlled trial was to evaluate the effect of probiotic treatment in depressed individuals. Within inpatient care, 82 currently depressed individuals were randomly assigned to either receive a multistrain probiotic plus biotin treatment or biotin plus placebo for 28 days. Clinical symptoms as well as gut microbiome were analyzed at the begin of the study, after one and after four weeks. After 16S rRNA analysis, microbiome samples were bioinformatically explored using QIIME, SPSS, R and Piphillin. Both groups improved significantly regarding psychiatric symptoms. <i>Ruminococcus gauvreauii</i> and <i>Coprococcus 3</i> were more abundant and β-diversity was higher in the probiotics group after 28 days. KEGG-analysis showed elevated inflammation-regulatory and metabolic pathways in the intervention group. The elevated abundance of potentially beneficial bacteria after probiotic treatment allows speculations on the functionality of probiotic treatment in depressed individuals. Furthermore, the finding of upregulated vitamin B6 and B7 synthesis underlines the connection between the quality of diet, gut microbiota and mental health through the regulation of metabolic functions, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties. Concluding, four-week probiotic plus biotin supplementation, in inpatient individuals with a major depressive disorder diagnosis, showed an overall beneficial effect of clinical treatment. However, probiotic intervention compared to placebo only differed in microbial diversity profile, not in clinical outcome measures.",Nutrients,2020,Eva Z Reininghaus; Martina Platzer; Alexandra Kohlhammer-Dohr; Carlo Hamm; Sabrina Mörkl; Susanne A Bengesser; Frederike T Fellendorf; Theressa Lahousen-Luxenberger; Birgitta Leitner-Afschar; Helmut Schöggl; Daniela Amberger-Otti; Walter Wurm; Robert Queissner; Armin Birner; Valerie S Falzberger; Annamaria Painold; Werner Fitz; Jolana Wagner-Skacel; Martina Brunnmayr; Alexandra Rieger; Alexander Maget; Renate Unterweger; Karin Schwalsberger; Bernd Reininghaus; Melanie Lenger; Thomaz F S Bastiaanssen; Nina Dalkner
32819434,The gut microbiota regulates autism-like behavior by mediating vitamin B<sub>6</sub> homeostasis in EphB6-deficient mice.,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder, and the effective pharmacological treatments for the core autistic symptoms are currently limited. Increasing evidence, particularly that from clinical studies on ASD patients, suggests a functional link between the gut microbiota and the development of ASD. However, the mechanisms linking the gut microbiota with brain dysfunctions (gut-brain axis) in ASD have not yet been full elucidated. Due to its genetic mutations and downregulated expression in patients with ASD, EPHB6, which also plays important roles in gut homeostasis, is generally considered a candidate gene for ASD. Nonetheless, the role and mechanism of EPHB6 in regulating the gut microbiota and the development of ASD are unclear.Here, we found that the deletion of EphB6 induced autism-like behavior and disturbed the gut microbiota in mice. More importantly, transplantation of the fecal microbiota from EphB6-deficient mice resulted in autism-like behavior in antibiotic-treated C57BL/6J mice, and transplantation of the fecal microbiota from wild-type mice ameliorated the autism-like behavior in EphB6-deficient mice. At the metabolic level, the disturbed gut microbiota in EphB6-deficient mice led to vitamin B<sub>6</sub> and dopamine defects. At the cellular level, the excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance in the medial prefrontal cortex was regulated by gut microbiota-mediated vitamin B<sub>6</sub> in EphB6-deficient mice.Our study uncovers a key role for the gut microbiota in the regulation of autism-like social behavior by vitamin B<sub>6</sub>, dopamine, and the E/I balance in EphB6-deficient mice, and these findings suggest new strategies for understanding and treating ASD.

33287442,The Gut Microbiota: A Potential Gateway to Improved Health Outcomes in Breast Cancer Treatment and Survivorship.,"Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women worldwide. The disease and its treatments exert profound effects on an individual's physical and mental health. There are many factors that impact an individual's risk of developing breast cancer, their response to treatments, and their risk of recurrence. The community of microorganisms inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract, the gut microbiota, affects human health through metabolic, neural, and endocrine signaling, and immune activity. It is through these mechanisms that the gut microbiota appears to influence breast cancer risk, response to treatment, and recurrence. A disrupted gut microbiota or state of 'dysbiosis' can contribute to a biological environment associated with higher risk for cancer development as well as contribute to negative treatment side-effects. Many cancer treatments have been shown to shift the gut microbiota toward dysbiosis; however, the microbiota can also be positively manipulated through diet, prebiotic and probiotic supplementation, and exercise. The objective of this review is to provide an overview of the current understanding of the relationship between the gut microbiota and breast cancer and to highlight potential strategies for modulation of the gut microbiota that could lead to improved clinical outcomes and overall health in this population.",International journal of molecular sciences,2020,Kara Sampsell; Desirée Hao; Raylene A Reimer

However, the potential for clinical translation of microbiome research for children and adolescents with psychiatric disorders is unclear. This review examined available evidence related to gut microbiota as well as the impact of probiotic supplementation on psychiatric disorders in the pediatric population reported to date.We performed a literature search for the gut microbiota in child and adolescent population (0-18 years old) with mental health disorders from July 1999 through July 2019 in several databases: ClinicalTrials.gov, Ovid EBM Reviews, Ovid Embase, Ovid Medline, Ovid PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science.A total of 7 studies met inclusion criteria consisting of randomized controlled trials and cohort studies that examined various associations between psychiatric disorders and gut microbiota in youth. Six studies examined the effects of various treatment interventions such as probiotic supplementation on microbiota composition and behaviors. One study showed an increase in prosocial behavior in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and an increase in the Lachnospiraceae family following prebiotic supplementation. Another study suggested that prebiotic supplementation increased bifidobacterial populations for ASD and healthy controls. A study evaluating infant supplementation of prebiotics showed both a decreased likelihood of developing Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or ASD and decreased gut Bifidobacterium. One study did not find significant differences in microbiome composition after micronutrient treatment.The main goal of this systematic review was to comprehensively examine and summarize the current evidence focused on the potential effect of the relationship between microbiota gut composition as well as the effects of probiotic supplementation on psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents. This is a relatively new area of research and the number of included studies is limited. More studies are needed to determine whether gut dysbiosis leads to the development and/or contributes to the severity of mental disorders or whether gut dysbiosis is a result of other processes that accompany mental disorders.A better understanding of the specific bacteria contributions, gut-brain pathways, and role in pathophysiological mechanisms in neuropsychiatric disorders in the child and adolescent populations can possibly provide alternative tools for a clinical psychiatrist. Moreover, it may ultimately aid the clinician with intervention strategies, or detect populations at risk for developing neuropsychiatric disorders.",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,2021,Anna N Ligezka; A Irem Sonmez; Martha P Corral-Frias; Raphael Golebiowski; Brian Lynch; Paul E Croarkin; Magdalena Romanowicz

This is a relatively new area of research and the number of included studies is limited. More studies are needed to determine whether gut dysbiosis leads to the development and/or contributes to the severity of mental disorders or whether gut dysbiosis is a result of other processes that accompany mental disorders.A better understanding of the specific bacteria contributions, gut-brain pathways, and role in pathophysiological mechanisms in neuropsychiatric disorders in the child and adolescent populations can possibly provide alternative tools for a clinical psychiatrist. Moreover, it may ultimately aid the clinician with intervention strategies, or detect populations at risk for developing neuropsychiatric disorders.",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,2021,Anna N Ligezka; A Irem Sonmez; Martha P Corral-Frias; Raphael Golebiowski; Brian Lynch; Paul E Croarkin; Magdalena Romanowicz
31255682,Altered gut microbiota and mucosal immunity in patients with schizophrenia.,"Evidence shows that gut microbiota may play important roles in schizophrenia pathogenesis via the ""gut-brain"" axis, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Here, eighty-four patients with schizophrenia and 84 sex- and age-matched healthy controls were enrolled. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing and 16S rRNA sequencing were performed, and the gut microbiota-associated epitopes (MEs) were predicted, which, together with IgA content, were used to determine the gut microbiota composition associated with gut immune status. Patients with schizophrenia had significantly reduced gut microbiota richnesses compared with those of the healthy controls, and the gut microbiota compositions clearly distinguished the patients with schizophrenia from the healthy controls. Based on two-stage metagenomic-wide association studies, nineteen gut microbiota taxonomies were associated with schizophrenia, and the microbial dysbiosis (MD) index was calculated based on the abundance of differential taxonomies. We found that MD index was positively correlated with MEs diversity and gut IgA levels, and negatively correlated with gut microbiota richness. Glutamate synthase (GOGAT) was more active in the guts of patients with schizophrenia than in those of healthy controls, and high GOGAT activity was associated with altered gut microbiota taxonomies associated with gut IgA levels. Our results may imply a role of the microbiome in the etiology of schizophrenia and contribute to the development of microbiome targeted interventions for schizophrenia.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2020,Ruihuan Xu; Bingbing Wu; Jingwen Liang; Fusheng He; Wen Gu; Kang Li; Yi Luo; Jianxia Chen; Yongbo Gao; Ze Wu; Yongqiang Wang; Wenhao Zhou; Mingbang Wang
32062351,Gut microbiota composition during infancy and subsequent behavioural outcomes.,"Despite intense interest in the relationship between gut microbiota and brain development, longitudinal data from human studies are lacking. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the composition of gut microbiota during infancy and subsequent behavioural outcomes.A subcohort of 201 children with behavioural outcome measures was identified within a longitudinal, Australian birth-cohort study. The faecal microbiota were analysed at 1, 6, and 12 months of age. Behavioural outcomes were measured at 2 years of age.In an unselected birth cohort, we found a clear association between decreased normalised abundance of Prevotella in faecal samples collected at 12 months of age and increased behavioural problems at 2 years, in particular Internalizing Problem scores. This association appeared independent of multiple potentially confounding variables, including maternal mental health. Recent exposure to antibiotics was the best predictor of decreased Prevotella.Our findings demonstrate a strong association between the composition of the gut microbiota in infancy and subsequent behavioural outcomes; and support the importance of responsible use of antibiotics during early life.This study was funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia (1082307, 1147980, 1129813), The Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Barwon Health, Deakin University, Perpetual Trustees, and The Shepherd Foundation.

31821833,The connection between microbiome and schizophrenia.,"There has been an accumulation of knowledge about the human microbiome, some detailed investigations of the gastrointestinal microbiota and its functions, and the highlighting of complex interactions between the gut, the gut microbiota, and the central nervous system. That assumes the involvement of the microbiome in the pathogenesis of various CNS diseases, including schizophrenia. Given this information and the fact, that the gut microbiota is sensitive to internal and environmental influences, we have speculated that among the factors that influence the formation and composition of gut microbiota during life, possible key elements in the schizophrenia development chain are hidden where gut microbiota is a linking component. This article aims to describe and understand the developmental relationships between intestinal microbiota and the risk of developing schizophrenia.",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,2020,Bogdana Golofast; Karel Vales
33318317,Mental awareness improved mild cognitive impairment and modulated gut microbiome.,"There is ample scientific and clinical evidence of the effects of gut microbiota on the brain but no definitive evidence that the brain can affect changes in gut microbiota under the bi-directional gut-brain axis concept. As there is no pharmacotherapeutic intervention for the early stages of cognitive decline, research has focused on cognitive stimulation in reversing or slowing the impairment. Elderly patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment underwent a randomized-control trial of mindful awareness practice. Neuropsychological assessments, inflammatory markers, and gut microbiota profiles were tested. Here, we report that their cognitive impairment was improved and associated with changes in gut bacterial profile. A cognition-score-dependent-abundance was observed in <i>Ruminococcus</i> vs Recognition Trials (RT), Digit Span Backward (DSB), Semantic Fluency Span (SFS) and Memory Domain (MD); <i>Coprococcus</i> vs DSB, Color Trails Test 2 (CTT2) and Block Design (BD); <i>Parabacteroides</i> vs DSB and SFS; <i>Fusobacterium</i> vs DSB and CTT2; <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> vs BD and SFS; <i>Ruminococcaceae</i> vs DSB; <i>Phascolarctobacterium</i> vs MD. The study showed for the first-time, alteration in the cognitive capacity leading to the corresponding changes in microbiota profiles. This strongly suggests that signals from the different segments of brain could dictate directly or indirectly the abundances of specific gut microbes.",Aging,2020,Wei Wei Thwe Khine; Miao Lian Voong; Ted Kheng Siang Ng; Lei Feng; Grishma Avinash Rane; Alan Prem Kumar; Ee Heok Kua; Ratha Mahendran; Rathi Mahendran; Yuan-Kun Lee
32056905,Reduced anti-inflammatory gut microbiota are associated with depression and anhedonia.,"Characterise gut microbiota distributions of participants with co-occurring depression and anxiety, in those with only depression or with anxiety, and determine if gut bacteria differentially correlates with distinct clinical presentations.Participants (10 healthy controls [mean age: 33, 60% female] and 60 psychiatric subjects; major depressive disorder (comorbid with anxiety), n = 38 [mean age: 39.2, 82% female], anxiety only, n = 8 [mean age: 40.0, 100% female], depression only without anxiety, n = 14 [mean age: 41.9, 79% female]) were characterized by psychiatric assessments. Quantitative PCR and 16S rRNA sequencing were used to characterize the gut microbiota in stool samples.Altered microbiota correlated with pre-defined clinical presentation, with Bacteroides (p = 0.011) and the Clostridium leptum subgroup (p = 0.023) significantly different between clinical categories. Cluster analysis of the total sample using weighted UniFrac β-diversity of the gut microbiota identified two different clusters defined by differences in bacterial distribution. Cluster 2 had higher Bacteroides (p = 0.006), and much reduced presence of Clostridales (p<0.001) compared to Cluster 1. Bifidobacterium (p = 0.0173) was also reduced in Cluster 2 compared to Cluster 1. When evaluated for clinical charateristics, anhedonia scores in Cluster 2 were higher than in Cluster 1.The sample is smaller and predominately female.Reduced or absent Clostridia was consistently seen in those with depression, independent of the presence of anxiety. Conversely, reduced Bacteroides may be more associated with the presence of anxiety, independent of the presence of depression. These differences suggest that gut microbiota distribution could help clarify the underlying pathology of comorbid clinical presentation.",Journal of affective disorders,2020,Brittany L Mason; Qiwei Li; Abu Minhajuddin; Andrew H Czysz; Laura A Coughlin; Sarah K Hussain; Andrew Y Koh; Madhukar H Trivedi
33177907,Gut Microbiota Changes and Their Relationship with Inflammation in Patients with Acute and Chronic Insomnia.,"The major purpose of this study was to detect the changes in gut microbiota composition and inflammatory cytokines production associated with acute and chronic insomnia. This study also evaluated the relationship between gut microbiota changes and increased inflammatory cytokines in insomnia patients.Outpatients with acute and chronic insomnia (aged 26-55 years; n=20 and 38, respectively) and age/gender-matched healthy controls (n=38) were recruited from a southern China region. Participants' gut microbiome, plasma cytokines, and self-reported sleep quality and psychopathological symptoms were measured.The gut microbiomes of insomnia patients compared with healthy controls were characterized by lower microbial richness and diversity, depletion of anaerobes, and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria, and an expansion of potential pathobionts. <i>Lachnospira</i> and <i>Bacteroides</i> were signature bacteria for distinguishing acute insomnia patients from healthy controls, while <i>Faecalibacterium</i> and <i>Blautia</i> were signature bacteria for distinguishing chronic insomnia patients from healthy controls. Acute/chronic insomnia-related signature bacteria also showed correlations with these patients' self-reported sleep quality and plasma IL-1β.These ﬁndings suggest that insomnia symptomology, gut microbiota, and inflammation may be interrelated in complex ways. Gut microbiota may serve as an important indicator for auxiliary diagnosis of insomnia and provide possible new therapeutic targets in the ﬁeld of sleep disorders.",Nature and science of sleep,2020,Yuanyuan Li; Bin Zhang; Ya Zhou; Daoming Wang; Xianchen Liu; Lin Li; Tong Wang; Yuechu Zhang; Min Jiang; Huilan Tang; Lawrence V Amsel; Fang Fan; Christina W Hoven
32032668,Maternal Obesity as a Risk Factor for Brain Development and Mental Health in the Offspring.,"Maternal obesity plays a key role in the health trajectory of the offspring. Although research on this topic has largely focused on the potential of this condition to increase the risk for child obesity, it is becoming more and more evident that it can also significantly impact cognitive function and mental health. The mechanisms underlying these effects are starting to be elucidated and point to the placenta as a critical organ that may mediate changes in the response to stress, immune function and oxidative stress. Long-term effects of maternal obesity may rely upon epigenetic changes in selected genes that are involved in metabolic and trophic regulations of the brain. More recent evidence also indicates the gut microbiota as a potential mediator of these effects. Overall, understanding cause-effect relationships can allow the development of preventive measures that could rely upon dietary changes in the mother and the offspring. Addressing diets appears more feasible than developing new pharmacological targets and has the potential to affect the multiple interconnected physiological pathways engaged by these complex regulations, allowing prevention of both metabolic and mental disorders.",Neuroscience,2020,Francesca Cirulli; Chiara Musillo; Alessandra Berry
31726457,Gut Microbiota: A Perspective for Psychiatrists.,"There is mounting evidence that the trillions of microbes that inhabit our gut are a substantial contributing factor to mental health and, equally, to the progression of neuropsychiatric disorders. The extraordinary complexity of the gut ecosystem, and how it interacts with the intestinal epithelium to manifest physiological changes in the brain to influence mood and behaviour, has been the subject of intense scientific scrutiny over the last 2 decades. To further complicate matters, we each harbour a unique microbiota community that is subject to change by a number of factors including diet, exercise, stress, health status, genetics, medication, and age, amongst others. The microbiota-gut-brain axis is a dynamic matrix of tissues and organs including the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota, immune cells, gut tissue, glands, the autonomic nervous system (ANS), and the brain that communicate in a complex multidirectional manner through a number of anatomically and physiologically distinct systems. Long-term perturbations to this homeostatic environment may contribute to the progression of a number of disorders by altering physiological processes including hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation, neurotransmitter systems, immune function, and the inflammatory response. While an appropriate, co-ordinated physiological response, such as an immune or stress response, is necessary for survival, a dysfunctional response can be detrimental to the host, contributing to the development of a number of central nervous system disorders.",Neuropsychobiology,2020,Kieran Rea; Timothy G Dinan; John F Cryan
32056910,Feeling down? A systematic review of the gut microbiota in anxiety/depression and irritable bowel syndrome.,"Background Anxiety/depression and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are highly prevalent and burdensome conditions, whose co-occurrence is estimated between 44 and 84%. Shared gut microbiota alterations have been identified in these separate disorders relative to controls; however, studies have not adequately considered their comorbidity. This review set out to identify case-control studies comparing the gut microbiota in anxiety/depression, IBS, and both conditions comorbidly relative to each other and to controls, as well as gut microbiota investigations including measures of both IBS and anxiety/depression. Methods Four databases were systematically searched using comprehensive search terms (OVID Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and PubMed), following PRISMA guidelines. Results Systematic review identified 17 studies (10 human, 7 animal). Most studies investigated the gut microbiota and anxiety/depression symptoms in IBS cohorts. Participants with IBS and high anxiety/depression symptoms had lower alpha diversity compared to controls and IBS-only cohorts. Machine learning and beta diversity distinguished between IBS participants with and without anxiety/depression by their gut microbiota. Comorbid IBS and anxiety/depression also had higher abundance of Proteobacteria, Prevotella/Prevotellaceae, Bacteroides and lower Lachnospiraceae relative to controls. Limitations A large number of gut microbiota estimation methods and statistical techniques were utilized; therefore, meta-analysis was not possible. Conclusions Well-designed case-control and longitudinal studies are required to disentangle whether the gut microbiota is predicted as a continuum of gastrointestinal and anxiety/depression symptom severity, or whether reported dysbiosis is unique to IBS and anxiety/depression comorbidity. These findings may inform the development of targeted treatment through the gut microbiota for individuals with both anxiety/depression and IBS.",Journal of affective disorders,2020,Carra A Simpson; Andre Mu; Nick Haslam; Orli S Schwartz; Julian G Simmons
32469834,"The human gut microbiota and depression: widely reviewed, yet poorly understood.","A large number of existing reviews have discussed the role of the gut microbiota in affective disorders, though syntheses have been overwhelmingly narrative in their focus.In this correspondence, we compliment Sanada et al.

We also comment on how this synthesis should be extended in future research.Sanada et al. (2020) conducted a meta-analysis of alpha diversity in participants with MDD compared to controls, whereby they unexpectedly observed no significant difference between groups. A meta-analysis was only able to be performed on alpha diversity indices. Future research should consider research quality, other forms of depression, incorporate comprehensive meta-analyses, where possible, as well as investigate associations between anxiety/depression symptom measures and the gut microbiota.Further consideration of papers which incorporate functional analyses (e.g., metabolomics) is required to integrate this body of literature.Research investigating the microbiota-gut-brain axis in affective disorders has been met with great enthusiasm, offering promising direction for novel therapeutics in conditions such as depression.

33206326,Gut-Brain-Skin Axis in Psoriasis: A Review.,"Psoriasis is a common skin disease, with chronic inflammation and a complex etiology. It has long been recognized that chronic skin conditions and mental health disorders are often co-morbid. Thus, the concept of the gut-brain-skin axis emphasized in mental health disorders may also regulate the health of skin.The gut microbiota has been found to be the bridge between the immune system and nervous system.

Furthermore, mammalian neurotransmitters, including dopamine, serotonin, or γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), can be produced and/or consumed by several types of bacteria. Other studies suggest that manipulating these neurotransmitters by bacteria may have an effect on host physiology, and the levels of neurotransmitter can be altered by microbiota-based interventions.Nonetheless, it is unknown whether or not the manipulation of neurotransmitter levels by bacteria can affect the occurrence and development of psoriasis.

32506238,Gut Microbiome Dysbiosis and Depression: a Comprehensive Review.,"The human gut microbiome is involved in a bi-directional communication pathway with the central nervous system (CNS), termed the microbiota-gut-brain axis. The microbiota-gut-brain axis is believed to mediate or modulate various central processes through the vagus nerve. The microbiota-gut-brain axis is involved with the production of microbial metabolites and immune mediators which trigger changes in neurotransmission, neuroinflammation, and behavior. Little is understood about the utilization of microbiome manipulation to treat disease.Though studies exploring the role of the microbiome in various disease processes have shown promise, mechanisms remain unclear and evidence-based treatments for most illnesses have not yet been developed. The animal studies reviewed in the present investigation include an array of basic science studies that clarify mechanisms by which the microbiome may affect mental health. More evidence is needed, particularly as it relates to translating this work to humans. The studies presented in this review demonstrate encouraging results in the treatment of depression. Limitations include small sample sizes and heterogeneous methodology. The exact mechanism by which the gut microbiota causes or alters neuropsychiatric disease states is not fully understood.

33005892,"Gut dysbiosis in Huntington's disease: associations among gut microbiota, cognitive performance and clinical outcomes.","Huntington's disease is characterized by a triad of motor, cognitive and psychiatric impairments, as well as unintended weight loss. Although much of the research has focused on cognitive, motor and psychiatric symptoms, the extent of peripheral pathology and the relationship between these factors, and the core symptoms of Huntington's disease, are relatively unknown. Gut microbiota are key modulators of communication between the brain and gut, and alterations in microbiota composition (dysbiosis) can negatively affect cognition, behaviour and affective function, and may be implicated in disease progression. Furthermore, gut dysbiosis was recently reported in Huntington's disease transgenic mice. Our main objective was to characterize the gut microbiome in people with Huntington's disease and determine whether the composition of gut microbiota are significantly related to clinical indicators of disease progression. We compared 42 Huntington's disease gene expansion carriers, including 19 people who were diagnosed with Huntington's disease (Total Functional Capacity > 6) and 23 in the premanifest stage, with 36 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Participants were characterized clinically using a battery of cognitive tests and using results from 16S V3 to V4 rRNA sequencing of faecal samples to characterize the gut microbiome. For gut microbiome measures, we found significant differences in the microbial communities (beta diversity) based on unweighted UniFrac distance (<i>P </i>=<i> </i>0.001), as well as significantly lower alpha diversity (species richness and evenness) between our combined Huntington's disease gene expansion carrier group and healthy controls (<i>P </i>=<i> </i>0.001). We also found major shifts in the microbial community structure at Phylum and Family levels, and identified functional pathways and enzymes affected in our Huntington's disease gene expansion carrier group. Within the Huntington's disease gene expansion carrier group, we also discovered associations among gut bacteria, cognitive performance and clinical outcomes. Overall, our findings suggest an altered gut microbiome in Huntington's disease gene expansion carriers. These results highlight the importance of gut biomarkers and raise interesting questions regarding the role of the gut in Huntington's disease, and whether it may be a potential target for future therapeutic intervention.",Brain communications,2020,Cory I Wasser; Emily-Clare Mercieca; Geraldine Kong; Anthony J Hannan; Sonja J McKeown; Yifat Glikmann-Johnston; Julie C Stout
31722343,The Gut Microbiome in Bipolar Disorder and Pharmacotherapy Management.,"The gut microbiome is a complex and dynamic community of commensal, symbiotic, and pathogenic microorganisms that exist in a bidirectional relationship with the host. Bacterial functions in the gut play a critical role in healthy host functioning, and its disruption can contribute to many medical conditions. The relationship between gut microbiota and the brain has gained attention in mental health due to the mounting evidence supporting the association of gut bacteria with mood and behavior. Patients with bipolar disorder exhibit an increased frequency of gastrointestinal illnesses such as inflammatory bowel disease, which mechanistically has been linked to microbial community function. While the heterogeneity in microbial communities between individuals might be associated with disease risk, it may also moderate the efficacy or adverse effects associated with the use of medication. The following review highlights published evidence linking the function of gut microbiota both to bipolar disorder risk and to the effect of medications that influence microbiota, inflammation, and mood symptoms.",Neuropsychobiology,2020,Stephanie A Flowers; Kristen M Ward; Crystal T Clark
31750916,Dietary fiber and its associations with depression and inflammation.,"Dietary fiber is a crucial component of a healthy diet, with benefits that can be attributed to processes in the gut microbiota and the resulting by-products. Observational studies support associations between dietary fiber intake and depression and inflammation, but the potential mechanisms are poorly understood. This review examines evidence of the effects of dietary fiber on depression and inflammation and considers plausible mechanisms linking dietary fiber and depression, including microbiota-driven modification of gene expression and increased production of neurotransmitters. Additionally, inflammation may mediate the relationship between dietary fiber intake and depression. A high-fiber diet potentially lowers inflammation by modifying both the pH and the permeability of the gut. The resultant reduction in inflammatory compounds may alter neurotransmitter concentrations to reduce symptoms of depression. Further research into the link between dietary fiber intake and inflammation and depression is essential, as findings could potentially provide guidance for improvement in or prevention of inflammatory and depressive disorders.",Nutrition reviews,2020,Olivia G Swann; Michelle Kilpatrick; Monique Breslin; Wendy H Oddy

Despite the considerable evolution in our understanding of the pathophysiology of depression, no reliable biomarkers that have contributed to objective diagnoses and clinical therapy currently exist. The discovery of the microbiota-gut-brain axis induced scientists to study the role of gut microbiota (GM) in the pathogenesis of depression. Over the last decade, many of studies were conducted in this field. The productions of metabolites and compounds with neuroactive and immunomodulatory properties among mechanisms such as the mediating effects of the GM on the brain, have been identified. This comprehensive review was focused on low molecular weight compounds implicated in depression as potential products of the GM. The other possible mechanisms of GM involvement in depression were presented, as well as changes in the composition of the microbiota of patients with depression. In conclusion, the therapeutic potential of functional foods and psychobiotics in relieving depression were considered.

32389857,Targeting the microbiota in pharmacology of psychiatric disorders.,"There is increasing interest in the role of the gut microbiota in health and disease. In particular, gut microbiota influences the Central Nervous System (CNS) development and homeostasis through neural pathways or routes involving the immune and circulatory systems. The CNS, in turn, shapes the intestinal flora through endocrine or stress-mediated responses. These overall bidirectional interactions, known as gut microbiota-brain axis, profoundly affect some brain functions, such as neurogenesis and the production of neurotransmitters, up to influence behavioral aspects of healthy subjects. Consequently, a dysfunction within this axis, as observed in case of dysbiosis, can have an impact on the behavior of a given individual (e.g. anxiety and depression) or on the development of pathologies affecting the CNS, such as autism spectrum disorders and neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease). It should be considered that the whole microbiota has a significant role not only on aspects concerning human physiology, such as harvesting of nutrients and energy from the ingested food or production of a wide range of bioactive compounds, but also has positive effects on the gastrointestinal barrier function and actively contributes to the pharmacokinetics of several compounds including neuropsychiatric drugs. Indeed, the microbiota is able to affect drug absorption and metabolism up to have an impact on drug activity and/or toxicity. On the other hand, drugs are able to shape the human gut microbiota itself, where these changes may contribute to their pharmacologic profile. Therefore, the emerging picture on the complex drug-microbiota bidirectional interplay will have considerable implications in the future not only in terms of clinical practice but also, upstream, on drug development.",Pharmacological research,2020,Alessia Pascale; Nicoletta Marchesi; Stefano Govoni; Annalisa Barbieri

Previous studies in gnotobiotic mice also provide evidence that these gut microorganisms may influence social behaviour. To further investigate these interactions, we examined the impact of the intermittent access to a HFHS diet on social behaviour, gene expression and microbiota composition in adolescent rats. <b>Methods:</b> Male rats were permitted intermittent daily access (2 h / day) to a palatable HFHS chow diet for 28 days across adolescence. Social interaction, social memory and novel object recognition were assessed during this period. Following testing, RT-PCR was conducted on hippocampal and prefrontal cortex (PFC) samples. 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing was used for identification and relative quantification of bacterial taxa in faecal samples. <b>Results:</b> We observed reduced social interaction behaviours, impaired social memory and novel object recognition in HFHS diet rats compared to chow controls. RT-PCR revealed reduced levels of monoamine oxidase A (<i>Maoa</i>), catechol-O-methyltransferase (<i>Comt</i>) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (<i>Bdnf</i>) mRNA in the PFC of HFHS diet rats. Faecal microbiota analysis demonstrated that the relative abundance of a number of specific bacterial taxa differed significantly between the two diet groups, in particular, <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> and <i>Ruminoccoceae</i> bacteria. <b>Discussion:</b> Intermittent HFHS diet consumption evoked physiological changes to the brain, particularly expression of mRNA associated with reward and neuroplasticity, and gut microbiome.

31955786,"Neuroactive compounds in foods: Occurrence, mechanism and potential health effects.","Neuroactive compounds are synthesized by certain plants and microorganisms by undertaking different tasks, especially as a stress response. Most common neuroactive compounds in foods are gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), serotonin, melatonin, kynurenine, kynurenic acid, dopamine, norepinephrine, histamine, tryptamine, tyramine and β-phenylethylamine. Fermented foods contain some of these compounds, which can affect human health and mood. Moreover, food processing such as roasting and malting alter amount and profile of neuroactive compounds in foods. In addition to plant-origin and microbially-formed neuroactive compounds in foods, these substances are also formed by gut microbiota, which is the most attractive subject to assess the interaction between gut microbiota and mental health. The discovery of microbiota-gut-brain axis calls for the investigation of the effects of diet on the formation of neuroactive compounds in the gut. Furthermore, probiotics and prebiotics are indispensable elements for the understanding of the food-mood relationship. The focus of this comprehensive review is to investigate the neuroactive compounds found naturally in foods or formed during fermentation. Their formation pathways in humans, plants and microorganisms, potential health effects, effects of diet on the formation of microbial metabolites including neuroactive compounds in the gut are discussed throughout this review. Furthermore, the importance of gut-brain axis, probiotics and prebiotics are discussed.","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2020,Cemile Yılmaz; Vural Gökmen
30818031,Impact of chemotherapy on the association between fear of cancer recurrence and the gut microbiota in breast cancer survivors.,"Dysfunctional processing of fear memory may be involved in the pathophysiology of fear of cancer recurrence (FCR), which is cited as the major unmet psychological need of cancer survivors. Emerging evidence has shown that the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis affects depressive and anxiety disorders, and chemotherapy-associated psychological distress. We therefore hypothesized that the gut microbiota is associated with FCR in cancer survivors.This cross-sectional study enrolled women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer who were not currently undergoing chemotherapy. Fecal samples were obtained to assess the gut microbiota. FCR grade was assessed using the Concerns About Recurrence Scale (CARS).Mean age of the participants (n = 126) was 58 years; 47% had stage I disease. Multiple regression analysis with adjustment for possible confounders showed that the relative abundance of the Bacteroides genus (beta = 0.180, p = 0.03) was significantly and directly associated with FCR. In the 57 participants with a history of chemotherapy, higher FCR was associated with lower microbial diversity (p = 0.04), lower relative abundance of Firmicutes (p = 0.03) and higher relative abundance of Bacteroidetes (p = 0.04) at the phylum level, and higher relative abundance of Bacteroides (p < 0.01) and lower relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae.g (p = 0.03) and Ruminococcus (p = 0.02) at the genus level.Our findings provide the first evidence of an association between the gut microbiota and FCR and suggest that chemotherapy-induced changes in gut microbiota can influence FCR. Further studies should examine the effects of the gut microbiota on FCR using a prospective design.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2020,Ryo Okubo; Takayuki Kinoshita; Noriko Katsumata; Yasuhito Uezono; Jinzhong Xiao; Yutaka J Matsuoka
33139656,Gut Biofactory-Neurocompetent Metabolites within the Gastrointestinal Tract. A Scoping Review.,"The gut microbiota have gained much scientific attention recently. Apart from unravelling the taxonomic data, we should understand how the altered microbiota structure corresponds to functions of this complex ecosystem. The metabolites of intestinal microorganisms, especially bacteria, exert pleiotropic effects on the human organism and contribute to the host systemic balance. These molecules play key roles in regulating immune and metabolic processes. A subset of them affect the gut brain axis signaling and balance the mental wellbeing. Neurotransmitters, short chain fatty acids, tryptophan catabolites, bile acids and phosphatidylcholine, choline, serotonin, and <i>L</i>-carnitine metabolites possess high neuroactive potential. A scoping literature search in PubMed/Embase was conducted up until 20 June 2020, using three major search terms ""microbiota metabolites"" AND ""gut brain axis"" AND ""mental health"".

32518376,A key role of the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve in the depression-like phenotype and abnormal composition of gut microbiota in mice after lipopolysaccharide administration.,"The vagus nerve plays a role in the cross talk between the brain and gut microbiota, which could be involved in depression. The subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve serves as a major modulatory pathway between the brain and gut microbiota. Here, we investigated the effects of subdiaphragmatic vagotomy (SDV) on the depression-like phenotype and the abnormal composition of gut microbiota in mice after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration. LPS caused a depression-like phenotype, inflammation, increase in spleen weight, and downregulation of synaptic proteins in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in the sham-operated mice. In contrast, LPS did not produce a depression-like phenotype and downregulated synaptic proteins in the mPFC after SDV. The spleen weight and plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the SDV + LPS group were lower than those of the sham + LPS group. Interestingly, there were positive correlations between the plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and spleen weight, suggesting a relationship between inflammatory events and spleen weight. Furthermore, LPS led to significant alterations in gut microbiota diversity in sham-operated mice, but not SDV-operated mice. In an unweighted UniFrac PCoA, the dots representing the sham + LPS group were located far away from the dots representing the other three groups. Our results suggest that LPS produces a depression-like phenotype, increases spleen weight, triggers inflammation, downregulates synaptic proteins in the mPFC, and leads to abnormal composition of gut microbiota via the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve. It is likely that the vagus nerve plays a crucial role in the brain-gut-microbiota axis.",Translational psychiatry,2020,Jiancheng Zhang; Li Ma; Lijia Chang; Yaoyu Pu; Youge Qu; Kenji Hashimoto
33105830,Probiotics in Treatment of Viral Respiratory Infections and Neuroinflammatory Disorders.,"Inflammation is a biological response to the activation of the immune system by various infectious or non-infectious agents, which may lead to tissue damage and various diseases. Gut commensal bacteria maintain a symbiotic relationship with the host and display a critical function in the homeostasis of the host immune system. Disturbance to the gut microbiota leads to immune dysfunction both locally and at distant sites, which causes inflammatory conditions not only in the intestine but also in the other organs such as lungs and brain, and may induce a disease state. Probiotics are well known to reinforce immunity and counteract inflammation by restoring symbiosis within the gut microbiota. As a result, probiotics protect against various diseases, including respiratory infections and neuroinflammatory disorders. A growing body of research supports the beneficial role of probiotics in lung and mental health through modulating the gut-lung and gut-brain axes. In the current paper, we discuss the potential role of probiotics in the treatment of viral respiratory infections, including the COVID-19 disease, as major public health crisis in 2020, and influenza virus infection, as well as treatment of neurological disorders like multiple sclerosis and other mental illnesses.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2020,Roghayeh Shahbazi; Hamed Yasavoli-Sharahi; Nawal Alsadi; Nafissa Ismail; Chantal Matar
33389842,The emerging role of mood disorders in inflammatory bowel diseases.,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic, devastating conditions of the gastrointestinal tract characterized by a complex pathogenesis, increasing worldwide prevalence, a wide spectrum of extraintestinal manifestations, and a reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Furthermore, mood disorders, specifically anxiety and depression, are more prevalent among IBD patients compared to the general population. The connection between mental disorders and IBD is compound, bidirectional and still not fully understood. The IBD may impact psychological health, whereas anxiety and depression are associated with a more aggressive course of IBD. The inflammation process, gut microbiota alterations and drug side effects are factors that influence the mental state of patients with IBD. Importantly, despite the high prevalence of depression and anxiety in IBD, many of the current guidelines do not include clear recommendation for assessment of mental problems in patients and further management. Therefore, monitoring for mood disorders should become a part of the multi-disciplinary and holistic approach to patients with IBD. This review is based on current literature searched in PubMed, mainly considering publications from the last 10 years.",Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical University,2020,Paweł Kuźnicki; Radosław Kempiński; Katarzyna Neubauer
31917834,"Adolescence and Aging: Impact of Adolescence Inflammatory Stress and Microbiota Alterations on Brain Development, Aging, and Neurodegeneration.","Puberty/adolescence is a critical phase during neurodevelopment with numerous structural, neurochemical, and molecular changes occurring in response to genetic and environmental signals. A consequence of this major neuronal reorganizing and remodeling is a heightened level of vulnerability to stressors and immune challenges. The gut microbiota is a fundamental modulator of stress and immune responses and has been found to play a role in mental health conditions and neurodegenerative disorders. Environmental insults (stress, infection, neuroinflammation, and use of antibiotics) during adolescence can result in dysbiosis subsidizing the development of brain disorders later in life. Also, pubertal neuroinflammatory insults can alter neurodevelopment, impact brain functioning in an enduring manner, and contribute to neurological disorders related to brain aging, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and depression. Exposure to probiotics during puberty can mitigate inflammation, reverse dysbiosis, and decrease vulnerabilities to brain disorders later in life. The goal of this review is to reveal the consequences of pubertal exposure to stress and immune challenges on the gut microbiota, immune reactivity within the brain, and the risk or resilience to stress-induced mental illnesses and neurodegenerative disorders. We propose that the consumption of probiotics during adolescence contribute to the prevention of brain pathologies in adulthood.","The journals of gerontology.

33244049,Emotional well-being and gut microbiome profiles by enterotype.,"With increasing attention being paid to improving emotional well-being, recent evidence points to gut microbiota as a key player in regulating mental and physical health via bidirectional communication between the brain and gut. Here, we examine the association between emotional well-being and gut microbiome profiles (i.e., gut microbiome composition, diversity, and the moderating role of the enterotypes) among healthy Korean adults (n = 83, mean age = 48.9, SD = 13.2). The research was performed using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing to obtain gut microbiome profiles, as well as a self-report survey that included the Positive Affect Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). The cluster-based analysis identified two enterotypes dominated by the genera Bacteroides (n = 49) and Prevotella (n = 34). Generalized linear regression analysis reveals significant associations between positive emotion and gut microbiome diversity (Shannon Index) among participants in the Prevotella dominant group, whereas no such relationship emerged among participants in the Bacteroides group. Moreover, a novel genus from the family Lachnospiraceae is associated with emotional well-being scores, both positive and negative. Together, the current findings highlight the enterotype-specific links between the gut microbiota community and emotion in healthy adults and suggest the possible roles of the gut microbiome in promoting mental health.",Scientific reports,2020,Sung-Ha Lee; Seok-Hwan Yoon; Yeonjae Jung; Namil Kim; Uigi Min; Jongsik Chun; Incheol Choi

Nutritional intervention may be hypothesized as a promising treatment strategy; in particular, it facilitates relapse prevention. Low-carbohydrate high-fat diets (LCHF) may provide a rewarding outcome for some anxiety disorders; more research is needed before this regimen can be recommended to patients on a daily basis, but the evidence mentioned in this paper should encourage researchers and clinicians to consider LCHF as a piece of advice somewhere between psychotherapy and pharmacology, or as an add-on to those two.",Nutrients,2020,Adam Włodarczyk; Wiesław Jerzy Cubała; Aleksandra Wielewicka
32188376,Diet and Neurocognition in Mood Disorders - An Overview of the Overlooked.,"Bipolar disorder and major depression are associated with significant disability, morbidity, and reduced life expectancy. People with mood disorders have shown higher ratios of unhealthy lifestyle choices, including poor diet quality and suboptimal nutrition. Diet and nutrition impact on brain /mental health, but cognitive outcomes have been less researched in psychiatric disorders. Neurocognitive dysfunction is a major driver of social dysfunction and a therapeutic target in mood disorders, although effective cognitive-enhancers are currently lacking. This narrative review aimed to assess the potential cognitive benefits of dietary and nutritional interventions in subjects diagnosed with mood disorders. Eight clinical trials with nutrients were identified, whereas none involved dietary interventions. Efficacy to improve select cognitive deficits has been reported, but results are either preliminary or inconsistent.

31610228,Plasma cytokine levels in patients with chronic alcohol overconsumption: Relations to gut microbiota markers and clinical correlates.,"Alcohol-related morbidity may involve changes in the gut microbiota and immune dysregulation. We have previously demonstrated alterations in gut microbiota composition and functions in patients with alcohol overconsumption, and now aimed to investigate possible associations between cytokine levels, gut microbiota, and clinical symptoms.We included hospital inpatients with a history of chronic alcohol overconsumption. For comparison, we included control patients with a low alcohol intake. Cytokine levels (TGF-β1, TNF-α, IL-10, IL-8, IL-6, IFN-γ, MCP-1, IL-1RA, IL-1β, and IL-17) were determined using a customized V-plex assay. We then examined associations of cytokine levels with the abundance of Proteobacteria and Faecalibacterium, percentage of the short-chain fatty acid butyrate, psychiatric symptoms (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), and biochemical liver variables.We included 28 patients with alcohol overconsumption (79% men), and 25 control patients (72% men). Patients with alcohol overconsumption had higher levels of IL-6 (p = 0.002), IFN-γ (p = 0.018), and MCP-1 (p = 0.006), and lower levels of TGF-β1 (p = 0.017) compared with control patients. Inverse correlations were found between Proteobacteria abundance and TNF-α (R<sub>s</sub> = -0.55, p = 0.02) and IL-8 (R<sub>s</sub> = -0.58, p = 0.014), and between Faecalibacterium and MCP-1 levels (R<sub>s</sub> = -0.56, p = 0.02) in the control patients, but not in patients with alcohol overconsumption. Patients with alcohol overconsumption reported more psychiatric symptoms, and these symptoms were inversely correlated with IL-10 levels. There were positive correlations between several of the assessed cytokines and biochemical liver variables, and negative correlations between cytokine levels and albumin.Patients with alcohol overconsumption had a cytokine profile suggestive of increased systemic inflammatory activity, with higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IFN-γ, and MCP-1) and lower levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines (TGF-β1). The findings may represent a link between alcohol use and alcohol-related morbidity.","Alcohol (Fayetteville, N.Y.)",2020,Steinar Traae Bjørkhaug; Sudan Prasad Neupane; Jørgen G Bramness; Håvard Aanes; Viggo Skar; Asle W Medhus; Jørgen Valeur

Classic serotonergic psychedelics have recently been gaining public and professional interest as novel interventions to a number of mental health afflictions. Psychedelics have also been shown to be able to modulate immune functions, however, while there has been great interest to researching into their psychotherapeutic applications, there has so far been very little exploration into the potential to treat inflammatory and immune-related diseases with these compounds. A handful of studies from a variety of fields suggest that psychedelics do indeed have effects in the body that may attenuate the outcome of AiD. This literature review explores existing evidence that psychedelic compounds may offer a potential novel application in the treatment of pathologies related to autoimmunity. We propose that psychedelics hold the potential to attenuate or even resolve autoimmunity by targeting psychosomatic origins, maladaptive chronic stress responses, inflammatory pathways, immune modulation and enteric microbiome populations.",Immunology letters,2020,Caitlin Thompson; Attila Szabo

32224141,Molecular mechanisms of the rapid-acting and long-lasting antidepressant actions of (R)-ketamine.,"Ketamine, an anesthetic developed in the early 1960s, is also a popular abused drug among young people at dance parties and raves and among spiritual seekers, because it produces schizophrenia-like symptoms and dissociation (i.e., out-of-body experience). Regarding mood disorders, ketamine exerts robust antidepressant actions in treatment-resistant patients with depression. Ketamine is a racemic mixture comprising equal parts of (R)-ketamine (or arketamine) and (S)-ketamine (or esketamine). The United States (US) Food and Drug Administration approved the J&J (S)-ketamine nasal spray for treatment-resistant depression on March 5, 2019; the spray was then approved in Europe (December 19, 2019). Although (R)-ketamine has lower affinity for the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) vs. (S)-ketamine, (R)-ketamine has greater potency and longer-lasting antidepressant-like actions in animal models of depression. Importantly, (R)-ketamine has less detrimental side effects than does (R,S)-ketamine or (S)-ketamine in rodents, monkeys, and humans. A role for the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) receptor in the antidepressant effects of ketamine and its two enantiomers has been suggested. A recent RNA-sequencing analysis suggested that the transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) plays a role in the antidepressant effects of (R)-ketamine. A recent pilot study demonstrated that (R)-ketamine had rapid-acting and sustained antidepressant effects in treatment-resistant patients with depression. In this article, the author reviews the mechanisms of the antidepressant actions of the enantiomers of ketamine and its metabolites, (S)-norketamine and (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine (HNK) and discusses the role of the brain-gut-microbiota axis and brain-spleen axis in stress-related psychiatric disorders, such as depression.",Biochemical pharmacology,2020,Kenji Hashimoto

33194817,Multiomics Study of Gut Bacteria and Host Metabolism in Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Depression Patients.,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and depression have high tendencies of comorbidity. In particular, diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) and depression exhibit similar fecal microbiota signatures, yet little is known about their pathogenic mechanism. Here, we propose that the differences in structure and composition of IBS-D and depression gut microbiota give rise to different downstream functions, which lead to distinct clinical phenotypes <i>via</i> host metabolism and further influence the interaction of brain-gut axis.We performed multiomics study, including fecal metagenome-wide sequencing and serum metabolomics profiling in 65 individuals with IBS-D (n=22), depression (n=15), comorbid patients (n=13), and healthy controls (n=15). We analyzed functional genes contributed by the primary genus and evaluated their correlations with clinical indices and host metabolites.Metagenomic analysis revealed 26 clusters of orthologous groups of protein (COG) categories consisting of a total of 4,631 functional genes. Trehalose and maltose hydrolase (COG1554) and fucose permease (COG0738) were the most relevant and enriched functional genes in the IBS-D patients; urease accessory proteins UreE (COG2371) was that in the depression patients. Context based genome annotation suggest that an alteration of <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Enterobacter cloacae</i> in IBS-D and depression respectively may be responsible for the enrichment described above. Correlation with host metabolites, such as maltotriose and isomaltose in carbohydrate metabolism and anandamide in neuroactive metabolism, drew further connections between these findings.These changes led us to propose a connection between genomic signatures and clinical differences observed in IBS-D and depression.

31154909,"Unravelled facets of milk derived opioid peptides: a focus on gut physiology, fractures and obesity.","Beyond being a source of key nutrients, bovine milk influences physiological functions by synthesising bioactive peptides during the process of digestion. Some of the claimed negative health outcomes associated with milk consumption, such as cardiovascular diseases and type 1 diabetes may be attributed to an opioid peptide, beta-casomorphin-7 (BCM-7), derived from A1 beta-casein. BCM-7 exerts its function by binding to the μ-opioid receptors in the body. It is hypothesised that activation of the μ-opioid receptors in the gut can alter gut microbial composition, impair gut barrier integrity and bile acid metabolism, in addition to increasing gastrointestinal transit time and gut inflammation. Further, it is hypothesised that BCM-7 may influence fractures and obesity via μ-opioid receptor pathways.

Recent studies have implicated the gut microbiota in infant colic, and certain probiotics have demonstrated possible efficacy. We aim to investigate whether the intestinal microbiota composition in infants with colic is associated with cry/fuss time at baseline, persistence of cry/fuss at 4-week follow-up, or child behavior at 2 years of age. Fecal samples from infants with colic (n = 118, 53% male) were analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing. After examining the alpha and beta diversity of the clinical samples, we performed a differential abundance analysis of the 16S data to look for taxa that associate with baseline and future behavior, while adjusting for potential confounding variables. In addition, we used random forest classifiers to evaluate how well baseline gut microbiota can predict future crying time. Alpha diversity of the fecal microbiota was strongly influenced by birth mode, feed type, and child gender, but did not significantly associate with crying or behavioral outcomes. Several taxa within the microbiota (including Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, Lactobacillus, and Klebsiella) associate with colic severity, and the baseline microbiota composition can predict further crying at 4 weeks with up to 65% accuracy. The combination of machine learning findings with associative relationships demonstrates the potential prognostic utility of the infant fecal microbiota in predicting subsequent infant crying problems.",Journal of developmental origins of health and disease,2021,Amy Loughman; Thomas Quinn; Monica L Nation; Amy Reichelt; Robert J Moore; Thi Thu Hao Van; Valerie Sung; Mimi L K Tang

33334010,Food Addiction and Tobacco Use Disorder: Common Liability and Shared Mechanisms.,"As food addiction is being more commonly recognized within the scientific community, parallels can be drawn between it and other addictive substance use disorders, including tobacco use disorder. Given that both unhealthy diets and smoking are leading risk factors for disability and death, a greater understanding of how food addiction and tobacco use disorder overlap with one another is necessary. This narrative review aimed to highlight literature that investigated prevalence, biology, psychology, and treatment options of food addiction and tobacco use disorder. Published studies up to August 2020 and written in English were included. Using a biopsychosocial lens, each disorder was assessed together and separately, as there is emerging evidence that the two disorders can develop concurrently or sequentially within individuals. Commonalities include but are not limited to the dopaminergic neurocircuitry, gut microbiota, childhood adversity, and attachment insecurity. In addition, the authors conducted a feasibility study with the purpose of examining the association between food addiction symptoms and tobacco use disorder among individuals seeking tobacco use disorder treatment. To inform future treatment approaches, more research is necessary to identify and understand the overlap between the two disorders.",Nutrients,2020,Laurie Zawertailo; Sophia Attwells; Wayne K deRuiter; Thao Lan Le; Danielle Dawson; Peter Selby
33094505,Gut dysbiosis associated with the rats' responses in methamphetamine-induced conditioned place preference.,"Methamphetamine (MA) is a potent stimulant and notoriously addictive. Individuals respond to MA effects differently and thus have a varying susceptible risk of developing MA use disorder. Cumulative evidence has indicated that gut dysbiosis contributes to behavioral response to drug effects. However, the role of gut microbiota in the susceptible risk of developing MA use disorder has remained elusive. Using an MA-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) rat model, we administrated the same dose of MA to rats, which then showed distinct preferences in drug-related place, indicating their different responses to MA. From all of the MA-exposed rats, the eight with the highest CPP scores were labeled as group high CPP (H-CPP), and the eight with the lowest were labeled as group low CPP (L-CPP). By 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequencing, we found that the gut microbiota compositions differed between H-CPP and L-CPP. Specifically, Akkermansia was significantly higher in H-CPP and positively correlated with the CPP scores. Notably, H-CPP and L-CPP differed in the gut microbiota composition prior to the CPP training; Ruminococcus was the dominant phylotype in H-CPP at baseline. More importantly, rats pretreated by antibiotics showed a significantly stronger MA-induced CPP than did the controls. Our study demonstrates that the gut dysbiosis was associated with the MA-induced CPP, indicating that the gut microbiota might be important modulators for MA-induced behavior and vulnerability to MA use disorder.",Addiction biology,2021,Cheng Yang; Xiaoya Fu; Wei Hao; Xiaojun Xiang; Tieqiao Liu; Bao-Zhu Yang; Xiaojie Zhang

33087994,Human Gut Microbiome Response to Short-Term <i>Bifidobacterium</i>-Based Probiotic Treatment.,"Gut microbiota is believed to play a crucial role in modulating obesity in humans, and probiotics affecting gut microbiota can alleviate some of the obesity-related health complications. The study was aimed to investigate changes in the composition of the gut microbiome in obese humans due to short-term (2 weeks) treatment of obese patients with a probiotic preparation containing <i>Bifidobacterium longum</i>. Faecal microbiome diversity was studied using the 16S amplicon sequencing by Illumina MiSeq. Bioinformatic analysis showed distribution across 14 phyla (with <i>Firmicutes</i> and <i>Bacteroidetes</i> dominating), 21 class, 125 genera and 973 OTUs. The probiotic treatment decreased relative abundance of <i>Bacteroidetes</i> (<i>Prevotellaceae</i> and <i>Bacteroidaceae</i>), while increasing that of <i>Actinobacteria</i> (<i>Bifidobacteriaceae</i> and <i>Coriobacteriaceae</i>), and <i>Firmicutes</i> (<i>Negativicutes</i>: <i>Veillonellaceae</i> and <i>Clostridia</i>: <i>Peptostreptococcaceae</i>). The probiotic treatment decreased total blood sugar and increased patients' assessment of their physical and mental health. Thus even the short-term <i>Bifidobacterium</i>-based probiotic treatment brought significant compositional changes in the 16S rRNA gene diversity in faecal bacterial assemblages by increasing beneficial and decreasing pathogenic or opportunistic bacteria; the related shifts in life quality assessment necessitate further research into the causal relationships involved.",Indian journal of microbiology,2020,Natalia Naumova; Tatiana Alikina; Alexey Tupikin; Anna Kalmykova; Galina Soldatova; Valentin Vlassov; Marsel Kabilov
33181474,Gut microbiota composition in children with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome: a pilot study.,"Obstructive Sleep Apnoea syndrome (OSAS) is considered a systemic inflammatory disease and is characterized by intermittent hypoxia that can damage the integrity of intestinal barrier and alter gut microbiota composition in adults and animal models. To date there is only one study on snoring children and microbiota but no studies are present on paediatric OSAS related dysbiosis.To evaluate gut microbiota composition in OSAS children in respect to healthy subjects and investigate the role of sleep parameters in changing gut microbiome.Sixteen children divided in OSAS and healthy groups. Stool samples were collected from both the two groups to assess gut microbiota composition using 16S rRNA sequencing and a nocturnal pulsossimetry and polysomnography were performed in OSAS children.OSAS children showed a decreased microbial diversity in respect to healthy subjects in terms of number of observed species and Chao1 index (p = 0,01). Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was directly correlated to Sleep Clinical Record (p = 0,03). The abundance of several inflammation-related strains (Proteobacteria, Clostridiaceae, Oscillospiraceae, Klebsiella) were found significantly modified in relation to sleep parameters. Bacteria implied in the gut barrier integrity (Desulfovibrionaceae, Bacteroides fragilis and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii) were found significantly different in the two study groups and correlated with sleep parameters.OSAS children showed a lower microbiota diversity in respect to heathy subjects and an increase of inflammation and gut barrier disruptors-related strains probably induced by intermittent hypoxia. Further studies should be conducted to understand the role of gut microbiota in OSAS physiopathology and comorbidities in children.",Sleep medicine,2020,Francesco Valentini; Melania Evangelisti; Marta Arpinelli; Giovanni Di Nardo; Marina Borro; Maurizio Simmaco; Maria Pia Villa

30794085,"Associations among diet, the gastrointestinal microbiota, and negative emotional states in adults.","<b>Objective:</b> Habitual diet impacts mood and the human gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota. Yet, studies infrequently control for diet when evaluating associations between mood and GI microbiota. Accordingly, we aimed to investigate relationships among diet, GI microbiota, and mood in adults without mood disorders by conducting a cross-sectional examination of dietary intake, subjective emotional state, and fecal microbial taxa abundances. <b>Methods:</b> Adults (<i>N</i> = 133; 25-45 years of age) without physician-diagnosed mood disorders were studied. Fecal DNA was extracted, and the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced. Sequences were analyzed using QIIME2. Subjective mood state was assessed using the 42-item Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-42). Habitual dietary intake was measured with the National Cancer Institute's Diet History Questionnaire II, and diet quality was evaluated with the 2010 Healthy Eating Index (HEI). <b>Results:</b> Relationships were observed between 28 bacterial taxa and DASS-42 scores. Sex-dependent associations were observed among 21 bacterial taxa and DASS-42 scores, including an inverse relationship between Anxiety scale scores and <i>Bifidobacterium</i> in females and an inverse relationship between Depression scale scores and <i>Lactobacillus</i> in males. HEI total fruit and dairy components were inversely associated with Depression and Stress scales, respectively. <b>Conclusions:</b> These results suggest GI microbes are related to mood in adults without diagnosed mood disorders and that these relationships differ by sex and are influenced by dietary fiber intake. Incorporating dietary intake data in gut-microbiota-brain studies may help clarify the roles of specific microbes and dietary components in mental health symptoms.",Nutritional neuroscience,2020,Andrew M Taylor; Sharon V Thompson; Caitlyn G Edwards; Salma M A Musaad; Naiman A Khan; Hannah D Holscher

These are typically energy-dense, nutrient-poor and contribute to the rising prevalence of obesity and chronic disease burden. The aims of this study were to evaluate whether a community-based cooking program instigated a change to participants' skills, attitudes, knowledge, enjoyment and satisfaction of cooking and cooking confidence (self-efficacy).The pseudo-random, pre-post study design consisted of an intervention and a control group. Participant recruitment and group allocation was based on their program start dates. Intervention participants were surveyed three times (baseline, 7 weeks and 6 months) and the control group were surveyed at baseline and 5 weeks. All participants were registered via an online website and were 18 years or over. Upon consent, participants were offered four levels of commitment, defined by different assessments. The minimum participation level included an online survey and levels 2, 3 and 4 involved attendance at a clinic with increasing functional, anthropometric and biomarker measurements. Primary endpoints were participants' cooking confidence as a proxy for self-efficacy. Secondary endpoints were dietary intake, physical activity levels, body composition, anthropometry, blood, urine and faecal biomarkers of systemic, physical and mental health.The community cooking program provided participants with information and advice on food sourcing, preparation and nutrition to improve home cooking skills. The study was designed to explore whether food literacy programs are efficacious in improving participant physical health and well-being in order to combat the rise in obesity and diet-related disease. It will support future use of public health cooking program initiatives aimed at improving food literacy, self-efficacy and physical and mental health. The extensive data collected will inform future research into the relationship between diet, the gut-microbiota and human health.Retrospectively registered on 16.08.2019 with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR).

33067643,Profiling the differences of gut microbial structure between schizophrenia patients with and without violent behaviors based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing.,"Understanding the violence behaviors in schizophrenia patients has always been the focus of forensic psychiatry. Although many studies show gut microbiota could regulate behavior, to our knowledge, no studies have profiled the gut microbiota structure in schizophrenia patients with violence. We profiled the characteristics of gut microbiota structure in 26 schizophrenia patients with violence (V.SCZ) by comparing with that of 16 schizophrenia patients without violence (NV.SCZ) under the control of confounders, and found the differences of gut microbiota structure between the two groups.

The 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to identify and relatively quantify gut microbial composition. Bioinformatics analysis was used to find differential gut microbial composition between the V.SCZ and NV.SCZ groups. Fifty-nine differential microbial taxonomic compositions were found between the two groups. Fifteen gut microbial compositions were the key microbial taxonomic compositions responsible for the differences between the V.SCZ and NV.SCZ groups, including five enriched microbial taxonomic compositions (p_Bacteroidetes, c_Bacteroidia, o_Bacteroidales, f_Prevotellaceae, s_Bacteroides_uniformis), and ten impoverished microbial taxonomic compositions (p_Actinobacteria, c_unidentified_Actinobacteria, o_Bifidobacteriales, f_ Enterococcaceae, f_Veillonellaceae, f_Bifidobacteriaceae, g_Enterococcus, g_Candidatus_Saccharimonas, g_Bifidobacterium, and s_Bifidobacterium_pseudocatenulatum).

33005148,Sensitivity to Morphine Reward Associates With Gut Dysbiosis in Rats With Morphine-Induced Conditioned Place Preference.,"Gut microbiota has been found to establish a bidirectional relationship with the central nervous system. Variations of the gut microbiota has been implicated in various mental disorders, including opioid use disorders. Morphine exposure has been repeatedly found to disrupt the gut microbiota, but association between the gut microbiota and the sensitivity to morphine reward remains unknown. In this study the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm was used for morphine-treated rats and saline-treated rats. After the CPP procedure, the morphine-treated rats were divided equally into the low and high CPP (L- and H-CPP) groups according to the CPP scores. We adopted 16S rRNA sequencing for the fecal bacterial communities at baseline and post-conditioning. By comparing the morphine-treated group with saline-treated group, we found alterations of microbial composition in the morphine-treated group, but no significant differences in alpha diversity. The L-CPP group and H-CPP group differed in microbial composition both before and after morphine treatment. The relative abundance of certain taxa was correlated to the CPP scores, such as <i>Alloprevotella</i> and <i>Romboutsia</i>. This study provides direct evidence that morphine exposure alters the composition of the gut microbiota in rats and that microbial alterations are correlated to the sensitivity to morphine reward. These findings may help develop novel therapeutic and preventive strategies for opioid use disorder.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2020,Jingyuan Zhang; Jun Yang; Cheng Yang; Ti Chen; Ziwei Wang; Junyi Li; Fanglin Qin; Qijian Deng; Xiaojie Zhang

31704402,Naturally-diverse airborne environmental microbial exposures modulate the gut microbiome and may provide anxiolytic benefits in mice.,"Growing epidemiological evidence links natural green space exposure with a range of health benefits, including for mental health. Conversely, greater urbanisation associates with increased risk of mental health disorders. Microbiomes are proposed as an important but understudied link that may help explain many green space-human health associations. However, there remains a lack of controlled experimental evidence testing possible beneficial effects from passive exposure to natural biodiversity via airborne microbiota. Previous mouse model studies have used unrealistic environmental microbial exposures-including excessive soil and organic matter contact, feed supplements and injections-to demonstrate host microbiota, immune biomarker, and behavioural changes. Here, in a randomised controlled experiment, we demonstrate that realistic exposures to trace-level dust from a high biodiversity soil can change mouse gut microbiota, in comparison to dust from low biodiversity soil or no soil (control) (n = 54 total mice, comprising 3 treatments × 18 mice, with 9 females + 9 males per group). Furthermore, we found a nominal soil-derived anaerobic spore-forming butyrate-producer, Kineothrix alysoides, was supplemented to a greater extent in the gut microbiomes of high biodiversity treatment mice. Also, increasing relative abundance of this rare organism correlated with reduced anxiety-like behaviour in the most anxious mice. Our results point to an intriguing new hypothesis: that biodiverse soils may represent an important supplementary source of butyrate-producing bacteria capable of resupplying the mammalian gut microbiome, with potential for gut health and mental health benefits. Our findings have potential to inform cost-effective population health interventions through microbiome-conscious green space design and, ultimately, the mainstreaming of biodiversity into health care.",The Science of the total environment,2020,Craig Liddicoat; Harrison Sydnor; Christian Cando-Dumancela; Romy Dresken; Jiajun Liu; Nicholas J C Gellie; Jacob G Mills; Jennifer M Young; Laura S Weyrich; Mark R Hutchinson; Philip Weinstein; Martin F Breed
34589852,Nutritional psychiatry in the treatment of psychotic disorders: Current hypotheses and research challenges.,"Current treatment for schizophrenia-spectrum disorders focusses primarily on psychotropic medication to treat symptoms, though their efficacy varies between patients and psychotropic medication is often accompanied by severe side effects. Nutritional interventions to prevent and treat mental illness have received considerable attention over recent years. However, evidence for nutritional interventions in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders remains limited in quantity and quality. Pathways currently in focus include: i) nutritional deficits and impairments in glucose metabolism, ii) inflammation and immune dysregulation (also known from the mild encephalitis hypothesis), and iii) altered gut microbiota. All of which appear to be interconnected. Key limiting factors for advancing research in this field are research challenges associated with assessing and interpreting inflammatory profiles, microbiota and subjective nutritional assessments, which is further complicated by illness characteristics. This review describes the state of evidence for key hypotheses, including underlying mechanisms, implicated in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, the challenges in nutritional psychiatry research and the current state of nutrition interventions in mental healthcare.","Brain, behavior, & immunity - health",2020,Scott Teasdale; Sabrina Mörkl; Annabel Sandra Müller-Stierlin
32046750,"Treating impulsivity with probiotics in adults (PROBIA): study protocol of a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.","Impulsivity and compulsivity are related to emotional and social maladjustment and often underlie psychiatric disorders. Recently, alterations in microbiota composition have been shown to have implications for brain development and social behavior via the microbiota-gut-brain axis. However, the exact mechanisms are not fully identified. Recent evidence suggests the modulatory effect of synbiotics on gut microbiota and the contribution of these agents in ameliorating symptoms of many psychiatric diseases. To date, no randomized controlled trial has been performed to establish the feasibility and efficacy of this intervention targeting the reduction of impulsivity and compulsivity. We hypothesize that supplementation with synbiotics may be an effective treatment in adults with high levels of impulsivity and/or compulsivity.This is a prospective, multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial with two arms: treatment with a synbiotic formula versus placebo treatment. The primary outcome is the response rate at the end of the placebo-controlled phase (response defined as a Clinical Global Impression-Improvement Scale score of 1 or 2 = very much improved or much improved, plus a reduction in the Affective Reactivity Index total score of at least 30% compared with baseline). A total of 180 participants with highly impulsive behavior and a diagnosis of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and/or borderline personality disorder, aged 18-65 years old, will be screened at three study centers. Secondary outcome measures, including changes in general psychopathology, ADHD symptoms, neurocognitive function, somatic parameters, physical activity, nutritional intake, and health-related quality of life, will be explored at assessments before, during, and at the end of the intervention. The effect of the intervention on genetics, microbiota, and several blood biomarkers will also be assessed. Gastrointestinal symptoms and somatic complaints will additionally be explored at 1-week follow-up.This is the first randomized controlled trial to determine the effects of supplementation with synbiotics on reducing impulsive and compulsive behavior. This clinical trial can contribute to explaining the mechanisms involved in the crosstalk between the intestinal microbiome and the brain. If effects can be established by reducing impulsive and compulsive behavior, new cost-effective treatments might become available to these patients.ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03495375.

31539679,Antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion is associated with resilience in mice after chronic social defeat stress.,"The brain-gut axis plays a role in the pathogenesis of stress-related disorders such as depression. However, the role of brain-gut axis in the resilience versus susceptibility after stress remains unclear. Here, we examined the effects of antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion on an anhedonia-like phenotype in adult mice subjected to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS).Using CSDS paradigm, we investigated the effects of antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion on the resilience versus susceptibility in mice.Treatment with an antibiotic cocktail for 14 days significantly decreased the diversity and composition of the microbiota in the host gut. Proteobacteria were markedly increased after treatment with the antibiotic cocktail. At the genus and species levels, the antibiotic-treated group exhibited marked alterations in the microbiota compared with a control group. CSDS was shown to significantly improve the abnormal composition of gut microbiota in the antibiotic-treated group. CSDS did not produce an anhedonia-like phenotype in the antibiotic-treated mice, but did induce an anhedonia-like phenotype in control mice, suggesting that gut bacteria are essential for the development of CSDS-induced anhedonia. CSDS treatment did not alter the plasma levels of interleukin-6 or the expression of synaptic proteins, such as PSD-95 and GluA1, in the prefrontal cortex of antibiotic-treated mice.Specific microbiome were not determined.These findings suggest that antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion contributed to resilience to anhedonia in mice subjected to CSDS. Therefore, it is likely that the brain-gut axis plays a role in resilience versus susceptibility to stress.",Journal of affective disorders,2020,Siming Wang; Youge Qu; Lijia Chang; Yaoyu Pu; Kai Zhang; Kenji Hashimoto
33195226,Microbiome Profiling Reveals Gut Dysbiosis in the Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 5 Knockout Mouse Model of Schizophrenia.,"Schizophrenia (SZ) is a psychiatric disorder that constitutes one of the top 10 global causes of disability. More recently, a potential pathogenic role for the gut microbial community (microbiota) has been highlighted, with numerous studies describing dysregulated microbial profiles in SZ patients when compared to healthy controls. However, no animal model of SZ has previously recapitulated the gut dysbiosis observed clinically. Since the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu5) knockout mice provide a preclinical model of SZ with strong face and predictive validity, in the present study we performed gut microbiome profiling of mGlu5 knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice by 16S rRNA sequencing of bacterial genomic DNA from fecal samples, analyzing bacterial diversity and taxonomic composition, as well as gastrointestinal parameters as indicators of gut function. We found a significant genotype difference in microbial beta diversity. Analysis of composition of microbiomes (ANCOM) models were performed to evaluate microbiota compositions, which identified a decreased relative abundance of the <i>Erysipelotrichaceae</i> family and <i>Allobaculum</i> genus in this mouse model of SZ. We also identified a signature of bacteria discriminating between the genotypes (KO and WT), consisting of the Erysipelotrichales, Bacteroidales, and Clostridiales orders and macroscopic gut differences. We thus uncovered global differential community composition in the gut microbiota profile between mGlu5 KO and WT mice, outlining the first evidence for gut dysbiosis in a genetic animal model of SZ. Our findings suggest that this widely used preclinical model of SZ also has substantial utility for investigations of gut dysbiosis and associated signaling via the microbiota-gut-brain axis, as potential modulators of SZ pathogenesis. Our discovery opens up new avenues to explore gut dysbiosis and its proposed links to brain dysfunction in SZ, as well as novel therapeutic approaches to this devastating disorder.",Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,2020,Carolina Gubert; Geraldine Kong; Volkan Uzungil; Ariel M Zeleznikow-Johnston; Emma L Burrows; Thibault Renoir; Anthony J Hannan
32799901,Ingestion of Lactobacillus intestinalis and Lactobacillus reuteri causes depression- and anhedonia-like phenotypes in antibiotic-treated mice via the vagus nerve.,"The brain-gut-microbiota axis plays a role in the pathogenesis of stress-related disorders such as depression. In this study, we examined the effects of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in mice with antibiotic-treated microbiota depletion.The fecal microbiota was obtained from mice subjected to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) and control (no CSDS) mice. FMT from these two groups was performed to antibiotic-treated mice. 16S rRNA analysis was performed to examine the composition of gut microbiota. Furthermore, the effects of subdiaphragmatic vagotomy in depression-like phenotypes after ingestion of microbes were examined.The ingestion of fecal microbiota from CSDS-susceptible mice resulted in an anhedonia-like phenotype, higher plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), and decreased expression of synaptic proteins in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in antibiotic-treated mice but not in water-treated mice. 16S rRNA analysis suggested that two microbes (Lactobacillus intestinalis and Lactobacillus reuteri) may be responsible for the anhedonia-like phenotype in antibiotic-treated mice after FMT. Ingestion of these two microbes for 14 days led to depression- and anhedonia-like phenotypes, higher plasma IL-6 levels, and decreased expression of synaptic proteins in the PFC of antibiotic-treated mice. Interestingly, subdiaphragmatic vagotomy significantly blocked the development of behavioral abnormalities, elevation of plasma IL-6 levels, and downregulation of synaptic proteins in the PFC after ingestion of these two microbes.These findings suggest that microbiota depletion using an antibiotic cocktail is essential for the development of FMT-induced behavioral changes and that the vagus nerve plays a key role in behavioral abnormalities in antibiotic-treated mice after the ingestion of L. intestinalis and L. reuteri. Therefore, it is likely that the brain-gut-microbiota axis participates in the pathogenesis of depression via the vagus nerve.",Journal of neuroinflammation,2020,Siming Wang; Tamaki Ishima; Jiancheng Zhang; Youge Qu; Lijia Chang; Yaoyu Pu; Yuko Fujita; Yunfei Tan; Xingming Wang; Kenji Hashimoto
32398374,Maternal glyphosate exposure causes autism-like behaviors in offspring through increased expression of soluble epoxide hydrolase.,"Epidemiological studies suggest that exposure to herbicides during pregnancy might increase risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in offspring. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the risk of ASD by herbicides such as glyphosate remain unclear. Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) in the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids is shown to play a key role in the development of ASD in offspring after maternal immune activation. Here, we found ASD-like behavioral abnormalities in juvenile offspring after maternal exposure to high levels of formulated glyphosate. Furthermore, we found higher levels of sEH in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus, and striatum of juvenile offspring, and oxylipin analysis showed decreased levels of epoxy-fatty acids such as 8 (9)-EpETrE in the blood, PFC, hippocampus, and striatum of juvenile offspring after maternal glyphosate exposure, supporting increased activity of sEH in the offspring. Moreover, we found abnormal composition of gut microbiota and short-chain fatty acids in fecal samples of juvenile offspring after maternal glyphosate exposure. Interestingly, oral administration of TPPU (an sEH inhibitor) to pregnant mothers from E5 to P21 prevented ASD-like behaviors such as social interaction deficits and increased grooming time in the juvenile offspring after maternal glyphosate exposure. These findings suggest that maternal exposure to high levels of glyphosate causes ASD-like behavioral abnormalities and abnormal composition of gut microbiota in juvenile offspring, and that increased activity of sEH might play a role in ASD-like behaviors in offspring after maternal glyphosate exposure. Therefore, sEH may represent a target for ASD in offspring after maternal stress from occupational exposure to contaminants.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2020,Yaoyu Pu; Jun Yang; Lijia Chang; Youge Qu; Siming Wang; Kai Zhang; Zhongwei Xiong; Jiancheng Zhang; Yunfei Tan; Xingming Wang; Yuko Fujita; Tamaki Ishima; Debin Wang; Sung Hee Hwang; Bruce D Hammock; Kenji Hashimoto
31931033,Heat-killed Enterococcus fecalis (EC-12) supplement alters the expression of neurotransmitter receptor genes in the prefrontal cortex and alleviates anxiety-like behavior in mice.,"Gut microbiota plays a crucial role in the maintenance of mental health and influences mental disorders such as depression and anxiety. Several studies have reported the beneficial affects of probiotics in mental health. Heat-killed Enterococcus faecalis strain EC-12 (EC-12), a lactic acid bacterium induces activation of the immune system. However, little is known about the effect of EC-12 on mental health. In the present study, the anti-anxiety effect of EC-12 was elucidated in vivo. Male mice fed on diet supplemented with EC-12 showed decreased anxiety-like behavior in open-field and elevated plus-mazetest. In addition, EC-12 supplementation exhibited an anti-depressive trend in mice subjected to forced swim test. The expression of neurotransmitter receptor genes: Adrb3 and Avpr1a were significantly enhanced in EC-12 supplemented mice compared to that of the control mice. In mice, analyses of gut microbiota composition by next generation sequencing revealed significant increase in Butyricicoccus and Enterococcus with EC-12 supplementation. Significant difference was not detected in the expression of neurotransmitter receptor genes in the prefrontal cortex with the administration of sodium butyrate compared to that of the control group. The mechanism associated with EC-12 mediated reduced anxiety-like behavior and altered gene expression in the brain needs to be further elucidated. Taken together, the present study is the first to report the possibility of exploiting the anti-anxiety effect of heat-killed EC-12 as a novel probiotic to promote mental health.",Neuroscience letters,2020,Jun Kambe; Sovijit Watcharin; Yuko Makioka-Itaya; Ryo Inoue; Gen Watanabe; Hirohito Yamaguchi; Kentaro Nagaoka
32485204,Probiotic treatment (Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum 35624™) affects stress responsivity in male rats after chronic corticosterone exposure.,"Mounting evidence suggests that gut microbiota do not only regulate intestinal function and health, but that they also play a role in mental health via the gut-brain axis. Previous research further suggests that probiotics may have beneficial health effects, but more research is needed to confirm these beneficial effects and better understand the underlying mechanisms and potential sex differences in the response to probiotics. Therefore, the current study investigates the effects of chronic administration of the commercially available probiotic Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum 35624™(B. 35624) to male and female rats under control or ""stressed"" conditions. For this, 24 male and 24 female Sprague-Dawley rats were either given daily corticosterone injections (40 mg/kg; to induce depressive-like behavior and a ""stressed"" condition) or oil injections (controls) together with oral administration of B.35624 or vehicle for 21 days (n = 5-7/group). Animals performed the Open Field Test (OFT) and Forced Swim Test (FST) and several blood samples were collected to investigate basal as well as stress-induced corticosterone levels. Rats were sacrificed on day 22 and their brains sliced and stained with doublecortin, a marker of immature neurons. Results showed that B.35624 was not able to rescue depressive-like behavior or induce changes in neurogenesis in males or females, but the probiotic impacted hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis functioning in male animals and tended to reduce anxiolytic behavior in the OFT. More research is needed to further elucidate the potential health effects of probiotics especially in regard to possible sex differences.",Behavioural brain research,2020,Gabriel S Haas; Wan Wang; Malak Saffar; Sean M Mooney-Leber; Susanne Brummelte
32739746,Colonization with the commensal fungus Candida albicans perturbs the gut-brain axis through dysregulation of endocannabinoid signaling.,"Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent mental health disorder worldwide, with a lifetime prevalence of 5-7 % of the human population. Although the etiology of anxiety disorders is incompletely understood, one aspect of host health that affects anxiety disorders is the gut-brain axis. Adolescence is a key developmental window in which stress and anxiety disorders are a major health concern. We used adolescent female mice in a gastrointestinal (GI) colonization model to demonstrate that the commensal fungus Candida albicans affects host health via the gut-brain axis. In mice, bacterial members of the gut microbiota can influence the host gut-brain axis, affecting anxiety-like behavior and the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis which produces the stress hormone corticosterone (CORT). Here we showed that mice colonized with C. albicans demonstrated increased anxiety-like behavior and increased basal production of CORT as well as dysregulation of CORT production following acute stress. The HPA axis and anxiety-like behavior are negatively regulated by the endocannabinoid N-arachidonoylethanolamide (AEA). We demonstrated that C. albicans-colonized mice exhibited changes in the endocannabinoidome. Further, increasing AEA levels using the well-characterized fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitor URB597 was sufficient to reverse both neuroendocrine phenotypes in C. albicans-colonized mice. Thus, a commensal fungus that is a common colonizer of humans had widespread effects on the physiology of its host. To our knowledge, this is the first report of microbial manipulation of the endocannabinoid (eCB) system that resulted in neuroendocrine changes contributing to anxiety-like behavior.",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2020,Laura Markey; Andrew Hooper; Laverne C Melon; Samantha Baglot; Matthew N Hill; Jamie Maguire; Carol A Kumamoto
31769847,Probiotics and prebiotics: focus on psychiatric disorders - a systematic review.,"The gut-brain axis and microbial dysbiosis may play a role in psychiatric diseases. In this view, the gut microbiota has been considered a potential therapeutic target using probiotics and prebiotics.This systematic review aims to find the existing clinical evidence that may justify the use of probiotics or prebiotics in psychiatric patients.PRISMA guidelines were followed for a systematic literature review of randomized controlled trials that assessed the effect of prebiotics or probiotics in patients diagnosed with a classified psychiatric disorder.From a total of 212 studies screened, 11 were included in the final systematic review. Quality assessment of the included trials was assessed by the Jadad scale.Probiotics seem to offer some benefit in major depressive disorder and Alzheimer's disease. One study showed that probiotics reduced rehospitalization in patients with acute mania. In autism spectrum disorders, the results were controversial; however a single study found that early administration of probiotics showed a preventive role. No benefits were found for patients with schizophrenia. In most studies, no major adverse effects were reported.Although recent findings in specific psychiatric disorders are encouraging, the use of prebiotics and probiotics in clinical practice stills lacks sufficiently robust evidence.",Nutrition reviews,2020,Renata S D Barbosa; Maria A Vieira-Coelho
33067279,Effects of sulforaphane on cognitive function in patients with frontal brain damage: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.,"Many patients with frontal brain damage show serious cognitive function deficits, which hamper their quality of life and result in poor clinical outcomes. Preclinical research has shown that sulforaphane can significantly improve spatial localisation and working memory impairment after brain injury. The primary aim of this double-blind randomised controlled clinical trial is to assess the efficacy of sulforaphane for improving cognitive function in patients with frontal brain damage.Ninety eligible patients will be randomly allocated to an active treatment or a placebo group in a 2:1 ratio. Participants will undergo a series of cognitive and neuropsychiatric tests at baseline (week 0) and after 12 weeks to determine the effect of sulforaphane on cognition. Magnetic resonance spectrum of the brain will be studied using the 3T MRIs of the brain to detect brain metabolites markers, including N-acetyl aspartate, glutamate (Glu), glutathione (GSH) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Blood brain-derived neurotrophic factor, Glu, GSH and GABA levels and gut microbiota will also be assessed over this period. This study will also evaluate long-term outcomes of brain trauma, brain tumours and cerebrovascular disease via exploratory analyses. The primary outcome will be the difference in scores of a battery of cognitive tests after 12 weeks of sulforaphane treatment. The secondary outcomes will be changes in the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, the changes in T1-weighted MRI and resting-state functional MRI findings, and changes in brain and blood metabolic markers and gut microbiota at weeks 0 and 12. We expect that sulforaphane will yield favourable results in treating memory and learning deficits for patients with frontal brain damage. Cognitive functional treatment may also improve brain trauma, brain tumours and cerebrovascular outcomes.The study protocol has been approved by the Medical Ethics committee of the Xiangya Hospital of Central South University (No. 2017121019). The results will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and at international conferences.This trial was registered on Clinicaltrials.gov on 31 January 2020 (NCT04252261).

32438623,Recipe for a Healthy Gut: Intake of Unpasteurised Milk Is Associated with Increased <i>Lactobacillus</i> Abundance in the Human Gut Microbiome.,"The gut microbiota plays a role in gut-brain communication and can influence psychological functioning. Diet is one of the major determinants of gut microbiota composition. The impact of unpasteurised dairy products on the microbiota is unknown. In this observational study, we investigated the effect of a dietary change involving intake of unpasteurised dairy on gut microbiome composition and psychological status in participants undertaking a residential 12-week cookery course on an organic farm.Twenty-four participants completed the study. The majority of food consumed during their stay originated from the organic farm itself and included unpasteurised milk and dairy products. At the beginning and end of the course, participants provided faecal samples and completed self-report questionnaires on a variety of parameters including mood, anxiety and sleep. Nutrient intake was monitored with a food frequency questionnaire. Gut microbiota analysis was performed with 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Additionally, faecal short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were measured.Relative abundance of the genus <i>Lactobacillus</i> increased significantly between pre- and post-course time points. This increase was associated with participants intake of unpasteurised milk and dairy products. An increase in the faecal SCFA, valerate, was observed along with an increase in the functional richness of the microbiome profile, as determined by measuring the predictive neuroactive potential using a gut-brain module approach.While concerns in relation to safety need to be considered, intake of unpasteurised milk and dairy products appear to be associated with the growth of the probiotic bacterial genus, <i>Lactobacillus</i>, in the human gut. More research is needed on the effect of dietary changes on gut microbiome composition, in particular in relation to the promotion of bacterial genera, such as <i>Lactobacillus</i>, which are recognised as being beneficial for a range of physical and mental health outcomes.",Nutrients,2020,Mary I Butler; Thomaz F S Bastiaanssen; Caitriona Long-Smith; Kirsten Berding; Sabrina Morkl; Anne-Marie Cusack; Conall Strain; Kizkitza Busca; Penny Porteous-Allen; Marcus J Claesson; Catherine Stanton; John F Cryan; Darina Allen; Timothy G Dinan
32379622,Betaine supplementation is associated with the resilience in mice after chronic social defeat stress: a role of brain-gut-microbiota axis.,"The brain-gut-microbiota axis plays a role in the pathogenesis of stress-related psychiatric disorders; however, its role in the resilience versus susceptibility after stress remains unclear. Dietary nutrient betaine is suggested to affect the gut microbiome. Here, we examined whether betaine supplementation can affect anhedonia-like phenotype in mice subjected to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS).CSDS was performed during betaine supplementation. Sucrose preference test and 16S rRNA analysis of fecal samples were performed.CSDS did not produce an anhedonia-like phenotype in the betaine-treated mice, but did induce an anhedonia-like phenotype in water-treated mice. Furthermore, CSDS treatment did not alter the plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) of betaine-treated mice whereas CSDS caused higher plasma levels of IL-6 in water-treated mice. Betaine supplementation ameliorated the abnormal diversity and composition of the microbiota in the host gut after CSDS. At the genus level, CSDS caused marked increases in the several bacteria of water-treated mice, but not betaine-treated mice. CSDS increased levels of short-chain fatty acids (i.e., succinic acid and acetic acid) in feces from water-treated mice, but not betaine-treated mice. Interestingly, there are positive correlations between short-chain fatty acids (i.e., succinic acid, acetic acid, butyric acid) and several bacteria among the groups.Specific microbiome were not determined.These findings suggest that betaine supplementation contributed to resilience to anhedonia in mice subjected to CSDS through anti-inflammation action. Therefore, it is likely that betaine could be a prophylactic nutrient to prevent stress-related psychiatric disorders.",Journal of affective disorders,2020,Youge Qu; Kai Zhang; Yaoyu Pu; Lijia Chang; Siming Wang; Yunfei Tan; Xingming Wang; Jiancheng Zhang; Tetsuo Ohnishi; Takeo Yoshikawa; Kenji Hashimoto
32495743,"The Safety, Efficacy, and Tolerability of Microbial Ecosystem Therapeutic-2 in People With Major Depression and/or Generalized Anxiety Disorder: Protocol for a Phase 1, Open-Label Study.","The bidirectional signaling between the gut microbiota and the brain, known as the gut-brain axis, is being heavily explored in current neuropsychiatric research. Analyses of the human gut microbiota have shown considerable individual variability in bacterial content, which is hypothesized to influence brain function, and potentially mood and anxiety symptoms, through gut-brain axis communication. Preclinical and clinical research examining these effects suggests that fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) may aid in improving the severity of depression and anxiety symptoms by recolonizing the gastrointestinal (GI) tract with healthy bacteria. The microbial ecosystem therapeutic (ie, microbial ecosystem therapeutic-2 [MET-2]) used in this study is an alternative treatment to FMT, which comprises 40 different strains of gut bacteria from a healthy donor.The primary objective of this study is to assess subjective changes in mood and anxiety symptoms before, during, and after administration of MET-2. The secondary objectives of this study are to assess the changes in metabolic functioning and the level of repopulation of healthy gut bacteria, the safety and tolerability of MET-2, and the effects of early stress on biomarkers of depression/anxiety and the response to treatment.Adults experiencing depressive or anxiety symptoms will be recruited from the Kingston area. These participants will orally consume an encapsulated MET-2 once daily-containing 40 strains of purified and laboratory-grown bacteria from a single healthy donor-for 8 weeks, followed by a 2-week treatment-free follow-up period. Participants will undergo a series of clinical assessments measuring mood, anxiety, and GI symptoms using validated clinical scales and questionnaires. Molecular data will be collected from blood and fecal samples to assess metabolic changes, neurotransmitter levels, inflammatory markers, and the level of engraftment of the fecal samples that may predict outcomes in depression or anxiety.Given the association between the gut bacteria and the risk factors of depression, we expect to observe an improvement in the severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms following treatment, and we expect that this improvement is mediated by the recolonization of the GI tract with healthy bacteria. The recruitment for this study has been completed, and the data obtained are currently being analyzed.This is the first time MET-2 is being tested in psychiatric indications, specifically depression and anxiety. As such, this may be the first study to show the potential effects of microbial therapy in alleviating psychiatric symptoms as well as its safety and tolerability.DERR1-10.2196/17223.",JMIR research protocols,2020,Arthi Chinna Meyyappan; Roumen Milev
33066107,Effects of <i>Bifidobacterium animalis</i> Subsp. <i>lactis</i> (BPL1) Supplementation in Children and Adolescents with Prader-Willi Syndrome: A Randomized Crossover Trial.,"Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a wide range of clinical manifestations, including obesity, hyperphagia, and behavioral problems. <i>Bifidobacterium animalis</i> subsp. <i>lactis</i> strain BPL1 has been shown to improve central adiposity in adults with simple obesity. To evaluate BPL1's effects in children with PWS, we performed a randomized crossover trial among 39 patients (mean age 10.4 years). Participants were randomized to placebo-BPL1 (<i>n</i> = 19) or BPL1-placebo (<i>n</i> = 20) sequences and underwent a 12-week period with placebo/BPL1 treatments, a 12-week washout period, and a 12-week period with the crossover treatment. Thirty-five subjects completed the study. The main outcome was changes in adiposity, measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Secondary outcomes included lipid and glucose metabolism, hyperphagia, and mental health symptoms. Generalized linear modeling was applied to assess differences between treatments. While BPL1 did not modify total fat mass compared to placebo, BPL1 decreased abdominal adiposity in a subgroup of patients older than 4.5 years (<i>n</i> = 28). BPL1 improved fasting insulin concentration and insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, we observed modest improvements in some mental health symptoms. A follow-up trial with a longer treatment period is warranted to determine whether BPL1 supplementation can provide a long-term therapeutic approach for children with PWS (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03548480).",Nutrients,2020,Montse Amat-Bou; Sonika Garcia-Ribera; Eric Climent; Irene Piquer-Garcia; Raquel Corripio; David Sanchez-Infantes; Laia Villalta; Maria Elias; Josep C Jiménez-Chillarón; Empar Chenoll; Daniel Ramón; Lourdes Ibañez; Marta Ramon-Krauel; Carles Lerin
32989186,Effects of a Psychobiotic Supplement on Serum Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor Levels in Depressive Patients: A <i>Post Hoc</i> Analysis of a Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Psychobiotics are probiotics or prebiotics that, upon ingestion in adequate amounts, yield positive influence on mental health via microbiota-gut-brain axis regulation to modulate the circulating cytokines, chemokines, neurotransmitters, or neurotrophins levels. We have recently shown that a psychobiotic combination (<i>Lactobacillus helveticus</i> R0052 and <i>Bifidobacterium longum</i> R0175; CEREBIOME) significantly improved depression symptoms in patients with depression. Recent animal data suggest the influence of the gut microbiota on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which was shown to correlate with antidepressant response in depressive patients. Therefore, we conducted this exploratory <i>post hoc</i> analysis of BDNF levels to clarify the mechanism of action of this psychobiotic in our cohort.Our study was a double-blind, randomized controlled trial of patients with low-to-moderate depression receiving either a probiotic combination, prebiotic or placebo. From the 110 patients randomized in the trial, 78 were included in this <i>post hoc</i> analysis (probiotic, n = 28; prebiotic and placebo, n = 25). We compared serum BDNF levels from participants at baseline and endpoint, and assessed the Pearson correlation between depression severity and BDNF levels for each intervention.We found that post-intervention BDNF levels were significantly different between groups (<i>P</i> < 0.001). Furthermore, BDNF levels increased significantly in the probiotic group compared to both the prebiotic (<i>P</i> < 0.001) and placebo groups (<i>P</i> = 0.021), which inversely correlated with depression severity compared to placebo (ANOVA/ANCOVA, <i>P</i> = 0.012; Pearson, <i>r</i> = -0.79, <i>P</i> < 0.001). In the prebiotic group, BDNF levels reduced but not significantly compared with placebo group (<i>P</i> > 0.05).Eight-week supplementation with B. longum and L. helveticus in depressive patients improved depression symptoms, possibly by increasing BDNF levels.",Journal of neurogastroenterology and motility,2020,Nazanin Heidarzadeh-Rad; Hülya Gökmen-Özel; Asma Kazemi; Negin Almasi; Kurosh Djafarian
33212907,PROFAST: A Randomized Trial Assessing the Effects of Intermittent Fasting and <i>Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus</i> Probiotic among People with Prediabetes.,"Both intermittent fasting and specific probiotics have shown promise in improving glucose tolerance with a potential for synergistic effects through alterations to gut microbiota. In this randomized, double-blinded, two-arm feasibility study, we investigated whether intermittent fasting, supplemented with <i>Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus</i> HN001 probiotic, reduces HbA1c in individuals with prediabetes. All participants with HbA1c 40-50 mmol/mol commenced intermittent fasting (2 days per week of calorie restriction to 600-650 kcal/day) and were randomized 1:1 to either daily probiotic (<i>Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus</i> HN001) or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was a change in HbA1c. Secondary outcomes included changes in anthropometry, body composition, glucoregulatory markers, lipids, hunger hormones, liver enzymes, inflammatory markers, gut hormones, calorie and macronutrient intake, quality of life, hunger, mood and eating behavior. Of 33 participants who commenced the trial, 26 participants (mean age 52 years, body mass index (BMI) 34.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) completed the intervention (<i>n</i> = 11 placebo, <i>n</i> = 15 probiotic). HbA1c decreased from 43 ± 2.7 mmol/mol to 41 ± 2.3 mmol/mol, <i>p</i> < 0.001, with average of 5% weight loss. No significant between-group differences were seen in primary or secondary outcomes except for social functioning (<i>p</i> = 0.050) and mental health (<i>p</i> = 0.007) scores as improvements were seen in the probiotic group, but not in the placebo group. This study shows additional psychological benefits of probiotic supplementation during intermittent fasting to achieve weight loss and glycemic improvement in prediabetes.",Nutrients,2020,Audrey Tay; Hannah Pringle; Elise Penning; Lindsay D Plank; Rinki Murphy
33067915,Interaction between Maternal Immune Activation and Antibiotic Use during Pregnancy and Child Risk of Autism Spectrum Disorder.,"Prenatal exposure to maternal immune activation (MIA) has been implicated as a risk factor for the development of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), though the conditions under which this elevated risk occurs are unclear. Animal literature demonstrates that antibiotic use, which affects the composition of the maternal gut microbiota, modifies the effect of MIA on neurodevelopmental outcomes in the offspring. The aim of this study was to assess whether antibiotic use during pregnancy modifies the association between MIA and subsequent risk of ASD, in a prospective birth cohort with 116 ASD cases and 860 typically developing (TD) child controls. There was no evidence of interaction between fever or genitourinary infection and antibiotic use on the odds of ASD in unadjusted or adjusted analyzes. However, we found evidence of an interaction between flu, specifically in second trimester, and antibiotic use at any point during pregnancy on the odds of ASD in the child. Among women who received an antibiotic during pregnancy, flu in trimester two was not associated with ASD (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.99 [0.43-2.28]). Among women who were not exposed to an antibiotic at any point during pregnancy, flu in second trimester was significantly associated with increased odds of ASD (aOR = 4.05 [1.14-14.38], P = .03), after adjustment for child sex, child birth year, maternal age, gestational age, C-section delivery, and low birthweight. These findings should be treated as hypothesis-generating and suggest that antibiotic use may modify the influence that MIA has on autism risk in the child. LAY SUMMARY: We looked at whether the association between activation of the immune system during pregnancy and risk of the child developing autism spectrum disorder (ASD) differed among women who did or did not take an antibiotic at any point during pregnancy. We examined 116 children with ASD and 860 without ASD and found that flu in second trimester was associated with increased ASD, but only among women who did not take an antibiotic during pregnancy. No other immune activation exposures seemed to interact with antibiotic use.",Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research,2020,Calliope Holingue; Martha Brucato; Christine Ladd-Acosta; Xiumei Hong; Heather Volk; Noel T Mueller; Xiaobin Wang; M Daniele Fallin
33693453,Diet and the Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis: Sowing the Seeds of Good Mental Health.,"Over the past decade, the gut microbiota has emerged as a key component in regulating brain processes and behavior. Diet is one of the major factors involved in shaping the gut microbiota composition across the lifespan. However, whether and how diet can affect the brain via its effects on the microbiota is only now beginning to receive attention. Several mechanisms for gut-to-brain communication have been identified, including microbial metabolites, immune, neuronal, and metabolic pathways, some of which could be prone to dietary modulation. Animal studies investigating the potential of nutritional interventions on the microbiota-gut-brain axis have led to advancements in our understanding of the role of diet in this bidirectional communication. In this review, we summarize the current state of the literature triangulating diet, microbiota, and host behavior/brain processes and discuss potential underlying mechanisms. Additionally, determinants of the responsiveness to a dietary intervention and evidence for the microbiota as an underlying modulator of the effect of diet on brain health are outlined. In particular, we emphasize the understudied use of whole-dietary approaches in this endeavor and the need for greater evidence from clinical populations. While promising results are reported, additional data, specifically from clinical cohorts, are required to provide evidence-based recommendations for the development of microbiota-targeted, whole-dietary strategies to improve brain and mental health.","Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2021,Kirsten Berding; Klara Vlckova; Wolfgang Marx; Harriet Schellekens; Catherine Stanton; Gerard Clarke; Felice Jacka; Timothy G Dinan; John F Cryan
33671569,Nutritional Components in Western Diet Versus Mediterranean Diet at the Gut Microbiota-Immune System Interplay. Implications for Health and Disease.,"The most prevalent diseases of our time, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) (including obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and some types of cancer) are rising worldwide. All of them share the condition of an ""inflammatory disorder"", with impaired immune functions frequently caused or accompanied by alterations in gut microbiota. These multifactorial maladies also have in common malnutrition related to physiopathology. In this context, diet is the greatest modulator of immune system-microbiota crosstalk, and much interest, and new challenges, are arising in the area of precision nutrition as a way towards treatment and prevention. It is a fact that the westernized diet (WD) is partly responsible for the increased prevalence of NCDs, negatively affecting both gut microbiota and the immune system. Conversely, other nutritional approaches, such as Mediterranean diet (MD), positively influence immune system and gut microbiota, and is proposed not only as a potential tool in the clinical management of different disease conditions, but also for prevention and health promotion globally. Thus, the purpose of this review is to determine the regulatory role of nutritional components of WD and MD in the gut microbiota and immune system interplay, in order to understand, and create awareness of, the influence of diet over both key components.",Nutrients,2021,Cielo García-Montero; Oscar Fraile-Martínez; Ana M Gómez-Lahoz; Leonel Pekarek; Alejandro J Castellanos; Fernando Noguerales-Fraguas; Santiago Coca; Luis G Guijarro; Natalio García-Honduvilla; Angel Asúnsolo; Lara Sanchez-Trujillo; Guillermo Lahera; Julia Bujan; Jorge Monserrat; Melchor Álvarez-Mon; Miguel A Álvarez-Mon; Miguel A Ortega
33271426,The gut microbiota in anxiety and depression - A systematic review.,"Growing evidence indicates the community of microorganisms throughout the gastrointestinal tract, (i.e., gut microbiota), is associated with anxiety and depressive disorders. We present the first systematic review of the gut microbiota in anxiety disorders, along with an update in depression. Consideration of shared underlying features is essential due to the high rates of comorbidity. Systematic searches, following PRISMA guidelines, identified 26 studies (two case-control comparisons of the gut microbiota in generalised anxiety disorder, 18 in depression, one incorporating both anxiety/depression, and five including symptom-only measures). Alpha and beta diversity findings were inconsistent; however, differences in bacterial taxa indicated disorders may be characterised by a higher abundance of proinflammatory species (e.g., Enterobacteriaceae and Desulfovibrio), and lower short-chain fatty acid producing-bacteria (e.g., Faecalibacterium).

33271426,The gut microbiota in anxiety and depression - A systematic review.,"Growing evidence indicates the community of microorganisms throughout the gastrointestinal tract, (i.e., gut microbiota), is associated with anxiety and depressive disorders. We present the first systematic review of the gut microbiota in anxiety disorders, along with an update in depression. Consideration of shared underlying features is essential due to the high rates of comorbidity. Systematic searches, following PRISMA guidelines, identified 26 studies (two case-control comparisons of the gut microbiota in generalised anxiety disorder, 18 in depression, one incorporating both anxiety/depression, and five including symptom-only measures). Alpha and beta diversity findings were inconsistent; however, differences in bacterial taxa indicated disorders may be characterised by a higher abundance of proinflammatory species (e.g., Enterobacteriaceae and Desulfovibrio), and lower short-chain fatty acid producing-bacteria (e.g., Faecalibacterium). Several taxa, and their mechanisms of action, may relate to anxiety and depression pathophysiology via communication of peripheral inflammation to the brain.

33955443,Gut microbiota in mental health and depression: role of pre/pro/synbiotics in their modulation.,"The microbiome residing in the human gut performs a wide range of biological functions. Recently, it has been elucidated that a change in dietary habits is associated with alteration in the gut microflora which results in increased health risks and vulnerability towards various diseases. Falling in line with the same concept, depression has also been shown to increase its prevalence around the globe, especially in the western world. Various research studies have suggested that changes in the gut microbiome profile further result in decreased tolerance of stress. Although currently available medications help in relieving the symptoms of depressive disorders briefly, these drugs are not able to completely reverse the multifactorial pathology of depression. The discovery of the communication pathway between gut microbes and the brain, i.e. the Gut-Brain Axis, has led to new areas of research to find more effective and safer alternatives to current antidepressants. The use of probiotics and prebiotics has been suggested as being effective in various preclinical studies and clinical trials for depression. Therefore, in the present review, we address the new antidepressant mechanisms via gut microbe alterations and provide insight into how these can provide an alternative to antidepressant therapy without the side effects and risk of adverse drug reactions.",Food & function,2021,Hasnain N Methiwala; Bhupesh Vaidya; Vamsi Krishna Addanki; Mahendra Bishnoi; Shyam Sunder Sharma; Kanthi Kiran Kondepudi

We aimed to verify the efficacy and safety of probiotic NVP-1704, a mixture of <i>Lactobacillus reuteri</i> NK33 and <i>Bifidobacterium adolescentis</i> NK98, in improving stress, depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances, along with the measurement of some blood biomarkers. A total of 156 healthy adults with subclinical symptoms of depression, anxiety, and insomnia were retrospectively registered and randomly assigned to receive either NVP-1704 (<i>n</i> = 78) or a placebo (<i>n</i> = 78) for eight weeks. Participants completed the Stress Response Inventory, Beck's Depression and Anxiety Inventory, Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index, and Insomnia Severity Index at baseline, at four and eight weeks of treatment. Pre- and post-treatment blood tests for biomarkers were conducted. After intervention, gut microbiota composition was quantified by pyrosequencing the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. The NVP-1704 group had a more significant reduction in depressive symptoms at four and eight weeks of treatment, and anxiety symptoms at four weeks compared to the placebo group. Those receiving NVP-1704 also experienced an improvement in sleep quality. NVP-1704 treatment led to a decrease in serum interleukin-6 levels. Furthermore, NVP-1704 increased <i>Bifidobacteriaceae</i> and <i>Lactobacillacea</i>, whereas it decreased <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> in the gut microbiota composition.

33963281,Gut microbiota modulates the inflammatory response and cognitive impairment induced by sleep deprivation.,"Sleep deprivation (SD) is increasingly common in modern society, which can lead to the dysregulation of inflammatory responses and cognitive impairment, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Emerging evidence suggests that gut microbiota plays a critical role in the pathogenesis and development of inflammatory and psychiatric diseases, possibly via gut microbiota-brain interactions and neuroinflammation. The present study investigated the impact of SD on gut microbiota composition and explored whether alterations of the gut microbiota play a causal role in chronic inflammatory states and cognitive impairment that are induced by SD. We found that SD-induced gut dysbiosis, inflammatory responses, and cognitive impairment in humans. Moreover, the absence of the gut microbiota suppressed inflammatory response and cognitive impairment induced by SD in germ-free (GF) mice. Transplantation of the ""SD microbiota"" into GF mice activated the Toll-like receptor 4/nuclear factor-κB signaling pathway and impaired cognitive function in the recipient mice. Mice that harbored ""SD microbiota"" also exhibited increases in neuroinflammation and microglial activity in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex. These findings indicate that gut dysbiosis contributes to both peripheral and central inflammatory processes and cognitive deficits that are induced by SD, which may open avenues for potential interventions that can relieve the detrimental consequences of sleep loss.",Molecular psychiatry,2021,Zhong Wang; Wen-Hao Chen; Su-Xia Li; Zhong-Ming He; Wei-Li Zhu; Yan-Bin Ji; Zhe Wang; Xi-Mei Zhu; Kai Yuan; Yan-Ping Bao; Le Shi; Shi-Qiu Meng; Yan-Xue Xue; Wen Xie; Jie Shi; Wei Yan; Hong Wei; Lin Lu; Ying Han
32667590,The role of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in neuropsychiatric disorders.,"The microbiota-gut-brain axis is a bidirectional signaling mechanism between the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system. The complexity of the intestinal ecosystem is extraordinary; it comprises more than 100 trillion microbial cells that inhabit the small and large intestine, and this interaction between microbiota and intestinal epithelium can cause physiological changes in the brain and influence mood and behavior. Currently, there has been an emphasis on how such interactions affect mental health. Evidence indicates that intestinal microbiota are involved in neurological and psychiatric disorders. This review covers evidence for the influence of gut microbiota on the brain and behavior in Alzheimer disease, dementia, anxiety, autism spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia. The primary focus is on the pathways involved in intestinal metabolites of microbial origin, including short-chain fatty acids, tryptophan metabolites, and bacterial components that can activate the host's immune system. We also list clinical evidence regarding prebiotics, probiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation as adjuvant therapies for neuropsychiatric disorders.","Revista brasileira de psiquiatria (Sao Paulo, Brazil : 1999)",2021,Jaqueline S Generoso; Vijayasree V Giridharan; Juneyoung Lee; Danielle Macedo; Tatiana Barichello

34758889,A fiber-deprived diet causes cognitive impairment and hippocampal microglia-mediated synaptic loss through the gut microbiota and metabolites.,"Cognitive impairment, an increasing mental health issue, is a core feature of the aging brain and neurodegenerative diseases. Industrialized nations especially, have experienced a marked decrease in dietary fiber intake, but the potential mechanism linking low fiber intake and cognitive impairment is poorly understood. Emerging research reported that the diversity of gut microbiota in Western populations is significantly reduced. However, it is unknown whether a fiber-deficient diet (which alters gut microbiota) could impair cognition and brain functional elements through the gut-brain axis.In this study, a mouse model of long-term (15 weeks) dietary fiber deficiency (FD) was used to mimic a sustained low fiber intake in humans. We found that FD mice showed impaired cognition, including deficits in object location memory, temporal order memory, and the ability to perform daily living activities. The hippocampal synaptic ultrastructure was damaged in FD mice, characterized by widened synaptic clefts and thinned postsynaptic densities. A hippocampal proteomic analysis further identified a deficit of CaMKIId and its associated synaptic proteins (including GAP43 and SV2C) in the FD mice, along with neuroinflammation and microglial engulfment of synapses. The FD mice also exhibited gut microbiota dysbiosis (decreased Bacteroidetes and increased Proteobacteria), which was significantly associated with the cognitive deficits. Of note, a rapid differentiating microbiota change was observed in the mice with a short-term FD diet (7 days) before cognitive impairment, highlighting a possible causal impact of the gut microbiota profile on cognitive outcomes. Moreover, the FD diet compromised the intestinal barrier and reduced short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production. We exploit these findings for SCFA receptor knockout mice and oral SCFA supplementation that verified SCFA playing a critical role linking the altered gut microbiota and cognitive impairment.This study, for the first time, reports that a fiber-deprived diet leads to cognitive impairment through altering the gut microbiota-hippocampal axis, which is pathologically distinct from normal brain aging. These findings alert the adverse impact of dietary fiber deficiency on brain function, and highlight an increase in fiber intake as a nutritional strategy to reduce the risk of developing diet-associated cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases.

34520319,"Sleep, circadian rhythm and gut microbiota: alterations in Alzheimer's disease and their potential links in the pathogenesis.","ABSTRATCIn recent years, emerging studies have observed gut microbiota (GM) alterations in Alzheimer's disease (AD), even in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Further, impaired sleep and circadian patterns are common symptoms of AD, while sleep and circadian rhythm disruption (SCRD) is associated with greater β-amyloid (Aβ) burden and AD risk, sometimes years before the clinical onset of AD. Moreover, reports have demonstrated that GM and its metabolites exhibit diurnal rhythmicity and the role of SCRD in dampening the GM rhythmicity and eubiosis. This review will provide an evaluation of clinical and animal studies describing GM alterations in distinct conditions, including AD, sleep and circadian disruption. It aims to identify the overlapping and distinctive GM alterations in these conditions and their contributions to pathophysiology. Although most studies are observational and use different methodologies, data indicate partial commonalities in GM alterations and unanimity at functional level. Finally, we discuss the possible interactions between SCRD and GM in AD pathogenesis, as well as several methodological improvements that are necessary for future research.",Gut microbes,2021,Yi Li; Lingzhan Shao; Yang Mou; Yan Zhang; Yong Ping

34204057,Mediterranean Diet as an Antioxidant: The Impact on Metabolic Health and Overall Wellbeing.,"It has been established, worldwide, that non-communicable diseases such as obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular events account for a high percentage of morbidity and mortality in contemporary societies. Several modifiable risk factors, such as sedentary activities, sleep deprivation, smoking, and unhealthy dietary habits have contributed to this increase. Healthy nutrition in terms of adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MD), rich in fruits, legumes, vegetables, olive oil, herbs, spices, and high fiber intake may contribute to the decrease in this pandemic. The beneficial effects of the MD can be mainly attributed to its numerous components rich in anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Moreover, the MD may further contribute to the improvement of reproductive health, modify the risk for neurodegenerative diseases, and protect against depression and psychosocial maladjustment. There is also evidence highlighting the impact of healthy nutrition in female people on the composition of the gut microbiota and future metabolic and overall health of their offspring. It is therefore important to highlight the beneficial effects of the MD on metabolic, reproductive, and mental health, while shaping the overall health of future generations. The beneficial effects of MD can be further enhanced by increased physical activity in the context of a well-balanced healthy lifestyle.",Nutrients,2021,Katherina V Gantenbein; Christina Kanaka-Gantenbein
33421542,Bipolar disorder: An evolutionary psychoneuroimmunological approach.,"Bipolar disorder is a mental health disorder characterized by extreme shifts in mood, high suicide rate, sleep problems, and dysfunction of psychological traits like self-esteem (feeling inferior when depressed and superior when manic). Bipolar disorder is rare among populations that have not adopted contemporary Western lifestyles, which supports the hypothesis that bipolar disorder results from a mismatch between Homo sapiens's evolutionary and current environments. Recent studies have connected bipolar disorder with low-grade inflammation, the malfunctioning of the internal clock, and the resulting sleep disturbances. Stress is often a triggering factor for mania and sleep problems, but stress also causes low-grade inflammation. Since inflammation desynchronizes the internal clock, chronic stress and inflammation are the primary biological mechanisms behind bipolar disorder. Chronic stress and inflammation are driven by contemporary Western lifestyles, including stressful social environments, unhealthy dietary patterns, limited physical activity, and obesity. The treatment of bipolar disorder should focus on reducing stress, stress sensitivity, and inflammation by lifestyle changes rather than just temporarily alleviating symptoms with psychopharmacological interventions.",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,2021,Markus J Rantala; Severi Luoto; Javier I Borráz-León; Indrikis Krams
34617139,A next-generation probiotic: Akkermansia muciniphila ameliorates chronic stress-induced depressive-like behavior in mice by regulating gut microbiota and metabolites.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a neurasthenic disease, which is the second-largest burden of disease globally. Increasing studies have revealed that depression is associated with abnormalities in gut microbiota and metabolites. Several species of bacteria have been classified as psychobiotics, which confer mental health benefits through interactions with commensal gut microbiota. Therefore, it is essential to identify new psychobiotics and elucidate their mechanisms in the treatment of depression. This study aims to evaluate the antidepressant effect of Akkermansia muciniphila (AKK) in a mouse model of depression induced by chronic restraint stress (CRS). C57BL/6 male mice were divided into three groups: mice subjected to CRS, mice not subjected to CRS, and mice treated with AKK for 3 weeks. Behavioral tests were performed, and hormone, neurotransmitter, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels were measured. Cecal microbiota was analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and serum metabolites were detected using untargeted metabolomics. In addition, correlations between altered gut microbiota and metabolites with significant variations in serum associated with AKK ameliorating depression were analyzed using Pearson's correlation coefficient. The results revealed that AKK significantly ameliorated depressive-like behavior and restored abnormal variations in depression-related molecular (corticosterone, dopamine, and BDNF). Moreover, AKK altered chronic stress-induced gut microbial abnormalities. Untargeted metabolomics analysis revealed 23 potential biomarkers in serum that could be associated with the mechanisms underlying CRS-induced depression and the therapeutic effects of AKK. Pearson's correlation coefficient analysis revealed that AKK predominantly upregulated β-alanyl-3-methyl-L-histidine and edaravone to relieve depression. Furthermore, β-alanyl-3-methyl-L-histidine and edaravone exhibited the antidepressant phenotype in mice subjected to CRS. In conclusion, the study demonstrated that AKK ameliorates chronic stress-induced depressive symptoms in mice by regulating gut microbiota and metabolites. KEY POINTS: • AKK reduces depressive-like behaviors induced by chronic stress. • AKK regulates the gut microbial structure and metabolomics of serum under the chronic stress. • Antidepressant effect of AKK correlates with the increase of β-alanyl-3-methyl-l-histidine and edaravone.",Applied microbiology and biotechnology,2021,Yang Ding; Fan Bu; Tuo Chen; Guoping Shi; Xiaomin Yuan; Zeyu Feng; Zhenglan Duan; Rong Wang; Sumin Zhang; Qiong Wang; Jinyong Zhou; Yugen Chen
33511258,Probiotic consumption relieved human stress and anxiety symptoms possibly via modulating the neuroactive potential of the gut microbiota.,"Stress has been shown to disturb the balance of human intestinal microbiota and subsequently causes mental health problems like anxiety and depression. Our previous study showed that ingesting the probiotic strain, <i>Lactobacillus</i> (<i>L</i>.) <i>plantarum</i> P-8, for 12 weeks could alleviate stress and anxiety of stressed adults. The current study was a follow-up work aiming to investigate the functional role of the gut metagenomes in the observed beneficial effects. The fecal metagenomes of the probiotic (n = 43) and placebo (n = 36) receivers were analyzed in depth. The gut microbiomes of the placebo group at weeks 0 and 12 showed a significantly greater Aitchison distance (<i>P</i> < 0.001) compared with the probiotic group. Meanwhile, the Shannon diversity index of the placebo group (<i>P</i> < 0.05) but not the probiotic group decreased significantly at week 12. Additionally, significantly more species-level genome bins (SGBs) of <i>Bifidobacterium adolescentis</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium longum</i>, and <i>Fecalibacterium prausnitzii</i> (<i>P</i> < 0.01) were identified in the fecal metagenomes of the probiotic group, while the abundances of SGBs representing the species <i>Roseburia faecis</i> and <i>Fusicatenibacter saccharivorans</i> decreased significantly (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Furthermore, the 12-week probiotic supplementation enhanced the diversity of neurotransmitter-synthesizing/consuming SGBs and the levels of some predicted microbial neuroactive metabolites (e.g., short-chain fatty acids, gamma-aminobutyric acid, arachidonic acid, and sphingomyelin). Our results showed a potential link between probiotic-induced gut microbiota modulation and stress/anxiety alleviation in stressed adults, supporting that the gut-brain axis was involved in relieving stress-related symptoms. The beneficial effect relied not only on microbial diversity changes but more importantly gut metagenome modulations at the SGB and functional gene levels.",Neurobiology of stress,2021,Teng Ma; Hao Jin; Lai-Yu Kwok; Zhihong Sun; Min-Tze Liong; Heping Zhang
34692176,"A Review of Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Model of Microbial, Immune and Neuropsychological Integration.","<b>Objective:</b> Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are complex chronic inflammatory disorders of the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract with uncertain etiology. IBDs comprise two idiopathic disorders: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). The aetiology, severity and progression of such disorders are still poorly understood but thought to be influenced by multiple factors (including genetic, environmental, immunological, physiological, psychological factors and gut microbiome) and their interactions. The overarching aim of this review is to evaluate the extent and nature of the interrelationship between these factors with the disease course. A broader conceptual and longitudinal framework of possible neuro-visceral integration, core microbiome analysis and immune modulation assessment may be useful in accurately documenting and characterizing the nature and temporal continuity of crosstalk between these factors and the role of their interaction (s) in IBD disease activity. Characterization of these interactions holds the promise of identifying novel diagnostic, interventions, and therapeutic strategies. <b>Material and Methods:</b> A search of published literature was conducted by exploring PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Medline Plus, CDSR library databases. Following search terms relating to key question were set for the search included: ""Inflammatory bowel diseases,"" ""gut microbiota,"" ""psychological distress and IBD,"" ""autonomic reactivity and IBD,"" ""immune modulation,"" ""chronic inflammation,"" ""gut inflammation,"" ""enteric nervous system,"" ""gut nervous system,"" ""Crohn's disease,"" ""Ulcerative colitis"", ""depression and IBD"", ""anxiety and IBD"", ""quality of life in IBD patients,"" ""relapse in IBDs,"" ""remission in IBDs,"" ""IBD disease activity,"" ""brain-gut-axis,"" ""microbial signature in IBD,"" ""validated questionnaires in IBD,"" ""IBD activity indices,"" ""IBD aetiology,"" ""IBDs and stress,"" ""epidemiology of IBDs"", ""autonomic nervous system and gut inflammation"", ""IBD and environment,"" ""genetics of IBDs,"" ""pathways of immune response in IBDs,"" ""sleep disturbances in IBD,"" ""hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA),"" ""sympatho-adrenal axis,"" ""CNS and its control of gut function"" ""mucosal immune response,"" ""commensal and pathogenic bacteria in the gut,"" ""innate and adaptive immunity."" Studies evaluating any possible associations between gut microbiome, psychological state, immune modulation, and autonomic function with IBDs were identified. Commonly cited published literatures with high quality research methodology/results and additional articles from bibliographies of recovered papers were examined and included where relevant. <b>Results:</b> Although there is a substantial literature identifying major contributing factors with IBD, there has been little attempt to integrate some factors over time and assess their interplay and relationship with IBD disease activity. Such contributing factors include genetic and environmental factors, gut microbiota composition and function, physiological factors, psychological state and gut immune response. Interdependences are evident across psychological and biological factors and IBD disease activity. Although from the available evidence, it is implausible that a single explanatory model could elucidate the interplay between such factors and the disease course as well as the sequence of the effect during the pathophysiology of IBD. <b>Conclusion:</b> Longitudinal monitoring of IBD patients and integrating data related to the contributing/risk factors including psychological state, physiological conditions, inflammatory/immune modulations, and microbiome composition/function, could help to explain how major factors associate and interrelate leading to exacerbation of symptoms and disease activity. Identifying the temporal trajectory of biological and psychosocial disturbances may also help to assess their effects and interdependence on individuals' disease status. Moreover, this allows greater insight into understanding the temporal progressions of subclinical events as potential ground for disease severity in IBD. Furthermore, understanding the interaction between these risk factors may help better interventions in controlling the disease, reducing the costs related to disease management, further implications for clinical practice and research approaches in addition to improving patients' mental health and quality of life.",Public health reviews,2021,P Tavakoli; U Vollmer-Conna; D Hadzi-Pavlovic; M C Grimm
33428888,Gut microbiota-derived vitamins - underrated powers of a multipotent ally in psychiatric health and disease.,"Despite the well-established roles of B-vitamins and their deficiencies in health and disease, there is growing evidence indicating a key role of those nutrients in functions of the central nervous system and in psychopathology. Clinical data indicate the substantial role of B-vitamins in various psychiatric disorders, including major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, autism, and dementia, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. As enzymatic cofactors, B-vitamins are involved in many physiological processes such as the metabolism of glucose, fatty acids and amino acids, metabolism of tryptophan in the kynurenine pathway, homocysteine metabolism, synthesis and metabolism of various neurotransmitters and neurohormones including serotonin, dopamine, adrenaline, acetylcholine, GABA, glutamate, D-serine, glycine, histamine and melatonin. Those vitamins are highly involved in brain energetic metabolism and respiration at the cellular level. They have a broad range of anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antioxidant and neuroprotective properties. Furthermore, some of those vitamins are involved in the regulation of permeability of the intestinal and blood-brain barriers. Despite the fact that a substantial amount of the above vitamins is acquired from various dietary sources, deficiencies are not uncommon, and it is estimated that micronutrient deficiencies affect about two billion people worldwide. The majority of gut-resident microbes and the broad range of bacteria available in fermented food, express genetic machinery enabling the synthesis and metabolism of B-vitamins and, consequently, intestinal microbiota and fermented food rich in probiotic bacteria are essential sources of B-vitamins for humans. All in all, there is growing evidence that intestinal bacteria-derived vitamins play a significant role in physiology and that dysregulation of the ""microbiota-vitamins frontier"" is related to various disorders. In this review, we will discuss the role of vitamins in mental health and explore the perspectives and potential of how gut microbiota-derived vitamins could contribute to mental health and psychiatric treatment.",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,2021,Leszek Rudzki; Trevor W Stone; Michael Maes; Błażej Misiak; Jerzy Samochowiec; Agata Szulc

The current microbial research has shifted from descriptive to mechanismal perspective, and future research using new technologies may further demonstrate the pathophysiological mechanism of association of SCI with gut microbiota, elucidate the mode of interaction of gut microbiota and hosts, and help develop personalized microbiota-targeted therapies and drugs based on microbiota or corresponding metabolites.",Life sciences,2021,Yingli Jing; Fan Bai; Yan Yu

33722869,"Bugs and Brains, the Gut and Mental Health Study: a mixed-methods study investigating microbiota composition and function in anxiety, depression and irritable bowel syndrome.","Research has highlighted relationships between the micro-organisms that inhabit our gastrointestinal tract (oral and gut microbiota) with host mood and gastrointestinal functioning. Mental health disorders and functional gastrointestinal disorders co-occur at high rates, although the mechanisms underlying these associations remain unclear. The Bugs and Brains Study aims to investigate complex relationships between anxiety/depression and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in two ways. First, its primary component will compare the gut and oral microbiota in females with anxiety/depression and/or IBS relative to controls, and investigate underlying physiological, endocrine and immune factors, as well as associations with diet and psychosocial factors. In an ancillary component, the study will also investigate gastrointestinal and mental health symptoms in a larger sample, and explore relationships with diet, exercise, oral health, substance use, medical history, early life adversity and psychosocial factors.The Bugs and Brains Study aims to recruit 160 females to the primary component: (1) 40 controls; (2) 40 participants with a depressive/anxiety disorder, but no IBS; (3) 40 participants with IBS, but no depressive/anxiety disorder and (4) 40 participants with both depressive/anxiety disorder and IBS. Participation is completed within 1 month, and involves comprehensive questionnaires, anthropometrics, a diagnostic clinical interview, collection of two saliva samples, and stool, urine and hair samples. This study aims to use a systems biology approach to characterise oral and gut microbial composition <u>and</u> function using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and nuclear MR spectroscopy. As part of the ancillary component, it will collect questionnaire data from 1000 participants aged 18-40 years, capturing mental health, gastrointestinal health, oral health, diet and psychosocial factors.Approval was granted by the University of Melbourne Human Research Ethics Committee (#1749221).

34172092,Depletion of acetate-producing bacteria from the gut microbiota facilitates cognitive impairment through the gut-brain neural mechanism in diabetic mice.,"Modification of the gut microbiota has been reported to reduce the incidence of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D). We hypothesized that the gut microbiota shifts might also have an effect on cognitive functions in T1D. Herein we used a non-absorbable antibiotic vancomycin to modify the gut microbiota in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced T1D mice and studied the impact of microbial changes on cognitive performances in T1D mice and its potential gut-brain neural mechanism.We found that vancomycin exposure disrupted the gut microbiome, altered host metabolic phenotypes, and facilitated cognitive impairment in T1D mice. Long-term acetate deficiency due to depletion of acetate-producing bacteria resulted in the reduction of synaptophysin (SYP) in the hippocampus as well as learning and memory impairments. Exogenous acetate supplement or fecal microbiota transplant recovered hippocampal SYP level in vancomycin-treated T1D mice, and this effect was attenuated by vagal inhibition or vagotomy.Our results demonstrate the protective role of microbiota metabolite acetate in cognitive functions and suggest long-term acetate deficiency as a risk factor of cognitive decline.

33777957,Brain Neurotransmitter Modulation by Gut Microbiota in Anxiety and Depression.,"Anxiety and depression are highly prevalent mental illnesses worldwide and have long been thought to be closely associated to neurotransmitter modulation. There is growing evidence indicating that changes in the composition of the gut microbiota are related to mental health including anxiety and depression. In this review, we focus on combining the intestinal microbiota with serotonergic, dopaminergic, and noradrenergic neurotransmission in brain, with special emphasis on the anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in stress-related rodent models. Therefore, we reviewed studies conducted on germ-free rodents, or in animals subjected to microbiota absence using antibiotics, as well as via the usage of probiotics. All the results strongly support that the brain neurotransmitter modulation by gut microbiota is indispensable to the physiopathology of anxiety and depression. However, a lot of work is needed to determine how gut microbiota mediated neurotransmission in human brain has any physiological significance and, if any, how it can be used in therapy. Overall, the gut microbiota provides a novel way to alter neurotransmitter modulation in the brain and treat gut-brain axis diseases, such as anxiety and depression.",Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,2021,Fei Huang; Xiaojun Wu
33918462,Gut Microbiota and Bipolar Disorder: An Overview on a Novel Biomarker for Diagnosis and Treatment.,"The gut microbiota is the set of microorganisms that colonize the gastrointestinal tract of living creatures, establishing a bidirectional symbiotic relationship that is essential for maintaining homeostasis, for their growth and digestive processes. Growing evidence supports its involvement in the intercommunication system between the gut and the brain, so that it is called the gut-brain-microbiota axis. It is involved in the regulation of the functions of the Central Nervous System (CNS), behavior, mood and anxiety and, therefore, its implication in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders. In this paper, we focused on the possible correlations between the gut microbiota and Bipolar Disorder (BD), in order to determine its role in the pathogenesis and in the clinical management of BD. Current literature supports a possible relationship between the compositional alterations of the intestinal microbiota and BD. Moreover, due to its impact on psychopharmacological treatment absorption, by acting on the composition of the microbiota beneficial effects can be obtained on BD symptoms. Finally, we discussed the potential of correcting gut microbiota alteration as a novel augmentation strategy in BD. Future studies are necessary to better clarify the relevance of gut microbiota alterations as state and disease biomarkers of BD.",International journal of molecular sciences,2021,Lorenza Lucidi; Mauro Pettorruso; Federica Vellante; Francesco Di Carlo; Franca Ceci; Maria Chiara Santovito; Ilenia Di Muzio; Michele Fornaro; Antonio Ventriglio; Carmine Tomasetti; Alessandro Valchera; Alessandro Gentile; Yong-Ku Kim; Giovanni Martinotti; Silvia Fraticelli; Massimo Di Giannantonio; Domenico De Berardis
33497754,Gut microbiota alteration and modulation in psychiatric disorders: Current evidence on fecal microbiota transplantation.,"The micro-organisms residing within the gastrointestinal tract, namely gut microbiota, form a dynamic population proper of each individual, mostly composed by bacteria which co-evolved symbiotically with human species. The advances of culture-independent techniques allowed the understanding of the multiple functions of the gut microbiota in human physiology and disease, the latter often recognising a predisposing condition in an imbalanced intestinal microbial ecosystem (dysbiosis). A complex mutual interconnection between the central nervous system (CNS), the intestine and the gut microbiota, known as ""microbiota-gut-brain axis"", has been hypothesized to play a pivotal role in maintaining central and peripheral functions, as well as mental health. Thus, dysbiosis with specific microbiota imbalances seems to be strongly associated with the onset psychiatric disorders by altering neurodevelopment, enhancing neurodegeneration, affecting behaviour and mood. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) consists of transferring the fecal matter from a donor into the gastrointestinal tract of a recipient, and it is used to quickly modulate the gut microbiota. This review focuses on the uses of FMT in psychiatric disorders. FMT has been used to induce dysbiosis and to study the disease development, or to heal dysbiosis-related mental disorders. Overall, FMT of impaired microbiota resulted effective in enhancing psychiatric-like disturbances (mainly depression and anxiety) in recipient animals, plausibly by impairing immune system, inflammatory and metabolic pathways, neurochemical processes and neuro-transmission. On the other side, preclinical and clinical data suggest that reversing or mitigating dysbiosis seems a promising strategy to restore behavioural impairments or to obtain psychiatric symptom relief. However, current evidence is limited by the lack of procedural standardization, the paucity of human studies in the vastity of psychiatric conditions and the need of a microbiota-targeted donor-recipient matching.",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,2021,Carlo Romano Settanni; Gianluca Ianiro; Stefano Bibbò; Giovanni Cammarota; Antonio Gasbarrini
34329424,Probiotics-targeting new milestones from gut health to mental health.,"Conventional probiotic food research was primarily focused on their benefits for gut health. Recently with the confirmation that the gut microbiota has a bidirectional connection with the brain, it is being proposed that modification of the microbiota can possibly extirpate neurological diseases. Development of probiotic foods and formulations for neural health benefits has garnered interest, with a renewed focus. In this context, this review discusses the evidences collected on the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of probiotics, especially during the time span of 2015-till now. Although, more clinical trials are necessary to elucidate the exact mechanism of probiotic mode of action but several of the established probiotic strains have been investigated and it appears that few of them have demonstrated their potential as 'psychobiotics'. The formulation of new psychobiotic-based therapeutics is in the spotlight. It is expected that in near future, biological effect of probiotics on neurological conditions will open up an entirely new avenue for personalized medication and healthcare in mental health, and they can be tailored according to the gut-microbiota of specific individuals.",FEMS microbiology letters,2021,Gargi Dey; Sohom Mookherjee

However, the potential for clinical translation of microbiome research for children and adolescents with psychiatric disorders is unclear. This review examined available evidence related to gut microbiota as well as the impact of probiotic supplementation on psychiatric disorders in the pediatric population reported to date.We performed a literature search for the gut microbiota in child and adolescent population (0-18 years old) with mental health disorders from July 1999 through July 2019 in several databases: ClinicalTrials.gov, Ovid EBM Reviews, Ovid Embase, Ovid Medline, Ovid PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science.A total of 7 studies met inclusion criteria consisting of randomized controlled trials and cohort studies that examined various associations between psychiatric disorders and gut microbiota in youth. Six studies examined the effects of various treatment interventions such as probiotic supplementation on microbiota composition and behaviors. One study showed an increase in prosocial behavior in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and an increase in the Lachnospiraceae family following prebiotic supplementation. Another study suggested that prebiotic supplementation increased bifidobacterial populations for ASD and healthy controls. A study evaluating infant supplementation of prebiotics showed both a decreased likelihood of developing Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or ASD and decreased gut Bifidobacterium. One study did not find significant differences in microbiome composition after micronutrient treatment.The main goal of this systematic review was to comprehensively examine and summarize the current evidence focused on the potential effect of the relationship between microbiota gut composition as well as the effects of probiotic supplementation on psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents. This is a relatively new area of research and the number of included studies is limited. More studies are needed to determine whether gut dysbiosis leads to the development and/or contributes to the severity of mental disorders or whether gut dysbiosis is a result of other processes that accompany mental disorders.A better understanding of the specific bacteria contributions, gut-brain pathways, and role in pathophysiological mechanisms in neuropsychiatric disorders in the child and adolescent populations can possibly provide alternative tools for a clinical psychiatrist.

34050205,Abnormal﻿ composition of microbiota in the gut and skin of imiquimod-treated mice.,"Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease. Although the precise etiology of psoriasis remains unclear, gut-microbiota axis might play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Here we investigated whether the composition of microbiota in the intestine and skin is altered in the imiquimod (IMQ)-treated mouse model of psoriasis. Topical application of IMQ to back skin caused significant changes in the composition of microbiota in the intestine and skin of IMQ-treated mice compared to control mice. The LEfSe algorithm identified the species Staphylococcus lentus as potential skin microbial marker for IMQ group. Furthermore, there were correlations for several microbes between the intestine and skin, suggesting a role of skin-gut-microbiota in IMQ-treated mice. Levels of succinic acid and lactic acid in feces from IMQ-treated mice were significantly higher than control mice. Moreover, the predictive functional analysis of the microbiota in the intestine and skin showed that IMQ caused alterations in several KEGG pathways. In conclusion, the current data indicated that topical application with IMQ to skin alters the composition of the microbiota in the gut and skin of host. It is likely that skin-gut microbiota axis plays a role in pathogenesis of psoriasis.",Scientific reports,2021,Hiroyo Shinno-Hashimoto; Yaeko Hashimoto; Yan Wei; Lijia Chang; Yuko Fujita; Tamaki Ishima; Hiroyuki Matsue; Kenji Hashimoto

34946184,Gut Bacteria and Neuropsychiatric Disorders.,"Bacteria in the gut microbiome plays an intrinsic part in immune activation, intestinal permeability, enteric reflex, and entero-endocrine signaling. Apart from physiological and structural changes brought about by gut bacteria on entero-epithelial cells and mucus layers, a vast number of signals generated in the gastro-intestinal tract (GIT) reaches the brain via the vagus nerve. Research on the gut-brain axis (GBA) has mostly been devoted to digestive functions and satiety. Less papers have been published on the role gut microbiota play in mood, cognitive behavior and neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism, depression and schizophrenia. Whether we will be able to fully decipher the connection between gut microbiota and mental health is debatable, especially since the gut microbiome is diverse, everchanging and highly responsive to external stimuli. Nevertheless, the more we discover about the gut microbiome and the more we learn about the GBA, the greater the chance of developing novel therapeutics, probiotics and psychobiotics to treat gastro-intestinal disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but also improve cognitive functions and prevent or treat mental disorders. In this review we focus on the influence gut bacteria and their metabolites have on neuropsychiatric disorders.",Microorganisms,2021,Leon M T Dicks; Diron Hurn; Demi Hermanus
34988495,Characterization of the gut microbiota among Veterans with unique military-related exposures and high prevalence of chronic health conditions: A United States-Veteran Microbiome Project (US-VMP) study.,"The gut microbiome is impacted by environmental exposures and has been implicated in many physical and mental health conditions, including anxiety disorders, affective disorders, and trauma- and stressor-related disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). United States (US) military Veterans are a unique population in that their military-related exposures can have consequences for both physical and mental health, but the gut microbiome of this population has been understudied. In this publication, we describe exposures, health conditions, and medication use of Veterans in the US Veteran Microbiome Project (US-VMP) and examine the associations between these characteristics and the gut microbiota. This cohort included 331 US Veterans seeking healthcare with the Veterans Health Administration who were 83% male with an average (±SD) age of 47.6 ​± ​13.4 years. The cohort displayed a high prevalence of PTSD (49.8%) and history of traumatic brain injuries (76.1%), and high current use of prescription medications (74.9%) to treat various acute and chronic conditions. We observed significant associations between the gut microbiota composition and gastroenteritis, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), bipolar disorders, symptoms of severe depression based on the Beck Depression Inventory, stimulant and opioid use disorders, beta-blockers, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor antidepressants, diabetes medications, and proton pump inhibitors. Many of the Veteran characteristics examined were associated with altered relative abundances of specific taxa. We found that PVD and cardiovascular disease were associated with lower microbiota diversity in the gut (i.e., α-diversity), while supplemental vitamin use was associated with higher α-diversity. Our study contributes novel insights as to whether the unique exposures of Veterans in this cohort correlate with gut microbiota characteristics and, in line with previous findings with other population-level studies of the microbiome, confirms associations between numerous health conditions and medications with the gut microbiome.","Brain, behavior, & immunity - health",2021,Maggie A Stanislawski; Christopher E Stamper; Kelly A Stearns-Yoder; Andrew J Hoisington; Diana P Brostow; Jeri E Forster; Teodor T Postolache; Christopher A Lowry; Lisa A Brenner
34393849,Association Between Abundance of <i>Haemophilus</i> in the Gut Microbiota and Negative Symptoms of Schizophrenia.,"Increasing evidence indicates an interaction between dysbiosis of the microbiota and the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. However, limited information is available on the specific microbial communities associated with symptoms of schizophrenia. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate gut microbiota dysbiosis and its relationship with psychopathologies in schizophrenia. We recruited 126 participants and divided them into three groups according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, criteria-acute group (patients with acute schizophrenia), remission group (patients with schizophrenia in remission), and control group (healthy controls). Psychotic symptoms were evaluated using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Microbiota compositions, diversity and community structure were evaluated using 16S rRNA sequencing. Pearson's correlation analysis was used to evaluate the association between bacterial taxa and psychotic symptoms. The beta-diversity of microbiota composition in the acute group was distinct from that in the remission and control groups (PC1 = 21.11% vs. PC2 = 12.86%, <i>P</i> = 0.021). Furthermore, Pearson's correlation analysis revealed that abundance of <i>Haemophilu</i>s was positively correlated with negative psychiatric symptoms (<i>r</i> = 0.303, <i>P</i> = 0.021), while abundance of <i>Coprococcus</i> was negatively correlated with negative psychiatric symptoms (<i>r</i> = -<i>0.285, P</i> = <i>0.025</i>). Moreover, abundance of <i>Haemophilus</i> was positively correlated with cognition (<i>r</i> = 0.428, <i>P</i> = 0.009), excitement (<i>r</i> = 0.266, <i>P</i> = 0.037), and depression (<i>r</i> = 0.295, <i>P</i> = 0.020). The study findings suggest that alterations in certain gut microbiota may interfere with psychological symptoms in schizophrenia. Our results provide evidence that may help in the development of therapeutic strategies using microbial-based targets.

33742731,Fecal microbiota transplantation ameliorates gut microbiota imbalance and intestinal barrier damage in rats with stress-induced depressive-like behavior.,"The gut-microbiota-brain axis is the most important complex and bidirectional pathway between the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system. This study investigated the potential of microbe-induced gut-to-brain signaling to modulate the effect of stress on depressive-like behavior, intestinal barrier, and neuroinflammation. Result showed that fecal microbiota transplantation increased the consumption of sucrose solutions and decreased the immobility time in forced swimming test. This treatment also increased Firmicutes and decreased Bacteroidetes and Desulfobacterota at phylum levels; reduced the loss of villi and epithelial cells; suppressed the inflammatory cell infiltration in the ileum; increased the expression of ZO-1, occludin; protected the mucosal layer function; and suppressed the high levels of inflammasomes (NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, and IL-1β) in rat brain. In summary, fecal microbiota transplantation improves the depressive-like behavior, alters the gut microbiota imbalance, and alleviates the intestinal tract inflammation, intestinal mucosa disruption, and neuroinflammation in rats induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress.",The European journal of neuroscience,2021,Jingjing Rao; Ruining Xie; Li Lin; Jian Jiang; Lei Du; Xindie Zeng; Gongying Li; Chunmei Wang; Yi Qiao
34589731,Abnormalities of the composition of the gut microbiota and short-chain fatty acids in mice after splenectomy.,"The brain-gut-microbiota axis is a complex multi-organ bidirectional signaling system between the brain and microbiota that participates in the host immune system. The spleen, as the largest immune organ in the body, has a key role in the brain-gut-microbiota axis. Here, we investigated whether splenectomy could affect depression-like phenotypes and the composition of the gut microbiota in adult mice. In behavioral tests, splenectomy did not cause depression-like behaviors in mice. Conversely, splenectomy led to significant alterations in the diversity of gut microbes compared with the findings in control (no surgery) and sham-operated mice. In an unweighted UniFrac distance analysis, the boxplots representing the splenectomy group were distant from those representing the other two groups. We found differences in abundance for several bacteria in the splenectomy group at the taxonomic level compared with the other two groups. Finally, splenectomy induced significant changes in lactic acid and n-butyric acid levels compared with those in the other groups. Interestingly, there were significant correlations between the counts of certain bacteria and lactic acid (or n-butyric acid) levels in all groups. These data suggest that splenectomy leads to an abnormal composition of the gut microbiota. It is likely that the spleen-gut-microbiota axis plays a crucial role in the composition of the gut microbiota by regulating immune homeostasis.","Brain, behavior, & immunity - health",2021,Yan Wei; Lijia Chang; Tamaki Ishima; Xiayun Wan; Li Ma; Gerile Wuyun; Yaoyu Pu; Kenji Hashimoto
34870091,Compositional and functional alterations in the oral and gut microbiota in patients with psychosis or schizophrenia: A systematic review.,"<b>Background:</b> Gut and oral microbiota are intrinsically linked to human health. Recent studies suggest a direct link with mental health through bidirectional gut-brain pathways. Emerging evidence suggests that the composition and/or function of intestinal microbiome differs in those with psychosis and schizophrenia as compared with controls. There is relatively little research on the predicted or actual functional alterations associated with the composition of oral and gut microbiota in patients with psychosis. We will perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify, evaluate and if possible, combine the published literature on compositional alterations in the oral and gut microbiota in patients with psychosis or schizophrenia compared with healthy controls. We also aim to explore the potential functional impact of any compositional changes. <b>Methods:</b> Original studies involving humans and animals using a case-control, cohort or cross-sectional design will be included. The electronic databases PsycINFO, EMBASE, Web of Science, PubMed/MEDLINE and Cochrane will be systematically searched. Quantitative analyses will be performed using random-effects meta-analyses to calculate mean difference with 95% confidence intervals. <b>Discussion:</b> Changes in microbiota composition in psychosis and schizophrenia have been correlated with alternations in brain structure and function, altered immunity, altered metabolic pathways and symptom severity. Changes have also been identified as potential biomarkers for psychosis that might aid in diagnosis.

It is becoming increasingly clear that major players in this complex system are gut bacteria. The mechanisms of signal transmission from bacteria to the brain are complex and not fully elucidated, but include neural, endocrine, immune, and metabolic pathways. It was initially demonstrated in a rodent model of depression that the gut microbiota was altered. This observation has been replicated in patients with major depression who show decreased microbial diversity. Furthermore, when rodents receive a microbiota transplant from a depressed patient their behaviour alters, as does their tryptophan metabolism and immune status. Several studies of psychobiotics (bacteria with a potential mental health benefit) have been conducted in healthy populations and in patients with depression. While some psychobiotics have shown efficacy in treating depression, other bacteria have yielded negative findings. Larger-scale, well-designed studies are required. EU-funded guidelines recommend that patients with depression or vulnerability to depression should be encouraged to enhance a plant-based diet with a high content of grains/fibres, fermented foods, and fish. A significant impact of such a diet is likely mediated through the gut microbiota.",Modern trends in psychiatry,2021,Timothy G Dinan; Mary I Butler; John F Cryan
33407119,Alterations in the intestinal microbiome and mental health status of workers in an underground tunnel environment.,"Working in an underground tunnel environment is unavoidable in professions such as miners and tunnel workers, and there is a concern about the health of these workers. Few studies have addressed alterations in the intestinal microbiome of workers within that environment.Fecal samples were collected from the workers before they entered the tunnel (baseline status, BS) and after they left the tunnel (exposed status, ES), respectively (a time period of 3 weeks between them). We analyzed 16S rRNA sequencing to show the changes in microbial composition and self-evaluation of mental health questionnaire was also performed. The results showed that Shannon and Simpson indices decreased significantly from BS to ES. A higher abundance was found in the phylum Actinobacteria, classes Actinobacteria and Deltaproteobacteria, orders Bifidobacteriales, Coriobacteriales, and Desulfovibrionales, families Bifidobacteriaceae, Peptostreptococcaceae, Coriobacteriaceae, Clostridiaceae_1, Desulfovibrionaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, and Microbacteriaceae, and genera Bifidobacterium, Romboutsia, Clostridium sensu stricto, and Leucobacter in ES, while BS showed greater levels of genera Faecalibacterium and Roseburia. The self-evaluation showed that at least one-half of the tunnel workers experienced one or more symptoms of mental distress (inattention, sleeplessness, loss of appetite, headache or dizziness, irritability) after working in the underground tunnel environment.Collectively, the underground tunnel environment led to alterations in the intestinal microbiome, which might be relevant to symptoms of mental distress in underground-tunnel workers.",BMC microbiology,2021,Zhen-Hua Lu; Yi-Wen Liu; Zhao-Hua Ji; Ting Fu; Min Yan; Zhong-Jun Shao; Yong Long
34480631,Microglial depletion and abnormalities in gut microbiota composition and short-chain fatty acids in mice after repeated administration of colony stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibitor PLX5622.,"PLX5622, a brain-penetrant highly specific inhibitor of the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), is used to eliminate microglia in the brain. Considering the role of microglia and gut microbiota in the brain homeostasis, this study was undertaken to investigate whether repeated intragastric administration of PLX5622 (65 mg/kg/day for consecutive 7 days) could affect the composition of gut microbiota and the concentration of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in fresh feces of adult mice. Repeated administration of PLX5622 caused significant reductions of the expression of genes and proteins for microglial markers in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus compared to control mice although the elimination of brain's microglia was partial. There was a significant alteration in the β-diversity of intestine microbiota in the PLX5622-treated group. Linear discriminant analysis effect size identified eight significant enriched bacteria as microbial markers for PLX5622-treated group. Repeated administration of PLX5622 affected the relative abundance of several bacteria at the genus and species levels. Furthermore, repeated administration of PLX5622 caused a significant change in lactic acid compared to control group. Interestingly, we found significant correlations between microglial markers in the brain and the relative abundance of several bacteria, suggesting microbiome-microglia crosstalk through the brain-gut axis. These data demonstrate that repeated administration of PLX5622 leads to an abnormal composition of the gut microbiota and lactic acid in adult mice. Therefore, abnormalities in the composition of gut microbiota after repeated treatment of PLX5622 should be considered for behavioral and biological functions in animals treated with CSF1R inhibitors.",European archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience,2022,Yong Yang; Tamaki Ishima; Xiayun Wan; Yan Wei; Lijia Chang; Jiancheng Zhang; Youge Qu; Kenji Hashimoto

34074025,MAIT Cells and Microbiota in Multiple Sclerosis and Other Autoimmune Diseases.,"The functions of mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells in homeostatic conditions include the interaction with the microbiota and its products, the protection of body barriers, and the mounting of a tissue-repair response to injuries or infections. Dysfunction of MAIT cells and dysbiosis occur in common chronic diseases of inflammatory, metabolic, and tumor nature. This review is aimed at analyzing the changes of MAIT cells, as well as of the microbiota, in multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune disorders. Common features of dysbiosis in these conditions are the reduced richness of microbial species and the unbalance between pro-inflammatory and immune regulatory components of the gut microbiota. The literature concerning MAIT cells in these disorders is rather complex, and sometimes not consistent. In multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune conditions, several studies have been done, or are in progress, to find correlations between intestinal permeability, dysbiosis, MAIT cell responses, and clinical biomarkers in treated and treatment-naïve patients. The final aims are to explain what activates MAIT cells in diseases not primarily infective, which interactions with the microbiota are potentially pathogenic, and their dynamics related to disease course and disease-modifying treatments.",Microorganisms,2021,Rosella Mechelli; Silvia Romano; Carmela Romano; Emanuele Morena; Maria Chiara Buscarinu; Rachele Bigi; Gianmarco Bellucci; Roberta Reniè; Giulia Pellicciari; Marco Salvetti; Giovanni Ristori
33713734,Affective disorders impact prevalence of Flavonifractor and abundance of Christensenellaceae in gut microbiota.,"Background Affective disorders (AD) have been associated with a higher prevalence of the gut Flavonifractor genus and a lower abundance of the gut Christensenellaceae family. Objective and methods By pooling two independent study samples of patients with AD (n = 176), their unaffected first-degree relatives (n = 70) and healthy controls (n = 101) we aimed to replicate and extend our prior findings of differential Flavonifractor prevalence and Christensenellaceae abundance when comparing patients with AD and healthy controls. The gut microbiota was profiled using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Results The pattern of higher prevalence of Flavonifractor and lower Centered Log-Ratio (CLR) abundance of Christensenellaceae was associated with AD. In generalized linear models the CLR abundance of Christensenellaceae was lower in patients with AD (p = 0.024), and in smokers (p = 1.9*10<sup>-4</sup>), and inversely associated with increasing waist circumference (p = 0.031). The prevalence of Flavonifractor was higher in patients with AD (p = 0.033) and in smokers (p = 0.036). No impact of psychotropic medication was found. The CLR abundance of Christensenellaceae (p = 0.041), but not the prevalence of Flavonifractor (p = 0.20) could distinguish non-smoking patients with AD from non-smoking healthy controls, whereas no such associations were found in smokers. Unaffected relatives neither differed from patients with AD nor from healthy controls. Conclusion Compared with findings in healthy controls, AD was associated with a significantly lower CLR abundance of the health-linked Christensenellaceae and a significantly higher prevalence of Flavonifractor; findings that are associated with enhanced oxidative stress and systemic low-grade inflammation. If our observations are validated in future independent studies, they support the notion that parts of aberrant gut microbiota are shared by AD and states of dysmetabolism.",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,2021,Klara Coello; Tue Haldor Hansen; Nikolaj Sørensen; Ninja Meinhard Ottesen; Kamilla Woznica Miskowiak; Oluf Pedersen; Lars Vedel Kessing; Maj Vinberg
33206326,Gut-Brain-Skin Axis in Psoriasis: A Review.,"Psoriasis is a common skin disease, with chronic inflammation and a complex etiology. It has long been recognized that chronic skin conditions and mental health disorders are often co-morbid. Thus, the concept of the gut-brain-skin axis emphasized in mental health disorders may also regulate the health of skin.The gut microbiota has been found to be the bridge between the immune system and nervous system. By leveraging clinical cases and animal models of psoriasis, an important communication pathway has been identified along the gut-brain-skin axis that is associated with the modulation of neurotransmitters from the microbiota. Furthermore, mammalian neurotransmitters, including dopamine, serotonin, or γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), can be produced and/or consumed by several types of bacteria. Other studies suggest that manipulating these neurotransmitters by bacteria may have an effect on host physiology, and the levels of neurotransmitter can be altered by microbiota-based interventions.Nonetheless, it is unknown whether or not the manipulation of neurotransmitter levels by bacteria can affect the occurrence and development of psoriasis. Notably, preliminary experiments found that oral consumption of probiotics improves the clinical symptoms in patients with psoriasis, perhaps correlated with the gut microbiome-mediated crosstalk between the immune system and the nervous system by secreting neurotransmitters in psoriasis.

33454868,Gut microbiota homeostasis restoration may become a novel therapy for breast cancer.,"Breast cancer is the most diagnosed cancer in women. It significantly impairs a patient's physical and mental health. Gut microbiota comprise the bacteria residing in a host's gastrointestinal tract. Through studies over the last decade, we now know that alterations in the composition of the gut microbiome are associated with protection against colonization by pathogens and other diseases, such as diabetes and cancer. This review focuses on how gut microbiota can affect breast cancer development through estrogen activity and discusses the types of bacteria that may be involved in the onset and the progression of breast cancer. We also describe potential therapies to curtail the risk of breast cancer by restoring gut microbiota homeostasis and reducing systemic estrogen levels. This review will further explore the relationship between intestinal microbes and breast cancer and propose a method to treat breast cancer by improving intestinal microbes. We aimed at discovering new methods to prevent or treat BC by changing intestinal microorganisms.",Investigational new drugs,2021,Zhi-Peng Feng; Hong-Yi Xin; Ze-Wei Zhang; Chen-Guang Liu; Zheng Yang; Hua You; Hong-Wu Xin
33487078,Nutrition-based interventions for mood disorders.,"<b>Introduction</b>: 'Nutritional Psychiatry' is an emerging area of research that has great potential as an adjunctive tool for the prevention and treatment of diverse neuropsychiatric disorders. Several nutrition-related aspects, such as obesity, dietary patterns, gut microbiome composition and gut permeability, bioactive food compounds, and nutrients can influence pathways implicated in the pathophysiology of mood disorders.<b>Areas covered</b>: Here, the authors review the current evidence on nutrition-mood interaction and nutrition-based treatments for the two main mood disorders, i.e., major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder.<b>Expert opinion</b>: Consistent evidence from observational studies has pointed out the association between a 'healthy' diet, generally characterized by a higher intake of fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, whole grains, and good quality sources of protein (i.e. fish and/or seafood), and decreased risk of mood disorders and the parallel association between a 'Western' diet pattern and increased risk. However, only a few clinical trials have evaluated the effect of nutritional interventions on the treatment of these conditions. The bidirectional interaction between the brain and the gut, named 'brain-gut-microbiome axis' or 'gut-brain axis', plays a key role in the link between nutrition and mood disorders. Therefore, nutrition-based strategies for gut microbiota modulation are promising fields in mood disorders.",Expert review of neurotherapeutics,2021,Lais B Martins; Jenneffer Rayane Braga Tibães; Marsal Sanches; Felice Jacka; Michael Berk; Antônio L Teixeira
34830610,Targeting the Gut Microbiome in Prader-Willi Syndrome.,"Overwhelming evidence demonstrates an important role of the gut microbiome in the development of a wide range of diseases, including obesity, metabolic disorders, and mental health symptoms. Indeed, interventions targeting the gut microbiome are being actively investigated as a therapeutic strategy to tackle these diseases. Given that obesity and mental health symptoms are both hallmarks of Prader-Willi syndrome, targeting the gut microbiome may be a promising therapeutical strategy. Only a few studies have investigated the gut microbiome in the context of Prader-Willi syndrome and assessed the efficacy of probiotic supplementation as a therapeutic strategy for this disease. Here, we review the knowledge obtained to this date regarding the gut microbiome in individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome. The limited evidence available indicate that probiotic supplementation improves some metabolic and mental health aspects, however further studies are warranted to determine whether targeting the gut microbiome may constitute a safe and efficient strategy to treat individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome.",Journal of clinical medicine,2021,Marta Ramon-Krauel; Montse Amat-Bou; Mercedes Serrano; Antonio F Martinez-Monseny; Carles Lerin
34338703,Co-supplementation of camelina oil and a prebiotic is more effective for in improving cardiometabolic risk factors and mental health in patients with NAFLD: a randomized clinical trial.,"This trial evaluated the effects of co-supplementing <i>Camelina sativa</i> oil (CSO) and a prebiotic as modulators of the gut microbiota on cardiometabolic risk factors and mental health in NAFLD patients. In all, 44 subjects with NAFLD were allocated to either an intervention (20 g d<sup>-1</sup> CSO + resistant dextrin) or a placebo (20 g d<sup>-1</sup> CSO + maltodextrin) group and received a calorie-restricted diet (-500 kcal d<sup>-1</sup>) for 12 weeks. Fasting plasma levels of gucose, insulin, hs-CRP, endotoxin, antioxidant enzyme activity, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), malondialdehyde (MDA), 8-iso-prostaglandin F2α, and uric acid were measured at the baseline and post-intervention. The depression, anxiety and stress scale (DASS) and the general health questionnaire (GHQ) were used to assess mental health. Co-supplementing CSO and resistant dextrin significantly decreased the level of insulin concentration (-0.84 μU ml<sup>-1</sup>, <i>p</i> = 0.011), HOMA-IR (-0.27, <i>p</i> = 0.021), hs-CRP (-1.25 pg ml<sup>-1</sup>, <i>p</i> = 0.023), endotoxin (-3.70 EU mL<sup>-1</sup>, <i>p</i> = 0.001), cortisol (-2.43, <i>p</i> = 0.033), GHQ (-5.03, <i>p</i> = 0.035), DASS (-9.01, <i>p</i> = 0.024), and MDA (-0.54 nmol mL<sup>-1</sup>, <i>p</i> = 0.021) and increased the levels of TAC (0.16 mmol L<sup>-1</sup>, <i>p</i> = 0.032) and superoxide dismutase (106.32 U g<sup>-1</sup> Hb, <i>p</i> = 0.45) in the intervention group compared with the placebo group. No significant changes were observed in the levels of other biomarkers.

33490703,Obesity and gut microbiome: review of potential role of probiotics.,"Obesity prevalence has increased worldwide over the years, with pandemic levels being already reached, besides to its huge economic and health impacts. The multifactorial pathogenesis of obesity partly explains the important challenge posed to health policy regarding its clinical treatment, with increasing evidences have shown that obesity and metabolic disturbances are closely linked to variations in gut microbiota (GM) function and composition. Indeed, GM play a key contribution in energy metabolism, with GM modulation being increasingly linked to changes in body weight and body mass index. In such matter, probiotics have been proposed as a promising new therapeutic strategy to treat/prevent obesity.

31685046,Shotgun metagenomics reveals both taxonomic and tryptophan pathway differences of gut microbiota in major depressive disorder patients.,"The microbiota-gut-brain axis, especially the microbial tryptophan (Trp) biosynthesis and metabolism pathway (MiTBamp), may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder (MDD). However, studies on the MiTBamp in MDD are lacking. The aim of the present study was to analyze the gut microbiota composition and the MiTBamp in MDD patients.We performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing of stool samples from 26 MDD patients and 29 healthy controls (HCs). In addition to the microbiota community and the MiTBamp analyses, we also built a classification based on the Random Forests (RF) and Boruta algorithm to identify the gut microbiota as biomarkers for MDD.The Bacteroidetes abundance was strongly reduced whereas that of Actinobacteria was significantly increased in the MDD patients compared with the abundance in the HCs. Most noteworthy, the MDD patients had increased levels of Bifidobacterium, which is commonly used as a probiotic. Four Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) orthologies (KOs) (K01817, K11358, K01626, K01667) abundances in the MiTBamp were significantly lower in the MDD group. Furthermore, we found a negative correlation between the K01626 abundance and the HAMD scores in the MDD group. Finally, RF classification at the genus level can achieve an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.890.The present findings enabled a better understanding of the changes in gut microbiota and the related Trp pathway in MDD.

33920695,Neurobiological Processes Induced by Aerobic Exercise through the Endocannabinoidome.,"Evidence suggesting the triangulation of the endocannabinoid system, exercise, and neurological health is emerging. In addition to the endocannabinoids <i>N</i>-arachidonoylethanolamine (anandamide; AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), the expanded endocannabinoid system, known as the endocannabinoidome (eCBome), appears to be an important player in this relationship. The eCBome includes several endocannabinoid-like mediators such as <i>N</i>-acylethanolamines and 2-monoacylglycerols, the enzymes involved in their biosynthesis and degradation, and the receptors they affect. This review aims to relate the functional interactions between aerobic exercise, and the molecular and cellular pathways related to endocannabinoids, in the hypothalamus, hippocampus, and the periphery, with special attention given to associations with emotional state, cognition, and mental health. Given the well-documented roles of many eCBome members in regulating stress and neurological processes, we posit that the eCBome is an important effector of exercise-induced central and peripheral adaptive mechanisms that benefit mental health. Gut microbiota imbalance, affecting the gut-brain axis and metabolism, also influences certain eCBome-modulated inflammation pathways. The integrity of the gut microbiota could thus be crucial in the onset of neuroinflammation and mental conditions. Further studies on how the modulation by exercise of the peripheral eCBome affects brain functions could reveal to be key elements in the prevention and treatment of neuropsychological disorders.",Cells,2021,Fabiola Forteza; Giada Giorgini; Frédéric Raymond
34691318,Microbial Therapeutics in Neurocognitive and Psychiatric Disorders.,"Microbial therapeutics, which include gut biotics and fecal transplantation, are interventions designed to improve the gut microbiome. Gut biotics can be considered as the administration of direct microbial populations. The delivery of this can be done through live microbial flora, certain food like fiber, microbial products (metabolites and elements) obtained through the fermentation of food products, or as genetically engineered substances, that may have therapeutic benefit on different health disorders. Dietary intervention and pharmacological supplements with gut biotics aim at correcting disruption of the gut microbiota by repopulating with beneficial microorganism leading to decrease in gut permeability, inflammation, and alteration in metabolic activities, through a variety of mechanisms of action. Our understanding of the pharmacokinetics of microbial therapeutics has improved with <i>in vitro</i> models, sampling techniques in the gut, and tools for the reliable identification of gut biotics. Evidence from human studies points out that prebiotics, probiotics and synbiotics have the potential for treating and preventing mental health disorders, whereas with paraprobiotics, proteobiotics and postbiotics, the research is limited at this point. Some animal studies point out that gut biotics can be used with conventional treatments for a synergistic effect on mental health disorders. If future research shows that there is a possibility of synergistic effect of psychotropic medications with gut biotics, then a gut biotic or nutritional prescription can be given along with psychotropics. Even though the overall safety of gut biotics seems to be good, caution is needed to watch for any known and unknown side effects as well as the need for risk benefit analysis with certain vulnerable populations. Future research is needed before wide spread use of natural and genetically engineered gut biotics. Regulatory framework for gut biotics needs to be optimized. Holistic understanding of gut dysbiosis, along with life style factors, by health care providers is necessary for the better management of these conditions. In conclusion, microbial therapeutics are a new psychotherapeutic approach which offer some hope in certain conditions like dementia and depression. Future of microbial therapeutics will be driven by well-done randomized controlled trials and longitudinal research, as well as by replication studies in human subjects.",Journal of clinical medicine research,2021,Kannayiram Alagiakrishnan; Tyler Halverson

33967849,"Effectiveness of Probiotic, Prebiotic, and Synbiotic Supplementation to Improve Perinatal Mental Health in Mothers: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.","<b>Introduction:</b> There is an emerging interest in modulating the gut microbiota to target the gut-brain axis and improve maternal mental health in the perinatal period. This systematic review evaluated the effectiveness of prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics supplementation during pregnancy to reduce the risk of maternal mental health problems in the perinatal period. <b>Methods:</b> Electronic biomedical databases and clinical trial registries were searched from database inception through August 2020 to identify randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating the effect of probiotic, prebiotic, or synbiotic supplements administered to women during pregnancy on measures of perinatal depression, anxiety, and other mental health outcomes. Study selection, risk of bias appraisal, and data extraction were independently performed by two reviewers. Pooled mean differences (MD) and odds ratios (pOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated in random-effects meta-analyses for the outcomes of interest in the review. <b>Results:</b> From 3,868 studies identified through the search strategy, three RCTs of low risk of bias involving 713 participants were included, all three testing probiotics. There were no differences between probiotics and control groups in the mean depression scores (MD -0.46; 95% CI -2.16, 1.25) at end of follow-up. Although statistical significance was not achieved, probiotics showed an advantage in the proportion of participants scoring below an established cut-off for depression (pOR 0.68; 95% CI 0.43, 1.07). Compared to placebo, probiotics in pregnancy reduced anxiety symptoms (MD -0.99; 95% CI -1.80, -0.18); however, this advantage was not translated in a reduction in the proportion of participants scoring above an established cut-off for anxiety (pOR 0.65; 95% CI 0.23, 1.85). There were no differences between probiotics and control groups in global mental health scores at end of follow-up (MD 1.09; 95% CI -2.04, 4.22). <b>Conclusion:</b> There is limited but promising evidence about the effectiveness of probiotics during pregnancy to reduce anxiety symptoms and reduce the proportion of women scoring ABOVE a cut-off depression score. There is a lack of RCT evidence supporting prebiotics and synbiotics supplementation for similar purposes in the perinatal period. More research is needed before prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics are recommended to support maternal mental health and well-being in the perinatal period. <b>Systematic Review Registration:</b> PROSPERO, CRD42019137158.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2021,Vidhi Desai; Anita L Kozyrskyj; Stuart Lau; Omolara Sanni; Liz Dennett; Jens Walter; Maria B Ospina
34603341,Consumption of Butylated Starch Alleviates the Chronic Restraint Stress-Induced Neurobehavioral and Gut Barrier Deficits Through Reshaping the Gut Microbiota.,"The beneficial effect of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) on host health has been well recognized based on the booming knowledge from gut microbiome research. The role of SCFA in influencing psychological function is highlighted in recent years but has not been fully elucidated. In this study, the SCFA-acylated starches were used to accomplish a sizeable intestine-targeted release of the SCFAs, and the neurobehavioral, immunological, and microbial effects were further investigated. Acetylated-, butylated-, and isobutylated-starch could attenuate the depression-like behaviors and excessive corticosterone production in chronically stressed mice. Butylated- starch significantly reduced the colonic permeability <i>via</i> increasing the tight junction proteins (including ZO-1, Claudin, and Occludin) gene expression and reduced the level of the inflammatory cytokines (including IL-1β and IL-6). The butylated starch's neurological and immunological benefits may be derived from the gut microbiome modifications, including normalizing the abundance of certain beneficial microbes (<i>Odoribacter</i> and <i>Oscillibacter</i>) and metabolomic pathways (<i>Tryptophan synthesis</i> and <i>Inositol degradation</i>). The present findings further validate the brain-beneficial effect of butyrate and offer novel guidance for developing novel food or dietary supplements for improving mental health.",Frontiers in immunology,2021,Peijun Tian; Huiyue Zhu; Xin Qian; Ying Chen; Zheng Wang; Jianxin Zhao; Hao Zhang; Gang Wang; Wei Chen
34970638,CUMS and dexamethasone induce depression-like phenotypes in mice by differentially altering gut microbiota and triggering macroglia activation.,"Although the link between gut microbiota and depression has been suggested, changes of gut microbiota vary largely among individuals with depression.Explore the heterogeneity of microbiota-gut-brain axis and new pathogenic characteristics in murine models of depression.Adolescent female mice were randomly divided into control (CON) group (n=10), chronic unexpected mild stress (CUMS) group (n=15) and dexamethasone (DEX) group (n=15). Mice in the DEX group were gavaged twice a day with 0.2 mg/kg of DEX for 5 weeks, whereas CON mice were given the same amount of solvent. Mice in the CUMS group were exposed to stressors. After behavioural evaluations, all mice were sacrificed for harvesting tissues and blood samples. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was conducted for measuring levels of corticosterone (CORT) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in sera, whereas levels of protein expression in colon and hippocampal tissues were examined by western blot. Faecal microbial communities were analysed by sequencing 16S rDNAs.Mice in CUMS and DEX groups exhibited severe depression-like behaviours. Compared with CON mice, CUMS-exposed mice showed a significant increase in both α and β diversity. Prevotellaceae and Desulfovibrio were enriched, whereas Bacilli were decreased in the faeces of mice in the CUMS group. DEX-treated mice had a decrease in the abundance of <i>Clostridium XVIII</i>. Levels of occludin in colon tissue of DEX-treated mice were reduced. Relative to mice in the CON and CUMS groups, DEX-treated mice contained higher serum levels of CORT and IL-1β. Compared with CON mice, mice in the DEX and CUMS groups had higher levels of IL-1β in sera and lower levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), Nestin, Synapsin-1 and P2Y12 receptor in the hippocampus.Changes of gut microbiota diversity, intestinal integrity and neuroinflammation in the brain contribute to CUMS-induced depression, whereas pathobionts and excessive immunosuppression with damaged neuronal synapses is a basis of the DEX-induced depression.",General psychiatry,2021,Jing Wu; Jinhang Li; Chhetri Gaurav; Usman Muhammad; Yantian Chen; Xueyi Li; Jinghong Chen; Zejian Wang
34238926,Gut microbiota signature in treatment-naïve attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.,"Compelling evidence supports alterations in gut microbial diversity, bacterial composition, and/or relative abundance of several bacterial taxa in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, findings for ADHD are inconsistent among studies, and specific gut microbiome signatures for the disorder remain unknown. Given that previous studies have mainly focused on the pediatric form of the disorder and involved small sample sizes, we conducted the largest study to date to compare the gastrointestinal microbiome composition in 100 medication-naïve adults with ADHD and 100 sex-matched healthy controls. We found evidence that ADHD subjects have differences in the relative abundance of several microbial taxa. At the family level, our data support a lower relative abundance of Gracilibacteraceae and higher levels of Selenomonadaceae and Veillonellaceae in adults with ADHD. In addition, the ADHD group showed higher levels of Dialister and Megamonas and lower abundance of Anaerotaenia and Gracilibacter at the genus level. All four selected genera explained 15% of the variance of ADHD, and this microbial signature achieved an overall sensitivity of 74% and a specificity of 71% for distinguishing between ADHD patients and healthy controls. We also tested whether the selected genera correlate with age, body mass index (BMI), or scores of the ADHD rating scale but found no evidence of correlation between genera relative abundance and any of the selected traits. These results are in line with recent studies supporting gut microbiome alterations in neurodevelopment disorders, but further studies are needed to elucidate the role of the gut microbiota on the ADHD across the lifespan and its contribution to the persistence of the disorder from childhood to adulthood.",Translational psychiatry,2021,Vanesa Richarte; Cristina Sánchez-Mora; Montserrat Corrales; Christian Fadeuilhe; Laura Vilar-Ribó; Lorena Arribas; Estela Garcia; Silvia Karina Rosales-Ortiz; Alejandro Arias-Vasquez; María Soler-Artigas; Marta Ribasés; Josep Antoni Ramos-Quiroga

However, the best therapeutic schedule and related mechanism on CCRA were still uncertain. Studies on blood enrichment and anti-tumor effects of combined Danggui Buxue Decoction (DBD), Fe and rhEPO based on CCRA and gut microbiota modulation were conducted in this paper. Here, CCRA model was successfully induced by subcutaneous inoculation of CT-26 and i.p. oxaliplatin, rhEPO + DBD high dosage + Fe (EDF) and rhEPO + DBD high dosage (ED) groups had the best blood enrichment effect. Attractively, EDF group also showed antitumor activity. The sequencing results of gut microbiota showed that compared to P group, the relative abundances of Lachnospiraceae and opportunistic pathogen (Odoribacter) in ED and EDF groups were decreased. Interestingly, EDF also decreased the relative abundances of cancer-related bacteria (Helicobacter, Lactococcus, Alloprevotella) and imbalance-inducing bacteria (Escherichia-Shigella and Parabacteroides) and increased the relative abundances of butyrate-producing bacteria (Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014), however, ED showed the opposite effects to EDF, this might be the reason of the smaller tumor volume in EDF group. Our findings proposed the best treatment combination of DBD, rhEPO and Fe in CCRA and provided theoretical basis and literature reference for CCRA-induced intestinal flora disorder and the regulatory mechanism of EDF.",Chinese journal of natural medicines,2021,Xu-Qin Shi; Zhen-Hua Zhu; Shi-Jun Yue; Yu-Ping Tang; Yan-Yan Chen; Zong-Jin Pu; Hui-Juan Tao; Gui-Sheng Zhou; Jin-Ao Duan
34280457,Stress gets into the belly: Early life stress and the gut microbiome.,"Research has established that stress ""gets under the skin,"" impacting neuroendocrine and neuroimmune pathways to influence risk for physical and mental health outcomes. These effects can be particularly significant for early life stress (ELS), or adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). In this review, we explore whether stress gets ""into the belly,"" that is, whether psychosocial stress affects the gut microbiome. We review animal and human research utilizing a variety of stress paradigms (acute laboratory stressors, chronic stress, stressful life events, perceived stress, ELS, in utero stress) and their impacts on the gut microbiota, with a particular focus on ELS. We also review data on dietary interventions to moderate impact of stress on the gut microbiome. Our review suggests strong evidence that acute laboratory stress, chronic stress, and ELS affect the gut microbiota in rodents, and growing evidence that perceived stress and ELS may impact the gut microbiota in humans. Emerging data also suggests, particularly in rodents, that dietary interventions such as omega-3 fatty acids and pre- and pro-biotics may buffer against the effects of stress on the gut microbiome, but more research is needed. In sum, growing evidence suggests that stress impacts not only the neuroendocrine and neuroimmune axes, but also the microbiota-gut-brain-axis, providing a pathway by which stress may get ""into the belly"" to influence health risk.",Behavioural brain research,2021,Liisa Hantsoo; Babette S Zemel

34174901,Beyond the lesion site: minocycline augments inflammation and anxiety-like behavior following SCI in rats through action on the gut microbiota.,"Minocycline is a clinically available synthetic tetracycline derivative with anti-inflammatory and antibiotic properties. The majority of studies show that minocycline can reduce tissue damage and improve functional recovery following central nervous system injuries, mainly attributed to the drug's direct anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and neuroprotective properties. Surprisingly the consequences of minocycline's antibiotic (i.e., antibacterial) effects on the gut microbiota and systemic immune response after spinal cord injury have largely been ignored despite their links to changes in mental health and immune suppression.Here, we sought to determine minocycline's effect on spinal cord injury-induced changes in the microbiota-immune axis using a cervical contusion injury in female Lewis rats. We investigated a group that received minocycline following spinal cord injury (immediately after injury for 7 days), an untreated spinal cord injury group, an untreated uninjured group, and an uninjured group that received minocycline. Plasma levels of cytokines/chemokines and fecal microbiota composition (using 16s rRNA sequencing) were monitored for 4 weeks following spinal cord injury as measures of the microbiota-immune axis. Additionally, motor recovery and anxiety-like behavior were assessed throughout the study, and microglial activation was analyzed immediately rostral to, caudal to, and at the lesion epicenter.We found that minocycline had a profound acute effect on the microbiota diversity and composition, which was paralleled by the subsequent normalization of spinal cord injury-induced suppression of cytokines/chemokines. Importantly, gut dysbiosis following spinal cord injury has been linked to the development of anxiety-like behavior, which was also decreased by minocycline. Furthermore, although minocycline attenuated spinal cord injury-induced microglial activation, it did not affect the lesion size or promote measurable motor recovery.We show that minocycline's microbiota effects precede its long-term effects on systemic cytokines and chemokines following spinal cord injury. These results provide an exciting new target of minocycline as a therapeutic for central nervous system diseases and injuries.",Journal of neuroinflammation,2021,Emma K A Schmidt; Pamela J F Raposo; Abel Torres-Espin; Keith K Fenrich; Karim Fouad
34277527,Towards Tailored Gut Microbiome-Based and Dietary Interventions for Promoting the Development and Maintenance of a Healthy Brain.,"Mental health is determined by a complex interplay between the Neurological Exposome and the Human Genome. Multiple genetic and non-genetic (exposome) factors interact early in life, modulating the risk of developing the most common complex neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), with potential long-term consequences on health. To date, the understating of the precise etiology underpinning these neurological alterations, and their clinical management pose a challenge. The crucial role played by diet and gut microbiota in brain development and functioning would indicate that modulating the gut-brain axis may help protect against the onset and progression of mental-health disorders. Some nutritional deficiencies and gut microbiota alterations have been linked to NDDs, suggesting their potential pathogenic implications. In addition, certain dietary interventions have emerged as promising alternatives or adjuvant strategies for improving the management of particular NDDs, at least in particular subsets of subjects. The gut microbiota can be a key to mediating the effects of other exposome factors such as diet on mental health, and ongoing research in Psychiatry and Neuropediatrics is developing Precision Nutrition Models to classify subjects according to a diet response prediction based on specific individual features, including microbiome signatures. Here, we review current scientific evidence for the impact of early life environmental factors, including diet, on gut microbiota and neuro-development, emphasizing the potential long-term consequences on health; and also summarize the state of the art regarding the mechanisms underlying diet and gut microbiota influence on the brain-gut axis. Furthermore, we describe the evidence supporting the key role played by gut microbiota, diet and nutrition in neurodevelopment, as well as the effectiveness of certain dietary and microbiome-based interventions aimed at preventing or treating NDDs. Finally, we emphasize the need for further research to gain greater insight into the complex interplay between diet, gut microbiome and brain development.

31859119,"Infections, antibiotic treatment and the Microbiome in relation to schizophrenia.","Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder with several potential pathophysiological mechanisms, including immune activation. Infections have been identified as a significant contributing risk factor for schizophrenia; this association is reviewed together with the potential impact of antibiotic treatment and alterations of the intestinal microbiota. Both infections and the treatment with antibiotics may alter the composition of the gut microbiota, causing dysbiosis, which in animal studies has been associated with alterations of behavior. Of the few studies that have been conducted on humans, some have suggested alterations in the microbial composition of individuals with schizophrenia compared to healthy controls, albeit with conflicting results. Recently, increased attention has emerged regarding potential adverse effects from antibiotics, as a number of these have been associated with an increased risk of psychotic episodes. Particularly, the fluoroquinolones have been associated with neurotoxic adverse events. The association between schizophrenia and infections, antibiotic treatment and dysbiosis, may be an epiphenomenon, which could be explained by other confounding factors. However, these associations could be causal and could therefore be important risk factors in a subgroup of patients. Large-scale well-matched longitudinal studies are needed with measurements of immune markers from multiple biological samples, ranging from material close to the brain, as cerebrospinal fluid and brain-scans targeting neuroinflammation, to analysis of blood and intestinal microbiota. This would help to obtain more definite results on the association between infections, immune components and microbiota alterations in relation to schizophrenia.",Schizophrenia research,2021,Amalie W Klein-Petersen; Ole Köhler-Forsberg; Michael E Benros
34650506,The Relationship Between the Gut Microbiome-Immune System-Brain Axis and Major Depressive Disorder.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prominent cause of disability worldwide. Current antidepressant drugs produce full remission in only about one-third of MDD patients and there are no biomarkers to guide physicians in selecting the best treatment for individuals. There is an urgency to learn more about the etiology of MDD and to identify new targets that will lead to improved therapy and hopefully aid in predicting and preventing MDD. There has been extensive interest in the roles of the immune system and the gut microbiome in MDD and in how these systems interact. Gut microbes can contribute to the nature of immune responses, and a chronic inflammatory state may lead to increased responsiveness to stress and to development of MDD. The gut microbiome-immune system-brain axis is bidirectional, is sensitive to stress and is important in development of stress-related disorders such as MDD. Communication between the gut and brain involves the enteric nervous system (ENS), the autonomic nervous system (ANS), neuroendocrine signaling systems and the immune system, and all of these can interact with the gut microbiota. Preclinical studies and preliminary clinical investigations have reported improved mood with administration of probiotics and prebiotics, but large, carefully controlled clinical trials are now necessary to evaluate their effectiveness in treating MDD. The roles that several gut microbe-derived molecules such as neurotransmitters, short chain fatty acids and tryptophan play in MDD are reviewed briefly. Challenges and potential future directions associated with studying this important axis as it relates to MDD are discussed.",Frontiers in neurology,2021,Jane A Foster; Glen B Baker; Serdar M Dursun

34835436,The Potential Utility of Prebiotics to Modulate Alzheimer's Disease: A Review of the Evidence.,"The gut microbiome has recently emerged as a critical modulator of brain function, with the so-called gut-brain axis having multiple links with a variety of neurodegenerative and mental health conditions, including Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Various approaches for modulating the gut microbiome toward compositional and functional states that are consistent with improved cognitive health outcomes have been documented, including probiotics and prebiotics. While probiotics are live microorganisms that directly confer beneficial health effects, prebiotics are oligosaccharide and polysaccharide structures that can beneficially modulate the gut microbiome by enhancing the growth, survival, and/or function of gut microbes that in turn have beneficial effects on the human host. In this review, we discuss evidence showing the potential link between gut microbiome composition and AD onset or development, provide an overview of prebiotic types and their roles in altering gut microbial composition, discuss the effectiveness of prebiotics in regulating gut microbiome composition and microbially derived metabolites, and discuss the current evidence linking prebiotics with health outcomes related to AD in both animal models and human trials. Though there is a paucity of human clinical trials demonstrating the effectiveness of prebiotics in altering gut microbiome-mediated health outcomes in AD, current evidence highlights the potential of various prebiotic approaches for beneficially altering the gut microbiota or gut physiology by promoting the production of butyrate, indoles, and secondary bile acid profiles that further regulate gut immunity and mucosal homeostasis, which are associated with beneficial effects on the central immune system and brain functionality.",Microorganisms,2021,Jea Woo Kang; Angela M Zivkovic
34014031,Impaired blood-brain barrier in the microbiota-gut-brain axis: Potential role of bipolar susceptibility gene TRANK1.,"Bipolar disorder (BD) is a common psychiatric illness with high prevalence and disease burden. Accumulating susceptibility genes for BD have been identified in recent years. However, the exact functions of these genes remain largely unknown. Despite its high heritability, gene and environment interaction is commonly accepted as the major contributing factor to BD pathogenesis. Intestine microbiota is increasingly recognized as a critical environmental factor for human health and diseases via the microbiota-gut-brain axis. BD individuals showed altered diversity and compositions in the commensal microbiota. In addition to pro-inflammatory factors, such as interleukin-6 and tumour necrosis factor-α, type 1 interferon signalling pathway is also modulated by specific intestinal bacterial strains. Disruption of the microbiota-gut-brain axis contributes to peripheral and central nervous system inflammation, which accounts for the BD aetiology. Administration of type 1 interferon can induce the expression of TRANK1, which is associated with elevated circulating biomarkers of the impaired blood-brain barrier in BD patients. In this review, we focus on the influence of intestine microbiota on the expression of bipolar gene TRANK1 and propose that intestine microbiota-dependent type 1 interferon signalling is sufficient to induce the over-expression of TRANK1, consequently causing the compromise of BBB integrity and facilitating the entrance of inflammatory mediators into the brain. Activated neuroinflammation eventually contributes to the occurrence and development of BD. This review provides a new perspective on how gut microbiota participate in the pathogenesis of BD. Future studies are needed to validate these assumptions and develop new treatment targets for BD.",Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,2021,Jianbo Lai; Jiajun Jiang; Peifen Zhang; Caixi Xi; Lingling Wu; Xingle Gao; Yaoyang Fu; Danhua Zhang; Yiqing Chen; Huimin Huang; Yiyi Zhu; Shaohua Hu
33467657,Mechanisms Underlying the Cognitive and Behavioural Effects of Maternal Obesity.,"The widespread consumption of 'western'-style diets along with sedentary lifestyles has led to a global epidemic of obesity. Epidemiological, clinical and preclinical evidence suggests that maternal obesity, overnutrition and unhealthy dietary patterns programs have lasting adverse effects on the physical and mental health of offspring. We review currently available preclinical and clinical evidence and summarise possible underlying neurobiological mechanisms by which maternal overnutrition may perturb offspring cognitive function, affective state and psychosocial behaviour, with a focus on (1) neuroinflammation; (2) disrupted neuronal circuities and connectivity; and (3) dysregulated brain hormones. We briefly summarise research implicating the gut microbiota in maternal obesity-induced changes to offspring behaviour. In animal models, maternal obesogenic diet consumption disrupts CNS homeostasis in offspring, which is critical for healthy neurodevelopment, by altering hypothalamic and hippocampal development and recruitment of glial cells, which subsequently dysregulates dopaminergic and serotonergic systems. The adverse effects of maternal obesogenic diets are also conferred through changes to hormones including leptin, insulin and oxytocin which interact with these brain regions and neuronal circuits. Furthermore, accumulating evidence suggests that the gut microbiome may directly and indirectly contribute to these maternal diet effects in both human and animal studies. As the specific pathways shaping abnormal behaviour in offspring in the context of maternal obesogenic diet exposure remain unknown, further investigations are needed to address this knowledge gap. Use of animal models permits investigation of changes in neuroinflammation, neurotransmitter activity and hormones across global brain network and sex differences, which could be directly and indirectly modulated by the gut microbiome.",Nutrients,2021,Kyoko Hasebe; Michael D Kendig; Margaret J Morris
34098340,Maternal prenatal gut microbiota composition predicts child behaviour.,"Murine studies demonstrate that maternal prenatal gut microbiota influences brain development and behaviour of offspring. No human study has related maternal gut microbiota to behavioural outcomes during early life. This study aimed to evaluate relationships between the prenatal faecal microbiota, prenatal diet and childhood behaviour.A sub-cohort of 213 mothers and 215 children were selected from a longitudinal pre-birth cohort. Maternal prenatal exposure measures collected during the third trimester included the faecal microbiota (generated using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing), and dietary intake. The behavioural outcome used the Childhood Behaviour Checklist at age two. Models were adjusted for prenatal diet, smoking, perceived stress, maternal age and sample batch.We found evidence that the alpha diversity of the maternal faecal microbiota during the third trimester of pregnancy predicts child internalising behaviour at two years of age (-2·74, (-4·71, -0·78), p = 0·01 (Wald test), R<sup>2</sup>=0·07). Taxa from butyrate-producing families, Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae, were more abundant in mothers of children with normative behaviour. A healthy prenatal diet indirectly related to decreased child internalising behaviours via higher alpha diversity of maternal faecal microbiota.These findings support animal studies showing that the composition of maternal prenatal gut microbiota is related to offspring brain development and behaviour. Our findings highlight the need to evaluate potential impacts of the prenatal gut microbiota on early life brain development.This study was funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia (1082307, 1147980), Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Barwon Health and Deakin University.",EBioMedicine,2021,Samantha L Dawson; Martin O'Hely; Felice N Jacka; Anne-Louise Ponsonby; Christos Symeonides; Amy Loughman; Fiona Collier; Margarita Moreno-Betancur; Peter Sly; David Burgner; Mimi L K Tang; Richard Saffery; Sarath Ranganathan; Michael A Conlon; Leonard C Harrison; Susanne Brix; Karsten Kristiansen; Peter Vuillermin; 
34290352,The change of gut microbiota in MDD patients under SSRIs treatment.,"The alterations in the gut microbiota have been reported to be correlated with the development of depression. The purpose of this study was to investigate the changes of intestinal microbiota in depressed patients after antidepressant treatment. We recruited 30 MDD patients (MDD group) and 30 healthy controls (control group). The MDD group received individualized treatment with escitalopram at a maximum dose of 20 mg/day. After depressive symptoms improved to a HAMD scale score > 50%, a fecal sample was collected again and used as the follow-up group. The differences of gut microbiota between patients and controls, the characteristics of gut microbiota under treatment and the potential differences in metabolic functions were thus investigated. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was significantly different within three groups, and the ratio of follow-up group was significantly lower than those of the other two groups. Alpha diversity was significantly higher in MDD group than those of the other groups, and the alpha diversity was not significantly different between control and follow-up groups. The beta diversity of some patients resembled participants in the control group. The metabolic function of gut microbiota after treatment was still different from that of the control group. This study suggests that the intestinal flora of depressed patients has a tendency to return to normal under escitalopram treatment.",Scientific reports,2021,Yang Shen; Xiao Yang; Gaofei Li; Jiayu Gao; Ying Liang

33045322,Targeting the microbiome-gut-brain axis for improving cognition in schizophrenia and major mood disorders: A narrative review.,"Cognitive impairment has been consistently found to be a core feature of serious mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and major mood disorders (major depression and bipolar disorder). In recent years, a great effort has been made in elucidating the biological causes of cognitive deficits and the search for new biomarkers of cognition. Microbiome and gut-brain axis (MGB) hormones have been postulated to be potential biomarkers of cognition in serious mental illnesses. The main aim of this review was to synthesize current evidence on the association of microbiome and gut-brain hormones on cognitive processes in schizophrenia and major mood disorders and the association of MGB hormones with stress and the immune system. Our review underscores the role of the MGB axis on cognitive aspects of serious mental illnesses with the potential use of agents targeting the gut microbiota as cognitive enhancers. However, the current evidence for clinical trials focused on the MGB axis as cognitive enhancers in these clinical populations is scarce. Future clinical trials using probiotics, prebiotics, antibiotics, or faecal microbiota transplantation need to consider potential mechanistic pathways such as the HPA axis, the immune system, or gut-brain axis hormones involved in appetite control and energy homeostasis.",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,2021,Miquel Bioque; Alexandre González-Rodríguez; Clemente Garcia-Rizo; Jesús Cobo; José Antonio Monreal; Judith Usall; Virginia Soria; ; Javier Labad

34348619,"Metabolomic Connections between Schizophrenia, Antipsychotic Drugs and Metabolic Syndrome: A Variety of Players.","Diagnosis of schizophrenia lacks reliable medical diagnostic tests and robust biomarkers applied to clinical practice. Schizophrenic patients undergoing treatment with antipsychotics suffer reduced life expectancy due to metabolic disarrangements that co-exist with their mental illness and predispose them to develop metabolic syndrome, which is also exacerbated by medication. Metabolomics is an emerging and potent technology able to accelerate this biomedical research.This review focus on a detailed vision of the molecular mechanisms involved both in schizophrenia and antipsychotic-induced metabolic syndrome, based on innovative metabolites that consistently change in nascent metabolic syndrome, drug-naïve, first episode psychosis and/or schizophrenic patients compared to healthy subjects. Main Lines: Supported by metabolomic approaches, although not exclusively, noteworthy variations are reported mainly through serum samples of patients and controls in several scenes: 1) alterations in fatty acids, inflammatory response indicators, amino acids and biogenic amines, biometals, and gut microbiota metabolites (schizophrenia); 2) alterations in metabolites involved in carbohydrate and gut microbiota metabolism, inflammation and oxidative stress (metabolic syndrome), some of them shared with schizophrenia; 3) alterations of cytokines secreted by adipose tissue, phosphatidylcholines, acylcarnitines, Sirtuin 1, orexin-A, and changes in microbiota composition (antipsychotic-induced metabolic syndrome).Novel insights into the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and metabolic side-effects associated with its antipsychotic treatment represent an urgent request for scientists and clinicians. Leptin, carnitines, adiponectin, insulin, or interleukin-6 represent some examples of candidate biomarkers. Cutting-edge technologies like metabolomics have the power to strengthen research for achieving preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutical solutions for schizophrenia.",Current pharmaceutical design,2021,Juan D Molina; Sonia Avila; Gabriel Rubio; Francisco López-Muñoz
33651324,Gut microbiota dysbiosis is associated with worse emotional states in HIV infection.,"The biological mechanisms underlying emotional distress in HIV infection are likely to be complex but remain understudied. We investigated whether dysbiotic signatures in the gut microbiome of persons living with HIV (PLWH) are associated with their emotional status. We retrospectively examined the gut microbiome and clinical evaluation of 129 adults (94 PLWH and 35 HIV-) enrolled at UC San Diego's HIV Neurobehavioral Research Program. A subset of participants (32 PLWH vs. 13 HIV-) underwent an emotional assessment using the NIH Toolbox Emotion Battery summarized by three composite scores (negative affect, social satisfaction, and psychological well-being). We then sequenced the 16S rDNA V3-V4 regions from stool and performed taxonomic assignment using CLC Microbial Genomics Module. The gut microbiota profiles were evaluated in relation to participants' emotional assessment. All analyses were done in R statistical software. We found that the relative abundance of aerotolerant bacteria was significantly higher in PLWH (p < 0.01) and was associated with a lifetime major depression diagnosis independently of HIV status (p = 0.05). Moreover, PLWH experienced significantly worse psychological well-being (p = 0.02), less social satisfaction (p = 0.03), and more negative affect (p = 0.02). Higher levels of aerotolerant bacteria were associated with worse psychological well-being (rho = -0.35, p = 0.02), less social satisfaction (r = - 0.42, p < 0.01), and more negative affect (rho = 0.46, p < 0.01). The association of aerotolerant bacteria with social satisfaction and negative affect was independent of HIV status (p < 0.05, for both). The over-representation of aerotolerant bacteria in the gut may reflect worse oxidative stress and barrier defects and may contribute to emotional distress during HIV infection.",Journal of neurovirology,2021,Josué Pérez-Santiago; María J Marquine; Debralee Cookson; Rafael Giraud-Colón; Robert K Heaton; Igor Grant; Ronald J Ellis; Scott L Letendre; Scott N Peterson
34485176,Altered Fecal Microbiota Composition in Older Adults With Frailty.,"Frailty is a common geriatric syndrome that is diagnosed and staged based mainly on symptoms. We aimed to evaluate frailty-related alterations of the intestinal permeability and profile fecal microbiota of healthy and frail older adults to identify microbial biomarkers of this syndrome.We collected serum and fecal samples from 94 community-dwelling older adults, along with anthropometric, medical, mental health, and lifestyle data. Serum inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and HGMB1 and the intestinal permeability biomarker zonulin were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing method was performed to determine the fecal composition of fecal microbiota. We analyzed the diversity and composition differences of the gut microbiota in the two groups and assessed the relationship between the changes in microbiota structure and clinical biomarkers.Older adults with frailty showed higher concentrations of IL-6, HGMB1, and zonulin. Although there were no statistically significant differences in the diversity index and evenness indices or species richness of fecal microbiota between the two groups, we found significant microbiota structure differences. Compared with the control group, fecal samples from the frail group had higher levels of <i>Akkermansia</i>, <i>Parabacteroides</i>, and <i>Klebsiella</i> and lower levels of the commensal genera <i>Faecalibacterium</i>, <i>Prevotella</i>, <i>Roseburia</i>, <i>Megamonas</i>, and <i>Blautia.</i> Spearman's correlation analysis showed that the intergenus interactions were more common in healthy controls than older adults with frailty. <i>Escherichia</i>/<i>Shigella</i>, <i>Pyramidobacter</i>, <i>Alistipes</i>, and <i>Akkermansia</i> were positively correlated with IL-6, while <i>Faecalibacterium</i>, <i>Prevotella</i>, and <i>Roseburia</i> were negatively correlated with IL-6. <i>Alistipes</i> were found to be positively correlated with HGMB1. <i>Akkermansia</i> and <i>Alistipes</i> were linked to the increased serum level of inflammatory factors and intestinal permeability.Frailty is associated with differences in the composition of fecal microbiota. These findings might aid in the development of probiotics or microbial-based therapies for frailty.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2021,YuShuang Xu; YiHua Wang; HeWei Li; Yong Dai; Di Chen; MengMeng Wang; Xin Jiang; ZaoZao Huang; HongLu Yu; JuanJuan Huang; ZhiFan Xiong

We aimed to systematically review studies of alterations in gut microbiota of patients suffering from psychotic disorders, bipolar disorder or depression compared to healthy controls.We systematically searched the databases CENTRAL, PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO and LILACS. Primary outcome was to compare the gut microbiota of patients suffering from psychotic disorders, bipolar disorder or depression with healthy controls.We identified 17 studies, covering 744 patients and 620 healthy controls. The most consistent microbiota changes were a tendency towards higher abundance of Actinobacteria and lower abundance of Firmicutes at the phylum level, lower abundance of Lachnospiraceae at family level and lower abundance of Faecalibacterium at genus level for the mental disorders overall. However, we found that all studies had risk of bias and that the included studies displayed great variability in methods of storage, analysis of the fecal samples, reporting of results and statistics used.Due to the many limitations of the included studies the findings should be interpreted with caution.

Animal studies have shown there are enduring psychological processes in C-section born mice. However, the long-term impact of microbiota-gut-brain axis disruptions due to birth by C-section on psychological processes in humans is unknown. Forty age matched healthy young male university students born vaginally and 36 C-section delivered male students were recruited. Participants underwent an acute stressor, the Trier social stress test (TSST), during a term-time study visit. A subset of participants also completed a study visit during the university exam period, representing a naturalistic stressor. Participants completed a battery of cognitive tests and self-report measures assessing mood, anxiety, and perceived stress. Saliva, blood, and stool samples were collected for analysis of cortisol, peripheral immune profile, and the gut microbiota. Young adults born by C-section exhibit increased psychological vulnerability to acute stress and a prolonged period of exam-related stress. They did not exhibit an altered salivary cortisol awakening response to the TSST, but their measures of positive affect were significantly lower than controls throughout the procedure. Both C-section and vaginally-delivered participants performed equally well on cognitive assessments. Most of the initial effects of delivery mode on the gut microbiome did not persist into adulthood as the gut microbiota profile showed modest changes in composition in adult vaginally-delivered and C-sectioned delivered subjects. From an immune perspective, concentrations of IL-1β and 1L-10 were higher in C-section participants.

32279681,Infant microbiota in colic: predictive associations with problem crying and subsequent child behavior.,"Infant colic is a condition of unknown cause which can result in carer distress and attachment difficulties. Recent studies have implicated the gut microbiota in infant colic, and certain probiotics have demonstrated possible efficacy. We aim to investigate whether the intestinal microbiota composition in infants with colic is associated with cry/fuss time at baseline, persistence of cry/fuss at 4-week follow-up, or child behavior at 2 years of age. Fecal samples from infants with colic (n = 118, 53% male) were analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing. After examining the alpha and beta diversity of the clinical samples, we performed a differential abundance analysis of the 16S data to look for taxa that associate with baseline and future behavior, while adjusting for potential confounding variables. In addition, we used random forest classifiers to evaluate how well baseline gut microbiota can predict future crying time. Alpha diversity of the fecal microbiota was strongly influenced by birth mode, feed type, and child gender, but did not significantly associate with crying or behavioral outcomes. Several taxa within the microbiota (including Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, Lactobacillus, and Klebsiella) associate with colic severity, and the baseline microbiota composition can predict further crying at 4 weeks with up to 65% accuracy. The combination of machine learning findings with associative relationships demonstrates the potential prognostic utility of the infant fecal microbiota in predicting subsequent infant crying problems.",Journal of developmental origins of health and disease,2021,Amy Loughman; Thomas Quinn; Monica L Nation; Amy Reichelt; Robert J Moore; Thi Thu Hao Van; Valerie Sung; Mimi L K Tang

34518605,Altered fecal microbiota composition in individuals who abuse methamphetamine.,"As a severe public health problem, methamphetamine (METH) abuse places a heavy burden on families and society. A growing amount of evidence has indicated communication between gut microbiota and the CNS in drug addiction, with associations to neural, endocrine and immune pathways. Thus, we searched for alterations in the gut microbiota and their potential effects in METH users through 16S rRNA gene sequencing. A decreased Shannon index indicated lower bacterial diversity in the METH users than in the age-matched control group. The gut microbial community composition in the METH users was also altered, including reductions in Deltaproteobacteria and Bacteroidaceae abundances and increases in Sphingomonadales, Xanthomonadales, Romboutsia and Lachnospiraceae abundances. Moreover, the Fusobacteria abundance was correlated with the duration of METH use. Enterobacteriaceae, Ruminococcaceae, Bacteroides, and Faecalibacterium had statistically significant correlations with items related to the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia and to general psychopathology in the METH users, and all have previously been reported to be altered in individuals with psychotic syndromes, especially depression. Abstraction, one of the items of the cognitive assessment, was positively related to Blautia. These findings revealed alterations in the gut microbiota of METH users, and these alterations may play a role in psychotic syndrome and cognitive impairment. Although the mechanisms behind the links between these disorders and METH abuse are unknown, the relationships may indicate similarities in the pathogenesis of psychosis induced by METH abuse and other causes, providing a new paradigm for addiction and METH use disorder treatment.",Scientific reports,2021,Yongde Yang; Xuan Yu; Xuebing Liu; Guangya Liu; Kuan Zeng; Gang Wang
34004259,Abnormalities in the composition of the gut microbiota in mice after repeated administration of DREADD ligands.,"Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) are known as genetically modified G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which can be activated by synthetic ligands such as clozapine N-oxide (CNO) and DREADD agonist 21 (compound 21: C21). The brain-gut-microbiota axis has a crucial role in bidirectional interactions between the brain and the gastrointestinal microbiota. In this study, we investigated whether repeated administration of CNO or C21 could influence the gut microbiota and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in feces of adult mice. Repeated administration of CNO or C21 as drinking water did not alter the α- and β-diversity of gut microbiota in mice compared with control mice. However, we found significant changes in relative abundance for several bacteria in the CNO (or C21) group at the taxonomic level compared to the control group. The linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) algorithm distinguished the family Prevotellaceae, the genus Anaerocolumna, the genus Prevotella, and the genus Frisingicoccus, these four specific microbial markers for the CNO group relative to the control group. In addition, the LEfSe algorithm identified the family Clostridiaceae, the genus Faecalicatena and the genus Marinisporobacter, these three bacteria of different taxonomic as potential microbial markers for the C21 group relative to the control group. In contrast, repeated administration of CNO (or C21) did not alter SCFAs in feces samples of adult mice. The data suggest that repeated administration of CNO or C21 contributes to an unusual organization of the gut microbiota in adult mice. Therefore, abnormalities in the composition of gut microbiota by repeated dosing of DREADD ligands should be taken into consideration for behavioral and biological functions in rodents treated with DREADD ligands.",Brain research bulletin,2021,Wei Guo; Xiayun Wan; Li Ma; Jiancheng Zhang; Kenji Hashimoto
33094505,Gut dysbiosis associated with the rats' responses in methamphetamine-induced conditioned place preference.,"Methamphetamine (MA) is a potent stimulant and notoriously addictive. Individuals respond to MA effects differently and thus have a varying susceptible risk of developing MA use disorder. Cumulative evidence has indicated that gut dysbiosis contributes to behavioral response to drug effects. However, the role of gut microbiota in the susceptible risk of developing MA use disorder has remained elusive. Using an MA-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) rat model, we administrated the same dose of MA to rats, which then showed distinct preferences in drug-related place, indicating their different responses to MA. From all of the MA-exposed rats, the eight with the highest CPP scores were labeled as group high CPP (H-CPP), and the eight with the lowest were labeled as group low CPP (L-CPP). By 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequencing, we found that the gut microbiota compositions differed between H-CPP and L-CPP. Specifically, Akkermansia was significantly higher in H-CPP and positively correlated with the CPP scores. Notably, H-CPP and L-CPP differed in the gut microbiota composition prior to the CPP training; Ruminococcus was the dominant phylotype in H-CPP at baseline. More importantly, rats pretreated by antibiotics showed a significantly stronger MA-induced CPP than did the controls. Our study demonstrates that the gut dysbiosis was associated with the MA-induced CPP, indicating that the gut microbiota might be important modulators for MA-induced behavior and vulnerability to MA use disorder.",Addiction biology,2021,Cheng Yang; Xiaoya Fu; Wei Hao; Xiaojun Xiang; Tieqiao Liu; Bao-Zhu Yang; Xiaojie Zhang

(R,S)-ketamine is a racemic mixture of equal amounts of (R)-ketamine (arketamine) and (S)-ketamine (esketamine). In 2019, an esketamine nasal spray from Johnson & Johnson was approved in the United States of America and Europe for treatment-resistant depression. However, an increasing number of preclinical studies show that arketamine has greater potency and longer-lasting antidepressant-like effects than esketamine in rodents, despite the lower binding affinity of arketamine for the NMDAR. In clinical trials, non-ketamine NMDAR-related compounds did not exhibit ketamine-like robust antidepressant actions in patients with depression, despite these compounds showing antidepressant-like effects in rodents. Thus, the rodent data do not necessarily translate to humans due to the complexity of human psychiatric disorders. Collectively, the available studies indicate that it is unlikely that NMDAR plays a major role in the antidepressant action of (R,S)-ketamine and its enantiomers, although the precise molecular mechanisms underlying antidepressant actions of (R,S)-ketamine and its enantiomers remain unclear. In this paper, we review recent findings on the molecular mechanisms underlying the antidepressant actions of (R,S)-ketamine and its potent enantiomer arketamine. Furthermore, we discuss the possible role of the brain-gut-microbiota axis and brain-spleen axis in stress-related psychiatric disorders and in the antidepressant-like action of arketamine.

The situation is becoming more critical as second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), to a great extent, have replaced the role of first-generation antipsychotics in managing major psychiatric disorders. Although the exact mechanisms for developing AIMD is intricate, emerging evidence has indicated the involvement of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in AIMD. SGAs treatment may change the diversity and compositions of intestinal flora (e.g., decreased abundance of Bacteroidetes and Akkermansia muciniphila, and increased Firmicutes). Short-chain fatty acids and other metabolites derived from gut microbiota, on the one hand, can regulate the activity of intestinal endocrine cells and their secretion of satiety hormones (e.g., glucagon-like peptide 1, peptide YY, cholecystokinin and ghrelin); on the other hand, can activate the vagus nerve or transport into the brain to exert a central modulation of foraging behaviors via binding to neuropeptide receptors. Interestingly, metformin, a classical antidiabetic agent, is capable of alleviating AIMD possibly by regulating the microbiota-gut-brain axis. That is, metformin can not only partially reverse the alterations of gut microbial communities due to SGAs treatment, but also play a positive role in rectifying the disturbances of peripheral and central satiety-related neuropeptides. Current evidence has indicated a promising role for metformin on ameliorating AMID, but further verifications in well-designed clinical trials are still warranted.",Bioscience trends,2021,Xiaorong Wang; Huimin Huang; Yiyi Zhu; Shaoli Li; Peifen Zhang; Jiajun Jiang; Caixi Xi; Lingling Wu; Xingle Gao; Yaoyang Fu; Danhua Zhang; Yiqing Chen; Shaohua Hu; Jianbo Lai

33895287,Manipulations of the gut microbiome alter chemotherapy-induced inflammation and behavioral side effects in female mice.,"Chemotherapy treatment is associated with acute behavioral side effects (fatigue, anorexia) that significantly reduce patient quality of life and are dose-limiting, thereby increasing mortality (Kidwell et al., 2014). Disruptions to gut homeostasis (diarrhea, constipation, microbial dysbiosis) are also observed in patients receiving chemotherapy. In non-oncological patients, facets of mental health (fatigue, anxiety, depression) correlate with alterations in the gut microbiome, suggestive of a contribution of the gut in CNS disease etiology. The potential gut-to-brain pathway is poorly understood in patients receiving chemotherapy. Our prior studies have demonstrated a correlation between chemotherapy treatment, gut changes, peripheral and central inflammation, and behavioral symptoms in mice. Here we aimed to determine the extent to which chemotherapy-associated gut manipulations modulate the behavioral and biological consequences of chemotherapy. We measured sickness behaviors, peripheral and central inflammatory mediators, and anxiety in conventional or germ-free female mice: 1) cohabitating with mice of the opposite treatment group, 2) pre-treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, or 3) given an intra-gastric gavage of gut content from chemotherapy-treated mice. In cohabitation studies, presumed coprophagia promoted body mass recovery, however strong associations with inflammation and behavior were not observed. Reduction of gut microbial alpha diversity via antibiotics did not prevent chemotherapy-associated side effects, however the relative abundances of the genera Tyzzerella, Romboutsia, and Turicibacter correlated with circulating inflammatory (IL-1β) and behavioral outcomes (lethargy, anxiety-like behavior). A gut microbiota transplant from chemotherapy-treated mice decreased central locomotion in open field testing, increased circulating CXCL1, and increased hippocampal Il6 and Tnfa in germ-free mice compared to germ-free mice that received a transplant from vehicle-treated mice. Taken together, these data provide further evidence that the gut microbiota likely contributes to the development of chemotherapy-associated side effects. This work has significant implications in the future treatment of anxiety in patients, and warrants future studies using microbe-based treatment options.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2021,C V Grant; B R Loman; M T Bailey; L M Pyter
33921293,Non-Celiac Gluten/Wheat Sensitivity: Clinical Characteristics and Microbiota and Mycobiota Composition by Response to the Gluten Challenge Test.,"The aims of this observational ""proof-of-concept"" study were to analyze the clinical/psychological characteristics and gut microbiota/mycobiota composition of individuals with suspected non-celiac gluten/wheat sensitivity (NCGS/WS) according to responses to the double-blind-placebo-controlled (DBPC) crossover gluten challenge test. Fifty individuals with suspected NCGS/WS were subjected to the DBPC challenge test; anthropometric measurements, psychometric questionnaires, and fecal samples were collected. Twenty-seven (54%) participants were gluten responsive (NCGS), and 23 were placebo responsive, with an order effect. NCGS individuals displayed a significantly lower risk of eating disorders and a higher mental health score when compared to placebo-responsive participants, confirmed by multiple logistic regression analyses (OR = 0.87; 95% CI 0.76-0.98, <i>p</i> = 0.021, and OR = 1.30; 95% CI 1.06-1.59, <i>p</i> = 0.009, respectively). Principal coordinate analyses based on microbiota composition showed a separation by the DBPC response (<i>p</i> = 0.039). For <i>Bacteroides</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.05) and <i>Parabacteroides</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.007), the frequency of amplicon sequence variants was lower, and that for <i>Blautia</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.009) and <i>Streptococcus</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.004) was higher in NCGS individuals at multiple regression analyses. No difference in the mycobiota composition was detected between the groups. In conclusion, almost half of the individuals with suspected gluten sensitivity reported symptoms with placebo; they showed lower mental health scores, increased risk for eating disorders, and a different gut microbiota composition.",Nutrients,2021,Valentina Ponzo; Ilario Ferrocino; Ilaria Goitre; Marianna Pellegrini; Mauro Bruno; Marco Astegiano; Gianni Cadario; Eleonora Castellana; Fabio Bioletto; Maria Rita Corvaglia; Patrizia Malfa; Luca Cocolin; Ezio Ghigo; Simona Bo
34869080,Altered Fecal Microbiota Correlated With Systemic Inflammation in Male Subjects With Methamphetamine Use Disorder.,"Methamphetamine use disorder (MUD) is a major public health problem worldwide with limited effective treatment options. Previous studies have reported methamphetamine-associated alterations in gut microbiota. A potential role of gut microbiota in regulating methamphetamine-induced brain dysfunction through interactions with the host immune system has been proposed, but evidence for this hypothesis is limited. The present study aimed to investigate the alterations in the fecal microbiota and explore its relationship with systemic inflammation in MUD. Fecal samples were obtained from 26 male subjects with MUD and 17 sex- and age- matched healthy controls. Fecal microbial profiles were analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing. Plasma inflammatory markers were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Associations between fecal microbiota, systemic inflammatory markers and clinical characteristics were examined by Spearman partial correlation analysis while controlling for possible confounders. Compared with healthy controls, individuals with MUD showed no difference in fecal microbial diversity, but exhibited differences in the relative abundance of several microbial taxa. At the genus level, a higher abundance of <i>Collinsella</i>, <i>Odoribacter</i> and <i>Megasphaera</i> and lower levels of <i>Faecalibacterium</i>, <i>Blautia</i>, <i>Dorea</i> and <i>Streptococcus</i> were detected in subjects with MUD. More importantly, altered fecal microbiota was found to be correlated with plasma levels of CRP, IL-2, IL-6 and IL-10. The order <i>Lactobacillales</i>, exhibiting lower abundance in participants with MUD, was positively related to the duration of methamphetamine abstinence and the plasma level of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. This study is the first to provide evidence for a link between altered fecal microbiota and systemic inflammation in MUD. Further elucidation of interactions between gut microbiota and the host immune system may be beneficial for the development of novel therapeutic approaches for MUD.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2021,Di Deng; Hang Su; Yuehong Song; Tianzhen Chen; Qianqian Sun; Haifeng Jiang; Min Zhao
34399524,"Dietary advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) increase their concentration in plasma and tissues, result in inflammation and modulate gut microbial composition in mice; evidence for reversibility.","Dietary advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) are associated with negative biological effects, possibly due to accumulation in plasma and tissues and through modulation of inflammation and gut microbiota. Whether these biological consequences are reversible by limiting dietary AGE intake is unknown.Young healthy C57BL/6 mice were fed a standard chow (n = 10) or a baked chow high AGE-diet (n = 10) (~1.8-6.9 fold increased protein-bound Nε-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML), Nε-(1-carboxyethyl)lysine (CEL), and Nδ-(5-hydro-5-methyl-4-imidazolon-2-yl)-ornithine (MG-H1)) for 10 weeks or a switch diet with baked chow for 5 weeks followed by 5 weeks of standard chow (n = 10). We assessed accumulation of AGEs in plasma, kidney, and liver and measured inflammatory markers and gut microbial composition. After 10 weeks of baked chow, a substantial panel of AGEs were increased in plasma, liver, and kidney. These increases were normalized after the switch diet. The inflammatory z-score increased after the baked chow diet. Gut microbial composition differed significantly between groups, with enriched Dubosiella spp. dominating these alterations.A high AGE-diet led to an increase of AGEs in plasma, kidney, and liver and to more inflammation and modification of the gut microbiota. These effects were reversed or discontinued by a diet lower in AGEs.","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2021,Katja C W van Dongen; Armand M A Linkens; Suzan M W Wetzels; Kristiaan Wouters; Tim Vanmierlo; Marjo P H van de Waarenburg; Jean L J M Scheijen; Willem M de Vos; Clara Belzer; Casper G Schalkwijk
34413106,Protocol for the National Nurse Health Study (NNHS): a web-based ambispective cohort study.,"The physical and mental health of nurses may significantly impact the entire medical care group and directly affect the quality of medical services. Due to the intense emotional involvement and often problematic working conditions that characterise their profession, nurses appear to be especially susceptible to a complex set of stressors with repercussions to their health. Several landmark studies of nurses have provided an abundance of evidence on risk factors that influence the health status of nurses. However, few studies have investigated the health status of nurses who work in high-intensity work environments in China. The National Nurse Health Study (NNHS) objective is to build an ambispective cohort to gather web-based information on early-life events, daily habits, occupational and environmental risk factors, and health outcomes of a specific subset of healthcare professionals of Chinese nurses.NNHS, which was developed at a tertiary hospital in Beijing, China, is a research initiative that enrolls registered nurses working at Peking University Third Hospital. A web-based self-administered system was designed to collect health-related data and link them with previous physical examination data. During the study period, participants with signed informed consent will be invited to annually repeat a similar procedure.The NNHS research protocol was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee and provides promising data that contribute to the understanding of pathophysiological links between early-life events, body composition, gut microbiota, and inflammatory and metabolic risk profiles. Moreover, the combination of a user-friendly tool with the innovative purposes of the NNHS offers a remarkable resource to test hypotheses about mechanisms of diseases, including work stress, and further plan preventive programmes in public health.The study was registered on Clinicaltrials.gov (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04572347) and the China Cohort Consortium (http://chinacohort.bjmu.edu.cn/project/102/).",BMJ open,2021,Lin Zhuo; Heli Zhang; Rongmei Geng; Panfeng Wang; Lin Zeng; Ying Che; Peng Wang; Pengfei Li; Tao Huang; Baohua Li; Siyan Zhan
34776854,Changes in the Gut Microbiome and Predicted Functional Metabolic Effects in an Australian Parkinson's Disease Cohort.,"<b>Background:</b> There has been increasing recognition of the importance of the gut microbiome in Parkinson's disease (PD), but the influence of geographic location has received little attention. The present study characterized the gut microbiota and associated changes in host metabolic pathways in an Australian cohort of people with PD (PwP). <b>Methods:</b> The study involved recruitment and assessment of 87 PwP from multiple Movement Disorders Clinics in Australia and 47 healthy controls. Illumina sequencing of the V3 and V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene was used to distinguish inter-cohort differences in gut microbiota; KEGG analysis was subsequently performed to predict functional changes in host metabolic pathways. <b>Results:</b> The current findings identified significant differences in relative abundance and diversity of microbial operational taxonomic units (OTUs), and specific bacterial taxa between PwP and control groups. Alpha diversity was significantly reduced in PwP when compared to controls. Differences were found in two phyla (Synergistetes and Proteobacteria; both increased in PwP), and five genera (C<i>olidextribacter, Intestinibacter, Kineothrix, Agathobaculum</i>, and <i>Roseburia</i>; all decreased in PwP). Within the PD cohort, there was no association identified between microbial composition and gender, constipation or use of gastrointestinal medication. Furthermore, KEGG analysis identified 15 upregulated and 11 downregulated metabolic pathways which were predicted to be significantly altered in PwP. <b>Conclusion:</b> This study provides the first comprehensive characterization of the gut microbiome and predicted functional metabolic effects in a southern hemisphere PD population, further exploring the possible mechanisms whereby the gut microbiota may exert their influence on this disease, and providing evidence for the incorporation of such data in future individualized therapeutic strategies.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2021,Jade E Kenna; Eng Guan Chua; Megan Bakeberg; Alfred Tay; Sarah McGregor; Anastazja Gorecki; Malcolm Horne; Barry Marshall; Frank L Mastaglia; Ryan S Anderton
34002020,Endocannabinoid system mediates the association between gut-microbial diversity and anhedonia/amotivation in a general population cohort.,"Anhedonia and amotivation are debilitating symptoms and represent unmet therapeutic needs in a range of clinical conditions. The gut-microbiome-endocannabinoid axis might represent a potential modifiable target for interventions. Based on results obtained from animal models, we tested the hypothesis that the endocannabinoid system mediates the association between gut-microbiome diversity and anhedonia/amotivation in a general population cohort. We used longitudinal data collected from 786 volunteer twins recruited as part the TwinsUK register. Our hypothesis was tested with a multilevel mediation model using family structure as random intercept. The model was set using alpha diversity (within-individual gut-microbial diversity) as predictor, serum and faecal levels of the endocannabinoid palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) as mediator, and anhedonia/amotivation as outcome. PEA is considered the endogenous equivalent of cannabidiol, with increased serum levels believed to have anti-depressive effects, while increased stool PEA levels, reflecting increased excretion, are believed to have opposite, detrimental, effects on mental health. We therefore expected that either reduced serum PEA or increased stool PEA would mediate the association between microbial diversity and anhedonia amotivation. Analyses were adjusted for obesity, diet, antidepressant use, sociodemographic and technical covariates. Data were imputed using multiple imputation by chained equations. Mean age was 65.2 ± 7.6; 93% of the sample were females. We found a direct, significant, association between alpha diversity and anhedonia/amotivation (β = -0.37; 95%CI: -0.71 to -0.03; P = 0.03). Faecal, but not serum, levels of the endocannabinoid palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) mediated this association: the indirect effect was significant (β = -0.13; 95%CI: -0.24 to -0.01; P = 0.03), as was the total effect (β = -0.38; 95%CI: -0.72 to -0.04; P = 0.03), whereas the direct effect of alpha diversity on anhedonia/amotivation was attenuated fully (β = -0.25; 95%CI: -0.60 to 0.09; P = 0.16). Our results suggest that gut-microbial diversity might contribute to anhedonia/amotivation via the endocannabinoid system. These findings shed light on the biological underpinnings of anhedonia/amotivation and suggest the gut microbiota-endocannabinoid axis as a promising therapeutic target in an area of unmet clinical need.",Molecular psychiatry,2021,Amedeo Minichino; Matthew A Jackson; Marta Francesconi; Claire J Steves; Cristina Menni; Philip W J Burnet; Belinda R Lennox
33807447,Changes in Gut Microbiota after a Four-Week Intervention with Vegan vs. Meat-Rich Diets in Healthy Participants: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"An essential role of the gut microbiota in health and disease is strongly suggested by recent research. The composition of the gut microbiota is modified by multiple internal and external factors, such as diet. A vegan diet is known to show beneficial health effects, yet the role of the gut microbiota is unclear. Within a 4-week, monocentric, randomized, controlled trial with a parallel group design (vegan (VD) vs. meat-rich (MD)) with 53 healthy, omnivore, normal-weight participants (62% female, mean 31 years of age), fecal samples were collected at the beginning and at the end of the trial and were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (Clinical Trial register: DRKS00011963). Alpha diversity as well as beta diversity did not differ significantly between MD and VD. Plotting of baseline and end samples emphasized a highly intra-individual microbial composition. Overall, the gut microbiota was not remarkably altered between VD and MD after the trial. <i>Coprococcus</i> was found to be increased in VD while being decreased in MD. <i>Roseburia</i> and <i>Faecalibacterium</i> were increased in MD while being decreased in VD. Importantly, changes in genera <i>Coprococcus, Roseburia</i> and <i>Faecalibacterium</i> should be subjected to intense investigation as markers for physical and mental health.",Microorganisms,2021,Eva Kohnert; Clemens Kreutz; Nadine Binder; Luciana Hannibal; Gregor Gorkiewicz; Alexander Müller; Maximilian Andreas Storz; Roman Huber; Ann-Kathrin Lederer
34589003,Gut Microbiome: A Potential Indicator for Differential Diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder and General Anxiety Disorder.,"<b>Background:</b> Major depressive disorder (MDD) and general anxiety disorder (GAD) share many common features, leading to numerous challenges in their differential diagnosis. Given the importance of the microbiota-gut-brain axis, we investigated the differences in gut microbiota between representative cases of these two diseases and sought to develop a microbiome-based approach for their differential diagnosis. <b>Methods:</b> We enrolled 23 patients with MDD, 21 with GAD, and 10 healthy subjects (healthy crowd, HC) in the present study. We used 16S rRNA gene-sequencing analysis to determine the microbial compositions of the gut microbiome based on Illumina Miseq and according to the standard protocol. <b>Results:</b> GAD showed a significant difference in microbiota richness and diversity as compared with HC. Additionally, Otu24167, Otu19140, and Otu19751 were significantly decreased in MDD relative to HC, and Otu2581 and Otu10585 were significantly increased in GAD relative to MDD. At the genus level, the abundances of <i>Sutterella</i> and <i>Fusicatenibacter</i> were significantly lower in MDD relative to HC, and the abundances of <i>Fusicatenibacter</i> and <i>Christensenellaceae</i>_R7_group were significantly lower in GAD than in HC. The abundance of <i>Sutterella</i> was significantly higher whereas that of <i>Faecalibacterium</i> was significantly lower in GAD relative to MDD. Moreover, we observed that <i>Christensenellaceae</i>_R7_group negatively correlated with the factor score (Limited to Hopelessness) and total score of HAMD-24 (<i>p</i> < 0.05), whereas <i>Fusicatenibacter</i> negatively correlated with FT4 (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Furthermore, the GAD group showed significant differences at the genus level for <i>Faecalibacterium</i>, which negatively correlated with PTC (<i>p</i> < 0.05). <b>Conclusions:</b> This study elucidated a unique gut-microbiome signature associated with MDD and GAD that could facilitate differential diagnosis and targeted therapy.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2021,Zaiquan Dong; Xiaoling Shen; Yanni Hao; Jin Li; Haoran Li; Haizheng Xu; Li Yin; Weihong Kuang
34589800,Beyond the neuro-immune interplay in depression: Could gut microbes be the missing link?,"Accumulating evidence have positioned inflammatory signaling pathways as crucial routes by which microbes inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract (the gut microbiota) communicate with the host brain to influence behavior, with impacts on mental illnesses. In this short review, an overview of inflammatory and gut microbiota status in human depression and in rodent models of the illness are provided. Next, potential inflammatory pathways mediating the communications between the gut and the brain under stressful conditions are described.

34440563,Targeting Metabolic Dysfunction for the Treatment of Mood Disorders: Review of the Evidence.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD) are often chronic with many patients not responding to available treatments. As these mood disorders are frequently associated with metabolic dysfunction, there has been increased interest in novel treatments that would target metabolic pathways. The objectives of this scoping review were to synthesize evidence on the impact on mood symptoms of lipid lowering agents and anti-diabetics drugs, while also reviewing current knowledge on the association between mood disorders and dyslipidemia or hyperglycemia. We propose that metabolic dysfunction is prevalent in both MDD and BD and it may contribute to the development of these disorders through a variety of pathophysiological processes including inflammation, brain structural changes, hormonal alterations, neurotransmitter disruptions, alteration on brain cholesterol, central insulin resistance, and changes in gut microbiota. Current evidence is conflicting on the use of statins, polyunsaturated fatty acids, thiazolidinediones, glucagon-like peptide agonists, metformin, or insulin for the treatment of MDD and BD. Given the paucity of high-quality randomized controlled trials, additional studies are needed before any of these medications can be repurposed in routine clinical practice. Future trials need to enrich patient recruitment, include evaluations of mechanism of action, and explore differential effects on specific symptom domains such as anhedonia, suicidality, and cognition.","Life (Basel, Switzerland)",2021,Brett D M Jones; Salman Farooqui; Stefan Kloiber; Muhammad Omair Husain; Benoit H Mulsant; Muhammad Ishrat Husain
34560239,Regulation of neurotoxicity in the striatum and colon of MPTP-induced Parkinson's disease mice by gut microbiome.,"Increasing evidence suggests the role of gut-microbiota-brain axis in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). The objective of this study was to examine whether repeated administration of MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) can influence the neurotoxicity in the striatum and colon, and the composition of gut microbiota and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in feces of adult mice. MPTP caused the reduction of dopamine transporter (DAT) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the striatum, and increases in phosphorylated α-synuclein (p-α-Syn) in the striatum and colon. There was a negative correlation between the expression of TH in the striatum and the expression of p-α-Syn in the colon, suggesting a role of gut-brain communication. MPTP caused abnormalities in the α- and β-diversity of gut microbiota in the mice. Furthermore, the relative abundance of the genus Faecalicatena in the MPTP-treated group was significantly lower than that of control group. Interestingly, there was a positive correlation between the genus Faecalicatena and the expression of TH in the striatum. Moreover, MPTP did not alter the levels of SCFAs in feces samples. However, there was a positive correlation between the relative abundance of the genus Faecalicatena and propionic acid. The data suggest that MPTP-induced increases in colonic p-α-Syn expression might be associated with dopaminergic neurotoxicity in the striatum via gut-microbiota-brain axis.",Brain research bulletin,2021,Jiajing Shan; Youge Qu; Siming Wang; Yan Wei; Lijia Chang; Li Ma; Kenji Hashimoto
34576833,Specific Changes in the Mammalian Gut Microbiome as a Biomarker for Oxytocin-Induced Behavioral Changes.,"Prolonged exposure to psychiatric pharmacological agents is often associated with marked gastrointestinal phenomena, including changes in food intake, bowel motility, gastric emptying, and transit time. Those changes are reflected in the gut microbiota composition of the patient and can, therefore, be objectively measured. This is in contrast to the standard psychiatric evaluation of patients, which includes symptoms that are subjectively assessed (i.e., mood, anxiety level, perception, thought disorders, etc.). The association between a drug's effect on the microbiota and psychiatric symptoms may allow for quantifiable surrogate markers of treatment effectiveness. Changes in the levels of specific drug-sensitive bacterial species can, thus, potentially serve as biomarkers for the intake and effectiveness of psychiatric drugs. Here, we show substantial microbiota changes that were associated with oxytocin administration and the decreased anxiety/depression-like behaviors it conferred in a rat model of corticosterone-induced stress. Compared with oxytocin, citalopram produced more minor effects on the rats' microbiota. Alterations in the gut microbiota may, therefore, reflect the consumption and effectiveness of some psychiatric drugs.",Microorganisms,2021,Itzhak Dangoor; Dušanka Stanić; Leah Reshef; Vesna Pešić; Uri Gophna
33664475,Sialylated human milk oligosaccharides program cognitive development through a non-genomic transmission mode.,"Breastmilk contains bioactive molecules essential for brain and cognitive development. While sialylated human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) have been implicated in phenotypic programming, their selective role and underlying mechanisms remained elusive. Here, we investigated the long-term consequences of a selective lactational deprivation of a specific sialylated HMO in mice. We capitalized on a knock-out (KO) mouse model (B6.129-St6gal1<sup>tm2Jxm</sup>/J) lacking the gene responsible for the synthesis of sialyl(alpha2,6)lactose (6'SL), one of the two sources of sialic acid (Neu5Ac) to the lactating offspring. Neu5Ac is involved in the formation of brain structures sustaining cognition. To deprive lactating offspring of 6'SL, we cross-fostered newborn wild-type (WT) pups to KO dams, which provide 6'SL-deficient milk. To test whether lactational 6'SL deprivation affects cognitive capabilities in adulthood, we assessed attention, perseveration, and memory. To detail the associated endophenotypes, we investigated hippocampal electrophysiology, plasma metabolomics, and gut microbiota composition. To investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms, we assessed gene expression (at eye-opening and in adulthood) in two brain regions mediating executive functions and memory (hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, PFC). Compared to control mice, WT offspring deprived of 6'SL during lactation exhibited consistent alterations in all cognitive functions addressed, hippocampal electrophysiology, and in pathways regulating the serotonergic system (identified through gut microbiota and plasma metabolomics). These were associated with a site- (PFC) and time-specific (eye-opening) reduced expression of genes involved in central nervous system development. Our data suggest that 6'SL in maternal milk adjusts cognitive development through a short-term upregulation of genes modulating neuronal patterning in the PFC.",Molecular psychiatry,2021,Jonas Hauser; Edoardo Pisa; Alejandro Arias Vásquez; Flavio Tomasi; Alice Traversa; Valentina Chiodi; Francois-Pierre Martin; Norbert Sprenger; Oksana Lukjancenko; Alix Zollinger; Sylviane Metairon; Nora Schneider; Pascal Steiner; Alberto Martire; Viviana Caputo; Simone Macrì

Fifteen gut microbial compositions were the key microbial taxonomic compositions responsible for the differences between the V.SCZ and NV.SCZ groups, including five enriched microbial taxonomic compositions (p_Bacteroidetes, c_Bacteroidia, o_Bacteroidales, f_Prevotellaceae, s_Bacteroides_uniformis), and ten impoverished microbial taxonomic compositions (p_Actinobacteria, c_unidentified_Actinobacteria, o_Bifidobacteriales, f_ Enterococcaceae, f_Veillonellaceae, f_Bifidobacteriaceae, g_Enterococcus, g_Candidatus_Saccharimonas, g_Bifidobacterium, and s_Bifidobacterium_pseudocatenulatum). This study profiled the differences of gut microbiota between schizophrenia patients with violence and without violence. These results could enrich the etiological understanding of violence in schizophrenia and might be helpful to violence management in the future.",International journal of legal medicine,2021,Xiacan Chen; Jiajun Xu; Hongren Wang; Jiaguo Luo; Zheng Wang; Gang Chen; Dan Jiang; Ruochen Cao; Haolan Huang; Dan Luo; Xiao Xiao; Junmei Hu
33677218,Fecal microbiota transplantation ameliorates stress-induced depression-like behaviors associated with the inhibition of glial and NLRP3 inflammasome in rat brain.,"Evidence from previous studies has demonstrated that the gut-microbiota-brain axis is vital in regulating of behavior and neuroinflammation in the central nervous system. Considering the putative connection among gut microbiota, neural function, and behavior, the present study investigated the potential signaling of gut microbiota to modulate depression-like behaviors and neuroinflammation.Rats showing depression-like behaviors induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress received fecal microbiota treatment or vehicle for 14 days, and alterations in behavior and neuroinflammation were assessed. ELISA, immunofluorescence staining and Western blot were used to analysis the activation of glial cells and NLRP3 inflammasome.Treatment with fecal microbiota transplantation ameliorated depression-like behaviors. 5-Hydroxytryptamine decreased in the chronic unpredictable mild stress rat model but significantly increased after fecal microbiota transplantation. The treatment with fecal microbiota transplantation decreased the production of IL-1β and TNF-α. Moreover, fecal microbiota transplantation administration suppressed the activation of Iba1 positive microglia cells and GFAP positive astrocytes cells and reduced the expression of NLRP3, ASC, Caspase-1, and IL-1β pathway in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus.Fecal microbiota transplantation can improve depression-like behaviors induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress. The anti-depression effects of fecal microbiota transplantation were associated with the suppressed activation of glial cells and NLRP3 inflammasome in the brain.",Journal of psychiatric research,2021,Jingjing Rao; Yi Qiao; Ruining Xie; Li Lin; Jian Jiang; Chunmei Wang; Gongying Li
33508544,Transcriptional markers of excitation-inhibition balance in germ-free mice show region-specific dysregulation and rescue after bacterial colonization.,"Studies of germ-free (GF) mice demonstrate that gut microbiota can influence behaviour by modulating neurochemical pathways in the brain, and that bacterial colonization normalizes behavioural deficits in GF-mice. Since disrupted GABAergic and glutamatergic signaling are reported in mood disorders, this study investigated the effect of gut microbiota manipulations on EIB-relevant gene expression in the brain.GF Swiss-Webster mice were colonized with E. coli JM83, complex microbiota (specific-pathogen-free; SPF), or no microbiota, and compared with controls (n = 6/group). 21 synaptic genes representing GABAergic, glutamatergic, BDNF, and astrocytic functions were measured in the hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex using quantitative PCR. Gene co-expression analysis was used to identify gene modules related to colonization status, and compared by permutation analysis. Gene expression profiles were compared to existing post-mortem cohorts of depressed subjects (n = 28 cases vs 28 controls).Region-specific alterations in gene expression were observed in GF-mice compared to controls. 58% of all genes (14/24) altered in GF-mice were normalized following SPF-colonization. GF-mice displayed disorganization of gene co-expression networks in all three brain regions (hippocampus, p = 0.0003; amygdala, p = 0.0012; mPFC, p = 0.0069), which was restored by SPF colonization in hippocampus (p v.s. GF = 0.0003, p v.s. control = 0.60). The hippocampal gene expression profile in GF-mice was significantly correlated with that in human depression (ρ = 0.51, p = 0.027), and this correlation was not observed after colonization.Together, we show that the absence of gut microbiota disrupts the expression of EIB-relevant genes in mice, and colonization restores EIB-relevant expression, in ways that are relevant to human depression.",Journal of psychiatric research,2021,Vivek Philip; Dwight F Newton; Hyunjung Oh; Stephen M Collins; Premysl Bercik; Etienne Sibille
34311029,Fatty acids and beyond: Age and Alzheimer's disease related changes in lipids reveal the neuro-nutraceutical potential of lipids in cognition.,"Lipids are essential in maintaining brain function, and lipid profiles have been reported to be altered in aged and Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains as compared to healthy mature brains. Both age and AD share common metabolic hallmarks such as increased oxidative stress and perturbed metabolic function, and age remains the most strongly correlated risk factor for AD, a neurodegenerative disease. A major accompanying pathological symptom of these conditions is cognitive impairment, which is linked with changes in lipid metabolism. Thus, nutraceuticals that affect brain lipid metabolism or lipid levels as a whole have the potential to ameliorate cognitive decline. Lipid analyses and lipidomic studies reveal changes in specific lipid types with aging and AD, which can identify potential lipid-based nutraceuticals to restore the brain to a healthy lipid phenotype. The brain lipid profile can be influenced directly with dietary administration of lipids themselves, although because of synergistic effects of nutrients it may be more useful to consider a multi-component diet rather than single nutrient supplementation. Gut microbiota also serve as a source of beneficial lipids, and the value of treatments that manipulate the composition of gut microbiome should not be ignored. Lastly, instead of direct supplementation, compounds that affect pathways involved with lipid metabolism should also be considered as a way of manipulating lipid levels to improve cognition. In this review, we briefly discuss the role of lipids in the brain, the changing lipid profile in AD, current research on lipid-based nutraceuticals and their therapeutic potential to combat cognitive impairment.",Neurochemistry international,2021,Kei-Lin Murata Ooi; Kristina Vacy; Wah Chin Boon
34895297,The Moo'D Study: protocol for a randomised controlled trial of A2 beta-casein only versus conventional dairy products in women with low mood.,"Beta-casein is a major protein in cow's milk, of which A1 and A2 are the most frequent variants. Recent evidence implicates A1 beta-casein consumption in mechanisms that are of potential importance to mental health, yet its possible effects on psychological endpoints remains unknown. The primary aim of the study is to evaluate the comparative effects of consumption of dairy products containing A2 beta-casein versus conventional dairy (i.e. containing both A1 and A2 beta-casein) on symptoms of psychological distress in women with low mood.'The Moo'D Study' is a 16-week, superiority, 1:1 parallel group, triple-blinded, randomised controlled trial. Ninety women with low mood (Patient Health Questionnaire score ≥ 5) will be randomised to consume either A2 beta-casein only or conventional dairy products. The primary outcome, symptoms of psychological distress, will be measured by the 21-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale. Secondary outcomes will include symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress, severity of low mood, cognition, gut microbiota composition, gut symptomatology, markers of immune function, gut inflammation, systemic metabolites, endothelial integrity and oxidative stress, body composition, perceived wellbeing, sleep, quality of life, resource use and cost-effectiveness.This study will advance our understanding of the possible impact of milk proteins on psychological distress in women as well as elucidate mechanisms underpinning any association. Given dairy products form a substantial component of traditional and Western diets, the implications of these findings are likely to be of clinical and public health importance.The trial protocol has been prospectively registered with the Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN12618002023235 .

34147969,Ingestion of Faecalibaculum rodentium causes depression-like phenotypes in resilient Ephx2 knock-out mice: A role of brain-gut-microbiota axis via the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve.,"The brain-gut-microbiota axis plays a crucial role in the bidirectional interactions between the brain and the gut. Soluble epoxide hydrolase (coded by the Ephx2 gene) plays an important role in inflammation, which has been implicated in stress-related depression. Ephx2 knock-out (KO) mice exposed to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) did not show depression-like behaviors, indicating stress resilience. Here we examined whether the brain-gut-microbiota axis influences the resilience in Ephx2 KO mice.Effects of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from CSDS-susceptible (or control) mice in wild-type (WT) mice and Ephx2 KO mice treated with an antibiotic cocktail (ABX) were investigated. Behavioral, biochemical tests and 16S ribosome RNA analysis were performed.FMT from CSDS-susceptible mice produced anhedonia-like behavior in ABX-treated WT and Ephx2 KO mice. The 16S ribosome RNA analysis showed that Faecalibaculum rodentium (F. rodentium) may be responsible for the observed anhedonia-like behavior following FMT from CSDS-susceptible mice. Ingestion of F. rodentium for 14 days produced depression- and anhedonia-like behaviors, higher blood levels of interleukin-6, and reduced expression of synaptic proteins in the prefrontal cortex of ABX-treated Ephx2 KO mice. Furthermore, subdiaphragmatic vagotomy blocked the development of these behavioral abnormalities after ingestion of F. rodentium.Detailed mechanisms are unclear.These findings suggest that F. rodentium might contribute to the conversion of resilient Ephx2 KO mice into KO mice with depression-like phenotypes. The brain-gut-microbiota axis via the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve plays a crucial role in susceptibility and resilience to stress.",Journal of affective disorders,2021,Siming Wang; Tamaki Ishima; Youge Qu; Jiajing Shan; Lijia Chang; Yan Wei; Jiancheng Zhang; Yaoyu Pu; Yuko Fujita; Yunfei Tan; Xingming Wang; Li Ma; Xiayun Wan; Bruce D Hammock; Kenji Hashimoto
34474339,Lycium barbarum polysaccharide attenuates emotional injury of offspring elicited by prenatal chronic stress in rats via regulation of gut microbiota.,"Stress during pregnancy is not only detrimental to a woman's own physical and mental health, but can also cause changes in the intrauterine environment and even have an impact on later growth and development, this study was designed to understand the changes of gut microbiota in the maternal and offspring caused by prenatal chronic stress, and to explore the regulatory effect of LBP on gut microbiota, and then to improve the emotional damage caused by prenatal chronic stress in the offspring. A rat model of prenatal chronic stress was made and used LBP to intervene by gavage. Fresh feces of offspring were collected, the concentration of microbial metabolites were tested by ELISA. Illumina MiSeqPE300 sequencing technology was used to determine the sequence of 16S rRNA V3-V4 of microorganisms. On the PND 42, the emotional function of offspring were tested by open-field test (OFT), sucrose preference test (SPT) and tail of suspend test (TST). Results indicated that stress factors increased the plasma corticosterone level of rats during pregnancy and they appeared depressive behaviors. The body weight of offspring during prenatal chronic stress was lower than the control group, and the plasma corticosterone level was increased. Prenatal chronic stress had a significant impact on emotional performance of the offspring on OFT, SPT and TST. Alpha diversity of gut microbiota and microbiota composition in offspring of prenatal chronic stress was attenuated and some relationships existed between these parameters. LBP treatment reduced offspring's plasma corticosterone level and improved their body weight, changed the emotional function, increased the diversity of gut microbiota. Collectively, these findings disclose that prenatal chronic stress not only causes emotional injury on the offspring, but also changes the gut microbiota of the mother and offspring; LBP may regulate the intestinal flora of the mother, then reducing the influence of stress factors on the emotional injury of offspring.",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2021,Feng Zhao; Suzhen Guan; Youjuan Fu; Kai Wang; Zhihong Liu; Tzi Bun Ng

Gut microbiota could produce gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) that could modulate the gut-brain axis response<i>.</i> Jianpi Jieyu (JPJY) decoction, a traditional Chinese formula, is mainly composed of <i>Astragalus membranaxeus</i> and Radix <i>Pseudostellariae</i>. Although the JPJY decoction has been used to treat the depression in China, the potential action of its antidepressant has not been well understood. Thus this study was aim to investigate the role of JPJY improve gut microbiota homeostasis in the chronic stress induced depressive mice. <b>Methods:</b> The antidepressant effect of JPJY on chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) mice was evaluated by using sucrose preference test, tail suspension test and forced swim test. Fatigue-like behaviors were evaluated using degree of redness, grip strength test, and exhaustive swimming test. The new object recognition test was used to evaluate cognition performance. Fecal samples were collected and taxonomical analysis of intestinal microbial distribution was conducted with 16S rDNA. Serum level of GABA was measured using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The expression of GluR1 and p-Tau protein in the hippocampus was determined using Western blotting. <b>Results:</b> The dose of 9.2 g/kg JPJY produced antidepressant-like effects. JPJY and its major components also modulated gut microbiota diversity in the CUMS mice. Serum level of GABA and the expressions of hippocampal GluR1 and p-Tau were reversed after the administration of JPJY in CUMS mice. <b>Conclusion:</b> JPJY regulates gut microbiota to produce antidepressant-like effect and improve cognition deficit in depressive mice while its molecular mechanism possibly be enhanced NR1 and Tau expression in hippocampus and increased GABA in serum.",Frontiers in pharmacology,2021,Lanying Liu; Zhilu Zou; Jiangwei Yang; Xiaoqi Li; Boran Zhu; Hailou Zhang; Yan Sun; Yuxuan Zhang; Zhang-Jin Zhang; Wei Wang
33936013,"GABA Production by Human Intestinal <i>Bacteroides</i> spp.: Prevalence, Regulation, and Role in Acid Stress Tolerance.","The high neuroactive potential of metabolites produced by gut microbes has gained traction over the last few years, with metagenomic-based studies suggesting an important role of microbiota-derived γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in modulating mental health. Emerging evidence has revealed the presence of the glutamate decarboxylase (GAD)-encoding gene, a key enzyme to produce GABA, in the prominent human intestinal genus <i>Bacteroides</i>. Here, we investigated GABA production by <i>Bacteroides</i> in culture and metabolic assays combined with comparative genomics and phylogenetics. A total of 961 <i>Bacteroides</i> genomes were analyzed <i>in silico</i> and 17 metabolically and genetically diverse human intestinal isolates representing 11 species were screened <i>in vitro</i>. Using the model organism <i>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</i> DSM 2079, we determined GABA production kinetics, its impact on milieu pH, and we assessed its role in mitigating acid-induced cellular damage. We showed that the GAD-system consists of at least four highly conserved genes encoding a GAD, a glutaminase, a glutamate/GABA antiporter, and a potassium channel. We demonstrated a high prevalence of the GAD-system among <i>Bacteroides</i> with 90% of all <i>Bacteroides</i> genomes (96% in human gut isolates only) harboring all genes of the GAD-system and 16 intestinal <i>Bacteroides</i> strains producing GABA <i>in vitro</i> (ranging from 0.09 to 60.84 mM). We identified glutamate and glutamine as precursors of GABA production, showed that the production is regulated by pH, and that the GAD-system acts as a protective mechanism against acid stress in <i>Bacteroides</i>, mitigating cell death and preserving metabolic activity. Our data also indicate that the GAD-system might represent the only amino acid-dependent acid tolerance system in <i>Bacteroides</i>. Altogether, our results suggest an important contribution of <i>Bacteroides</i> in the regulation of the GABAergic system in the human gut.",Frontiers in microbiology,2021,Nize Otaru; Kun Ye; Denisa Mujezinovic; Laura Berchtold; Florentin Constancias; Fabián A Cornejo; Adam Krzystek; Tomas de Wouters; Christian Braegger; Christophe Lacroix; Benoit Pugin
34488774,Transcriptomics reveal different metabolic strategies for acid resistance and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) production in select Levilactobacillus brevis strains.,"Of the many neurotransmitters in humans, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) shows potential for improving several mental health indications such as stress and anxiety. The microbiota-gut-brain axis is an important pathway for GABAergic effects, as microbially-secreted GABA within the gut can affect host mental health outcomes. Understanding the molecular characteristics of GABA production by microbes within the gut can offer insight to novel therapies for mental health.Three strains of Levilactobacillus brevis with syntenous glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) operons were evaluated for overall growth, glutamate utilization, and GABA production in typical synthetic growth media supplemented with monosodium glutamate (MSG). Levilactobacillus brevis Lbr-6108™ (Lbr-6108), formerly known as L. brevis DPC 6108, and Levilactobacillus brevis Lbr-35 ™ (Lbr-35) had similar growth profiles but differed significantly in GABA secretion and acid resistance. Lbr-6108 produced GABA early within the growth phase and produced significantly more GABA than Lbr-35 and the type strain Levilactobacillus brevis ATCC 14869 after the stationary phase. The global gene expression during GABA production at several timepoints was determined by RNA sequencing. The GAD operon, responsible for GABA production and secretion, activated in Lbr-6108 after only 6 h of fermentation and continued throughout the stationary phase. Furthermore, Lbr-6108 activated many different acid resistance mechanisms concurrently, which contribute to acid tolerance and energy production. In contrast, Lbr-35, which has a genetically similar GAD operon, including two copies of the GAD gene, showed no upregulation of the GAD operon, even when cultured with MSG.This study is the first to evaluate whole transcriptome changes in Levilactobacillus brevis during GABA production in different growth phases. The concurrent expression of multiple acid-resistance mechanisms reveals niche-specific metabolic functionality between common human commensals and highlights the complex regulation of GABA metabolism in this important microbial species. Furthermore, the increased and rapid GABA production of Lbr-6108 highlights the strain's potential as a therapeutic and the overall value of screening microbes for effector molecule output.",Microbial cell factories,2021,Sagarika Banerjee; Matthew Poore; Svetlana Gerdes; Derek Nedveck; Lene Lauridsen; Heidi Thomsen Kristensen; Henrik Max Jensen; Phillip M Byrd; Arthur C Ouwehand; Elaine Patterson; Wesley Morovic

33938181,Human glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) is an antimicrobial adjuvant re-sensitising multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.,"Increasing antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative bacteria has mandated the development of both novel antibiotics and alternative therapeutic strategies. Evidence of interplay between several gastrointestinal peptides and the gut microbiota led us to investigate potential and broad-spectrum roles for the incretin hormone, human glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) against the <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> bacteria, <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Erwinia amylovora</i>. GIP had a potent disruptive action on drug efflux pumps of the multidrug resistant bacteria <i>E. coli TG1</i> and <i>E. amylovora 1189</i> strains. The effect was comparable to bacterial mutants lacking the inner and outer membrane efflux pump factor proteins AcrB and TolC. While GIP was devoid of direct antimicrobial activity, it has a potent membrane depolarizing effect, and at low concentrations, it significantly potentiated the activity of eight antibiotics and bile salt by reducing MICs by 4-8-fold in <i>E. coli TG1</i> and 4-20-fold in <i>E. amylovora 1189</i>.

34830242,Assessment of the Effects of Dietary Vitamin D Levels on Olanzapine-Induced Metabolic Side Effects: Focus on the Endocannabinoidome-Gut Microbiome Axis.,"Vitamin D deficiency is associated with poor mental health and dysmetabolism. Several metabolic abnormalities are associated with psychotic diseases, which can be compounded by atypical antipsychotics that induce weight gain and insulin resistance. These side-effects may be affected by vitamin D levels. The gut microbiota and endocannabinoidome (eCBome) are significant regulators of both metabolism and mental health, but their role in the development of atypical antipsychotic drug metabolic side-effects and their interaction with vitamin D status is unknown. We studied the effects of different combinations of vitamin D levels and atypical antipsychotic drug (olanzapine) exposure on whole-body metabolism and the eCBome-gut microbiota axis in female C57BL/6J mice under a high fat/high sucrose (HFHS) diet in an attempt to identify a link between the latter and the different metabolic outputs induced by the treatments. Olanzapine exerted a protective effect against diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance, largely independent of dietary vitamin D status. These changes were concomitant with olanzapine-mediated decreases in <i>Trpv1</i> expression and increases in the levels of its agonists, including various <i>N</i>-acylethanolamines and 2-monoacylglycerols, which are consistent with the observed improvement in adiposity and metabolic status. Furthermore, while global gut bacteria community architecture was not altered by olanzapine, we identified changes in the relative abundances of various commensal bacterial families. Taken together, changes of eCBome and gut microbiota families under our experimental conditions might contribute to olanzapine and vitamin D-mediated inhibition of weight gain in mice on a HFHS diet.",International journal of molecular sciences,2021,Armita Abolghasemi; Claudia Manca; Fabio A Iannotti; Melissa Shen; Nadine Leblanc; Sébastien Lacroix; Cyril Martin; Nicolas Flamand; Vincenzo Di Marzo; Cristoforo Silvestri

34550085,"The Safety and Efficacy of Microbial Ecosystem Therapeutic-2 in People With Major Depression: Protocol for a Phase 2, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study.","The gut-brain axis is a bidirectional signaling pathway between the gastrointestinal tract and the brain; it is being studied because of its potential influence in mediating mood, anxiety, and other neuropsychiatric symptoms. Previous research examining the effects of gut microbiota on neuropsychiatric disorders suggests that gut repopulation treatments such as probiotics, microbe therapy, and fecal microbiota transplantation show promising results in treating symptoms of anxiety and depression. This study explores the use of an alternative gut repopulation treatment to fecal microbiota transplantation, known as Microbial Ecosystem Therapeutic (MET)-2, as an intervention against symptoms of depression. MET-2 is a daily, orally administered capsule containing 40 bacterial strains purified from a single healthy donor.The primary aim of this study is to assess changes in mood in people with major depression that occur pre-, post-, and during the administration of MET-2. The secondary aims are to assess changes in anxiety symptoms, blood biomarker concentrations, and the level of repopulation of healthy gut bacteria as a response to treatment.In this study, we will recruit 60 adults aged between 18 and 45 years old with major depression and randomly assign them to treatment or placebo groups. Patients in the treatment group will receive MET-2 once a day for 6 weeks, whereas patients in the placebo group will receive a matching placebo for 6 weeks. Participants will complete biweekly visits during the treatment period and a follow-up visit at 2 weeks post treatment. As a primary outcome measure, participants' mood will be assessed using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale. Secondary outcome measures include changes in mood, anxiety, early stress, gastrointestinal symptoms, and tolerability of MET-2 treatment using a series of clinical scales and changes in blood markers, particularly immunoglobulins (Igs; IgA, IgG, and IgM) and inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor-α, transforming growth factor-β, interleukin-6, and interleukin-10). Changes in the relative abundance, diversity, and level of engraftment in fecal samples will be assessed using 16S rRNA sequencing. All data will be integrated to identify biomarkers that could indicate disease state or predict improvement in depressive symptoms in response to MET-2 treatment.Given the association between the gut microbiome and depression, we hypothesized that participants receiving MET-2 would experience greater improvement in depressive symptoms than those receiving placebo owing to the recolonization of the gut microbiome with healthy bacteria modulating the gut-brain axis connection.This study is the first of its kind to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a microbial therapy such as MET-2 in comparison with placebo for major depressive disorder. We hope that this study will also reveal the potential capabilities of microbial therapies to treat other psychiatric illnesses and mood disorders.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04602715; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04602715.DERR1-10.2196/31439.",JMIR research protocols,2021,Arthi Chinna Meyyappan; Cassandra Sgarbossa; Gustavo Vazquez; David J Bond; Daniel J Müller; Roumen Milev

Several constructs such as experiential avoidance, cognitive fusion, shame, and self-criticism have recently emerged as potential intervention targets to improve mental health in IBD. Psychotherapeutic models such as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and compassion-based interventions are known to target these constructs. In this protocol, we aim to describe a two-arm Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) testing the efficacy of an ACT and compassion-focused intervention named Living with Intention, Fullness, and Engagement with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (LIFEwithIBD) intervention + Treatment As Usual (TAU) vs. TAU in improving psychological distress, quality of life, work and social functioning, IBD symptom perception, illness-related shame, psychological flexibility, self-compassion, disease activity, inflammation biomarkers, and gut microbiota diversity. <b>Methods:</b> This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT03840707, date assigned 13/02/2019). The LIFEwithIBD intervention is an adaptation to the IBD population of the Mind programme for people with cancer, an acceptance, mindfulness, and compassion-based intervention designed to be delivered in a group format. The LIFEwithIBD intervention's structure and topics are presented in this protocol. Participants were recruited at the Gastroenterology Service of the Coimbra University Hospital between June and September 2019. Of the 355 patients screened, 61 participants were selected, randomly assigned to one of two conditions [experimental group (LIFEwithIBD + TAU) or control group (TAU)] and completed the baseline assessment.

34437440,Association of Polygenic Risk Score and Bacterial Toxins at Screening Colonoscopy with Colorectal Cancer Progression: A Multicenter Case-Control Study.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide, and its incidence is correlated with infections, chronic inflammation, diet, and genetic factors. An emerging aspect is that microbial dysbiosis and chronic infections triggered by certain bacteria can be risk factors for tumor progression. Recent data suggest that certain bacterial toxins implicated in DNA attack or in proliferation, replication, and death can be risk factors for insurgence and progression of CRC. In this study, we recruited more than 300 biopsy specimens from people undergoing colonoscopy, and we analyzed to determine whether a correlation exists between the presence of bacterial genes coding for toxins possibly involved in CRC onset and progression and the different stages of CRC. We also analyzed to determine whether CRC-predisposing genetic factors could contribute to bacterial toxins response. Our results showed that CIF toxin is associated with polyps or adenomas, whereas pks+ seems to be a predisposing factor for CRC. Toxins from <i>Escherichia coli</i> as a whole have a higher incidence rate in adenocarcinoma patients compared to controls, whereas <i>Bacteroides fragilis</i> toxin does not seem to be associated with pre-cancerous nor with cancerous lesions. These results have been obtained irrespectively of the presence of CRC-risk loci.",Toxins,2021,Alfonso Piciocchi; Elena Angela Pia Germinario; Koldo Garcia Etxebarria; Silvia Rossi; Lupe Sanchez-Mete; Barbara Porowska; Vittoria Stigliano; Paolo Trentino; Andrea Oddi; Fabio Accarpio; Gian Luca Grazi; Giovanni Bruno; Massimo Bonucci; Massimo Giambenedetti; Patrizia Spigaglia; Fabrizio Barbanti; Slawomir Owczarek; Ida Luzzi; Elisabetta Delibato; Zaira Maroccia; Lorenza Nisticò; Carla Fiorentini; Mauro D'Amato; Roberta De Angelis; Alessia Fabbri

We previously reported that Chrna7 knock-out (KO) mice show depression-like phenotypes through systemic inflammation. In this study, we investigated whether fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from Chrna7 KO mice causes depression-like phenotypes in mice treated with an antibiotic cocktail (ABX). Chrna7 KO mice with depression-like phenotypes show an abnormal gut microbiota composition, although the alpha diversity and beta diversity were not altered. FMT from Chrna7 KO mice caused depression-like phenotypes, systemic inflammation, and downregulation of synaptic proteins in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in the ABX-treated mice compared to FMT from the control mice. The Principal component analysis based on the OTU level showed that the FMT group from the KO mice were different from the FMT group from the control mice. We found differences in abundance for several bacteria in the FMT group from the KO mice at the taxonomic level when compared with the other group. Interestingly, subdiaphragmatic vagotomy significantly blocked the development of depression-like phenotypes in the ABX-treated mice after FMT from Chrna7 KO mice. These data suggest that FMT from Chrna7 KO mice produce depression-like phenotypes in ABX-treated mice via the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve. The brain-gut-microbiota axis association with the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve plays an important role in the development of depression.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2021,Yaoyu Pu; Yunfei Tan; Youge Qu; Lijia Chang; Siming Wang; Yan Wei; Xingming Wang; Kenji Hashimoto
35151796,Brain-gut-microbiota axis in depression: A historical overview and future directions.,"Depression is the most common mental disorder and a leading cause of disability worldwide. Despite abundant research, the precise mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of depression remain elusive. Accumulating evidence from preclinical and clinical studies suggests that alterations in the gut microbiota, microbe-derived short-chain fatty acids, D-amino acids and metabolites play a key role in the pathophysiology of depression via the brain-gut-microbiota axis, including the neural and immune systems. Notably, the brain-gut-microbiota axis might play a crucial role in susceptibility versus resilience in rodents exposed to stress. Vagotomy is reported to block depression-like phenotypes in rodents after fecal microbiota transplantation of ""depression-related"" microbiome, suggesting that the vagus nerve influences depression through the brain-gut-microbiota axis. In this article, we review recent findings regarding the brain-gut-microbiota axis in depression and discuss its potential as a therapeutic target for depression.",Brain research bulletin,2022,Lijia Chang; Yan Wei; Kenji Hashimoto

Perspectives on what we know, what we need to investigate and how to put knowledge into practice.","The gut and brain link via various metabolic and signalling pathways, each with the potential to influence mental, brain and cognitive health. Over the past decade, the involvement of the gut microbiota in gut-brain communication has become the focus of increased scientific interest, establishing the microbiota-gut-brain axis as a field of research. There is a growing number of association studies exploring the gut microbiota's possible role in memory, learning, anxiety, stress, neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Consequently, attention is now turning to how the microbiota can become the target of nutritional and therapeutic strategies for improved brain health and well-being. However, while such strategies that target the gut microbiota to influence brain health and function are currently under development with varying levels of success, still very little is yet known about the triggers and mechanisms underlying the gut microbiota's apparent influence on cognitive or brain function and most evidence comes from pre-clinical studies rather than well controlled clinical trials/investigations. Filling the knowledge gaps requires establishing a standardised methodology for human studies, including strong guidance for specific focus areas of the microbiota-gut-brain axis, the need for more extensive biological sample analyses, and identification of relevant biomarkers. Other urgent requirements are new advanced models for in vitro and in vivo studies of relevant mechanisms, and a greater focus on omics technologies with supporting bioinformatics resources (training, tools) to efficiently translate study findings, as well as the identification of relevant targets in study populations. The key to building a validated evidence base rely on increasing knowledge sharing and multi-disciplinary collaborations, along with continued public-private funding support.

36099873,The microbiota-gut-brain axis in sleep disorders.,"Sleep is a complex physiological process and is a critical determinant of physical and mental health. In the past decades, significant progress has been made in understanding the neural mechanisms of sleep and awakening. However, the initiation and maintenance of the sleep-wake cycle is regulated not only by the central system but is also affected by signals from peripheral tissues. Growing evidence shows that the microbiota-gut-brain axis contributes to the regulation of sleep behavior both directly and indirectly and may play a critical role in the etiology and pathogenesis of sleep disorders. Sleep deprivation leads to dysfunction of gut microbiota and sleep disorders are accompanied by altered gut microbiota composition. In this review, we describe the bidirectional relationships between sleep and gut microbiota and summarize the abnormal characteristics of gut bacteria in distinct conditions including sleep disturbances, sleep disorders and sleep disorders comorbid with neuropsychiatric disorders. We also examine the potential routes of microbiota-gut-brain axis in sleep and gut microbiome interactions, including metabolic, immune, and neural pathways, and propose microbiota-targeted interventions for improving sleep.

35194166,"A systematic review of gut microbiota composition in observational studies of major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.","The emerging understanding of gut microbiota as 'metabolic machinery' influencing many aspects of physiology has gained substantial attention in the field of psychiatry. This is largely due to the many overlapping pathophysiological mechanisms associated with both the potential functionality of the gut microbiota and the biological mechanisms thought to be underpinning mental disorders. In this systematic review, we synthesised the current literature investigating differences in gut microbiota composition in people with the major psychiatric disorders, major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SZ), compared to 'healthy' controls. We also explored gut microbiota composition across disorders in an attempt to elucidate potential commonalities in the microbial signatures associated with these mental disorders. Following the PRISMA guidelines, databases were searched from inception through to December 2021. We identified 44 studies (including a total of 2510 psychiatric cases and 2407 controls) that met inclusion criteria, of which 24 investigated gut microbiota composition in MDD, seven investigated gut microbiota composition in BD, and 15 investigated gut microbiota composition in SZ. Our syntheses provide no strong evidence for a difference in the number or distribution (α-diversity) of bacteria in those with a mental disorder compared to controls. However, studies were relatively consistent in reporting differences in overall community composition (β-diversity) in people with and without mental disorders. Our syntheses also identified specific bacterial taxa commonly associated with mental disorders, including lower levels of bacterial genera that produce short-chain fatty acids (e.g. butyrate), higher levels of lactic acid-producing bacteria, and higher levels of bacteria associated with glutamate and GABA metabolism. We also observed substantial heterogeneity across studies with regards to methodologies and reporting.

36093196,Gut microbiota: Linking nutrition and perinatal depression.,"Perinatal depression is a mood disorder that is reported in women during pregnancy (prenatal) and after childbirth (postnatal). The onset of perinatal depression is associated with changes in reproductive hormones, stress hormones and neurosteroids. These chemical compounds can be modulated by the gut microbiota, which may affect maternal mental health during the perinatal period <i>via</i> the gut-brain-axis. Recent studies suggest that nutritional and dietary interventions (vitamin D, ω-3 fatty acids, iron, and fiber) effectively prevent or mitigate maternal depression and anxiety, but their efficacy is confounded by various factors, including the gut microbiota. Probiotics are efficacious in maintaining microbiota homeostasis, and thus, have the potential to modulate the development of perinatal mood disorders, despite no evidence in human. Therefore, clinical trials are warranted to investigate the role of probiotic supplementation in perinatal depression and behavioral changes. This article reviews the interplay between nutrition, gut microbiota and mood and cognition, and the evidence suggesting that probiotics affect the onset and development of perinatal depression.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2022,Jia Song; Bi Zhou; Juntao Kan; Guangya Liu; Sheng Zhang; Liang Si; Xianping Zhang; Xue Yang; Junhua Ma; Junrui Cheng; Yongde Yang; Xiaobo Liu

Here we performed faecal metagenomic, serum metabolomics and neuroimaging studies on a cohort of 109 unmedicated patients with depressed bipolar disorder (BD) patients and 40 healthy controls (HCs) to characterise the microbial-gut-brain axis in BD. Across over 12,000 measured metabolic features, we observed a large discrepancy (73.54%) in the serum metabolome between BD patients and HCs, spotting differentially abundant microbial-derived neuroactive metabolites including multiple B-vitamins, kynurenic acid, gamma-aminobutyric acid and short-chain fatty acids. These metabolites could be linked to the abundance of gut microbiota presented with corresponding biosynthetic potentials, including Akkermansia muciniphila, Citrobacter spp. (Citrobacter freundii and Citrobacter werkmanii), Phascolarctobacterium spp., Yersinia spp. (Yersinia frederiksenii and Yersinia aleksiciae), Enterobacter spp. (Enterobacter cloacae and Enterobacter kobei) and Flavobacterium spp. Based on functional neuroimaging, BD-related neuroactive microbes and metabolites were discovered as potential markers associated with BD-typical features of functional connectivity of brain networks, hinting at aberrant cognitive function, emotion regulation, and interoception.

35819136,"Antibiotics and mental health: The good, the bad and the ugly.","Antibiotics are recognised as, on occasion, producing psychiatric side effects, most notably depression and anxiety. Apart from antimicrobial activity, antibiotics have multiple off-target effects. The brain-gut-microbiota axis has multiple sites for off-target activity, which may produce either positive or negative antibiotic effects. Here we review how antibiotics impact mental health by acting through the brain-gut-microbiota axis. Microbes in the gut influence brain function by acting through the vagus nerve or by altering the production of short-chain fatty acids or the amino acid tryptophan, the building block of serotonin. Not all antimicrobial actions of antibiotics have a negative impact. The first antidepressant discovered was actually an antibiotic: isoniazid is an antibacterial drug developed for treating tuberculosis. Minocycline, which enters the brain and mediates its effects through microglia, shows antidepressant activity. Some antibiotics bring about a significant decrease in gut microbial diversity, and this is viewed as a risk factor for depression. Other risk factors induced by antibiotics include altered gut barrier function, activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, reducing levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor or oxytocin and alteration of vagal tone. Although most patients taking antibiotics do not suffer from an iatrogenic psychiatric disorder, some do. As clinicians, we need to keep this in mind. The development of new antibiotics is primarily focused on antibiotic resistance, but efforts should be made to reduce off-target brain-gut-microbiota effects resulting in mental health problems.",Journal of internal medicine,2022,Katherine Dinan; Timothy Dinan

Evidence suggests that carbohydrates, especially fiber, are beneficial for the well-being and growth of gut microorganisms and consequently for the host in this symbiotic relationship, producing microbial alterations a negative effect on mental health and different organic systems. In addition, evidence suggests a negative impact of simple carbohydrates and refined carbohydrates on mood categories, including alertness and tiredness, reinforcing a vicious circle. Regarding physical health, sugar intake can affect the development and prognosis of metabolic disease, as an uncontrolled intake of refined carbohydrates puts individuals at risk of developing metabolic syndrome and subsequently developing metabolic disease.",Nutrients,2022,Vicente Javier Clemente-Suárez; Juan Mielgo-Ayuso; Alexandra Martín-Rodríguez; Domingo Jesús Ramos-Campo; Laura Redondo-Flórez; Jose Francisco Tornero-Aguilera

We observed no significant differences in alpha diversity but a significant difference in beta diversity between patients with MDD and HC. There were fluctuations in the abundance of specific taxa in patients with MDD relative to HC. Probiotic and synbiotic, but not prebiotic, treatment showed a modest benefit in reducing depressive symptoms in patients with MDD over four to nine weeks.

Recent findings also suggest that a natural perturbation of the gut microbiota (GM), combined with other factors, may create a unique vulnerability during this period of life. The GM of emerging adults is thought to be simpler, less diverse, and more unstable than either younger or older people.

35831877,The gut-liver axis in sepsis: interaction mechanisms and therapeutic potential.,"Sepsis is a potentially fatal condition caused by dysregulation of the body's immune response to an infection. Sepsis-induced liver injury is considered a strong independent prognosticator of death in the critical care unit, and there is anatomic and accumulating epidemiologic evidence that demonstrates intimate cross talk between the gut and the liver. Intestinal barrier disruption and gut microbiota dysbiosis during sepsis result in translocation of intestinal pathogen-associated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular patterns into the liver and systemic circulation. The liver is essential for regulating immune defense during systemic infections via mechanisms such as bacterial clearance, lipopolysaccharide detoxification, cytokine and acute-phase protein release, and inflammation metabolic regulation. When an inappropriate immune response or overwhelming inflammation occurs in the liver, the impaired capacity for pathogen clearance and hepatic metabolic disturbance can result in further impairment of the intestinal barrier and increased disruption of the composition and diversity of the gut microbiota. Therefore, interaction between the gut and liver is a potential therapeutic target.

We applied a multi-omics approach combining pre-clinical models with three human cohorts including patients with mild depression. Microbial functions and metabolites converging onto glutamate/GABA metabolism, particularly proline, were linked to depression. High proline consumption was the dietary factor with the strongest impact on depression. Whole-brain dynamics revealed rich club network disruptions associated with depression and circulating proline. Proline supplementation in mice exacerbated depression along with microbial translocation. Human microbiota transplantation induced an emotionally impaired phenotype in mice and alterations in GABA-, proline-, and extracellular matrix-related prefrontal cortex genes.

Diet influences the onset and consequences of neurological diseases, and dietary factors may influence mental health at individual and population level. The link between unhealthy diet, impaired cognitive function and neurodegenerative diseases indicates that adopting a healthy diet would ultimately afford prevention and management of neurological diseases and brain aging. Neurodegenerative diseases are of multifactorial origin and result in progressive loss of neuronal function in the brain, leading to cognitive impairment and motoneuron disorders. The so-called Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) with its healthy ingredients rich in antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immune, neuroprotective, antidepressant, antistress and senolytic activity plays an essential role in the prevention and management of neurological diseases and inhibits cognitive decline in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. The MedDiet also modulates the gut-brain axis by promoting a diversity of gut microbiota. In view of the importance of diet in neurological diseases management, this review focuses on the dietary components, natural compounds and medicinal plants that have proven beneficial in neurological diseases and for brain health.

Psychobiotics are microbiota-targeted interventions that can result in mental health benefits and protect the aging brain. This study investigated the gut microbiome composition and predicted microbial functional pathways of middle-aged and older adults that met criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI), compared to neurologically healthy individuals, and investigated the impact of probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial. A total of 169 community-dwelling middle-aged (52-59 years) and older adults (60-75 years) received a three-month intervention and were randomized to probiotic and placebo groups. Participants were further subdivided based on cognitive status into groups with intact or impaired cognition and samples were collected at baseline and post supplementation.Microbiome analysis identified Prevotella ruminicola, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, and Bacteroides xylanisolvens as taxa correlated with MCI. Differential abundance analysis at baseline identified Prevotella as significantly more prevalent in MCI subjects compared to cognitively intact subjects (ALDEx2 P = 0.0017, ANCOM-BC P = 0.0004). A decrease in the relative abundance of the genus Prevotella and Dehalobacterium in response to LGG supplementation in the MCI group was correlated with an improved cognitive score.Our study points to specific members of the gut microbiota correlated with cognitive performance in middle-aged and older adults.

35565888,The Role of the Microbiome-Brain-Gut Axis in the Pathogenesis of Depressive Disorder.,"The role of gut microbiota and its association with the central nervous system via the microbiome-brain-gut axis has been widely discussed in the literature. The aim of this review is to investigate the impact of gut microbiota on the development of depression and underlying molecular mechanisms. There are two possible pathways in which this interaction might occur. The first one suggests that depressive disorder could lead to dysbiosis and one of the causes may be the influence on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The second one considers if changes in the composition of gut microbiota might cause depressive disorder. The mechanisms that could be responsible for this interaction include the secretion of neurotransmitters, gut peptides and the activation of the immune system.

36039924,The anti-inflammatory effects of a Mediterranean diet: a review.,"Chronic noncommunicable diseases remain the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and the majority are preventable with a healthy diet and lifestyle, but controversy remains as to the best approach. Greater adherence to a traditional Mediterranean diet has consistently been associated with lower morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease, diabetes and many cancers, and lower all-cause mortality. Despite the well known benefits on chronic disease risk there remains some scepticism as to the effects of this dietary pattern across populations outside the Mediterranean and the mechanisms of action of this traditional plant-based dietary pattern.This narrative review aims to summarize the latest evidence on the health protective effects of a traditional Mediterranean diet on chronic noncommunicable diseases, specifically focussing on the anti-inflammatory effects of this highly published dietary pattern.Recent high-quality evidence now supports a Mediterranean diet in secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease with impacts on atherosclerosis progression, likely through reduction of systemic inflammation and irrespective of changes in cholesterol or weight. The Mediterranean diet has a low Dietary Inflammatory Index illustrating its anti-inflammatory potential. This dietary pattern beneficially modulates the gut microbiota and immune system, including emerging evidence for efficacy against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (coronavirus disease 2019). Emerging evidence shows clinicians are not routinely recommending a Mediterranean diet despite well known evidence due to barriers such as lack of training, patient materials and concerns about potential patient adherence.The physiological mechanisms of action of this healthy diet pattern are becoming better understood to be multisystem and involving the gut. Larger controlled trials investigating mechanistic effects in broader non-Mediterranean populations are warranted.

35713539,"The effect of COVID-19 lockdown on mental health, gut microbiota composition and serum cortisol levels.","The aim of this study was to assess changes in mental health, gut microbiota composition, and stress marker serum cortisol due to COVID-19 lockdown in asymptomatic individuals. Healthy adults participated in anthropometric measurements, blood and stool sample collection pre-lockdown and post-lockdown (<i>n</i> = 38, 63.2% females), lifestyle and psychological questionnaires were included in pre-lockdown measurement and lockdown survey (<i>n</i> = 46, 67.4% females). Subjects reported significantly higher body dissatisfaction (<i>p</i> = 0.007) and anxiety (<i>p</i> = 0.002), and significantly lower positive affect (<i>p</i> = 0.001) during lockdown compared with pre-lockdown. According to perceived stress, 51.6% of females and 20% of males experienced moderate to high stress. This was reflected in serum cortisol levels that significantly increased only in females (<i>p</i> = 0.006) post-lockdown and correlated with perceived stress (<i>p</i> = 0.037) and anxiety (<i>p</i> = 0.031). In addition to psychological measures, changes in gut microbiota composition were observed. Gut microbial alpha diversity significantly decreased (<i>p</i> = 0.033), whereas relative abundance of Proteobacteria significantly increased (<i>p</i> = 0.043) post-lockdown. Depression during lockdown was moderately positively correlated with changes in Bacteroidetes abundance (<i>p</i> = 0.015) and negatively with changes in Firmicutes abundance (<i>p</i> = 0.008). <i>Alistipes</i> abundance post-lockdown was moderately positively correlated with anxiety (<i>p</i> = 0.004) and negative affect (<i>p</i> = 0.005) during lockdown. Despite a small sample size and not being able to perform objective measurements during lockdown, the results confirm the effect of lockdown on mental health and gut microbiota composition that could have a great impact on our health (ClinicalTrials identifier: NCT04347213).","Stress (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2022,Karin Šik Novak; Nives Bogataj Jontez; Saša Kenig; Matjaž Hladnik; Alenka Baruca Arbeiter; Dunja Bandelj; Maša Černelič Bizjak; Ana Petelin; Nina Mohorko; Zala Jenko Pražnikar

More than 10% of children and adolescents in Iceland suffer from mental disorders, and rates of psychotropics use are very high. The aim of this novel observational longitudinal case-control study, ""Meals, Microbiota and Mental Health in Children and Adolescents (MMM-Study)"" is to contribute to the promotion of treatment options for children and adolescents diagnosed with mental disorders through identification of patterns that may affect the symptoms. All children and adolescents, 5-15 years referred to the outpatient clinic of the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Department at The National University Hospital in Reykjavik, Iceland, for one year (n≈150) will be invited to participate. There are two control groups, i.e., sex-matched children from the same postal area (n≈150) and same parent siblings (full siblings) in the same household close in age +/- 3 years (n<150). A three-day food diary, rating scales for mental health, and multiple questionnaires will be completed. Biosamples (fecal-, urine-, saliva-, blood samples, and buccal swab) will be collected and used for 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of the oral and gut microbiome, measurements of serum factors, quantification of urine metabolites and host genotype, respectively. For longitudinal follow-up, data collection will be repeated after three years in the same groups. Integrative analysis of diet, gut microbiota, intestinal permeability, serum metabolites, and mental health will be conducted applying bioinformatics and systems biology approaches. Extensive population-based data of this quality has not been collected before, with collection repeated in three years' time, contributing to the high scientific value. The MMM-study follows the ""Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology"" (STROBE) guidelines. Approval has been obtained from the Icelandic National Bioethics Committee, and the study is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov. The study will contribute to an improved understanding of the links between diet, gut microbiota and mental health in children through good quality study design by collecting information on multiple components, and a longitudinal approach.

This meta-analysis synthesizes the evidence regarding the impacts of probiotics on psychological well-being, psychiatric symptoms and CNS functioning.The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were applied for executing this review using the databases PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane Library. The data were summarized at qualitative and quantitative level.Fifty-four randomized placebo-controlled studies were included, of which 30 were eligible for meta-analysis. If investigated, the probiotics mostly exerted effects on CNS function. Most probiotics did not affect mood, stress, anxiety, depression and psychiatric distress when compared to placebo at the qualitative level. At quantitative level, depression and psychiatric distress improved slightly in the probiotic condition (depression: mean difference -0.37 (95% CI: -0.55, -0.20); <i>p</i> ≤ 0.0001; psychiatric distress: mean difference -0.33 (95% CI: -0.53, -0.13); <i>p</i> = 0.001).To date it is unclear to which extent and in which specific areas next generation probiotics selected and developed for their ability to improve psychiatric condition and potentially other CNS functions are promising.",Nutrients,2022,Charlotte Le Morvan de Sequeira; Charlotte Hengstberger; Paul Enck; Isabelle Mack
36466655,"Gut microbiota, pathogenic proteins and neurodegenerative diseases.","As the world's population ages, neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) have brought a great burden to the world. However, effective treatment measures have not been found to alleviate the occurrence and development of NDs. Abnormal accumulation of pathogenic proteins is an important cause of NDs. Therefore, effective inhibition of the accumulation of pathogenic proteins has become a priority. As the second brain of human, the gut plays an important role in regulate emotion and cognition functions. Recent studies have reported that the disturbance of gut microbiota (GM) is closely related to accumulation of pathogenic proteins in NDs. On the one hand, pathogenic proteins directly produced by GM are transmitted from the gut to the central center <i>via</i> vagus nerve. On the other hand, The harmful substances produced by GM enter the peripheral circulation through intestinal barrier and cause inflammation, or cross the blood-brain barrier into the central center to cause inflammation, and cytokines produced by the central center cause the production of pathogenic proteins. These pathogenic proteins can produced by the above two aspects can cause the activation of central microglia and further lead to NDs development. In addition, certain GM and metabolites have been shown to have neuroprotective effects. Therefore, modulating GM may be a potential clinical therapeutic approach for NDs. In this review, we summarized the possible mechanism of NDs caused by abnormal accumulation of pathogenic proteins mediated by GM to induce the activation of central microglia, cause central inflammation and explore the therapeutic potential of dietary therapy and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in NDs.",Frontiers in microbiology,2022,Wei Wei; Shixu Wang; Chongchong Xu; Xuemei Zhou; Xinqing Lian; Lin He; Kuan Li
35889175,Impact of Environmental Pollutants on Gut Microbiome and Mental Health via the Gut-Brain Axis.,"Over the last few years, the microbiome has emerged as a high-priority research area to discover missing links between brain health and gut dysbiosis. Emerging evidence suggests that the commensal gut microbiome is an important regulator of the gut-brain axis and plays a critical role in brain physiology. Engaging microbiome-generated metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids, the immune system, the enteric nervous system, the endocrine system (including the HPA axis), tryptophan metabolism or the vagus nerve plays a crucial role in communication between the gut microbes and the brain. Humans are exposed to a wide range of pollutants in everyday life that impact our intestinal microbiota and manipulate the bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain, resulting in predisposition to psychiatric or neurological disorders. However, the interaction between xenobiotics, microbiota and neurotoxicity has yet to be completely investigated. Although research into the precise processes of the microbiota-gut-brain axis is growing rapidly, comprehending the implications of environmental contaminants remains challenging. In these milieus, we herein discuss how various environmental pollutants such as phthalates, heavy metals, Bisphenol A and particulate matter may alter the intricate microbiota-gut-brain axis thereby impacting our neurological and overall mental health.",Microorganisms,2022,Samradhi Singh; Poonam Sharma; Namrata Pal; Manoj Kumawat; Swasti Shubham; Devojit Kumar Sarma; Rajnarayan R Tiwari; Manoj Kumar; Ravinder Nagpal

An interplay between stress and diet exists, with stress influencing food choices. Nutritional interventions may be effective in preventing mental health decline due to complex bidirectional interactions between the brain, the gut and the gut microbiota. Previous studies have shown walnut consumption has a positive effect on mental health. Here, using a randomized clinical trial (Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, #ACTRN12619000972123), we aimed to investigate the effects of academic stress and daily walnut consumption in university students on mental health, biochemical markers of general health, and the gut microbiota. We found academic stress had a negative impact on self-reported mood and mental health status, while daily walnut consumption improved mental health indicators and protected against some of the negative effects of academic stress on metabolic and stress biomarkers. Academic stress was associated with lower gut microbial diversity in females, which was improved by walnut consumption. The effects of academic stress or walnut consumption in male participants could not be established due to small numbers of participants. Thus, walnut consumption may have a protective effect against some of the negative impacts of academic stress, however sex-dependent mechanisms require further study.",Nutrients,2022,Mauritz F Herselman; Sheree Bailey; Permal Deo; Xin-Fu Zhou; Kate M Gunn; Larisa Bobrovskaya

The mental health status, gut microbiota and blood NH3, H2S, 5-hydroxy trptamine and dopamine levels were measured.Compared with unimprisoned controls, the fresh inmates exhibited significantly higher scores on anxiety and depression. Both phylogenetic structure and functional genes of the gut microbiota markedly shifted in inmates. Inmates was more <i>Bacteroides</i>-dominated, while unimprisoned subjects were more <i>Prevotella</i>-dominated. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producing genera were largely decreased in inmates and were negatively related to mental disorder scores, while Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria were positive to anxiety and depression scores. Simultaneously, the inmates possessed reduced genes that participate in amino acids, carbohydrates and vitamin cofactors metabolism, but enriched genes that involved in the neurotransmitter-producing Shikimate pathway.

35345829,Curcumin Alleviates DSS-Induced Anxiety-Like Behaviors via the Microbial-Brain-Gut Axis.,"The anxiety and depression caused by inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are known to greatly affect the mental health of patients. The mechanism of psychiatric disorders caused by IBD is not fully understood. Previous research has suggested that the gut microbiome plays a key role in IBD. Curcumin is a yellow polyphenol extracted from the rhizome of the ginger plant, which has been shown to have effects against both depression and anxiety. Research has indicated that curcumin affects the gut microbiome and exerts antianxiety and neuroprotective effects through the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGB). However, whether curcumin can alleviate the psychiatric disorders caused by IBD and how curcumin affects the MGB axis through the gut microbiota have not been fully understood. Therefore, this study was aimed at determining the metabolic parameters and microbiological environment in the peripheral and central nervous system to determine the effects of curcumin against anxiety induced by dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS) in mice. To elaborate on the link between the gut microbiota and how curcumin alleviates anxiety-like behaviors, we performed a fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiment. The results suggested that curcumin can effectively relieve anxiety-like behaviors caused by DSS in mice. Further, curcumin treatment can alleviate disturbances in the gut microbiota and systemic disorders of lipid metabolism caused by DSS. Finally, through FMT, we verified that curcumin increased phosphatidylcholine in the prefrontal cortex of the mice and alleviated DSS-induced anxiety-like behaviors by modulating specific gut microbiota. We also revealed that <i>Muribaculaceae</i> may be a key part of the gut microbiota for curcumin to alleviate DSS-induced anxiety-like behaviors through the MGB axis.",Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,2022,Fan Zhang; Yanlin Zhou; Haitao Chen; Hao Jiang; Feini Zhou; Bin Lv; Maosheng Xu

Specifically, our review consists of three mini reviews on the associations exploring: (1) ecological biodiversity and human microbiota; (2) human microbiota and neuropsychiatric disorders; (3) ecological biodiversity and neuropsychiatric disorders. We conclude that the environment could directly transfer microbes to humans and that human studies support the gut microbiota as part of the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. Overall, the results from the three mini reviews consistently support the biodiversity hypothesis. These findings demonstrated the plausibility of biodiversity exerting mental health effects through biophysiological mechanisms instead of psychological mechanisms alone.

35966709,Gut microbiota dysbiosis: The potential mechanisms by which alcohol disrupts gut and brain functions.,"Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a high-risk psychiatric disorder and a key cause of death and disability in individuals. In the development of AUD, there is a connection known as the microbiota-gut-brain axis, where alcohol use disrupts the gut barrier, resulting in changes in intestinal permeability as well as the gut microbiota composition, which in turn impairs brain function and worsens the patient's mental status and gut activity. Potential mechanisms are explored by which alcohol alters gut and brain function through the effects of the gut microbiota and their metabolites on immune and inflammatory pathways. Alcohol and microbiota dysregulation regulating neurotransmitter release, including DA, 5-HT, and GABA, are also discussed. Thus, based on the above discussion, it is possible to speculate on the gut microbiota as an underlying target for the treatment of diseases associated with alcohol addiction. This review will focus more on how alcohol and gut microbiota affect the structure and function of the gut and brain, specific changes in the composition of the gut microbiota, and some measures to mitigate the changes caused by alcohol exposure. This leads to a potential intervention for alcohol addiction through fecal microbiota transplantation, which could normalize the disruption of gut microbiota after AUD.",Frontiers in microbiology,2022,Ganggang Chen; Fenglei Shi; Wei Yin; Yao Guo; Anru Liu; Jiacheng Shuai; Jinhao Sun
34654024,Associations Between the Gut Microbiota and Internalizing Behaviors in Preschool Children.,"Emerging evidence points toward a connection between mental health and the gut microbiota and its metabolites (e.g., short-chain fatty acids). It is unknown whether the gut microbiota is associated with the development of mental health problems (e.g., internalizing or externalizing behaviors) in preschool children. The objective of this study was to evaluate associations between the gut microbiota and internalizing and externalizing behaviors in preschool-aged children.A community sample of 248 typically developing children (3-5 years of age) provided a stool sample for gut microbiota and SCFA analysis. Parents reported child internalizing and externalizing behaviors using the Child Behavior Checklist. Associations between child behaviors and gut microbiota measures were analyzed using Spearman correlations followed by an adjustment for multiple testing, with subanalysis conducted in children clinically ""at risk"" for behavioral problems compared with those who were not.There was a correlation between Shannon alpha diversity with internalizing behaviors (rs = -0.134, p = .035) and its subscale somatic complaints (rs = -0.144, p = .023). In addition, children clinically ""at risk"" for internalizing problems had decreased alpha diversity (U = 551, p = .017). Internalizing behaviors correlated with valerate and isobutyrate (rs = -0.147, p = .021; rs = -0.140, p = .028, respectively). Furthermore the somatic complaints subscale additionally correlated with acetate and butyrate (rs = -0.219, p = .001; rs = -0.241, p < .001, respectively). These findings were also present in children ""at risk"" for internalizing problems (U = 569, p = .026; U = 571, p = .028) and somatic complaints (U = 164, p = .004; U = 145, p = .001).These analyses reveal novel associations between internalizing behaviors and the gut microbiota in preschool children. Furthermore, a relationship between somatic complaints and acetate and butyrate was identified, indicating that interventions that increase SCFA production warrant future investigation.",Psychosomatic medicine,2022,Marcel van de Wouw; Yanan Wang; Matthew L Workentine; Elnaz Vaghef-Mehrabani; Deborah Dewey; Raylene A Reimer; Lianne Tomfohr-Madsen; Gerald F Giesbrecht
36211431,Maternal gut microbiota during pregnancy and the composition of immune cells in infancy.,"Preclinical studies have shown that maternal gut microbiota during pregnancy play a key role in prenatal immune development but the relevance of these findings to humans is unknown. The aim of this prebirth cohort study was to investigate the association between the maternal gut microbiota in pregnancy and the composition of the infant's cord and peripheral blood immune cells over the first year of life.The Barwon Infant Study cohort (<i>n</i>=1074 infants) was recruited using an unselected sampling frame. Maternal fecal samples were collected at 36 weeks of pregnancy and flow cytometry was conducted on cord/peripheral blood collected at birth, 6 and 12 months of age. Among a randomly selected sub-cohort with available samples (<i>n</i>=293), maternal gut microbiota was characterized by sequencing the 16S rRNA V4 region. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were clustered based on their abundance. Associations between maternal fecal microbiota clusters and infant granulocyte, monocyte and lymphocyte subsets were explored using compositional data analysis. Partial least squares (PLS) and regression models were used to investigate the relationships/associations between environmental, maternal and infant factors, and OTU clusters.We identified six clusters of co-occurring OTUs. The first two components in the PLS regression explained 39% and 33% of the covariance between the maternal prenatal OTU clusters and immune cell populations in offspring at birth. A cluster in which <i>Dialister, Escherichia</i>, and <i>Ruminococcus</i> were predominant was associated with a lower proportion of granulocytes (<i>p</i>=0.002), and higher proportions of both central naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD45RA<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>-</sup>) (<i>p</i><0.001) and naïve regulatory T cells (Treg) (CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD45RA<sup>+</sup>/FoxP3<sup>low</sup>) (<i>p</i>=0.02) in cord blood. The association with central naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells persisted to 12 months of age.This birth cohort study provides evidence consistent with past preclinical models that the maternal gut microbiota during pregnancy plays a role in shaping the composition of innate and adaptive elements of the infant's immune system following birth.",Frontiers in immunology,2022,Yuan Gao; Martin O'Hely; Thomas P Quinn; Anne-Louise Ponsonby; Leonard C Harrison; Hanne Frøkiær; Mimi L K Tang; Susanne Brix; Karsten Kristiansen; Dave Burgner; Richard Saffery; Sarath Ranganathan; Fiona Collier; Peter Vuillermin

Additionally, factors that contribute to changes in the gut-brain axis, including the gut microbiome, nutrition, the host's genome, and ethnic difference, are highlighted. Emphasis is given to the lack of studies on Hispanic populations, despite the fact this ethnic group has a higher prevalence of anxiety and depression in the US.",Microorganisms,2022,Fernando Vera-Urbina; María F Dos Santos-Torres; Filipa Godoy-Vitorino; Bianca A Torres-Hernández
36139496,Multi-Strain Probiotic Mixture Affects Brain Morphology and Resting State Brain Function in Healthy Subjects: An RCT.,"Probiotics can alter brain function via the gut-brain axis. We investigated the effect of a probiotic mixture containing <i>Bifidobacterium longum</i>, <i>Lactobacillus helveticus</i> and <i>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</i>. In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded crossover design, 22 healthy subjects (6 m/16 f; 24.2 ± 3.4 years) underwent four-week intervention periods with probiotics and placebo, separated by a four-week washout period. Voxel-based morphometry indicated that the probiotic intervention affected the gray matter volume of a cluster covering the left supramarginal gyrus and superior parietal lobule (<i>p</i> < 0.0001), two regions that were also among those with an altered resting state functional connectivity. Probiotic intervention resulted in significant (FDR < 0.05) functional connectivity changes between regions within the default mode, salience, frontoparietal as well as the language network and several regions located outside these networks. Psychological symptoms trended towards improvement after probiotic intervention, i.e., the total score of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (<i>p</i> = 0.056) and its depression sub-score (<i>p</i> = 0.093), as well as sleep patterns (<i>p</i> = 0.058). The probiotic intervention evoked distinct changes in brain morphology and resting state brain function alongside slight improvements of psycho(bio)logical markers of the gut-brain axis. The combination of those parameters may provide new insights into the modes of action by which gut microbiota can affect gut-brain communication and hence brain function.",Cells,2022,Julia Rode; Hanna M T Edebol Carlman; Julia König; Ashley N Hutchinson; Per Thunberg; Jonas Persson; Robert J Brummer
35050172,Gut Microbiota Metabolites in Major Depressive Disorder-Deep Insights into Their Pathophysiological Role and Potential Translational Applications.,"The gut microbiota is a complex and dynamic ecosystem essential for the proper functioning of the organism, affecting the health and disease status of the individuals. There is continuous and bidirectional communication between gut microbiota and the host, conforming to a unique entity known as ""holobiont"". Among these crosstalk mechanisms, the gut microbiota synthesizes a broad spectrum of bioactive compounds or metabolites which exert pleiotropic effects on the human organism. Many of these microbial metabolites can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) or have significant effects on the brain, playing a key role in the so-called microbiota-gut-brain axis. An altered microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis is a major characteristic of many neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD). Significative differences between gut eubiosis and dysbiosis in mental disorders like MDD with their different metabolite composition and concentrations are being discussed. In the present review, the main microbial metabolites (short-chain fatty acids -SCFAs-, bile acids, amino acids, tryptophan -trp- derivatives, and more), their signaling pathways and functions will be summarized to explain part of MDD pathophysiology. Conclusions from promising translational approaches related to microbial metabolome will be addressed in more depth to discuss their possible clinical value in the management of MDD patients.",Metabolites,2022,Miguel A Ortega; Miguel Angel Alvarez-Mon; Cielo García-Montero; Oscar Fraile-Martinez; Luis G Guijarro; Guillermo Lahera; Jorge Monserrat; Paula Valls; Fernando Mora; Roberto Rodríguez-Jiménez; Javier Quintero; Melchor Álvarez-Mon

36570854,Reviewing the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of depression and exploring new therapeutic options.,"The relationship between gut microbiota (GM) and mental health is one of the focuses of psychobiology research. In recent years, the microbial-gut-brain axis (MGBA) concept has gradually formed about this bidirectional communication between gut and brain. But how the GM is involved in regulating brain function and how they affect emotional disorders these mechanisms are tenuous and limited to animal research, and often controversial. Therefore, in this review, we attempt to summarize and categorize the latest advances in current research on the mechanisms of GM and depression to provide valid information for future diagnoses and therapy of mental disorders. Finally, we introduced some antidepressant regimens that can help restore gut dysbiosis, including classic antidepressants, Chinese materia medica (CMM), diet, and exogenous strains. These studies provide further insight into GM's role and potential pathways in emotion-related diseases, which holds essential possible clinical outcomes for people with depression or related psychiatric disorders. Future research should focus on clarifying the causal role of GM in disease and developing microbial targets, applying these findings to the prevention and treatment of depression.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2022,Wenjie Han; Na Wang; Mengzhen Han; Meng Ban; Tao Sun; Junnan Xu
37118092,Intermittent fasting protects against Alzheimer's disease in mice by altering metabolism through remodeling of the gut microbiota.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia without effective clinical treatment. Here, we show that intermittent fasting (IF) improves cognitive functions and AD-like pathology in a transgenic AD mouse model (5XFAD). IF alters gut microbial composition with a significant enrichment in probiotics such as Lactobacillus. The changes in the composition of the gut microbiota affect metabolic activities and metabolite production. Metabolomic profiling analysis of cecal contents revealed IF leads to a decreased carbohydrate metabolism (for example, glucose) and an increased abundance in amino acids (for example, sarcosine and dimethylglycine). Interestingly, we found that the administration of IF-elevated sarcosine or dimethylglycine mimics the protective effects of IF in 5XFAD mice, including the amelioration of cognitive decline, amyloid-β (Aβ) burden and glial overactivation. Our findings thus demonstrate an IF regimen is a potential approach to prevent AD progression, at least through the gut-microbiota-metabolites-brain axis, and constitutes an innovative AD therapeutic avenue.",Nature aging,2022,Rui-Yuan Pan; Jing Zhang; Jinlei Wang; Yingyi Wang; Zhihui Li; Yang Liao; Yajin Liao; Chenggang Zhang; Zhiqiang Liu; Lijuan Song; Jiezhong Yu; Zengqiang Yuan

35299696,The Role of MicroRNA and Microbiota in Depression and Anxiety.,"Depression and anxiety are devastating disorders. Understanding the mechanisms that underlie the development of depression and anxiety can provide new hints on novel treatments and preventive strategies. Here, we summarize the latest findings reporting the novel roles of gut microbiota and microRNAs (miRNAs) in the pathophysiology of depression and anxiety. The crosstalk between gut microbiota and the brain has been reported to contribute to these pathologies. It is currently known that some miRNAs can regulate bacterial growth and gene transcription while also modulate the gut microbiota composition, suggesting the importance of miRNAs in gut and brain health. Treatment and prevention strategies for neuropsychiatric diseases, such as physical exercise, diet, and probiotics, can modulate the gut microbiota composition and miRNAs expressions. Nonetheless, there are critical questions to be addressed to understand further the mechanisms involved in the interaction between the gut microbiota and miRNAs in the brain. This review summarizes the recent findings of the potential roles of microbiota and miRNA on the neuropathology of depression and anxiety, and its potential as treatment strategies.",Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience,2022,Julia M Rosa; Douglas A Formolo; Jiasui Yu; Thomas H Lee; Suk-Yu Yau
36440396,A genetic association study reveals the relationship between the oral microbiome and anxiety and depression symptoms.,"Growing evidence supports that alterations in the gut microbiota play an essential role in the etiology of anxiety, depression, and other psychiatric disorders. However, the potential effect of oral microbiota on mental health has received little attention.Using the latest genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data of the oral microbiome, polygenic risk scores (PRSs) of 285 salivary microbiomes and 309 tongue dorsum microbiomes were conducted. Logistic and linear regression models were applied to evaluate the relationship between salivary-tongue dorsum microbiome interactions with anxiety and depression. Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was utilized to compute the causal effects between the oral microbiome, anxiety, and depression.We observed significant salivary-tongue dorsum microbiome interactions related to anxiety and depression traits. Significantly, one common interaction was observed to be associated with both anxiety score and depression score, <i>Centipeda periodontii SGB 224</i> × <i>Granulicatella uSGB 3289</i> (P <sub>depressionscore</sub> = 1.41 × 10<sup>-8</sup>, P <sub>anxietyscore</sub> = 5.10 × 10<sup>-8</sup>). Furthermore, we detected causal effects between the oral microbiome and anxiety and depression. Importantly, we identified one salivary microbiome associated with both anxiety and depression in both the UKB database and the Finngen public database, <i>Eggerthia</i> (P <sub>IVW - majordepression - UKB</sub> = 2.99 × 10<sup>-6</sup>, P <sub>IVW - Self - reportedanxiety/panicattacks - UKB</sub> = 3.06 × 10<sup>-59</sup>, P <sub>IVW - depression - Finngen</sub> = 3.16 × 10 <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><msubsup><mrow></mrow> <mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow> <mrow><mo>-</mo> <mn>16</mn></mrow> </msubsup> </math> P <sub>IVW - anxiety - Finngen</sub> = 1.14 × 10<sup>-115</sup>).This study systematically explored the relationship between the oral microbiome and anxiety and depression, which could help improve our understanding of disease pathogenesis and propose new diagnostic targets and early intervention strategies.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2022,Chun'e Li; Yujing Chen; Yan Wen; Yumeng Jia; Shiqiang Cheng; Li Liu; Huijie Zhang; Chuyu Pan; Jingxi Zhang; Zhen Zhang; Xuena Yang; Peilin Meng; Yao Yao; Feng Zhang
35445772,Abnormal gut microbiota and bile acids in patients with first-episode major depressive disorder and correlation analysis.,"Gut microbiota and its metabolite bile acids may play a significant role in the occurrence and development of major depressive disorder (MDD). Therefore, this study analyzes gut microbiota and bile acids, as well as their correlation in patients.Thirty-one patients with MDD and 29 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled in this study. We collected their both blood and feces. Plasma bile acid content was determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and gut microbiota was detected by 16SrRNA gene sequencing and subsequently analyzed. We also analyzed the correlation between different gut microbiota, bile acids, and Hamilton Depression (HAMD) score.The α-diversity analysis found that Simpson and Pielou evenness index was much higher in HCs than in the patients with MDD. The β-diversity of the two groups were differences by nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis. Linear discriminant analysis effect size analysis identified 16 different strains. Bile acids detection showed that 23-nordeoxycholic acid in patients with MDD was significantly higher than in HCs, whereas taurolithocholic acid (TLCA), glycolithocholic acid (GLCA), and lithocholic acid 3-sulfate were significantly lower. Spearman correlation analysis showed that Turicibacteraceae, Turicibacterales, and Turicibacter were positively related with TLCA, GLCA, glycodeoxycholic acid (GDCA), and taurodeoxycholic acid, and were negatively correlated with HAMD score. At the same time, TLCA, GLCA, and GDCA were negatively correlated with HAMD score.Gut microbiota and bile acids metabolism are disturbances in MDD, and there exists a correlation between gut microbiota and bile acids metabolism. Moreover, their interaction may be related to the pathophysiological mechanism of MDD.",Psychiatry and clinical neurosciences,2022,Ning Sun; Jie Zhang; Jizhi Wang; Zhifen Liu; Xin Wang; Pengli Kang; Chunxia Yang; Penghong Liu; Kerang Zhang
36014798,The Effects of Physical Activity on the Gut Microbiota and the Gut-Brain Axis in Preclinical and Human Models: A Narrative Review.,"Increasing evidence supports the importance of the gut microbiota (GM) in regulating multiple functions related to host physical health and, more recently, through the gut-brain axis (GBA), mental health. Similarly, the literature on the impact of physical activity (PA), including exercise, on GM and GBA is growing. Therefore, this narrative review summarizes and critically appraises the existing literature that delves into the benefits or adverse effects produced by PA on physical and mental health status through modifications of the GM, highlighting differences and similarities between preclinical and human studies. The same exercise in animal models, whether performed voluntarily or forced, has different effects on the GM, just as, in humans, intense endurance exercise can have a negative influence. In humans and animals, only aerobic PA seems able to modify the composition of the GM, whereas cardiovascular fitness appears related to specific microbial taxa or metabolites that promote a state of physical health. The PA favors bacterial strains that can promote physical performance and that can induce beneficial changes in the brain. Currently, it seems useful to prioritize aerobic activities at a moderate and not prolonged intensity. There may be greater benefits if PA is undertaken from a young age and the effects on the GM seem to gradually disappear when the activity is stopped. The PA produces modifications in the GM that can mediate and induce mental health benefits.",Nutrients,2022,Stefania Cataldi; Luca Poli; Fatma Neşe Şahin; Antonino Patti; Luigi Santacroce; Antonino Bianco; Gianpiero Greco; Barbara Ghinassi; Angela Di Baldassarre; Francesco Fischetti
35370947,Composition of the Gut Microbiota in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"The latest research accumulates information to explore the correlation between gut microbiota and neurodevelopmental disorders, which may lead to new approaches to treat diseases such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, the conclusions of previous studies are not completely consistent. The objective of the systematic review and meta-analysis was to identify evidence on the dysbiosis of gut microbiota in ADHD and find potential distinctive traits compared to healthy controls.Electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO, were searched up to August 24, 2021, using predetermined terms. Meta-analysis was performed to estimate the comparison of microbiota profiles (alpha and beta diversity) and the relative abundance of gut microbiota in ADHD patients and healthy controls.A total of eight studies were included in the meta-analysis, containing 316 ADHD patients and 359 healthy controls. There was a higher Shannon index in ADHD patients than in healthy controls (SMD = 0.97; 95% CI, 0.13 to 1.82; <i>P</i> = 0.02; <i>I<sup>2</sup></i>  = 96%), but the significance vanished after sensitivity analysis because of high heterogeneity. No significant differences in other alpha diversity indexes were found. Regarding the relative abundance of gut microbiota, the genus <i>Blautia</i> was significantly elevated in ADHD patients compared with controls (SMD = 0.34; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.63; <i>P</i> = 0.02; <i>I<sup>2</sup></i>  = 0%).Patients with ADHD had gut microbiome alterations compared to healthy controls. Though more studies with strict methodology are warranted due to the high heterogeneity, further studies to translate the findings of gut microbiota dysbiosis to clinical application in ADHD patients are needed and may guide targeted therapies.[https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.php?RecordID=273993], identifier PROSPERO (CRD42021273993).",Frontiers in endocrinology,2022,Ning Wang; Xuping Gao; Zifeng Zhang; Li Yang
35115853,Alterations of the Gut Microbiota in Response to Total Sleep Deprivation and Recovery Sleep in Rats.,"Accumulating evidence suggests that both sleep loss and gut dysbiosis can lead to metabolic disorders. However, less is known about the impact of total sleep deprivation (SD) and sleep recovery on the composition, function, and metabolic dynamics of the gut microbiota.Specific-pathogen free Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 48 h of SD with gentle handling and then allowed to recover for 1 week. Taxonomic profiles of fecal microbiota were obtained at baseline, 24 h of SD, 48 h of SD, and 1 week of recovery. We used 16<i>S</i> rRNA gene sequencing to analyze the gut microbial composition and function and further characterize microbiota-derived metabolites in rats.The microbiota composition analysis revealed that gut microbial composition and metabolites did not change in the rats after 24 h of SD but were significantly altered after 48 h of SD. These changes were reversible after 1 week of sleep recovery. A functional analysis was performed based on Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) annotations, indicating that 19 KEGG pathways were significantly altered in the gut microbiota in SD rats. These functional changes occurred within 24 h of SD, were more apparent after 48 h of SD, and did not fully recover after 1 week of sleep recovery.These results indicate that acute total SD leads to significant compositional and functional changes in the gut microbiota, and these changes are reversible.",Nature and science of sleep,2022,Zhong Wang; Kai Yuan; Yan-Bin Ji; Su-Xia Li; Le Shi; Zhe Wang; Xin-Yu Zhou; Yan-Ping Bao; Wen Xie; Ying Han; Jie Shi; Lin Lu; Wei Yan; Wen-Hao Chen
35433746,Guts Imbalance Imbalances the Brain: A Review of Gut Microbiota Association With Neurological and Psychiatric Disorders.,"Over the last 10 years, there has been a growing interest in the relationship between gut microbiota, the brain, and neurologic-associated affections. As multiple preclinical and clinical research studies highlight gut microbiota's potential to modulate the general state of health state, it goes without saying that gut microbiota plays a significant role in neurogenesis, mental and cognitive development, emotions, and behaviors, and in the progression of neuropsychiatric illnesses. Gut microbiota produces important biologic products that, through the gut-brain axis, are directly connected with the appearance and evolution of neurological and psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, autism, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy. This study reviews recent research on the link between gut microbiota and the brain, and microbiome's role in shaping the development of the most common neurological and psychiatric illnesses. Moreover, special attention is paid to the use of probiotic formulations as a potential non-invasive therapeutic opportunity for prevention and management of neuropsychiatric-associated affections.",Frontiers in medicine,2022,Laura Mitrea; Silvia-Amalia Nemeş; Katalin Szabo; Bernadette-Emőke Teleky; Dan-Cristian Vodnar

This review concentrates relevant literature from Scopus, PubMed, and Google Scholar analyzed with the aim of rescuing knowledge that promotes mental health. In this context, it is important to highlight those flowers, seeds, herbaceous plants, fungi, leaves, and tree barks, among other ancestral matrices, that have been historically part of the eating habits of human beings and have also been a consequence of the adaptation of collectors, consuming the ethnoflora present in different ecosystems. Likewise, it is important to note that this knowledge has been progressively lost in the new generations. Therefore, this review concentrates an important number of matrices used particularly for food and medicinal purposes, recognized for their anxiolytic and antidepressant effects, establishing the importance of metabolism and biotransformation mainly of bioactive compounds such as polyphenols by the action of the gut microbiota.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2022,Saúl Alberto Álvarez; Nuria Elizabeth Rocha-Guzmán; Rubén Francisco González-Laredo; José Alberto Gallegos-Infante; Martha Rocío Moreno-Jiménez; Marely Bravo-Muñoz
34480631,Microglial depletion and abnormalities in gut microbiota composition and short-chain fatty acids in mice after repeated administration of colony stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibitor PLX5622.,"PLX5622, a brain-penetrant highly specific inhibitor of the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), is used to eliminate microglia in the brain. Considering the role of microglia and gut microbiota in the brain homeostasis, this study was undertaken to investigate whether repeated intragastric administration of PLX5622 (65 mg/kg/day for consecutive 7 days) could affect the composition of gut microbiota and the concentration of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in fresh feces of adult mice. Repeated administration of PLX5622 caused significant reductions of the expression of genes and proteins for microglial markers in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus compared to control mice although the elimination of brain's microglia was partial. There was a significant alteration in the β-diversity of intestine microbiota in the PLX5622-treated group. Linear discriminant analysis effect size identified eight significant enriched bacteria as microbial markers for PLX5622-treated group. Repeated administration of PLX5622 affected the relative abundance of several bacteria at the genus and species levels. Furthermore, repeated administration of PLX5622 caused a significant change in lactic acid compared to control group. Interestingly, we found significant correlations between microglial markers in the brain and the relative abundance of several bacteria, suggesting microbiome-microglia crosstalk through the brain-gut axis. These data demonstrate that repeated administration of PLX5622 leads to an abnormal composition of the gut microbiota and lactic acid in adult mice. Therefore, abnormalities in the composition of gut microbiota after repeated treatment of PLX5622 should be considered for behavioral and biological functions in animals treated with CSF1R inhibitors.",European archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience,2022,Yong Yang; Tamaki Ishima; Xiayun Wan; Yan Wei; Lijia Chang; Jiancheng Zhang; Youge Qu; Kenji Hashimoto

35634468,The Microbiome and Gut Endocannabinoid System in the Regulation of Stress Responses and Metabolism.,"The endocannabinoid system, with its receptors and ligands, is present in the gut epithelium and enteroendocrine cells, and is able to modulate brain functions, both indirectly through circulating gut-derived factors and directly through the vagus nerve, finally acting on the brain's mechanisms regarding metabolism and behavior. The gut endocannabinoid system also regulates gut motility, permeability, and inflammatory responses. Furthermore, microbiota composition has been shown to influence the activity of the endocannabinoid system. This review examines the interaction between microbiota, intestinal endocannabinoid system, metabolism, and stress responses. We hypothesize that the crosstalk between microbiota and intestinal endocannabinoid system has a prominent role in stress-induced changes in the gut-brain axis affecting metabolic and mental health. Inter-individual differences are commonly observed in stress responses, but mechanisms underlying resilience and vulnerability to stress are far from understood. Both gut microbiota and the endocannabinoid system have been implicated in stress resilience. We also discuss interventions targeting the microbiota and the endocannabinoid system to mitigate metabolic and stress-related disorders.",Frontiers in cellular neuroscience,2022,Raj Kamal Srivastava; Beat Lutz; Inigo Ruiz de Azua

What about the influence of the muscle-gut-brain (MGB) axis on mental health? The gut microbiota colonizes the intestinal tract and plays a pivotal role in digestion, production of vitamins and immune system development, but it is also able to exert a particular effect on psychological well-being and appears to play a critical role in regulating several muscle metabolic pathways. Endogenous and exogenous factors may cause dysbiosis, with relevant consequences on the composition and function of the gut microbiota that may also modulate muscle responses to exercise. The capacity of specific psychobiotics in ameliorating mental health as complementary strategies has been recently suggested as a novel treatment for some neuropsychiatric diseases. Moreover, physical exercise can modify qualitative and quantitative composition of the gut microbiota and alleviate certain psychopathological symptoms. In this minireview, we documented evidence about the impact of the MGB axis on mental health, which currently appears to be a possible target in the context of a multidimensional intervention mainly including pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments, especially for depressive mood.",Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,2022,Davide Maria Cammisuli; Jonathan Fusi; Giorgia Scarfò; Simona Daniele; Gianluca Castelnuovo; Ferdinando Franzoni
35157946,Stressful events induce long-term gut microbiota dysbiosis and associated post-traumatic stress symptoms in healthcare workers fighting against COVID-19.,"The microbiota-gut-brain axis is a key pathway perturbed by prolonged stressors to produce brain and behavioral disorders. Frontline healthcare workers (FHWs) fighting against COVID-19 typically experience stressful event sequences and manifest some mental symptoms; however, the role of gut microbiota in such stress-induced mental problems remains unclear. We investigated the association between the psychological stress of FHW and gut microbiota.We used full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize the longitudinal changes in gut microbiota and investigated the impact of microbial changes on FHWs' mental status.Stressful events induced significant depression, anxiety, and stress in FHWs and disrupted the gut microbiome; gut dysbiosis persisted for at least half a year. Different microbes followed discrete trajectories during the half-year of follow-up. Microbes associated with mental health were mainly Faecalibacterium spp. and [Eubacterium] eligens group spp. with anti-inflammatory effects. Of note, the prediction model indicated that low abundance of [Eubacterium] hallii group uncultured bacterium and high abundance of Bacteroides eggerthii at Day 0 (immediately after the two-month frontline work) were significant determinants of the reappearance of post-traumatic stress symptoms in FHWs.The lack of metabolomic evidence and animal experiments result in the unclear mechanism of gut dysbiosis-related stress symptoms.The stressful event sequences of fighting against COVID-19 induce characteristic longitudinal changes in gut microbiota, which underlies dynamic mental state changes.",Journal of affective disorders,2022,Fengjie Gao; Ruijin Guo; Qingyan Ma; Yening Li; Wei Wang; Yajuan Fan; Yanmei Ju; Binbin Zhao; Yuan Gao; Li Qian; Zai Yang; Xiaoyan He; Xiaoying Jin; Yixin Liu; Yuan Peng; Ce Chen; Yunchun Chen; Chengge Gao; Feng Zhu; Xiancang Ma
35276927,One Giant Leap from Mouse to Man: The Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis in Mood Disorders and Translational Challenges Moving towards Human Clinical Trials.,"The microbiota-gut-brain axis is a bidirectional communication pathway that enables the gut microbiota to communicate with the brain through direct and indirect signaling pathways to influence brain physiology, function, and even behavior. Research has shown that probiotics can improve several aspects of health by changing the environment within the gut, and several lines of evidence now indicate a beneficial effect of probiotics on mental and brain health. Such evidence has prompted the arrival of a new term to the world of biotics research: psychobiotics, defined as any exogenous influence whose effect on mental health is bacterially mediated. Several taxonomic changes in the gut microbiota have been reported in neurodevelopmental disorders, mood disorders such as anxiety and depression, and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. While clinical evidence supporting the role of the gut microbiota in mental and brain health, and indeed demonstrating the beneficial effects of probiotics is rapidly accumulating, most of the evidence to date has emerged from preclinical studies employing different animal models. The purpose of this review is to focus on the role of probiotics and the microbiota-gut-brain axis in relation to mood disorders and to review the current translational challenges from preclinical to clinical research.",Nutrients,2022,Sofia D Forssten; Arthur C Ouwehand; Síle M Griffin; Elaine Patterson
35303781,Anorexia nervosa and gut microbiome: implications for weight change and novel treatments.,"Host-microbiota interactions may be involved in many physical and psychological functions ranging from the digestion of food, maintenance of immune homeostasis, to the regulation of mood and cognition. Microbiome dysbiosis has been consistently described in many diseases. The pathogenesis and weight regulation mechanism in anorexia nervosa (AN) also seem to be implicated in the dynamic bidirectional adjustment of the microbiota-gut-brain axis. This review aims at elucidating this relationship.This review starts with a description of pathogenic gut-brain pathways. Next, we focus on the latest research on the associations between gut microbiota and weight change in the condition of AN. The strategies to alter the intestinal microbiome for the treatment of this disorder are discussed, including dietary, probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation.Gut microbiome is inextricably linked to AN. It may regulate weight gain in the process of refeeding via the microbiota-gut-brain axis, while the specific mechanism has yet to be clearly established. In the future, a better understanding of gut microbiome could have implications for developing microbiome-based prevention, diagnostics and therapies.",Expert review of gastroenterology & hepatology,2022,Yaohui Wei; Sufang Peng; Cheng Lian; Qing Kang; Jue Chen
35085752,(R)-ketamine ameliorates demyelination and facilitates remyelination in cuprizone-treated mice: A role of gut-microbiota-brain axis.,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common demyelinating disease that attacks the central nervous system. We recently reported that the new antidepressant (R)-ketamine could ameliorate the disease progression in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model of MS. Cuprizone (CPZ) has been used to produce demyelination which resembles demyelination in MS patients. This study was undertaken to investigate whether (R)-ketamine could affect demyelination in CPZ-treated mice and remyelination after CPZ withdrawal. Repeated treatment with (R)-ketamine (10 mg/kg/day, twice weekly, for 6 weeks) significantly ameliorated demyelination and activated microglia in the brain compared with saline-treated mice. Furthermore, pretreatment with ANA-12 (TrkB antagonist) significantly blocked the beneficial effects of (R)-ketamine on the demyelination and activated microglia in the brain of CPZ-treated mice. The 16S rRNA analysis showed that (R)-ketamine significantly improved abnormal composition of gut-microbiota and decreased levels of lactic acid of CPZ-treated mice. In addition, there were significant correlations between demyelination (or microglial activation) in the brain and the relative abundance of several microbiome, suggesting a link between gut microbiota and brain. Interestingly, (R)-ketamine could facilitate remyelination in the brain after CPZ withdrawal. In conclusion, the study suggests that (R)-ketamine could ameliorate demyelination in the brain of CPZ-treated mice through TrkB activation, and that gut-microbiota-microglia crosstalk may play a role in the demyelination of CPZ-treated mice. Therefore, it is likely that (R)-ketamine could be a new therapeutic drug for MS.",Neurobiology of disease,2022,Xingming Wang; Lijia Chang; Xiayun Wan; Yunfei Tan; Youge Qu; Jiajing Shan; Yong Yang; Li Ma; Kenji Hashimoto
35279596,"Targeting NLRP3 inflammasome modulates gut microbiota, attenuates corticospinal tract injury and ameliorates neurobehavioral deficits after intracerebral hemorrhage in mice.","Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) has a high mortality and disability rate. Fewer studies focus on white matter injury (WMI) after ICH, especially the corticospinal tract (CST) injury located in the spinal cord, which correlates with motor impairments. Recent studies have shown that gut microbiota dysbiosis occurs after ICH. Furthermore, NLRP3 inflammasome can be activated after ICH, resulting in inflammatory cascade reactions and aggravating brain injury. However, no direct and causal correlation among NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition, altered gut microbiota, and CST injury following ICH has been reported. This study aimed to investigate the effect of MCC950, a selective NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor, on the gut microbiota and CST injury after ICH. We observed that compared with the sham group, the members of Firmicutes, such as Faecalibaculum and Dubosiella, were depleted in the ICH + Vehicle group, whereas the members of Proteobacteria and Campilobacterota were enriched, such as Enterobacter and Helicobacter. After treatment with MCC950, the Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium and Paenibacillus were relatively abundant in the gut flora of mice. Moreover, we observed CST injury located in cervical enlargement of the spinal cord, and MCC950 alleviated it. Furthermore, treatment with MCC950 decreased the mNSS score and brain water content in ICH. Taken together, the present study showed that MCC950 modulated gut microbiota, effectively attenuated CST injury located in cervical enlargement of the spinal cord, and ameliorated neurological deficits after ICH. This study provided a novel report that links NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition, gut microbiota alteration and CST injury following ICH and profound implications for ICH treatment.",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2022,Linglong Xiao; Huaping Zheng; Jing Li; Meiqin Zeng; Dian He; Jianhao Liang; Kaijian Sun; Yunhao Luo; Feng Li; Baohong Ping; Wen Yuan; Hongwei Zhou; Qinghua Wang; Haitao Sun
36140263,Alterations of the Composition and Neurometabolic Profile of Human Gut Microbiota in Major Depressive Disorder.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is among the most prevalent mental disorders worldwide. Factors causing the pathogenesis of MDD include gut microbiota (GM), which interacts with the host through the gut-brain axis. In previous studies of GM in MDD patients, 16S rRNA sequencing was used, which provided information about composition but not about function. In our study, we analyzed whole metagenome sequencing data to assess changes in both the composition and functional profile of GM. We looked at the GM of 36 MDD patients, compared with that of 38 healthy volunteers. Comparative taxonomic analysis showed decreased abundances of <i>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</i>, <i>Roseburia hominis</i>, and <i>Roseburia intestinalis</i>, and elevated abundances of <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Ruthenibacterium lactatiformans</i> in the GM of MDD patients. We observed decreased levels of bacterial genes encoding key enzymes involved in the production of arginine, asparagine, glutamate, glutamine, melatonin, acetic, butyric and conjugated linoleic acids, and spermidine in MDD patients. These genes produced signature pairs with <i>Faecalibacterium prausntizii</i> and correlated with decreased levels of this species in the GM of MDD patients. These results show the potential impact of the identified biomarker bacteria and their metabolites on the pathogenesis of MDD, and should be confirmed in future metabolomic studies.",Biomedicines,2022,Alexey S Kovtun; Olga V Averina; Irina Y Angelova; Roman A Yunes; Yana A Zorkina; Anna Y Morozova; Alexey V Pavlichenko; Timur S Syunyakov; Olga A Karpenko; George P Kostyuk; Valery N Danilenko

Neuromodulation encompasses a wide range of stimulation techniques and is used to treat neurological, psychiatric and metabolic disorders, like Parkinson's Disease, depression and obesity. Here, we performed a systematic review to investigate whether neuromodulation is associated with subsequent changes in the gut microbiota.

Included studies needed to be clinical or preclinical studies comparing the effects of deep brain stimulation, electroconvulsive therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation or vagal nerve stimulation on the gut microbiota before and after treatment or between active and control groups. Seven studies were identified. Neuromodulation was associated with changes in relative bacterial abundances, but not with (changes in) α-diversity or β-diversity. Summarizing, currently reported findings suggest that neuromodulation interventions are associated with moderate changes in the gut microbiome. However, findings remain inconclusive due to the limited number and varying quality of included studies, as well as the large heterogeneity between studies.

35631301,Anthocyanins in Chronic Diseases: The Power of Purple.,"Anthocyanins are mainly purple-coloured phenolic compounds of plant origin that as secondary metabolites are important in plant survival. Understanding their health benefits in humans requires sourcing these unstable compounds in sufficient quantities at a reasonable cost, which has led to improved methods of extraction. Dark-coloured fruits, cereals and vegetables are current sources of these compounds. The range of potential sustainable sources is much larger and includes non-commercialised native plants from around the world and agri-waste containing anthocyanins. In the last 5 years, there have been significant advances in developing the therapeutic potential of anthocyanins in chronic human diseases. Anthocyanins exert their beneficial effects through improvements in gut microbiota, oxidative stress and inflammation, and modulation of neuropeptides such as insulin-like growth factor-1. Their health benefits in humans include reduced cognitive decline; protection of organs such as the liver, as well as the cardiovascular system, gastrointestinal tract and kidneys; improvements in bone health and obesity; and regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism. This review summarises some of the sources of anthocyanins and their mechanisms and benefits in the treatment of chronic human diseases.",Nutrients,2022,Sunil K Panchal; Oliver D John; Michael L Mathai; Lindsay Brown

36648872,Obesity and Its Multiple Clinical Implications between Inflammatory States and Gut Microbiotic Alterations.,"Obesity is a chronic multifactorial disease that has become a serious health problem and is currently widespread over the world. It is, in fact, strongly associated with many other conditions, including insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, the onset of different types of malignant tumors and alterations in reproductive function. According to the literature, obesity is characterized by a state of low-grade chronic inflammation, with a substantial increase in immune cells, specifically macrophage infiltrates in the adipose tissue which, in turn, secrete a succession of pro-inflammatory mediators. Furthermore, recent studies on microbiota have postulated new possible mechanisms of interaction between obesity and unbalanced nutrition with inflammation. This intestinal ""superorganism"" complex seems to influence not only the metabolic balance of the host but also the immune response, favoring a state of systemic inflammation and insulin resistance. This review summarizes the major evidence on the interactions between the gut microbiota, energetic metabolism and host immune system, all leading to a convergence of the fields of immunology, nutrients physiology and microbiota in the context of obesity and its possible clinical complications. Finally, possible therapeutic approaches aiming to rebalance the intestinal microbial ecosystem are evaluated to improve the alteration of inflammatory and metabolic states in obesity and related diseases.","Diseases (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,Walter Milano; Francesca Carizzone; Mariagabriella Foia; Magda Marchese; Mariafrancesca Milano; Biancamaria Saetta; Anna Capasso

35600753,Gut microbiome in schizophrenia and antipsychotic-induced metabolic alterations: a scoping review.,"Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a severe mental disorder with high morbidity and lifetime disability rates. Patients with SCZ have a higher risk of developing metabolic comorbidities such as obesity and diabetes mellitus, leading to increased mortality. Antipsychotics (APs), which are the mainstay in the treatment of SCZ, increase the risk of these metabolic perturbations. Despite extensive research, the mechanism underlying SCZ pathophysiology and associated metabolic comorbidities remains unclear. In recent years, gut microbiota (GMB) has been regarded as a 'chamber of secrets', particularly in the context of severe mental illnesses such as SCZ, depression, and bipolar disorder. In this scoping review, we aimed to investigate the underlying role of GMB in the pathophysiology of SCZ and metabolic alterations associated with APs. Furthermore, we also explored the therapeutic benefits of prebiotic and probiotic formulations in managing SCZ and AP-induced metabolic alterations. A systematic literature search yielded 46 studies from both preclinical and clinical settings that met inclusion criteria for qualitative synthesis. Preliminary evidence from preclinical and clinical studies indicates that GMB composition changes are associated with SCZ pathogenesis and AP-induced metabolic perturbations. Fecal microbiota transplantation from SCZ patients to mice has been shown to induce SCZ-like behavioral phenotypes, further supporting the plausible role of GMB in SCZ pathogenesis. This scoping review recapitulates the preclinical and clinical evidence suggesting the role of GMB in SCZ symptomatology and metabolic adverse effects associated with APs.

Thus, the search for aetiological and pathophysiological parameters of TLE is ongoing. Preclinical work and post-mortem human studies suggest adult hippocampal neurogenesis as a potentially relevant factor in TLE pathogenesis. Although progress has been made in elucidating the molecular links between TLE and hippocampal neurogenesis, recent evidence suggests that additional peripheral mediators may be involved. The microbiota-gut-brain axis mediates bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain and could comprise a link between neurogenesis and TLE. In this review, we discuss emerging evidence highlighting a potential role for the gut microbiome in connecting TLE pathogenesis and hippocampal neurogenesis. We focus in particular on mechanisms associated with neuronal excitability, neuroinflammation and gut microbial metabolites. As the evidence does not yet support a direct link between gut microbiota-regulated hippocampal neurogenesis and TLE aetiology or pathophysiology, future studies are needed to establish whether current findings comprise circumstantial links or a potentially novel avenue for clinically relevant research.",Neurobiology of disease,2022,Sebastian Dohm-Hansen; Francisco Donoso; Paul J Lucassen; Gerard Clarke; Yvonne M Nolan
35207483,Novel Pharmacological Approaches to the Treatment of Depression.,"Major depressive disorder is one of the most prevalent mental health disorders. Monoamine-based antidepressants were the first drugs developed to treat major depressive disorder. More recently, ketamine and other analogues were introduced as fast-acting antidepressants. Unfortunately, currently available therapeutics are inadequate; lack of efficacy, adverse effects, and risks leave patients with limited treatment options. Efforts are now focused on understanding the etiology of depression and identifying novel targets for pharmacological treatment. In this review, we discuss promising novel pharmacological targets for the treatment of major depressive disorder. Targeting receptors including N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, G-protein-coupled receptor 39, metabotropic glutamate receptors, galanin and opioid receptors has potential antidepressant effects. Compounds targeting biological processes: inflammation, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, and gut microbiota have also shown therapeutic potential. Additionally, natural products including plants, herbs, and fatty acids improved depressive symptoms and behaviors. In this review, a brief history of clinically available antidepressants will be provided, with a primary focus on novel pharmaceutical approaches with promising antidepressant effects in preclinical and clinical studies.","Life (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,Elias Elias; Ariel Y Zhang; Melissa T Manners
35453597,Gut Microbiota-Brain Axis as a Potential Modulator of Psychological Stress after Spinal Cord Injury.,"A growing body of evidence from preclinical and clinical studies has associated alterations of the gut microbiota-brain axis with the progression and development of a number of pathological conditions that also affect cognitive functions. Spinal cord injuries (SCIs) can be produced from traumatic and non-traumatic causes. It has been reported that SCIs are commonly associated with anxiety and depression-like symptoms, showing an incidence range between 11 and 30% after the injury. These psychological stress-related symptoms are associated with worse prognoses in SCIs and have been attributed to psychosocial stressors and losses of independence. Nevertheless, emotional and mental modifications after SCI could be related to changes in the volume of specific brain areas associated with information processing and emotions. Additionally, physiological modifications have been recognized as a predisposing factor for mental health depletion, including the development of gut dysbiosis. This condition of imbalance in microbiota composition has been shown to be associated with depression in clinical and pre-clinical models. Therefore, the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the relationship between SCIs, gut dysbiosis and psychological stress could contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies to improve SCI patients' quality of life.",Biomedicines,2022,Samir Musleh-Vega; Jorge Ojeda; Pia M Vidal
35135531,Enhanced intestinal protein fermentation in schizophrenia.,"Emerging findings highlighted the associations of mental illness to nutrition and dysbiosis in the intestinal microbiota, but the underlying mechanisms, especially in schizophrenia (SZ), remain unclarified.We conducted a case-control study of SZ patients (case to control=100:52) by performing sequencing of the gut metagenome; measurement of fecal and plasma non-targeted metabolome; including short-, medium-, and long-chain fatty acids; and targeted metabolites, along with recorded details of daily intakes of food.The metagenome analysis uncovered enrichment of asaccharolytic species and reduced abundance of carbohydrate catabolism pathways and enzymes in the gut of SZ patients, but increased abundance of peptidases in contrast to their significantly reduced protein intake. Fecal metabolome analysis identified increased concentrations of many protein catabolism products, including amino acids (AAs), urea, branched short-chain fatty acids, and various nitrogenous derivates of aromatic AAs in SZ patients. Protein synthesis, represented by the abundance of AA-biosynthesis pathways and aminoacyl-tRNA transferases in metagenome, was significantly decreased. The AUCs (area under the curve) of the diagnostic random forest models based on their abundance achieved 85% and 91%, respectively. The fecal levels of AA-fermentative enzymes and products uniformly showed positive correlations with the severity of psychiatric symptoms.Our findings revealed apparent dysbiosis in the intestinal microbiome of SZ patients, where microbial metabolism is dominated by protein fermentation and shift from carbohydrate fermentation and protein synthesis in healthy conditions. The aberrant macronutrient metabolism by gut microbes highlights the importance of nutrition care and the potential for developing microbiota-targeted therapeutics in SZ.",BMC medicine,2022,Ying Liang; Xing Shi; Yang Shen; Zhuoran Huang; Jian Wang; Changjun Shao; Yanan Chu; Jing Chen; Jun Yu; Yu Kang
36363733,"Psycho-Microbiology, a New Frontier for Probiotics: An Exploratory Overview.","Probiotics are gradually gaining importance in the field of psychiatry in the form of psychobiotics. Psychobiotics' studies examine the existing relationship between gut microbiota and mental phenomena; the intake of certain strains of probiotics, such as <i>Bifidobacterium</i> and <i>Lactobacillus</i>, for example, allow the gut microbial system to be modified in order to provide benefits at the psychic, immune, hormonal, and mental levels. Those who suffer from forms of depression, anxiety disorders, chronic stress, low mood, but also people who do not suffer from such disorders, can therefore benefit from the use of psychobiotics. Thanks to probiotics, neurochemicals can in fact be produced within the gut microbiota and interact with receptors of the enteric nervous system that innervate the entire gastrointestinal tract. Once they enter the portal circulation, these substances go on to influence components of the nervous system and ultimately the brain, through what is called the gut-brain axis. This article proposes an exploratory overview of the proven effects of probiotics on brain activity and psycho-related diseases, focusing on clinical studies and measurable outcomes.

34907601,"Intergenerational effects of a paternal Western diet during adolescence on offspring gut microbiota, stress reactivity, and social behavior.","The global consumption of highly processed, calorie-dense foods has contributed to an epidemic of overweight and obesity, along with negative consequences for metabolic dysfunction and disease susceptibility. As it becomes apparent that overweight and obesity have ripple effects through generations, understanding of the processes involved is required, in both maternal and paternal epigenetic inheritance. We focused on the patrilineal effects of a Western-style high-fat (21%) and high-sugar (34%) diet (WD) compared to control diet (CD) during adolescence and investigated F0 and F1 mice for physiological and behavioral changes. F0 males (fathers) showed increased body weight, impaired glycemic control, and decreased attractiveness to females. Paternal WD caused significant phenotypic changes in F1 offspring, including higher body weights of pups, increased Actinobacteria abundance in the gut microbiota (ascertained using 16S microbiome profiling), a food preference for WD pellets, increased male dominance and attractiveness to females, as well as decreased behavioral despair. These results collectively demonstrate the long-term intergenerational effects of a Western-style diet during paternal adolescence. The behavioral and physiological alterations in F1 offspring provide evidence of adaptive paternal programming via epigenetic inheritance. These findings have important implications for understanding paternally mediated intergenerational inheritance, and its relevance to offspring health and disease susceptibility.",FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,2022,Carina Bodden; Terence Y Pang; Yingshi Feng; Faria Mridha; Geraldine Kong; Shanshan Li; Matthew J Watt; Amy C Reichelt; Anthony J Hannan

However, some films promoted options containing fibre, beneficial proteins, or polyphenols. These are gifts under the Christmas tree for our microbiota.Good balance is needed for our microbiota, and consequently our mental health. Many festive films portray a Western diet that can lead to dysbiosis. Through their action on the gut-brain axis and the influence of media on dietary choices, the festive foods consumed in these films (maybe an extra chocolate biscuit during Love Actually) can be stressful for our microbiota.",The Medical journal of Australia,2022,Olivia Yousef; Stephen De Souza
36037991,"Effects of spleen nerve denervation on depression-like phenotype, systemic inflammation, and abnormal composition of gut microbiota in mice after administration of lipopolysaccharide: A role of brain-spleen axis.","Accumulating evidence suggests the role of brain-spleen axis as well as brain-gut-microbiota axis in inflammation-related depression. The spleen mediates anti-inflammatory effects of the vagus nerve which plays a role in depression. However, the role of spleen nerve in inflammation-related depression remains unclear.The effects of the splenic nerve denervation (SND) in the depression-like phenotype, systemic inflammation, and abnormal composition of gut microbiota in adult mice after administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were examined.LPS (0.5 mg/kg) caused depression-like phenotype, systemic inflammation, splenomegaly, increased expression of Iba1 (ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1) and decreased expression of postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95) in the hippocampus in the sham-operated mice. In contrast, LPS did not produce depression-like phenotype, and abnormal expressions of Iba1 and PSD-95 in the hippocampus in the SND-operated mice. Furthermore, SND significantly blocked LPS-induced increased plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 although SND did not affect LPS-induced splenomegaly and increased plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor-α in mice. There were significant changes in several microbiota among the four groups. Interestingly, there were correlations between the relative abundance of several microbiota and Iba1 (or PSD-95) expression in the hippocampus. In addition, expression of Iba1 in the hippocampus was correlated with the relative abundance of several microbiota.Detailed mechanisms are unclear.These results suggest that the splenic nerve plays a role in inflammation-related depression, microglial activation in the hippocampus, and that gut microbiota may regulate microglial function in the brain via gut-microbiota-brain axis.",Journal of affective disorders,2022,Li Ma; Jiancheng Zhang; Yuko Fujita; Hiroyo Shinno-Hashimoto; Jiajing Shan; Xiayun Wan; Youge Qu; Lijia Chang; Xingming Wang; Kenji Hashimoto
35715396,Experiencing social exclusion changes gut microbiota composition.,"Gut microbiota is suggested to regulate the host's mental health via the gut-brain axis. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the microbiome and psychological pain due to social exclusion. Adult individuals with (n = 14) and without (n = 25) social exclusion experience were assessed for the psychological status using self-reported questionnaires: Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Beck Depression Inventory, and the UCLA Loneliness Scale. The gut microbiota was analyzed by 16 S rRNA gene sequencing and bioinformatics. The exclusion group had a 1.70-fold higher total BAI score and 2.16-fold higher levels of anxiety-related physical symptoms (p < 0.05). The gut microbial profiles also differed between the two groups. The exclusion group showed higher probability of having Prevotella-enriched microbiome (odds ratio, 2.29; 95% confidence interval, 1.65-2.75; p < 0.05), a significantly reduced Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, and decreased abundance of Faecalibacterium spp. (p < 0.05) which was associated with the duration and intensity of social exclusion (p < 0.05). Our results indicate that the psychological pain due to social exclusion is correlated with the gut microbiota composition, suggesting that targeting social exclusion-related microorganisms can be a new approach to solving psychological problems and related social issues.",Translational psychiatry,2022,Chong-Su Kim; Go-Eun Shin; Yunju Cheong; Ji-Hee Shin; Dong-Mi Shin; Woo Young Chun
36421473,New Insights into the Gut Microbiota in Neurodegenerative Diseases from the Perspective of Redox Homeostasis.,"An imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants in the body can lead to oxidative stress, which is one of the major causes of neurodegenerative diseases. The gut microbiota contains trillions of beneficial bacteria that play an important role in maintaining redox homeostasis. In the last decade, the microbiota-gut-brain axis has emerged as a new field that has revolutionized the study of the pathology, diagnosis, and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Indeed, a growing number of studies have found that communication between the brain and the gut microbiota can be accomplished through the endocrine, immune, and nervous systems. Importantly, dysregulation of the gut microbiota has been strongly associated with the development of oxidative stress-mediated neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, a deeper understanding of the relationship between the gut microbiota and redox homeostasis will help explain the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases from a new perspective and provide a theoretical basis for proposing new therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we will describe the role of oxidative stress and the gut microbiota in neurodegenerative diseases and the underlying mechanisms by which the gut microbiota affects redox homeostasis in the brain, leading to neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, we will discuss the potential applications of maintaining redox homeostasis by modulating the gut microbiota to treat neurodegenerative diseases, which could open the door for new therapeutic approaches to combat neurodegenerative diseases.","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,Yu Wang; Zhe Zhang; Bowen Li; Bo He; Lei Li; Edouard C Nice; Wei Zhang; Jia Xu

The assessment and treatment of eating disorders are also challenging, due to patients' denial of their illness and reluctance for change. Despite a large number of previous assessment and treatment studies, new strategies to overcome these difficulties are still needed. This study casts light on four aspects; involvement of the brain's reward system, stages of change in relationship with motivation, refeeding syndrome during renourishment, and gut microbiota changes relating to chronicity. Further studies relating to these aspects are encouraged.",Journal of nutritional science and vitaminology,2022,Kazuhiro Yoshiuchi; Hisashi Yamada; Shu Takakura; Masanori Isobe; Koutatsu Maruyama; Toshihiko Nagata
35432038,The Oral-Microbiome-Brain Axis and Neuropsychiatric Disorders: An Anthropological Perspective.,"In the 21st century, neuropsychiatric disorders (NPDs) are on the rise, yet the causal mechanisms behind this global epidemic remain poorly understood. A key to these unknowns may lie within the vast communities of bacteria, fungi, and viruses in the body (microbiota), which are intimately linked with health and disease. NPDs were recently shown to be connected to gut microbiota, which can communicate with and influence the brain through the Gut-Brain-Axis (GBA). Parallel studies examining oral microbiota and their connections to the brain also suggest that microbes in the mouth can similarly influence NPD outcomes. However, the mechanisms and pathways that illuminate how oral microbiota and brain communicate in NPDs remain unknown. Here, we review identified mechanisms and pathways that oral microbiota use to engage the brain, and we lay the theoretical foundation for an oral-microbiota-brain axis (OMBA). Specifically, we examine established neuroinflammatory and immune system activation responses that underpin interactions between the oral microbiota and the central nervous system (CNS), detailing four specific mechanisms: (1) microbial and metabolite escape, (2) neuroinflammation, (3) CNS signaling, and (4) response to neurohormones. We then scrutinize why including the OMBA, in addition to the GBA, is critically needed to elucidate specific causal relationships between microbial dysbiosis and observed NPD development and progression. Furthermore, we argue for comprehensive, interdisciplinary approaches that integrate lab-based microbiome research and population-level studies that examine the OMBA to improve NPDs. We specifically identify key anthropological perspectives that integrate sociocultural, epidemiological, genetic, and environmental factors that shape the oral microbiome and its interactions with NPDs. Together, future studies of the OMBA in conjunction with interdisciplinary approaches can be used to identify NPD risks and improve outcomes, as well as develop novel intervention and treatment strategies.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2022,Grace B Bowland; Laura S Weyrich
36120376,Neferine alleviates chronic stress-induced depression by regulating monoamine neurotransmitter secretion and gut microbiota structure.,"Neferine (Nef) might possess anti-depressive properties; however, its therapeutic effects are yet to be elucidated. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to explore the anti-depressant property of Nef using a mouse model of chronic stress-induced depression. Fifteen depression-prone mice were randomly selected and divided into three groups, namely, the model, Nef, and fluoxetine (Flu) groups. We observed that in tail suspension and forced swimming tests, the Nef and Flu treatments significantly decreased the immobility time of the depressed mice, and increased their sucrose preference indices. Moreover, both Nef and Flu treatments induced significant increases in the levels of anti-depressant neurotransmitters, including dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT), and norepinephrine (NE), and also reduced pathological damage to the hippocampus of the depressed mice. Incidentally, Illumina MiSeq sequencing analysis demonstrated that the relative abundance of <i>Lactobacillus</i> in the intestinal microbiota of depressed mice was restored after Nef/Flu treatment. Moreover, colonic <i>Lactobacillus</i> abundance was positively correlated with the levels of DA, 5-HT, and NE in the hippocampus of the mice. In conclusion, Nef improved monoamine neurotransmitter secretion and modulated the intestinal flora structure, particularly the abundance of <i>Lactobacillus</i>. Hence, it showed considerable anti-depressant potential, and might be a prospective anti-depressant therapeutic agent.",Frontiers in pharmacology,2022,Zaiquan Dong; Qinglian Xie; Feiyu Xu; Xiaoling Shen; Yanni Hao; Jin Li; Haizhen Xu; Qiang Peng; Weihong Kuang
35286767,Potential of Probiotics as an Adjunct for Patients with Major Depressive Disorder.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is an enfeebling disease with a lifetime incidence of 20%. While accumulating studies implicate a correlation between the disease and gut microbiota, data show that not every patient responded to probiotic treatments. To comprehensively assess the potential role of probiotics in MDD, this study first summarizes the current pathological hypothesis of the disease from a life-stage perspective, focuses on the potential role of ""depression gut microbiota."" Currently available managements are then briefly summarized and novel bio-materials having potential therapeutic effects on MDD are also evaluated. To harness the positive effect of probiotics, prebiotics, and postbiotics, clinical evidence and their applications on MDD patients are listed. Factors that may counteract the pre/probiotic applications, such as diet, physiology, gender difference, and use of antibiotics and antidepressants are also discussed. The endocannabinoid (eCBs) system may be promising targets for probiotic therapy. More evidence is needed to demonstrate the hierarchical factors in the complex network driving the disease, and probiotic can be one promising adjunct for patients with MDD.",Molecular nutrition & food research,2022,Weihe Cang; Junrui Wu; Ruixue Ding; Weiming Wang; Na Li; Haisu Shi; Lin Shi; Yuankun Lee; Rina Wu
36583066,Impact of broad-spectrum antibiotics on the gut-microbiota-spleen-brain axis.,"The spleen is a key immune-related organ that plays a role in communication between the brain and the immune system through the brain-spleen axis and brain-gut-microbiota axis. However, how the gut microbiota affects spleen and brain function remains unclear. Here, we investigated whether microbiome depletion induced by administration of an antibiotic cocktail (ABX) affects spleen and brain function. Treatment with ABX for 14 days resulted in a significant decrease in spleen weight and significant alterations in splenic functions, including the percentage of neutrophils, NK cells, macrophages, and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Furthermore, ABX treatment resulted in the depletion of a large portion of the gut microbiota. Untargeted metabolomics analysis showed that ABX treatment caused alterations in the levels of certain compounds in the plasma, spleen, and brain. Moreover, ABX treatment decreased the expression of microglia marker Iba1 in the cerebral cortex. Interestingly, correlations were found between the abundance of different microbiome components and metabolites in various tissues, as well as splenic cell populations and spleen weight.

36078738,The Role of Psychobiotics to Ensure Mental Health during the COVID-19 Pandemic-A Current State of Knowledge.,"Psychobiotics are defined as probiotics, mainly of the genus <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, that confer mental health benefits to the host when consumed in a particular quantity through the interaction with commensal gut microbiota. The gut microbiota, which means a diverse and dynamic population of microorganisms harboring the gastrointestinal tract, communicates with the brain and vice versa through the brain-gut axis. The mechanisms of action of psychobiotics may be divided into four groups: synthesis of neurotransmitters and neurochemicals, regulation of the HPA axis, influence on the immune system, and synthesis of metabolites. Recent years showed that the COVID-19 pandemic affected not only physical, but also mental health. Social isolation, fear of infection, the lack of adequate vaccine, disinformation, increased number of deaths, financial loss, quarantine, and lockdown are all factors can cause psychiatric problems. The aim of this review was to discuss the potential role of psychobiotic in light of the current problems, based on <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies, meta-analyses, clinical trials evidence, and registered studies assessing probiotics' therapeutic administration in the prevention or treatment of symptoms or side effects of COVID-19.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2022,Dorota Zielińska; Marcelina Karbowiak; Aneta Brzezicka

The role of the gut microbiota in decision-making in healthy humans thus far remains largely unknown. Our study establishes a functional relationship between the gut microbiota and healthy humans' decisions that involve risk and time. We conducted a between subjects' placebo-controlled double-blinded design, with two groups and two sessions separated by 28 days, during which participants received daily doses of probiotics or a placebo. We investigated whether the prolonged and controlled intake of probiotics affects risk-taking behavior and intertemporal choices using incentivized economic tasks. We found a significant decrease in risk-taking behavior and an increase in future-oriented choices in the probiotics group as compared to the placebo group. These findings provide the first direct experimental evidence suggesting a potential functional role on the part of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in decision-making, creating a path for potential clinical applications and allowing for a better understanding of the underlying neural mechanisms of risk-taking behavior and intertemporal choices.",Scientific reports,2022,Aline M Dantas; Alexander T Sack; Elisabeth Bruggen; Peiran Jiao; Teresa Schuhmann
36329546,A critical analysis of eating disorders and the gut microbiome.,"The gut microbiota, also known as our ""second brain"" is an exciting frontier of research across a multitude of health domains. Gut microbes have been implicated in feeding behaviour and obesity, as well as mental health disorders including anxiety and depression, however their role in the development and maintenance of eating disorders (EDs) has only recently been considered. EDs are complex mental health conditions, shaped by a complicated interplay of factors. Perhaps due to an incomplete understanding of the etiology of EDs, treatment remains inadequate with affected individuals likely to face many relapses. The gut microbiota may be a missing piece in understanding the etiology of eating disorders, however more robust scientific inquiry is needed in the field before concrete conclusions can be made. In this spotlight paper, we critically evaluate what is known about the bi-directional relationship between gut microbes and biological processes that are implicated in the development and maintenance of EDs, including physiological functioning, hormones, neurotransmitters, the central nervous system, and the immune system. We outline limitations of current research, propose concrete steps to move the field forward and, hypothesize potential clinical implications of this research. Our gut is inhabited by millions of bacteria which have more recently been referred to as ""our second brain"". In fact, these microbes are thought to play a role in ED behaviour, associated anxiety and depression, and even affect our weight. Recent research has dove into this field with promising findings that have the potential to be applied clinically to improve ED recovery. The present paper discusses what is known about the gut microbiome in relation to EDs and the promising implications that leveraging this knowledge, through fecal microbiome transplants, probiotics, and microbiome-directed supplemental foods, could have on ED treatment.",Journal of eating disorders,2022,Sydney M Terry; Jacqueline A Barnett; Deanna L Gibson
36959989,Emerging Role and Place of Probiotics in the Management of Pediatric Neurodevelopmental Disorders.,"The current decade has witnessed significant developments with the latest therapeutic agents for managing various infectious diseases to complex hemato-oncological conditions, leading to a decrease in morbidity and mortality, while improving the quality of life (QoL), and increasing the life span. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), which are on the rise across all age-groups, are being driven by unhealthy lifestyles and improved mental health issues. The current therapeutic agents were found to offer only symptomatic relief of varying efficacy and significant adverse effects, leading clinicians to evaluate other options for the management of both neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. The role of gut microbiota has emerged as a potential target for the treatment of both neurodegenerative diseases and neurodevelopmental disorders like attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)/autism spectrum disorders (ASD) as a result of the decoding of the human genome and advances in our understanding of the human gut microbiome, including its interactions with the human brain. This review has been undertaken to understand on date level of understanding of human microbiota and towards identifying probiotic strains with proven efficacy and safety. According to recent investigations, several <i>lactobacillus</i> strains, including <i>L.</i> <i>Paracasei 37</i>, <i>L. Planetarium 128, L. reuteri DSM 17938</i>, and <i>Bifidobacterium longum</i>, have been effective in treating children's neurodevelopmental disorders such as ASD and ADHD. Future clinical studies are nonetheless required to confirm the long-term safety and effectiveness of probiotic strains in managing the primary and comorbid symptoms, hence improving patient and family quality of life.Khanna HN, Roy S, Shaikh A, <i>et al.</i> Emerging Role and Place of Probiotics in the Management of Pediatric Neurodevelopmental Disorders.

35731901,"The clinical and mechanistic roles of bile acids in depression, Alzheimer's disease, and stroke.","The burden of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders continues to grow with significant impacts on human health and social economy worldwide. Increasing clinical and preclinical evidences have implicated that bile acids (BAs) are involved in the onset and progression of neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases. Here, we summarized recent studies of BAs in three types of highly prevalent brain disorders, depression, Alzheimer's disease, and stroke. The shared and specific BA profiles were explored and potential markers associated with disease development and progression were summarized. The mechanistic roles of BAs were reviewed with focuses on inflammation, gut-brain-microbiota axis, cellular apoptosis. We also discussed future perspectives for the prevention and treatment of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders by targeting BAs and related molecules and gut microbiota. Our understanding of BAs and their roles in brain disorders is still evolving. A large number of questions still need to be addressed on the emerging crosstalk among central, peripheral, intestine, and their contribution to brain and mental health.",Proteomics,2022,Wu Lirong; Zhao Mingliang; Li Mengci; Guo Qihao; Ren Zhenxing; Zheng Xiaojiao; Chen Tianlu
35779628,(R)-ketamine as prophylactic and therapeutic drug for neurological disorders: Beyond depression.,"Neurological disorders are the leading cause of disability and the second leading cause of death worldwide. The increasing social and economic burdens of neurological disorders are driven by global population growth and aging. Depression is a common psychiatric symptom in numerous neurological disorders. It is also a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias, Parkinson's disease (PD), and stroke. The rapid-acting and sustained antidepressant actions of (R,S)-ketamine for severe depression was accidentally discovered. Interestingly, (R)-ketamine has greater potency and longer-lasting antidepressant-like effects than (S)-ketamine in rodents. Importantly, its side effects in rodents and humans are lower than those of (R,S)-ketamine and (S)-ketamine. Furthermore, (R)-ketamine could elicit beneficial actions in various rodent models of neurological disorders, including PD, multiple sclerosis (MS), and stroke. In this article, we review the potential of (R)-ketamine as a prophylactic or therapeutic drug for neurological disorders including AD and other dementias, PD, MS, and stroke.",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,2022,Xingming Wang; Jianjun Yang; Kenji Hashimoto
36104346,"Maternal immune activation induces autism-like changes in behavior, neuroinflammatory profile and gut microbiota in mouse offspring of both sexes.","Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a sex-biased neurodevelopmental disorder with a male to female prevalence of 4:1, characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and interaction and restricted-repetitive patterns of behavior, interests or activities. Microbiota alterations as well as signs of neuroinflammation have been also reported in ASD. The involvement of immune dysregulation in ASD is further supported by evidence suggesting that maternal immune activation (MIA), especially during early pregnancy, may be a risk factor for ASD. The present study was aimed at characterizing the effects of MIA on behavior, gut microbiota and neuroinflammation in the mouse offspring also considering the impact of MIA in the two sexes. MIA offspring exhibited significant ASD-like behavioral alterations (i.e., deficits in sociability and sensorimotor gating, perseverative behaviors). The analysis of microbiota revealed changes in specific microbial taxa that recapitulated those seen in ASD children. In addition, molecular analyses indicated sex-related differences in the neuroinflammatory responses triggered by MIA, with a more prominent effect in the cerebellum. Our data suggest that both sexes should be included in the experimental designs of preclinical studies in order to identify those mechanisms that confer different vulnerability to ASD to males and females.",Translational psychiatry,2022,Anna Maria Tartaglione; Annacandida Villani; Maria Antonietta Ajmone-Cat; Luisa Minghetti; Laura Ricceri; Valerio Pazienza; Roberta De Simone; Gemma Calamandrei

36191590,Features of gut microbiota in patients with anorexia nervosa.,"Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a psychological disorder, which is characterized by the misunderstanding of body image, food restriction, and low body weight. An increasing number of studies have reported that the pathophysiological mechanism of AN might be associated with the dysbiosis of gut microbiota. The purpose of our study was to explore the features of gut microbiota in patients with AN, hoping to provide valuable information on its pathogenesis and treatment.In this cross-sectional study, from August 2020 to June 2021, patients with AN who were admitted into Peking University Third Hospital and Peking University Sixth Hospital ( n   =  30) were recruited as the AN group, and healthy controls (HC) were recruited from a middle school and a university in Beijing ( n   =  30). Demographic data, Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) scores of the two groups, and length of stay of the AN group were recorded. Microbial diversity analysis of gut microbiota in stool samples from the two groups was analyzed by 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing.The weight (AN vs. HC, [39.31 ± 7.90] kg vs. [56.47 ± 8.88] kg, P  < 0.001) and body mass index (BMI, AN vs. HC, [14.92 ± 2.54] kg/m 2vs. [20.89 ± 2.14] kg/m 2 , P  < 0.001) of patients with AN were statistically significantly lower than those of HC, and HAMD scores in AN group were statistically significantly higher than those of HC. For alpha diversity, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups; for beta diversity, the two groups differed obviously regarding community composition. Compared to HC, the proportion of Lachnospiraceae in patients with AN was statistically significantly higher (AN vs. HC, 40.50% vs. 31.21%, Z  = -1.981, P  = 0.048), while that of Ruminococcaceae was lower (AN vs. HC, 12.17% vs. 19.15%, Z  = -2.728, P  = 0.007); the proportion of Faecalibacterium (AN vs. HC, 3.97% vs. 9.40%, Z  = -3.638, P  < 0.001) and Subdoligranulum (AN vs. HC, 4.60% vs. 7.02%, Z  = -2.369, P  = 0.018) were statistically significantly lower, while that of Eubacterium_hallii_group was significantly higher (AN vs. HC, 7.63% vs. 3.43%, Z  = -2.115, P  = 0.035). Linear discriminant effect (LEfSe) analysis (LDA score >3.5) showed that o_Lachnospirales, f_Lachnospiraceae, and g_Eubacterium_hallii_group (o, f and g represents order, family and genus respectively) were enriched in patients with AN. Microbial function of nutrient transport and metabolism in AN group were more abundant ( P  > 0.05). In AN group, weight and BMI were significantly negatively correlated with the abundance of Bacteroidota and Bacteroides , while positively correlated with Subdoligranulum . BMI was significantly positively correlated with Firmicutes; HAMD scores were significantly negatively correlated with Faecalibacterium.The composition of gut microbiota in patients with AN was different from that of healthy people.

36549572,The effect of microbiome composition on impulsive and violent behavior: A systematic review.,"The impact of the microbiome on brain function and behavior has recently become an important research topic. We searched for a link between the gut microbiome and impulsive and violent behavior. We focused on critical factors influencing the microbiome establishment that may affect human health later in life, i.e., delivery mode, early-life feeding, and early antibiotic exposure. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. We included original human studies examining adults and children with impulsive and/or violent behavior that assessed the gut microbiota composition of participants, delivery mode, infant feeding mode, or early antibiotic exposure. Bibliographic searches yielded 429 articles, and 21 met the eligibility criteria. Two studies reported data on patients with schizophrenia with violent behavior, while 19 studies reported data on patients with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The results showed several bacterial taxa associated with ADHD symptomatology and with violent behavior in patients with schizophrenia. No association was found between delivery mode and impulsive behavior, nor did any articles relate infant feeding mode to violent human behavior. Those studies investigating early antibiotic exposure yielded ambiguous results. The heterogeneity of the data and the different methodologies of the included studies limited the external validity of the results. We found few studies that addressed the possible microbiome involvement in the pathophysiology of impulsive and violent behavior in humans. Our review revealed a gap in knowledge regarding links between the gut microbiome and these extreme behavioral patterns.",Behavioural brain research,2023,Michaela Langmajerová; Radka Roubalová; Antonín Šebela; Jan Vevera

There is a significant risk of obesity in people with schizophrenia. This work proposed that the disorder of gut microbiota in patients with schizophrenia was based on microbial enterotypes. Ninety-seven patients with schizophrenia and 69 matched health controls were eligible. The fresh feces of all the subjects were collected and used to complete 16S rRNA sequence. Statistical analysis was performed to identify the intestinal type of gut microbiota and analyze their potential effects on metabolic function. The patients with enterotype-P had a higher BMI than that of the others. Several differences in the gut microbes of enterotype-P were found between the patients and the controls. Proteobacteria and Firmicutes had significantly higher abundance in the patients' group with enterotype-P. The Bacteroidetes had higher abundance in health controls with enterotype-P. Different metabolic pathways of the microbiota with the enterotype-P were identified in the subjects categorized in different BMI intervals. The schizophrenia patients had a significantly higher BMI than that of health controls. The patients with enterotype-P had a higher BMI. Therefore, the enterotype-P might have a critical influence on a variety of metabolic pathways to disturb the metabolism of glucose and lipid in human body.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2022,Ying Liang; Yang Shen; Gaofei Li; Ye Yuan; Meng Zhang; Jiayu Gao
35956395,Positive Effects of α-Lactalbumin in the Management of Symptoms of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.,"To date, the involvement of α-Lactalbumin (α-LA) in the management of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) refers to its ability to improve intestinal absorption of natural molecules like inositols, overcoming the inositol resistance. However, due to its own aminoacidic building blocks, α-LA is involved in various biological processes that can open new additional applications. A great portion of women with PCOS exhibit gastrointestinal dysbiosis, which is in turn one of the triggering mechanisms of the syndrome. Due to its prebiotic effect, α-LA can recover dysbiosis, also improving the insulin resistance, obesity and intestinal inflammation frequently associated with PCOS. Further observations suggest that altered gut microbiota negatively influence mental wellbeing. Depressive mood and low serotonin levels are indeed common features of women with PCOS. Thanks to its content of tryptophan, which is the precursor of serotonin, and considering the strict link between gut and brain, using α-LA contributes to preserving mental well-being by maintaining high levels of serotonin. In addition, considering women with PCOS seeking pregnancy, both altered microbiota and serotonin levels can induce later consequences in the offspring. Therefore, a deeper knowledge of potential applications of α-LA is required to transition to preclinical and clinical studies extending its therapeutic advantages in PCOS.",Nutrients,2022,Vincenzo Cardinale; Elisa Lepore; Sabrina Basciani; Salvatore Artale; Maurizio Nordio; Mariano Bizzarri; Vittorio Unfer

Recent observational studies of US adults demonstrated that lifetime MDMA use was associated with lower risk of depression. Here, we examined whether repeated administration of MDMA can affect resilience versus susceptibility in mice exposed to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS). CSDS produced splenomegaly, anhedonia-like phenotype, and higher plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the saline-treated mice. In contrast, CSDS did not cause these changes in the MDMA-treated mice. Analysis of gut microbiome found several microbes altered between saline + CSDS group and MDMA + CSDS group. Untargeted metabolomics analysis showed that plasma levels of N-epsilon-methyl-L-lysine in the saline + CSDS group were significantly higher than those in the control and MDMA + CSDS groups.

36558556,The Effect of Breast Milk Microbiota on the Composition of Infant Gut Microbiota: A Cohort Study.,"Evidence shows that breast milk microbiota and an infant’s gut microbiota are related. This study aimed to compare the effects of breast milk microbiota on the construction and colonization of gut microbiota in newborns. In this study, 23 healthy infants were selected and divided into a breastfeeding group (13) and a mixed feeding group (10) based on the feeding method within one month of age. Infant fecal and breast milk samples were collected on the day of birth (0 day) and 30 days after birth (30 days) for 16S rRNA second-generation sequencing and SCFA detection. The results showed that Firmicutes and Actinobacteriota on day 0 and Firmicutes and Proteobacteria on 30 d dominated breast milk gut microbiota. There were correlations between the breast milk microbiota and the infant gut microbiota in each group (p < 0.05). Additionally, breast milk microbiota correlated more significantly with infants’ SCFAs in the breastfeeding group than in the mixed feeding group. This study showed that breast milk microbiota partially influences the construction of infant gut microbiota, with some key strains having a crucial influence, such as Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Enterobacter. However, the effect of breast milk microbiota on infant gut microbiota is not through direct strain transmission but has been indirectly influenced, which may be related to the cross-feeding effect mediated by SCFAs.",Nutrients,2022,Yapeng Li; Lei Ren; Yunyi Wang; Jinxing Li; Qingqing Zhou; Chenrui Peng; Yuchen Li; Ruyue Cheng; Fang He; Xi Shen
35312049,Can gut microbiota throughout the first 10 years of life predict executive functioning in childhood?,"Animal models suggest that the gut microbiota can influence cognitive development and functioning via various pathways. In line with that, a first human study found associations between infant fecal microbiota composition and cognition at 2 years of age. This longitudinal study investigated whether fecal microbiota composition in infancy and childhood is associated with executive functioning in childhood. We followed healthy individuals from birth to their 10th year of life. Executive functioning was assessed using the Digit Span working memory test at 10 years of age and the ecologically valid Behavior Rating Inventory for executive functioning at 8 and 10 years. Stool samples were collected at month 1, 3 and 4 as well as at 6 and 10 years. The V4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA was analyzed to determine microbial composition at the genus level. Using established statistical techniques for microbiota analysis, we did not find associations between fecal microbiota composition and executive functioning after accounting for breastfeeding, maternal education, child sex and age. Our study results are most compatible with the absence or only a weak relationship between infant and childhood fecal microbiota composition and executive functioning in childhood in healthy community children.",Developmental psychobiology,2022,Henrik Andreas Eckermann; Yangwenshan Ou; Leo Lahti; Carolina de Weerth
35666299,Gut-microbiota-brain axis in the vulnerability to psychosis in adulthood after repeated cannabis exposure during adolescence.,"Increasing epidemiological evidence shows that the use of cannabis during adolescence could increase the risk for psychosis in adulthood. However, the precise mechanisms underlying long-lasting cannabis-induced risk for psychosis remain unclear. Accumulating evidence suggests the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders. Here, we examined whether gut microbiota plays a role in the risk for psychosis of adult after exposure of cannabinoid (CB) receptor agonist WIN55,212-2 during adolescence. Repeated administration of WIN55,212-2 (2 mg/kg/day) during adolescence (P35-P45) significantly increased the expression of Iba1 (ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) of adult mice after administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS: 0.5 mg/kg). In contrast, there were no changes in blood levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines between the two groups. Although alpha-diversity and beta-diversity of gut microbiota were no differences between the two groups, there were several microbes altered between the two groups. Interestingly, there were significant correlations between the relative abundance of microbiota and Iba1 expression in the mPFC and NAc. Furthermore, there were also significant correlations between the relative abundance of microbiota and several metabolites in the blood. These findings suggest that gut microbiota may play a role in the microglial activation in the mPFC and NAc of adult mice after repeated WIN55,212-2 exposure during adolescence. Therefore, it is likely that gut-microbiota-microglia crosstalk might play a role in increased risk for psychosis in adults with cannabis use during adolescence.",European archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience,2022,Xiayun Wan; Akifumi Eguchi; Youge Qu; Yong Yang; Lijia Chang; Jiajing Shan; Chisato Mori; Kenji Hashimoto
35799798,Association Between Non-Suicidal Self-Injury and Gut Microbial Characteristics in Chinese Adolescent.,"By exploring the gut-related microbiota differences of adolescents with non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and depression (without NSSI) and healthy volunteers, we provide a theoretical basis for the prevention and control of NSSI in adolescents through intestinal microecological regulation.A total of 99 subjects were recruited in Guangdong Province, China, including 51 adolescents with NSSI (KD), 24 healthy adolescents (NOR1), and 24 depression adolescents without NSSI (NOR2). General clinical data and fecal samples were collected from all subjects, who were assessed using the NSSI Behavioral Questionnaire and the 24-item Hamilton Depression Scale. The taxonomic composition of the gut microbiota was determined using the 16S rDNA gene sequencing method.There were significant differences in diversity between the KD and NOR1, and the species uniformity index of the KD according to the Shannon and Simpson indices was significantly reduced compared with that of the NOR1 (4.81 vs 5.21, p<0.01; 0.02 vs 0.01, p<0.05). The relative abundances were different among the KD, NOR1 and NOR2, as reflected at the taxonomic levels of class, order, family, genus, and species. Bacteroides were the dominant flora of the KD and NOR2, while Mitsuokella was the dominant flora that distinguished the KD from the NOR2.We found that gut microbiota diversity was decreased in adolescents with NSSI, and the relative abundance was altered at different taxonomic levels. These results enrich the understanding of the relationship between NSSI and depression and the gut microbiota, Supporting that NSSI and depression are not homologous disorders. What is more, it establishes the basis for exploring the mechanisms of flora action in NSSI, providing a possible direction for NSSI to achieve a better prognosis and prevent relapse.",Neuropsychiatric disease and treatment,2022,Li-Fei Cai; Shi-Bin Wang; Cai-Lan Hou; Ze-Bin Li; Yi-Jun Liao; Fu-Jun Jia
35024387,Altered stress responses in adults born by Caesarean section.,"Birth by Caesarean-section (C-section), which increases the risk for metabolic and immune disorders, disrupts the normal initial microbial colonisation of the gut, in addition to preventing early priming of the stress and immune-systems.. Animal studies have shown there are enduring psychological processes in C-section born mice. However, the long-term impact of microbiota-gut-brain axis disruptions due to birth by C-section on psychological processes in humans is unknown. Forty age matched healthy young male university students born vaginally and 36 C-section delivered male students were recruited. Participants underwent an acute stressor, the Trier social stress test (TSST), during a term-time study visit. A subset of participants also completed a study visit during the university exam period, representing a naturalistic stressor. Participants completed a battery of cognitive tests and self-report measures assessing mood, anxiety, and perceived stress. Saliva, blood, and stool samples were collected for analysis of cortisol, peripheral immune profile, and the gut microbiota. Young adults born by C-section exhibit increased psychological vulnerability to acute stress and a prolonged period of exam-related stress. They did not exhibit an altered salivary cortisol awakening response to the TSST, but their measures of positive affect were significantly lower than controls throughout the procedure. Both C-section and vaginally-delivered participants performed equally well on cognitive assessments. Most of the initial effects of delivery mode on the gut microbiome did not persist into adulthood as the gut microbiota profile showed modest changes in composition in adult vaginally-delivered and C-sectioned delivered subjects. From an immune perspective, concentrations of IL-1β and 1L-10 were higher in C-section participants. These data confirm that there is a potential enduring effect of delivery mode on the psychological responses to acute stress during early adulthood.

36370535,"Gut mycobiota dysbiosis in drug-naïve, first-episode schizophrenia.","Bacterial dysbiosis has been demonstrated in patients with schizophrenia (SCH). The aim of the present study was to investigate alterations in mycobiota composition and fungi-bacteria correlation network in drug-naïve, first episode SCH. We recruited 205 SCH patients and 125 healthy controls (HCs), whose gut bacterial and fungal compositions were characterized by 16S and 18S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing, respectively. Fungal-bacterial relative correlation network analysis was performed using the Spearman's test and distance correlation. We also computed relative networks connectedness, which represents the ratio of significant interactions (edges) and taxa (nodes) in the network. SCH patients showed lower fungal α-diversity compared with that of HCs. Furthermore, we identified 29 differential fungal markers at multiple taxonomies between SCH patients and HCs. SCH patients also showed a significantly lower fungi-to-bacteria α-diversity ratio compared with that of HCs (p = 1.81 × 10<sup>-8</sup>). In risk prediction models, we observed that combining bacterial and fungal markers achieved higher accuracy than that of bacterial markers alone (AUC = 0.847 vs AUC = 0.739; p = 0.043). Fungal-bacterial correlation network was denser in HCs than in SCH patients and was characterized by a high number of neighbors (p < 0.05). In addition, an increased abundance of Purpureocillium was associated with more severe psychiatric symptoms and poorer cognitive function in SCH patients (p < 0.05). Our study demonstrated a disrupted and weakened fungi-bacteria network in SCH patients, which might be associated with their clinical manifestations. Future research on fungal-bacterial correlation network is warranted to advance our understanding about the role of mycobiota in the etiology of SCH and to explore novel intervention approaches.",Schizophrenia research,2022,Xiuxia Yuan; Xue Li; Yulin Kang; Lijuan Pang; Gangrui Hei; Xiaoyun Zhang; Shuying Wang; Xinyi Zhao; Siwei Zhang; Qi Tao; Liyuan Zhang; Qiyue Zhu; Luxian Lv; Xiaoduo Fan; Shaohua Hu; Xueqin Song

36699448,The host genetics affects gut microbiome diversity in Chinese depressed patients.,"The gut microbiome and host genetics are both associated with major depressive disorder (MDD); however, the molecular mechanisms among the associations are poorly understood, especially in the Asian, Chinese group. Our study applied linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) and genome-wide association analysis in the cohort with both gut sequencing data and genomics data. We reported the different gut microbiota characteristics between MDD and control groups in the Chinese group and further constructed the association between host genetics and the gut microbiome. <i>Actinobacteria</i> and <i>Pseudomonades</i> were found more in the MDD group.

35399732,Gut-Thyroid axis: How gut microbial dysbiosis associated with euthyroid thyroid cancer.,"Thyroid cancer in humans has a fast-growing prevalence, with the most common lethal endocrine malignancy for unknown reasons<b>.</b> The current study was aimed to perform qualitative and quantitative investigation and characterization of the gut bacterial composition of euthyroid thyroid cancer patients. The fecal samples were collected from sixteen euthyroid thyroid cancer patients and ten from healthy subjects. The PCR-DGGE was conducted by targetting the V3 region of 16S rRNA gene, as well as real-time PCR for <i>Bacteroides vulgatus, E.coli Bifidobacterium, Clostridium leptum</i> and <i>Lactobacillus</i> were carried. High-throughput sequencing of V3+V4 region of 16S rRNA gene was performed on Hiseq 2500 platform on 20 (10 healthy & 10 diseased subjects) randomly selected fecal samples. The richness indices and comparative diversity analysis showed significant gut microbial modification in euthyroid thyroid cancer than control. At phylum level, there was significant enrichment of Firmicutes, Verrucomicrobia, while a significant decrease in Bacteroidetes was detected in the experimental group. At family statistics, significant high levels of Ruminococcaceae and Verrucomicrobiaceae, while the significant lower abundance of Bacteroidaceae, Prevotellaceae, Porphyromonadaceae, and Alcaligenaceae was after observed. It also found that the significantly raised level of <i>Escherichia-Shigella, Akkermansia</i> [Eubacterium]_coprostanoligenes<i>, Dorea, Subdoligranulum,</i> and <i>Ruminococcus_2 genera,</i> while significantly lowered genera of the patient group were <i>Prevotella_9</i>, <i>Bacteroides</i> and <i>Klebsiella</i>. The species-level gut microbial composition showed a significantly raised level of <i>Escherichia coli in</i> euthyroid thyroid cancer. Thus, this study reveals that euthyroid thyroid cancer patients have significant gut microbial dysbiosis.

36191806,A role of gut-microbiota-brain axis via subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve in depression-like phenotypes in Chrna7 knock-out mice.,"The α7 subtype of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7 nAChR: coded by Chrna7) is known to regulate the cholinergic ascending anti-inflammatory pathway. We previously reported that Chrna7 knock-out (KO) mice show depression-like behaviors through abnormal composition of gut microbiota and systemic inflammation. Given the role of subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve in gut-microbiota-brain axis, we investigated whether subdiaphragmatic vagotomy (SDV) could affect depression-like behaviors, abnormal composition of gut microbiota, and microbes-derived metabolites in Chrna7 KO mice. SDV blocked depression-like behaviors and reduced expression of synaptic proteins in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of Chrna7 KO mice. LEfSe (linear discriminant analysis effect size) analysis revealed that the species Lactobacillus sp. BL302, the species Lactobacillus hominis, and the species Lactobacillus reuteri, were identified as potential microbial markers in the KO + SDV group. There were several genus and species altered among the three groups [wild-type (WT) + sham group, KO + sham group, KO + SDV group]. Furthermore, there were several plasma metabolites altered among the three groups. Moreover, there were correlations between relative abundance of several microbiome and behavioral data (or synaptic proteins).

35967810,The Potential of Honey as a Prebiotic Food to Re-engineer the Gut Microbiome Toward a Healthy State.,"Honey has a long history of use for the treatment of digestive ailments. Certain honey types have well-established bioactive properties including antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities. In addition, honey contains non-digestible carbohydrates in the form of oligosaccharides, and there is increasing evidence from <i>in vitro</i>, animal, and pilot human studies that some kinds of honey have prebiotic activity. Prebiotics are foods or compounds, such as non-digestible carbohydrates, that are used to promote specific, favorable changes in the composition and function of the gut microbiota. The gut microbiota plays a critical role in human health and well-being, with disturbances to the balance of these organisms linked to gut inflammation and the development and progression of numerous conditions, such as colon cancer, irritable bowel syndrome, obesity, and mental health issues. Consequently, there is increasing interest in manipulating the gut microbiota to a more favorable balance as a way of improving health by dietary means. Current research suggests that certain kinds of honey can reduce the presence of infection-causing bacteria in the gut including <i>Salmonella</i>, <i>Escherichia coli</i>, and <i>Clostridiodes difficile</i>, while simultaneously stimulating the growth of potentially beneficial species, such as <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Bifidobacteria.</i> In this paper, we review the current and growing evidence that shows the prebiotic potential of honey to promote healthy gut function, regulate the microbial communities in the gut, and reduce infection and inflammation. We outline gaps in knowledge and explore the potential of honey as a viable option to promote or re-engineer a healthy gut microbiome.",Frontiers in nutrition,2022,Kathleen R Schell; Kenya E Fernandes; Erin Shanahan; Isabella Wilson; Shona E Blair; Dee A Carter; Nural N Cokcetin
36058421,Altered gut microbiota correlates with behavioral problems but not gastrointestinal symptoms in individuals with autism.,"Despite inconsistent results across studies, emerging evidence suggests that the microbial micro-environment may be associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Geographical and cultural factors highly impact microbial profiles, and there is a shortage of data from East Asian populations. This study aimed to comprehensively characterize microbial profiles in an East Asian sample and explore whether gut microbiota contributes to clinical symptoms, emotional/behavioral problems, and GI symptoms in ASD.We assessed 82 boys and young men with ASD and 31 typically developing controls (TDC), aged 6-25 years. We analyzed the stool sample of all participants with 16S V3-V4 rRNA sequencing and correlated its profile with GI symptoms, autistic symptoms, and emotional/behavioral problems.Autistic individuals, compared to TDC, had worse GI symptoms. There were no group differences in alpha diversity of species richness estimates (Shannon-wiener and Simpson diversity indices). Participants with ASD had an increased relative abundance of Fusobacterium, Ruminococcus torques group (at the genus level), and Bacteroides plebeius DSM 17135 (at the species level), while a decreased relative abundance of Ruminococcaceae UCG 013, Ervsipelotrichaceae UCG 003, Parasutterella, Clostridium sensu stricto 1, Turicibacter (at the genus level), and Clostridium spiroforme DSM 1552 and Intestinimonas butyriciproducens (at the species level). Altered taxonomic diversity in ASD significantly correlated with autistic symptoms, thought problems, delinquent behaviors, self dysregulation, and somatic complaints. We did not find an association between gut symptoms and gut microbial dysbiosis.Our findings suggest that altered microbiota are associated with behavioral phenotypes but not GI symptoms in ASD. The function of the identified microbial profiles mainly involves the immune pathway, supporting the hypothesis of a complex relationship between altered microbiome, immune dysregulation, and ASD that may advance the discovery of molecular biomarkers for ASD.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2022,Yu-Chieh Chen; Hsiang-Yuan Lin; Yiling Chien; Yu-Hung Tung; Yen-Hsuan Ni; Susan Shur-Fen Gau
35981685,Depression-like behaviors in mouse model of Sjögren's syndrome: A role of gut-microbiota-brain axis.,"Depression is a common psychiatric symptom in patients with Sjögren's syndrome (SS). Prevalence of depression in SS patients is significantly higher than that in the general population. Increasing evidence suggests a crucial role of gut-microbiota-brain axis in depression. In this study, we investigated whether non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, a widely used animal model of SS, exhibit depression-like phenotypes and abnormal composition of gut microbiota. Eleven-week-old NOD mice spontaneously exhibited SS-related symptoms without pancreatic destruction. NOD mice displayed depression-like behaviors, decreased expression of synaptic proteins in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and abnormal composition of gut microbiota. Interestingly, SS-related proinflammatory factors in the submandibular gland (SMG) and autoantibodies (anti-SSA and anti-SSB) in the plasma were correlated with the expression of synaptic proteins in the PFC or depression-like behaviors. In addition, there were correlations between the relative abundance of microbiota and SS-related symptoms (or depression-related phenotypes). These data suggest that SS-related symptoms and abnormal composition of gut microbiota may play a role in depression-like phenotypes in NOD mice through gut-microbiota-brain axis.","Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior",2022,Yaoyu Pu; Yangyang He; Xueting Zhao; Qiuping Zhang; Ji Wen; Kenji Hashimoto; Yi Liu

35309241,Consensus on potential biomarkers developed for use in clinical tests for schizophrenia.,"Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness affecting approximately 20 million individuals globally. Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the illness. If left undiagnosed and untreated, schizophrenia results in impaired social function, repeated hospital admissions, reduced quality of life and decreased life expectancy. Clinical diagnosis largely relies on subjective evidence, including self-reported experiences, and reported behavioural abnormalities followed by psychiatric evaluation. In addition, psychoses may occur along with other conditions, and the symptoms are often episodic and transient, posing a significant challenge to the precision of diagnosis. Therefore, objective, specific tests using biomarkers are urgently needed for differential diagnosis of schizophrenia in clinical practice.We aimed to provide evidence-based and consensus-based recommendations, with a summary of laboratory measurements that could potentially be used as biomarkers for schizophrenia, and to discuss directions for future research.We searched publications within the last 10 years with the following keywords: 'schizophrenia', 'gene', 'inflammation', 'neurotransmitter', 'protein marker', 'gut microbiota', 'pharmacogenomics' and 'biomarker'. A draft of the consensus was discussed and agreed on by all authors at a round table session.We summarised the characteristics of candidate diagnostic markers for schizophrenia, including genetic, inflammatory, neurotransmitter, peripheral protein, pharmacogenomic and gut microbiota markers. We also proposed a novel laboratory process for diagnosing schizophrenia in clinical practice based on the evidence summarised in this paper.Further efforts are needed to identify schizophrenia-specific genetic and epigenetic markers for precise diagnosis, differential diagnosis and ethnicity-specific markers for the Chinese population. The development of novel laboratory techniques is making it possible to use these biomarkers clinically to diagnose disease.",General psychiatry,2022,Ping Lin; Junyu Sun; Xiaoyan Lou; Dan Li; Yun Shi; Zhenhua Li; Peijun Ma; Ping Li; Shuzi Chen; Weifeng Jin; Shuai Liu; Qing Chen; Qiong Gao; Lili Zhu; Jie Xu; Mengyuan Zhu; Mengxia Wang; Kangyi Liang; Ling Zhao; Huabin Xu; Ke Dong; Qingtian Li; Xunjia Cheng; Jinghong Chen; Xiaokui Guo
33963284,Molecular mechanisms underlying the antidepressant actions of arketamine: beyond the NMDA receptor.,"The discovery of robust antidepressant actions exerted by the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist (R,S)-ketamine has been a crucial breakthrough in mood disorder research. (R,S)-ketamine is a racemic mixture of equal amounts of (R)-ketamine (arketamine) and (S)-ketamine (esketamine). In 2019, an esketamine nasal spray from Johnson & Johnson was approved in the United States of America and Europe for treatment-resistant depression. However, an increasing number of preclinical studies show that arketamine has greater potency and longer-lasting antidepressant-like effects than esketamine in rodents, despite the lower binding affinity of arketamine for the NMDAR. In clinical trials, non-ketamine NMDAR-related compounds did not exhibit ketamine-like robust antidepressant actions in patients with depression, despite these compounds showing antidepressant-like effects in rodents. Thus, the rodent data do not necessarily translate to humans due to the complexity of human psychiatric disorders. Collectively, the available studies indicate that it is unlikely that NMDAR plays a major role in the antidepressant action of (R,S)-ketamine and its enantiomers, although the precise molecular mechanisms underlying antidepressant actions of (R,S)-ketamine and its enantiomers remain unclear. In this paper, we review recent findings on the molecular mechanisms underlying the antidepressant actions of (R,S)-ketamine and its potent enantiomer arketamine. Furthermore, we discuss the possible role of the brain-gut-microbiota axis and brain-spleen axis in stress-related psychiatric disorders and in the antidepressant-like action of arketamine. Finally, we discuss the potential of arketamine as a treatment for cognitive impairment in psychiatric disorders, Parkinson's disease, osteoporosis, inflammatory bowel diseases, and stroke.",Molecular psychiatry,2022,Yan Wei; Lijia Chang; Kenji Hashimoto

36365032,The Role of the Microbiome in the Metabolic Health of People with Schizophrenia and Related Psychoses: Cross-Sectional and Pre-Post Lifestyle Intervention Analyses.,"The microbiome has been implicated in the development of metabolic conditions which occur at high rates in people with schizophrenia and related psychoses. This exploratory proof-of-concept study aimed to: (i) characterize the gut microbiota in antipsychotic naïve or quasi-naïve people with first-episode psychosis, and people with established schizophrenia receiving clozapine therapy; (ii) test for microbiome changes following a lifestyle intervention which included diet and exercise education and physical activity. Participants were recruited from the Eastern Suburbs Mental Health Service, Sydney, Australia. Anthropometric, lifestyle and gut microbiota data were collected at baseline and following a 12-week lifestyle intervention. Stool samples underwent 16S rRNA sequencing to analyse microbiota diversity and composition. Seventeen people with established schizophrenia and five people with first-episode psychosis were recruited and matched with 22 age-sex, BMI and ethnicity matched controls from a concurrent study for baseline comparisons. There was no difference in α-diversity between groups at baseline, but microbial composition differed by 21 taxa between the established schizophrenia group and controls. In people with established illness pre-post comparison of α-diversity showed significant increases after the 12-week lifestyle intervention. This pilot study adds to the current literature that detail compositional differences in the gut microbiota of people with schizophrenia compared to those without mental illness and suggests that lifestyle interventions may increase gut microbial diversity in patients with established illness. These results show that microbiome studies are feasible in patients with established schizophrenia and larger studies are warranted to validate microbial signatures and understand the relevance of lifestyle change in the development of metabolic conditions in this population.","Pathogens (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,Maryanne O'Donnell; Scott B Teasdale; Xin-Yi Chua; Jamie Hardman; Nan Wu; Jackie Curtis; Katherine Samaras; Patrick Bolton; Margaret J Morris; Cyndi Shannon Weickert; Tertia Purves-Tyson; Fatima El-Assaad; Xiao-Tao Jiang; Georgina L Hold; Emad El-Omar
36698474,"The different trends in the burden of neurological and mental disorders following dietary transition in China, the USA, and the world: An extension analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019.","The highly processed western diet is substituting the low-processed traditional diet in the last decades globally. Increasing research found that a diet with poor quality such as western diet disrupts gut microbiota and increases the susceptibility to various neurological and mental disorders, while a balanced diet regulates gut microbiota and prevents and alleviates the neurological and mental disorders. Yet, there is limited research on the association between the disease burden expanding of neurological and mental disorders with a dietary transition.We compared the disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) trend by age for neurological and mental disorders in China, in the United States of America (USA), and across the world from 1990 to 2019, evaluated the dietary transition in the past 60 years, and analyzed the association between the burden trend of the two disorders with the changes in diet composition and food production.We identified an age-related upward pattern in disease burden in China. Compared with the USA and the world, the Chinese neurological and mental disorders DALY percent was least in the generation over 75 but rapidly increased in younger generations and surpassed the USA and/or the world in the last decades. The age-related upward pattern in Chinese disease burdens had not only shown in the presence of cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms, and diabetes mellitus but also appeared in the presence of depressive disorders, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, schizophrenia, headache disorders, anxiety disorders, conduct disorders, autism spectrum disorders, and eating disorders, successively. Additionally, the upward trend was associated with the dramatic dietary transition including a reduction in dietary quality and food production sustainability, during which the younger generation is more affected than the older. Following the increase in total calorie intake, alcohol intake, ratios of animal to vegetal foods, and poultry meat to pulses, the burdens of the above diseases continuously rose. Then, following the rise of the ratios of meat to pulses, eggs to pulses, and pork to pulses, the usage of fertilizers, the farming density of pigs, and the burdens of the above disease except diabetes mellitus were also ever-increasing. Even the usage of pesticides was positively correlated with the burdens of Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, cardiovascular diseases, and neoplasms. Contrary to China, the corresponding burdens of the USA trended to reduce with the improvements in diet quality and food production sustainability.Our results suggest that improving diet quality and food production sustainability might be a promising way to stop the expanding burdens of neurological and mental disorders.",Frontiers in nutrition,2022,Shan Liang; Li Wang; Xiaoli Wu; Xu Hu; Tao Wang; Feng Jin

35937875,Gut microbiome: A potential indicator for predicting treatment outcomes in major depressive disorder.,"The therapeutic outcomes in major depressive disorder (MDD), one of the most common and heterogeneous mental illnesses, are affected by factors that remain unclear and often yield unsatisfactory results. Herein, we characterized the composition and metabolic function of the gut microbiota of patients with MDD during antidepressant treatment, based on 16S rRNA sequencing and metabolomics. The microbial signatures at baseline differed significantly between responder and non-responder groups. The gut microbiota of the non-responder group was mainly characterized by increased relative abundances of the phylum Actinobacteria, families Christensenellaceae and Eggerthellaceae, and genera <i>Adlercreutzia</i> and <i>Christensenellaceae R7 group</i> compared to that of the responder group. Additionally, the gut microbiota composition of the responder and non-responder groups differed significantly before and after treatment, especially at the genus level. Moreover, 20 differential metabolites between the responder and non-responder groups were identified that were mainly involved in lipid metabolism (cholestane steroids and steroid esters). Eggerthellaceae and <i>Adlercreutzia</i> displayed strong co-occurrence relationships with certain metabolites, suggesting alternations in the gut microbiome, and associated metabolites may be potential mediators of successful antidepressant treatment. Overall, our study demonstrates that alterations in gut microbiota composition and metabolic function might be relevant to the response to antidepressants, thereby providing insight into mechanisms responsible for their efficacy.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2022,Zaiquan Dong; Xiaoling Shen; Yanni Hao; Jin Li; Haizhen Xu; Li Yin; Weihong Kuang
36088985,A role of microRNA-149 in the prefrontal cortex for prophylactic actions of (R)-ketamine in inflammation model.,"MicroRNAs (or miRNAs) are short, regulatory RNAs that act as post-transcriptional repressors of gene expression. Recently, we reported that the nuclear factor of activated T cells 4 (NFATc4) signaling might contribute to sustained prophylactic effects of new antidepressant (R)-ketamine in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated inflammation model of depression. In this study, we examined the role of miRNAs (miR-149 and miR-7688-5p) which can regulate NFATc4 in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of male mice after administration of LPS (1.0 mg/kg). There was a positive correlation between the expression of Nfatc4 and the expression of miR-149 in the PFC. There was also a negative correlation between gene expression of Nfatc4 and gene expression of miR-7688-5p in the PFC. Gut microbiota analysis showed that pretreatment with (R)-ketamine (10 mg/kg) could restore altered composition of gut microbiota in LPS-treated mice. A network analysis showed that gut microbiota may regulate gene expression of Nfatc4 and miR-149 (or miR-7688-5p) in the PFC. Finally, inhibition of miR-149 by antagomiR-149 blocked LPS-induced depression-like behavior by attenuating LPS-induced expression of NFATc4 in the PFC. These findings suggest that the regulation of NFATc4 signaling by miR-149 might play a role in persistent prophylactic effects of (R)-ketamine, and that gut microbiota may regulate the gene expression of miRNAs in the PFC through gut-microbiota-brain axis.",Neuropharmacology,2022,Li Ma; Long Wang; Lijia Chang; Jiajing Shan; Youge Qu; Xingming Wang; Yuko Fujita; Kenji Hashimoto
36358286,The Effect of Long-Term Moderate Static Magnetic Field Exposure on Adult Female Mice.,"Because of the high cost and safety of ultra-high magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), its application has certain limitations. Whereas 0.5−3 T MRI has been widely applied in hospitals, static magnetic fields (SMFs) have been shown to improve mice mental health and have anti-tumor potentials. Here, we compared the effects of the upward and downward 150 mT SMF groups with the sham group on C57BL/6J adult female mice. Locomotor and exploratory activity were also measured by behavioral tests, including the open field and elevated plus test. Additionally, physiology, pathology indicators and gut microbiota were examined. We found that 150 mT SMFs long-term exposure enhanced locomotive and exploratory activity of mice, especially the downward 150 mT SMF. Compared with the downward 150 mT SMF group, the movement speed and distance in the center area of the sham group were increased by 65.99% (p < 0.0001) and 68.58% (p = 0.0038), respectively. Moreover, compared to the sham group, downward 150 mT SMF increased the number of entrances to the center area by 67.0% (p = 0.0082) and time in the center area by 77.12% (p = 0.0054). Additionally, we observed that upward 150 mT SMF improved the number of follicles (~2.5 times, p = 0.0325) and uterine glands through increasing the total antioxidant capacity and reducing lipid peroxidation level in mice. Gut microbiome analysis showed that 150 mT SMFs long-term exposure improved the microbiota abundance (Clostridium, Bifidobacterium, Ralstonia and Yaniella) in the genus level, which may affect metabolism, anxiety and behavior in adult female mice. Our results demonstrated that 150 mT SMFs long-term exposure not only had good biosafety, but also improved athletic performance, emotion and the function of ovarian, uterine and gut microbiota abundance in adult female mice, which unraveled the potential of moderate long-term SMF exposure in clinical applications.",Biology,2022,Xingxing Yang; Biao Yu; Chao Song; Chuanlin Feng; Jing Zhang; Xinyu Wang; Guofeng Cheng; Rui Yang; Wei Wang; Yong Zhu
35352107,Psychobiotics in diet: significance and applications of neuroactive and psychoactive microbial metabolites.,"The brain governs psychiatric behavior of an individual by regulating certain neuroactive compounds produced within the body. These might also be produced by the microbes present in the gut, along with certain probiotic strains: the psychobiotics. A healthy diet including psychobiotics plays an important role in neurological functioning by producing a number of psychoactive compounds. Health benefits of probiotic microorganisms to the host and their psychoactive metabolites involved in the alternation of brain functioning are summarized in this article. The effect of diet on gut microbiota is highlighted, along with the possibility of probiotic bacteria as psychobiotics in the treatment or prevention of mental health-related disorders. The psychobiotic formulations seem to be a step toward precision probiotics development.",Nutrition reviews,2022,Rajat Giri; Rakesh Kumar Sharma
36158270,Associations of gut microbiota with dyslipidemia based on sex differences in subjects from Northwestern China.,"The gut microbiota (GM) has been proven to play a role in the regulation of host lipid metabolism, which provides a new theory about the pathogenesis of dyslipidemia. However, the associations of GM with dyslipidemia based on sex differences remain unclear and warrant elucidation.To investigate the associations of GM features with serum lipid profiles based on sex differences in a Chinese population.This study ultimately recruited 142 participants (73 females and 69 males) at Honghui Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University. The anthropometric and blood metabolic parameters of all participants were measured. According to their serum lipid levels, female and male participants were classified into a high triglyceride (H_TG) group, a high total cholesterol (H_CHO) group, a low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (L_HDL-C) group, and a control (CON) group with normal serum lipid levels. Fresh fecal samples were collected for 16S rRNA gene sequencing. UPARSE software, QIIME software, the RDP classifier and the FAPROTAX database were used for sequencing analyses.The GM composition at the phylum level included Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes as the core GM. Different GM features were identified between females and males, and the associations between GM and serum lipid profiles were different in females and males. The GM features in different dyslipidemia subgroups changed in both female patients and male patients. Proteobacteria, Lactobacillaceae, <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Lactobacillus_salivarius</i> were enriched in H_CHO females compared with CON females, while Coriobacteriia were enriched in L_HDL-C females. In the comparison among the three dyslipidemia subgroups in females, <i>Lactobacillus_salivarius</i> were enriched in H_CHO females, and Prevotellaceae were enriched in L_HDL-C females. Compared with CON or H_TG males, Prevotellaceae, <i>unidentified_Ruminococcaceae</i>, <i>Roseburia</i> and <i>Roseburia_inulinivorans</i> were decreased in L_HDL-C males (<i>P</i> value < 0.05), and linear discriminant analysis effect size analysis indicated an enrichment of the above GM taxa in H_TG males compared with other male subgroups. Additionally, <i>Roseburia_inulinivorans</i> abundance was positively correlated with serum TG and total cholesterol levels, and <i>Roseburia</i> were positively correlated with serum TG level. Furthermore, Proteobacteria (0.724, 95%CI: 0.567-0.849), Lactobacillaceae (0.703, 95%CI: 0.544-0.832), <i>Lactobacillus</i> (0.705, 95%CI: 0.547-0.834) and <i>Lactobacillus_salivarius</i> (0.706, 95%CI: 0.548-0.835) could distinguish H_CHO females from CON females, while Coriobacteriia (0.710, 95%CI: 0.547-0.841), Coriobacteriales (0.710, 95%CI: 0.547-0.841), Prevotellaceae (0.697, 95%CI: 0.534-0.830), <i>Roseburia</i> (0.697, 95%CI: 0.534-0.830) and <i>Roseburia_inulinivorans</i> (0.684, 95%CI: 0.520-0.820) could discriminate H_TG males from CON males. Based on the predictions of GM metabolic capabilities with the FAPROTAX database, a total of 51 functional assignments were obtained in females, while 38 were obtained in males. This functional prediction suggested that cellulolysis increased in L_HDL-C females compared with CON females, but decreased in L_HDL-C males compared with CON males.This study indicates associations of GM with serum lipid profiles, supporting the notion that GM dysbiosis may participate in the pathogenesis of dyslipidemia, and sex differences should be considered.",World journal of gastroenterology,2022,Lei Guo; Yang-Yang Wang; Ji-Han Wang; He-Ping Zhao; Yan Yu; Guo-Dong Wang; Kun Dai; Yu-Zhu Yan; Yan-Jie Yang; Jing Lv
36216056,Effects of urban particulate matter on gut microbiome and partial schizophrenia-like symptoms in mice: Evidence from shotgun metagenomic and metabolomic profiling.,"Epidemiological evidence reported that particulate matter (PM) was associated with increased schizophrenia (SCZ) risk. Disturbance of gut microbiome was involved in SCZ. However, it remains unclear whether PM induces SCZ-like symptoms and how gut microbiome regulates them. Therefore, a multi-omics animal experiment was conducted to verify how urban PM induces SCZ-like behavior and altered gut microbiota and metabolic pathways.Using a completely random design, mice were divided into three groups: PM group, control group and MK801 group, which received daily tracheal instillation of PM solution, sterile PBS solution and intraperitoneal injection of MK801 (establish SCZ model), respectively. After a 14-day intervention, feces were collected for multi-omics testing (shotgun metagenomic sequencing and untargeted metabolomic profiling), followed by open field test, tail suspension test, and passive avoidance test. Besides, fecal microbiome of PM group and control group were transplanted into ""pseudo-sterile"" mice, then behavioral tests were conducted.Similar to MK801 group, mice in PM group showed SCZ-like symptoms, including increased spontaneous activity, excitability, anxiety and decreased learning and spatial memory. PM exposure significantly increased the relative abundance of Verrucomicrobia and decreased that of Fibrobacteres et al. The metabolism pathways of estrogen signaling (estriol, 16-glucuronide-estriol and 21-desoxycortisol) and choline metabolism (phosphocholine) were significantly altered by PM exposure. Verrucomicrobia was negatively correlated with the level of estriol, which was correlated with decreased learning and spatial memory. Fibrobacteres and Deinococcus-Thermus were positively correlated with the level of phosphocholine, which was correlated with increased spontaneous activity, excitability and anxiety.

36244970,Depression and fatigue in active IBD from a microbiome perspective-a Bayesian approach to faecal metagenomics.,"Extraintestinal symptoms are common in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and include depression and fatigue. These are highly prevalent especially in active disease, potentially due to inflammation-mediated changes in the microbiota-gut-brain axis. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between structural and functional microbiota characteristics and severity of fatigue and depressive symptoms in patients with active IBD.We included clinical data of 62 prospectively enrolled patients with IBD in an active disease state. Patients supplied stool samples and completed the questionnaires regarding depression and fatigue symptoms. Based on taxonomic and functional metagenomic profiles of faecal gut microbiota, we used Bayesian statistics to investigate the associative networks and triangle motifs between bacterial genera, functional modules and symptom severity of self-reported fatigue and depression.Associations with moderate to strong evidence were found for 3 genera (Odoribacter, Anaerotruncus and Alistipes) and 3 functional modules (pectin, glycosaminoglycan and central carbohydrate metabolism) with regard to depression and for 4 genera (Intestinimonas, Anaerotruncus, Eubacterium and Clostridiales g.i.s) and 2 functional modules implicating amino acid and central carbohydrate metabolism with regard to fatigue.This study provides the first evidence of association triplets between microbiota composition, function and extraintestinal symptoms in active IBD. Depression and fatigue were associated with lower abundances of short-chain fatty acid producers and distinct pathways implicating glycan, carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. Our results suggest that microbiota-directed therapeutic approaches may reduce fatigue and depression in IBD and should be investigated in future research.",BMC medicine,2022,Anne Kerstin Thomann; Torsten Wüstenberg; Jakob Wirbel; Laura-Louise Knoedler; Philipp Arthur Thomann; Georg Zeller; Matthias Philip Ebert; Stefanie Lis; Wolfgang Reindl
36493975,Key role of the gut-microbiota-brain axis via the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve in demyelination of the cuprizone-treated mouse brain.,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common demyelinating disease that attacks the central nervous system. Dietary intake of cuprizone (CPZ) produces demyelination resembling that of patients with MS. Given the role of the vagus nerve in gut-microbiota-brain axis in development of MS, we performed this study to investigate whether subdiaphragmatic vagotomy (SDV) affects demyelination in CPZ-treated mice. SDV significantly ameliorated demyelination and microglial activation in the brain compared with sham-operated CPZ-treated mice. Furthermore, 16S ribosomal RNA analysis revealed that SDV significantly improved the abnormal gut microbiota composition of CPZ-treated mice. An untargeted metabolomic analysis demonstrated that SDV significantly improved abnormal blood levels of metabolites in CPZ-treated mice compared with sham-operated CPZ-treated mice. Notably, there were correlations between demyelination or microglial activation in the brain and the relative abundance of several microbiome populations, suggesting a link between gut microbiota and the brain. There were also correlations between demyelination or microglial activation in the brain and blood levels of metabolites. Together, these data suggest that CPZ produces demyelination in the brain through the gut-microbiota-brain axis via the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve.",Neurobiology of disease,2023,Xingming Wang; Akifumi Eguchi; Yong Yang; Lijia Chang; Xiayun Wan; Jiajing Shan; Youge Qu; Li Ma; Chisato Mori; Jianjun Yang; Kenji Hashimoto

35788394,Long-lasting beneficial effects of maternal intake of sulforaphane glucosinolate on gut microbiota in adult offspring.,"Mounting evidence suggests the impact of maternal diet on the health of offspring. We reported that maternal diet of sulforaphane glucosinolate (SGS) could prevent behavioral abnormalities in offspring after maternal immune activation. The present study was designed to investigate whether the dietary intake of SGS during pregnancy and lactation influences the composition of gut microbiota in the offspring. The dietary intake of SGS during pregnancy and lactation caused significant changes in the α-diversity and β-diversity of gut microbiota in 3-week-old offspring (SGS-3W group) and 10-week-old offspring (SGS-10W group). The LEfSe algorithm identified several microbes as important phylotypes in the SGS-3W or SGS-10W groups. Predictive functional metagenomes showed that the maternal intake of SGS caused several KEGG pathways alterations with respect to the genetic information processing and metabolism. Furthermore, the plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in the SGS-10W group after the injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS: 0.5 mg/kg) were significantly lower than those of the CON-10W group. It is noteworthy that there were positive correlations between the relative abundance of the genus Blautia and IL-6 (or TNF-α) in adult offspring. Moreover, there were sex differences of gut microbiota composition in offspring. In conclusion, these data suggest that the dietary intake of SGS during pregnancy and lactation might produce long-lasting beneficial effects in adult offspring through the persistent modulation of gut microbiota. It is likely that the modulation of gut microbiota by maternal nutrition may confer resilience versus vulnerability to stress-related psychiatric disorders in the offspring.",The Journal of nutritional biochemistry,2022,Yan Wei; Lijia Chang; Guoqi Liu; Xingming Wang; Yong Yang; Kenji Hashimoto
36558405,Plasma Concentrations of Short-Chain Fatty Acids in Active and Recovered Anorexia Nervosa.,"Anorexia nervosa (AN) is one of the most lethal psychiatric disorders. To date, we lack adequate knowledge about the (neuro)biological mechanisms of this disorder to inform evidence-based pharmacological treatment. Gut dysbiosis is a trending topic in mental health, including AN. Communication between the gut microbiota and the brain is partly mediated by metabolites produced by the gut microbiota such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). Previous research has suggested a role of SCFA in weight regulation (e.g., correlations between specific SCFA-producing bacteria and BMI have been demonstrated). Moreover, fecal SCFA concentrations are reported to be altered in active AN. However, data concerning SCFA concentrations in individuals who have recovered from AN are limited. In the present study, we analyzed and compared the plasma concentrations of seven SCFA (acetic-, butyric-, formic-, isobutyric-, isovaleric-, propionic-, and succinic acid) in females with active AN (<i>n</i> = 109), recovered from AN (AN-REC, <i>n</i> = 108), and healthy-weight age-matched controls (CTRL, <i>n</i> = 110), and explored correlations between SCFA concentrations and BMI. Significantly lower plasma concentrations of butyric, isobutyric-, and isovaleric acid were detected in AN as well as AN-REC compared with CTRL. We also show significant correlations between plasma concentrations of SCFA and BMI. These results encourage studies evaluating whether interventions directed toward altering gut microbiota and SCFA could support weight restoration in AN.",Nutrients,2022,Jingjing Xu; Rikard Landberg; Catharina Lavebratt; Cynthia M Bulik; Mikael Landén; Ida A K Nilsson
35650202,Fecal microbiota transplantation from patients with rheumatoid arthritis causes depression-like behaviors in mice through abnormal T cells activation.,"Depression is common in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA); however, the precise mechanisms underlying a link between depression and RA remain unclear. Accumulating evidence suggests the role of gut-microbiota-brain axis in depression. In this study, we investigated whether collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice produce depression-like behaviors and abnormal composition of gut microbiota. Furthermore, we investigated whether fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from RA patients causes depression-like phenotypes in antibiotic cocktail (ABX)-treated mice. CIA mice displayed depression-like behaviors, increased blood levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), decreased expression of synaptic proteins in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and abnormal composition of gut microbiota. Furthermore, FMT from RA patients caused depression-like phenotypes, alterations of gut microbiota composition, increased levels of IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and downregulation of synaptic proteins in the PFC compared to FMT from healthy controls. There were correlations between relative abundance of microbiota and plasma cytokines, expression of synaptic proteins in the PFC or depression-like behaviors. Interestingly, FMT from RA patients induced T cells differentiation in Peyer's patches and spleen. Reduced percentage of Treg cells with an increase of Th1/Th2 index was observed in the mice after FMT from RA patients. These findings suggest that CIA mice exhibit depression-like behaviors, systemic inflammation, and abnormal composition of gut microbiota, and that FMT from RA patients produces depression-like behaviors in ABX-treated mice via T cells differentiation. Therefore, abnormalities in gut microbiota in RA patients may contribute to depression via gut-microbiota-brain axis.",Translational psychiatry,2022,Yaoyu Pu; Qiuping Zhang; Zhigang Tang; Chenyang Lu; Liang Wu; Yutong Zhong; Yuehong Chen; Kenji Hashimoto; Yubin Luo; Yi Liu
35981631,Antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion improves LPS-induced acute lung injury via gut-lung axis.,"Acute lung injury (ALI) is an acute inflammatory disorder. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the pathology of ALI remain elusive. An increasing evidence suggests the role of the gut-microbiota axis in the pathology of lung injury. This study aimed to investigate whether antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion could affect ALI in mice after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration.The effects of antibiotic cocktail (ABX) on ALI in the mice after intratracheally administration of LPS (5 mg/kg) were examined. Furthermore, 16s rRNA analysis and measurement of short-chain fatty acids in feces samples and metabolomics analysis of blood samples were performed.LPS significantly increased the interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of water-treated mice. Interestingly, an ABX significantly attenuated the LPS-induced increase in IL-6 in BALF and lung injury scores. Furthermore, ABX and/or LPS treatment markedly altered the α- and β-diversity of the gut microbiota. There were significant differences in the α- and β-diversity of the water + LPS group and ABX + LPS group. LEfSe analysis identified Enterococusfaecalis, Clostriumtertium, and Bacteroidescaecimyris as potential microbial markers for ABX + LPS group. Untargeted metabolomics analysis identified several plasma metabolites responsible for discriminating water + LPS group from ABX + LPS group. There were correlations between the relative abundance of the microbiome and plasma metabolites.

This condition, which is associated with low-grade chronic systemic inflammation, is of main concern during pregnancy leading to very serious consequences for the new generations. In addition to the prominent role played by the adipose tissue, dysbiosis of the maternal gut may also sustain the obesity-related inflammatory milieu contributing to create an overall suboptimal intrauterine environment. Such a condition here generically defined as ""inflamed womb"" may hold long-term detrimental effects on fetal brain development, increasing the vulnerability to mental disorders. In this review, we will examine the hypothesis that maternal obesity-related gut dysbiosis and the associated inflammation might specifically target fetal brain microglia, the resident brain immune macrophages, altering neurodevelopmental trajectories in a sex-dependent fashion. We will also review some of the most promising nutritional strategies capable to prevent or counteract the effects of maternal obesity through the modulation of inflammation and oxidative stress or by targeting the maternal microbiota.",Nutrients,2022,Francesca Cirulli; Roberta De Simone; Chiara Musillo; Maria Antonietta Ajmone-Cat; Alessandra Berry
36183483,Possible metabolic interplay between quality of life and fecal microbiota in a presenior population: Preliminary results.,"The number of people aged ≥60 y is increasing worldwide, so establishing a relationship between lifestyle and health-associated factors, such as gut microbiota in an older population, is important. This study aimed to characterize the gut microbiota of a presenior population, and analyze the association between some bacteria and quality of life with the Short Form (SF) 36 questionnaire.Participants were adult men and women ages 50 to 80 y (n = 74). In addition to the SF-36 questionnaire, fecal samples were collected in cryotubes, and 16S RNA gene sequencing was performed to characterize microbial features. Participants were classified into two groups according to SF-36 punctuation. Linear and logistic regression models were performed to assess the possible association between any bacterial bowl and SF-36 score. Receiver operating characteristics curves were fitted to define the relative diagnostic strength of different bacterial taxa for the correct determination of quality of life.A positive relationship was established between SF-36 score and Actinobacteria (P = 0.0310; R = 0.2510) compared with Peptostreptococcaceae (P = 0.0259; R = -0.2589), which increased with decreasing quality of life. Logistic regressions models and receiver operating characteristics curves showed that the relative abundance of Actinobacteria and Peptostreptococcaceae may be useful to predict quality of life in a presenior population (area under the curve: 0.71).Quality of life may be associated with the relative abundance of certain bacteria, especially Actinobacteria and Peptostreptococcaceae, which may have a specific effect on certain markers and health care, which is important to improve quality of life in older populations.","Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)",2022,Begoña de Cuevillas; José I Riezu-Boj; Itziar Abete; M Angeles Zulet; Cristina Galarregui; Carlos J Gonzalez-Navarro; Fermín I Milagro; J Alfredo Martínez; Santiago Navas-Carretero
36191374,Comparison of the chronic unpredictable mild stress and the maternal separation in mice postpartum depression modeling.,"Postpartum depression (PPD) is a serious mental health concern of new mothers worldwide. In view of the particularity of puerpera, the research on pathogenesis and drug development of PPD are highly dependent on animal models. Although both maternal separation (MS) and chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) modeling approaches have been used in PPD studies, the characteristics of the two rodent models have not been compared to explain which is more advantageous in PPD research. In this study, we applied 21-day MS and CUMS paradigms to induce mouse model of PPD and compared their differences in behavior, physiology and gut microbiota. As a result, the two models exhibited significant increases of immobility time in forced swim test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST), whereas sucrose preference index and pup weight were significantly decreased. Both displayed depression-like behaviors, and CUMS was more obvious, which demonstrated by the lower levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and higher hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis related mRNA expression (corticotropin releasing hormone, corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1) in CMUS group than that in MS group. The gut microbiota in MS and CUMS groups were significantly different in terms of the relative abundances of Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria. In conclusion, MS model and CUMS model have different performance in behavior and physiology. The CUMS model showed more obvious parameter changes, which may be more suitable for PPD induced by various social environmental factors.",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2022,Yan Zhang; Li Zhang; Birui Shi; Fulong Huang; Yinhuang Gao; Zhishuo Miao; Ke Ma; Ziyao Zhan; Wei Zou; Menghua Liu
35594949,Effects of (R)-ketamine on reduced bone mineral density in ovariectomized mice: A role of gut microbiota.,"Depression is a high risk for osteoporosis, suggesting an association between depression and low bone mineral density (BMD). We reported that the novel antidepressant (R)-ketamine could ameliorate the reduced BMD in the ovariectomized (OVX) mice which is an animal model of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Given the role of gut microbiota in depression and bone homeostasis, we examined whether gut microbiota plays a role in the beneficial effects of (R)-ketamine in the reduced BMD of OVX mice. OVX or sham was operated for female mice. Subsequently, saline (10 ml/kg/day, twice weekly) or (R)-ketamine (10 mg/kg/day, twice weekly) was administered intraperitoneally into OVX or sham mice for the six weeks. The reduction of cortical BMD and total BMD in the OVX mice was significantly ameliorated after subsequent repeated intermittent administration of (R)-ketamine. Furthermore, there were significant changes in the α- and β-diversity between OVX + saline group and OVX + (R)-ketamine group. There were correlations between several OTUs and cortical (or total) BMD. There were also positive correlations between the genera Turicibacter and cortical (or total) BMD. Moreover, there were correlations between several metabolites in blood and cortical (or total) BMD. These data suggest that (R)-ketamine may ameliorate the reduced cortical BMD and total BMD in OVX mice through anti-inflammatory actions via gut microbiota. Therefore, it is likely that (R)-ketamine would be a therapeutic drug for depressed patients with low BMD or patients with osteoporosis.",Neuropharmacology,2022,Xiayun Wan; Akifumi Eguchi; Yuko Fujita; Li Ma; Xingming Wang; Yong Yang; Youge Qu; Lijia Chang; Jiancheng Zhang; Chisato Mori; Kenji Hashimoto
36579574,The Potential Impact of Age on Gut Microbiota in Patients with Major Depressive Disorder: A Secondary Analysis of the Prospective Observational Study.,"We aimed to investigate the impact of aging on the relationship among the composition of gut microbiota, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, and the course of treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD) by analyzing the datasets from our previous study. Patients with MDD were recruited, and their stools were collected at three time points (baseline, midterm, and endpoint) following the usual antidepressant treatment. Gut microbiota were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Patients were categorized into two groups based on their age: the late-life group over 60 years and the middle-aged group under 60 years. GI symptoms were assessed with scores of item 11 of the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale. One hundred and ninety samples were collected from 32 patients with MDD. Several gut microbes had higher relative abundances in the late-life group than in the middle-aged group. In addition, the late-life group showed significantly higher diversity in the Chao1 index at baseline compared with the middle-aged group. We further found possible microbial taxa related to GI symptoms in patients with late-life depression. The abundance of several bacterial taxa may contribute to GI symptoms in the late-life depression, and our findings suggest that the therapeutic targets for the application of gut microbiota may differ depending on the age group of patients with depression.",Journal of personalized medicine,2022,Katsuma Miyaho; Kenji Sanada; Shunya Kurokawa; Arisa Tanaka; Tomoyuki Tachibana; Chiharu Ishii; Yoshihiro Noda; Shinichiro Nakajima; Shinji Fukuda; Masaru Mimura; Taishiro Kishimoto; Akira Iwanami

The modifiable gut microbiome might be a potential target for intervention to improve neurobiological functions through the gut-microbiome-brain axis.In this case-control study, gut microbiota of 132 patients with SCZ and increased waist circumference were compared with gut microbiota of two age- and sex-matched control groups, composed of 132 healthy individuals and 132 individuals with metabolic syndrome. Shotgun sequencing was used to characterize fecal samples at the taxonomic and functional levels. Cognition of the patients with SCZ was evaluated using the Brief Assessment of Cognition instrument.SCZ gut microbiota differed significantly from those of healthy control subjects and individuals with metabolic syndrome in terms of richness and global composition. SCZ gut microbiota were notably enriched in <i>Flavonifractor plautii</i>, <i>Collinsella aerofaciens</i>, <i>Bilophila wadsworthia</i>, and <i>Sellimonas intestinalis</i>, while depleted in <i>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</i>, <i>Ruminococcus lactaris</i>, <i>Ruminococcus bicirculans</i>, and <i>Veillonella rogosae</i>.

36079050,Intestinal Permeability and Depression in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Depression is a global health problem that requires an early and accurate diagnosis to ensure quick access to appropriate treatment. Among multiple psychopathological paths, recent attention has focused on analysing the brain-gut-microbiota axis. The intestinal barrier plays a key role, and dysfunctions occurring at this level have implications for mental health. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of intestinal permeability biomarkers, i.e., calprotectin, zonulin, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) and intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FAB), in relation to depression in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This is the first study of this kind taking place in Romania, Eastern Europe, with an emphasis on patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The correlations identified between depression and calprotectin and depression and LBP have the potential to shed light on the process of rapid diagnosis of depression with the help of biomarkers. Since depression is correlated with a decrease in the quality of life in patients with IBD, the need for access to appropriate treatments must be urgent.",Journal of clinical medicine,2022,Miorita Melina Iordache; Cristina Tocia; Mariana Aschie; Andrei Dumitru; Mihaela Manea; Georgeta Camelia Cozaru; Lucian Petcu; Sabina E Vlad; Eugen Dumitru; Anca Chisoi
35308288,Three Different Types of β-Glucans Enhance Cognition: The Role of the Gut-Brain Axis.,"Dietary fiber is fermented in the lower gastrointestinal tract, potentially impacting the microbial ecosystem and thus may improve elements of cognition and brain function via the gut-brain axis. β-glucans, soluble dietary fiber, have different macrostructures and may exhibit different effects on the gut-brain axis. This study aimed to compare the effects of β-glucans from mushroom, curdlan and oats bran, representing β-(1,3)/(1,6)-glucan, β-(1,3)-glucan or β-(1,3)/(1,4)-glucan, on cognition and the gut-brain axis.C57BL/6J mice were fed with either control diet or diets supplemented with β-glucans from mushroom, curdlan and oats bran for 15 weeks. The cognitive functions were evaluated by using the temporal order memory and Y-maze tests. The parameters of the gut-brain axis were examined, including the synaptic proteins and ultrastructure and microglia status in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC), as well as colonic immune response and mucus thickness and gut microbiota profiles.All three supplementations with β-glucans enhanced the temporal order recognition memory. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the post-synaptic protein 95 (PSD95) increased in the PFC. Furthermore, mushroom β-glucan significantly increased the post-synaptic thickness of synaptic ultrastructure in the PFC whilst the other two β-glucans had no significant effect. Three β-glucan supplementations decreased the microglia number in the PFC and hippocampus, and affected complement C3 and cytokines expression differentially. In the colon, every β-glucan supplementation increased the number of CD206 positive cells and promoted the expression of IL-10 and reduced IL-6 and TNF-α expression. The correlation analysis highlights that degree of cognitive behavior improved by β-glucan supplementations was significantly associated with microglia status in the hippocampus and PFC and the number of colonic M2 macrophages. In addition, only β-glucan from oat bran altered gut microbiota and enhanced intestinal mucus.We firstly demonstrated long-term supplementation of β-glucans enhanced recognition memory. Comparing the effects of β-glucans on the gut-brain axis, we found that β-glucans with different molecular structures exhibit differentia actions on synapses, inflammation in the brain and gut, and gut microbiota. This study may shed light on how to select appropriate β-glucans as supplementation for the prevention of cognitive deficit or improving immune function clinically.",Frontiers in nutrition,2022,Minmin Hu; Peng Zhang; Ruiqi Wang; Menglu Zhou; Ning Pang; Xiaoying Cui; Xing Ge; Xiaomei Liu; Xu-Feng Huang; Yinghua Yu
35013099,A pilot exploration of multi-omics research of gut microbiome in major depressive disorders.,"The pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) remains obscure. Recently, the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis's role in MDD has an increasing attention. However, the specific mechanism of the multi-level effects of gut microbiota on host metabolism, immunity, and brain structure is unclear. Multi-omics approaches based on the analysis of different body fluids and tissues using a variety of analytical platforms have the potential to provide a deeper understanding of MGB axis disorders. Therefore, the data of metagenomics, metabolomic, inflammatory factors, and MRI scanning are collected from the two groups including 24 drug-naïve MDD patients and 26 healthy controls (HCs). Then, the correlation analysis is performed in all omics. The results confirmed that there are many markedly altered differences, such as elevated Actinobacteria abundance, plasma IL-1β concentration, lipid, vitamin, and carbohydrate metabolism disorder, and diminished grey matter volume (GMV) of inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) in the MDD patients. Notably, three kinds of discriminative bacteria, Ruminococcus bromii, Lactococcus chungangensis, and Streptococcus gallolyticus have an extensive correlation with metabolome, immunology, GMV, and clinical symptoms. All three microbiota are closely related to IL-1β and lipids (as an example, phosphoethanolamine (PEA)). Besides, Lactococcus chungangensis is negatively related to the GMV of left IFG. Overall, this study demonstrate that the effects of gut microbiome exert in MDD is multifactorial.",Translational psychiatry,2022,Haoyang Zhao; Kangyu Jin; Chaonan Jiang; Fen Pan; Jing Wu; Honglin Luan; Zhiyong Zhao; Jingkai Chen; Tingting Mou; Zheng Wang; Jing Lu; Shaojia Lu; Shaohua Hu; Yi Xu; Manli Huang
36056826,Microbiome-Based Therapies in Parkinson's Disease: Can Tuning the Microbiota Become a Viable Therapeutic Strategy?,"Progressive neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD) have continued to baffle medical science, despite strides in the understanding of their pathology. The inability of currently available therapies to halt disease progression is a testament to an incomplete understanding of pathways crucial to disease initiation, progression and management. Science has continued to link the activities and equilibrium of the gut microbiome to the health and proper functioning of brain neurons. They also continue to stir interest in the potential applications of technologies that may shift the balance of the gut microbiome towards achieving a favourable outcome in PD management. There have been suggestions that an improved understanding of the roles of the gut microbiota is likely to lead to the emergence of an era where their manipulation becomes a recognized strategy for PD management. This review examines the current state of our journey in the quest to understand how the gut microbiota can influence several aspects of PD. We highlight the relationship between the gut microbiome/microbiota and PD pathogenesis, as well as preclinical and clinical evidence evaluating the effect of postbiotics, probiotics and prebiotics in PD management. This is with a view to ascertaining if we are at the threshold of discovering the application of a usable tool in our quest for disease modifying therapies in PD.",CNS & neurological disorders drug targets,2022,Adejoke Y Onaolapo; Folusho O Ojo; Anthony T Olofinnade; Joshua Falade; Ismail A Lawal; Olakunle J Onaolapo
35466109,Effects of Subdiaphragmatic Vagotomy in the MPTP-induced Neurotoxicity in the Striatum and Colon of Mice.,"Gut-microbiota-brain axis plays a role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). The subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve serves as a major modulatory pathway between the gut microbiota and the brain. However, the role of subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve in PD pathogenesis are unknown. Here, we investigated the effects of subdiaphragmatic vagotomy (SDV) on the neurotoxicity in the mouse striatum and colon after administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6- tetrahydropyridine (MPTP).Sham or SVD was performed. Subsequently, saline or MPTP (10 mg/kg × 3, 2-hour interval) was administered to mice. Western blot analysis of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine transporter (DAT) in the striatum and phosphorylated α-synuclein (p-α-Syn) in the colon was performed.Repeated administration of MPTP significantly caused reduction of TH and DAT in the striatum and increase of p-α-Syn in the colon of mice. However, SDV did not affect the reduction of TH and DAT in the striatum and increases in p-α-Syn in the colon after repeated MPTP administration.These data suggest that subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve doses not play a role in the MPTP-induced neurotoxicity in the brain and colon.",Clinical psychopharmacology and neuroscience : the official scientific journal of the Korean College of Neuropsychopharmacology,2022,Jiajing Shan; Youge Qu; Jiancheng Zhang; Li Ma; Kenji Hashimoto

35432048,The Correlation Between Probiotics and Anxiety and Depression Levels in Cancer Patients: A Retrospective Cohort Study.,"Studies have shown a correlation between gut microbiota and anxiety and depression levels. However, these studies are mainly animal studies or clinical studies of non-cancer patients, there is still a lack of relevant studies in cancer patients. The main objective of this trial was to analyze the correlation between probiotics and anxiety and depression levels in cancer patients.We screened all cancer patients consecutively admitted to the inpatient department of the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine in May 2020. A total of 292 cancer patients met our inclusion criteria. Then, we followed up all patients for 24 weeks. Patients who had incomplete data or loss of follow-up were excluded. In addition, in patients who took probiotics, those did not take probiotics consistently or did not take specific probiotics were excluded. Ultimately, the number of patients enrolled was 82 in probiotics cohort and 100 in non-probiotics cohort. The 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD-17) questionnaire was used to measure the depression levels of the patients, and we also used Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) questionnaire to assess the patients' anxiety levels. A logistic regression model was used to analyze whether the difference in baseline data of two cohorts would affect the final result.Demographic and clinical characteristics of all cancer patients enrolled in probiotics cohort and non-probiotics cohort were similar except the cancer therapy (<i>P</i> = 0.004). According to the HAMA score, we divided cancer patients into non-anxiety group (HAMA score < 14) and anxiety group (HAMA score ≥ 14). Similarly, cancer patients were also divided into non-depression group (HAMD-17 score ≤ 7) and depression group (HAMD-17 score > 7). The results demonstrated that there was no statistical difference in the proportion of patients with anxiety (6.1 and 13.0%, respectively, <i>P</i> = 0.121) and depression (30.5 and 23.0%, respectively, <i>P</i> = 0.254) between probiotics and non-probiotics cohorts. The results of logistic regression model analysis further proved that the baseline difference in cancer therapy did not affect the conclusions.Our results still suggest that there is no significant correlation between probiotics and anxiety and depression levels in cancer patients. Therefore, we do not recommend supplementing probiotics for cancer patients to prevent anxiety and depression. Moreover, high-quality RCTs are also needed to further confirm the conclusions of this study.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2022,Ziqi Ye; Yanfang Zhang; Mengfei Du; Shaojia Lu; Qingwei Zhao; Si Yang
36437993,"Effect of human probiotics on memory, psychological and biological measures in elderly: A study protocol of bi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial (CleverAge Biota).","Gut microbiota may influence brain functions. Therefore, we prepared a study protocol for a double-blind, crossover, randomized clinical trial to determine the complex effects of human probiotics on memory, psychological, and biological measures in the elderly.We selected eligible participants using an effective electronic questionnaire containing the inclusion and exclusion criteria and a brief electronic cognitive test. One-third of the respondents with the worst cognitive scores on the electronic test are randomized to group A, starting with a 3-month probiotic intervention, and to group B, starting with a placebo. In a crossover design, both groups change their intervention/placebo status after 3 months for the next 3 months. Participants refusing longer personal assessments due to the COVID-19 pandemic were randomly allocated to one of two subgroups assessed online. Participants in both groups are matched in age, education, gender, and cognitive scores on electronic testing at baseline. At three time points, participants are assessed using a neuropsychological battery, self-report measures of mood, a physical fitness test, blood, urine, and stool samples, and actigraphy. A subset of participants also provided their biological samples and underwent the neuropsychological battery in an extended testing phase 3 months after study termination to find out the long-term effect of the intervention.This is the first trial to address the comprehensive effects of human probiotics on memory and many other measures in the elderly. We assume that the probiotic group will have better outcomes than the placebo group after the first and second trimesters. We expect that the probiotic effect will persist for the next 3 months. These study's findings will contribute to an interesting area of how to improve memory, psychological and biological and other factors naturally and will examine the importance of probiotics for overall health in the elderly.[clinicaltrials.gov], identifier [NCT05051501].",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2022,Ales Bartos; Josefina Weinerova; Sofia Diondet; Karel Vales
36283312,Ginsenoside Rh4 remodels the periphery microenvironment by targeting the brain-gut axis to alleviate depression-like behaviors.,"Depression is a neuropsychiatric disease that threatens the physical and mental health of humans worldwide. This study explored the potential anti-depressant effects of ginsenoside Rh4 and its mechanisms of action. The results showed that Rh4 could significantly inhibit depression-like behavior in the depression mouse model and alleviate neuronal damage and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis disorder. Concurrently, Rh4 inhibits hippocampal neuronal apoptosis and synaptic structural damage due to the overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines and overactivation of microglia and astrocytes by inhibiting the immune-inflammatory response and signaling molecular interaction pathways. Rh4 can also improve intestinal flora and increase the short-chain fatty-acids content. The correlation analysis indicated that the Rh4-inhibited LPS/NLRP3/caspase-1/IL-1β signaling pathway plays a key role in ameliorating depression. Therefore, this study provides valuable insights into the mode of action of Rh4 on the brain-gut axis in depression, suggesting that Rh4 may be a promising clinical drug for the treatment of depression.",Food chemistry,2023,Jingjing Shao; Xiaoxuan Ma; Linlin Qu; Pei Ma; Rong Huang; Daidi Fan

35302147,<i>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</i> zz-1 exerts preventive effects on chronic unpredictable mild stress-induced depression in mice <i>via</i> regulating the intestinal microenvironment.,"Depression remains one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders, and it has been confirmed that it is related to the dysfunction of the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Manipulation of the gut microenvironment by probiotics might improve mental health and prevent stress-related psychiatric disorders. The present study aimed to determine whether <i>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</i> (<i>L. rhamnosus</i>) zz-1 could prevent the occurrence of depression and its potential mechanisms using a mouse model with chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). The results indicated that <i>L. rhamnosus</i> zz-1 intervention ameliorated CUMS-induced depression-like behaviors of mice with reduced body growth rate, lowered sucrose preference, increased immobility time, as well as decreased curiosity and mobility. Moreover, <i>L. rhamnosus</i> zz-1 significantly inhibited hormones released due to hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, alleviated CUMS-induced deficits of monoamine neurotransmitters, and increased the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB). These benefits were partially linked to the regulation of the intestinal microenvironment. <i>L. rhamnosus</i> zz-1 alleviated intestinal damage and reduced intestinal inflammation of the depressed mice. Meanwhile, <i>L. rhamnosus</i> zz-1 effectively adjusted the dysbiosis of mouse gut microbiota induced by CUMS, such as changes in the abundance of the <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> NK4A136 group, <i>Bacteroides</i>, and <i>Muribaculum</i>. Taken together, these results demonstrated that <i>L. rhamnosus</i> zz-1 was effective in preventing depression from chronic stress, adding new evidence to support the mental benefits of probiotics.",Food & function,2022,Jinzhao Xu; Mengqi Tang; Xinyu Wu; Xiangli Kong; Yini Liu; Xiaoxi Xu
36235606,Circulating Levels of Short-Chain Fatty Acids during Pregnancy and Infant Neurodevelopment.,"Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) play a key role in the gut microbiota-brain crosstalk regulating the main neurodevelopmental processes during pregnancy. The aim of this study is to investigate the longitudinal relationship between prenatal levels of the main SCFAs in maternal serum and infant cognitive development and temperament on day 40 postpartum after adjusting for several pre-, peri- and post-natal confounders.A sample of 357 healthy mother-infant pairs were followed from the beginning of pregnancy to 40 days after birth. Serum SCFA concentrations were assessed in the first and third trimester of pregnancy by LC-MS/MS; and socio-demographic, nutritional, and psychological variables were collected. At 40 days, the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-III and the Early Infancy Temperament Questionnaire were administered.Lower serum levels of acetic, butyric and isobutyric acid, mainly during the first trimester, were related to better language and psychomotor development and, in the case of butyric acid, better intensity behavior in infants. Medium levels of propionic acid were related to better scores for development, mood and temperament.These findings suggest that in a community sample of healthy pregnant women from a Mediterranean region of northern Spain, lower serum levels of SCFAs, especially in the first trimester of pregnancy, seem to be related to better infant neurodevelopment.",Nutrients,2022,Carmen Hernández-Martínez; Josefa Canals; Núria Voltas; Francisco Martín-Luján; Victoria Arija
35918353,Investigation of memory-enhancing effects of Streptococcus thermophilus EG007 in mice and elucidating molecular and metagenomic characteristics using nanopore sequencing.,"Over the past decades, accumulating evidences have highlighted the gut microbiota as a key player in the brain functioning via microbiota-gut-brain axis, and accordingly, the beneficial role of several probiotic strains in cognitive ability also have been actively investigated. However, the majority of the research have demonstrated the effects against age-related cognitive decline or neurological disease. To this end, we aimed to investigate lactic acid bacteria strains having beneficial effects on the cognitive function of healthy young mice and elucidate underlying characteristics by carrying out nanopore sequencing-based genomics and metagenomics analysis. 8-week consumption of Streptococcus thermophilus EG007 demonstrated marked enhancements in behavior tests assessing short-term spatial and non-spatial learning and memory. It was revealed that EG007 possessed genes encoding various metabolites beneficial for a health condition in many aspects, including gamma-aminobutyric acid producing system, a neurotransmitter associated with mood and stress response. Also, by utilizing 16S-23S rRNA operon as a taxonomic marker, we identified more accurate species-level compositional changes in gut microbiota, which was increase of certain species, previously reported to have associations with mental health or down-regulation of inflammation or infection-related species. Moreover, correlation analysis revealed that the EG007-mediated altered microbiota had a significant correlation with the memory traits.",Scientific reports,2022,Hyaekang Kim; Soomin Jeon; Jina Kim; Donghyeok Seol; JinChul Jo; Seoae Cho; Heebal Kim
35790976,"The effects of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) administration on the microbiome-gut-brain axis in adolescents with anorexia nervosa (the MiGBAN study): study protocol for a longitudinal, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.","Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe psychiatric disease that often takes a chronic course due to insufficient treatment options. Emerging evidence on the gut-brain axis offers the opportunity to find innovative treatments for patients with psychiatric disorders. The gut microbiome of patients with AN shows profound alterations that do not completely disappear after weight rehabilitation. In previous studies, the administration of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) resulted in effects that might be beneficial in the treatment of AN, affecting the microbiome, body weight and executive functions. Therefore, the MiGBAN study aims to examine the effects of a nutritional supplementation with PUFA on the gut microbiome and body mass index (BMI) in patients with AN.This is a longitudinal, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Within 2 years, 60 adolescent patients aged 12 to 19 years with AN will receive either PUFA or placebo for 6 months additional to treatment as usual. After 1 year, the long-term effect of PUFA on the gut microbiome and consecutively on BMI will be determined. Secondary outcomes include improvement of gastrointestinal symptoms, eating disorder psychopathology, and comorbidities. Additionally, the interaction of the gut microbiome with the brain (microbiome-gut-brain axis) will be studied by conducting MRI measurements to assess functional and morphological changes and neuropsychological assessments to describe cognitive functioning. Anti-inflammatory effects of PUFA in AN will be examined via serum inflammation and gut permeability markers. Our hypothesis is that PUFA administration will have positive effects on the gut microbiota and thus the treatment of AN by leading to a faster weight gain and a reduction of gastrointestinal problems and eating disorder psychopathology.Due to previously heterogeneous results, a systematic and longitudinal investigation of the microbiome-gut-brain axis in AN is essential. The current trial aims to further analyse this promising research field to identify new, effective therapeutic tools that could help improve the treatment and quality of life of patients. If this trial is successful and PUFA supplementation contributes to beneficial microbiome changes and a better treatment outcome, their administration would be a readily applicable additional component of multimodal AN treatment.German Clinical Trials Register DRKS00017130 .

36364950,Exploration of the Gut-Brain Axis through Metabolomics Identifies Serum Propionic Acid Associated with Higher Cognitive Decline in Older Persons.,"The gut microbiome is involved in nutrient metabolism and produces metabolites that, via the gut−brain axis, signal to the brain and influence cognition. Human studies have so far had limited success in identifying early metabolic alterations linked to cognitive aging, likely due to limitations in metabolite coverage or follow-ups. Older persons from the Three-City population-based cohort who had not been diagnosed with dementia at the time of blood sampling were included, and repeated measures of cognition over 12 subsequent years were collected. Using a targeted metabolomics platform, we identified 72 circulating gut-derived metabolites in a case−control study on cognitive decline, nested within the cohort (discovery n = 418; validation n = 420). Higher serum levels of propionic acid, a short-chain fatty acid, were associated with increased odds of cognitive decline (OR for 1 SD = 1.40 (95% CI 1.11, 1.75) for discovery and 1.26 (1.02, 1.55) for validation). Additional analyses suggested mediation by hypercholesterolemia and diabetes. Propionic acid strongly correlated with blood glucose (r = 0.79) and with intakes of meat and cheese (r > 0.15), but not fiber (r = 0.04), suggesting a minor role of prebiotic foods per se, but a possible link to processed foods, in which propionic acid is a common preservative. The adverse impact of propionic acid on metabolism and cognition deserves further investigation.",Nutrients,2022,Jeanne Neuffer; Raúl González-Domínguez; Sophie Lefèvre-Arbogast; Dorrain Y Low; Bénédicte Driollet; Catherine Helmer; Andrea Du Preez; Chiara de Lucia; Silvie R Ruigrok; Barbara Altendorfer; Ludwig Aigner; Paul J Lucassen; Aniko Korosi; Sandrine Thuret; Claudine Manach; Mercè Pallàs; Mireia Urpi-Sardà; Alex Sánchez-Pla; Cristina Andres-Lacueva; Cécilia Samieri
35704960,"Efficacy and safety of a food supplement with standardized menthol, limonene, and gingerol content in patients with irritable bowel syndrome: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.","Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects 9,2% of the global population and places a considerable burden on healthcare systems. Most medications for treating IBS, including spasmolytics, laxatives, and antidiarrheals, have low efficacy. Effective and safe therapeutic treatments have yet to be developed for IBS.This study assessed the efficacy and safety of a food supplement containing standardized menthol, limonene, and gingerol in human participants with IBS or IBS/functional dyspepsia (FD).A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.We randomly assigned 56 patients with IBS or IBS/FD to an intervention group (Group 1) or control group (Group 2) that were given supplement or placebo, respectively, in addition to the standard treatment regimen for 30 d. Three outpatient visits were conducted during the study. Symptom severity was measured at each visit using a 7×7 questionnaire. Qualitative and quantitative composition of the intestinal microbiota were assessed at visits 1 and 3 based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing.At visit 1 (before treatment), the median total 7×7 questionnaire score was in the moderately ill range for both groups, with no difference between the groups (p = 0.1). At visit 2, the total 7×7 score decreased to mildly ill, with no difference between the groups (p = 0.4). At visit 3, the total score for group 1 indicated borderline illness and for group 2 remained indicated mild illness (p = 0.009).

However, commonly consumed fermented and prebiotic-containing foods have not been well-tested. The aim of the present study was to determine whether consumption of fermented food and food-derived prebiotics is associated with cognitive performance, depressive, and anxiety symptoms in psychiatrically healthy medical students under psychological stress.The study protocol with data analysis plan was prospectively registered. Food consumption was evaluated with a 7-day dietary record. Cognitive performance was modeled with academic examination performance in relation to subject knowledge. Pre-exam depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, respectively.In total, 372 medical students (22.7 ± 1.1 years of age, 66% female) completed the study. No relationship was observed between cognitive performance under stress and either fermented food (adjusted β 0.02, 95% CI -0.07-0.11, <i>p</i> = 0.63) or food-derived prebiotics consumption (adjusted β -0.00, 95% CI -0.09-0.09, <i>p</i> = 0.99).

37069399,The gut microbiota contributes to the pathogenesis of anorexia nervosa in humans and mice.,"Anorexia nervosa (AN) is an eating disorder with a high mortality. About 95% of cases are women and it has a population prevalence of about 1%, but evidence-based treatment is lacking. The pathogenesis of AN probably involves genetics and various environmental factors, and an altered gut microbiota has been observed in individuals with AN using amplicon sequencing and relatively small cohorts. Here we investigated whether a disrupted gut microbiota contributes to AN pathogenesis. Shotgun metagenomics and metabolomics were performed on faecal and serum samples, respectively, from a cohort of 77 females with AN and 70 healthy females. Multiple bacterial taxa (for example, Clostridium species) were altered in AN and correlated with estimates of eating behaviour and mental health. The gut virome was also altered in AN including a reduction in viral-bacterial interactions. Bacterial functional modules associated with the degradation of neurotransmitters were enriched in AN and various structural variants in bacteria were linked to metabolic features of AN. Serum metabolomics revealed an increase in metabolites associated with reduced food intake (for example, indole-3-propionic acid). Causal inference analyses implied that serum bacterial metabolites are potentially mediating the impact of an altered gut microbiota on AN behaviour. Further, we performed faecal microbiota transplantation from AN cases to germ-free mice under energy-restricted feeding to mirror AN eating behaviour. We found that the reduced weight gain and induced hypothalamic and adipose tissue gene expression were related to aberrant energy metabolism and eating behaviour. Our 'omics' and mechanistic studies imply that a disruptive gut microbiome may contribute to AN pathogenesis.",Nature microbiology,2023,Yong Fan; René Klinkby Støving; Samar Berreira Ibraim; Tuulia Hyötyläinen; Florence Thirion; Tulika Arora; Liwei Lyu; Evelina Stankevic; Tue Haldor Hansen; Pierre Déchelotte; Tim Sinioja; Oddny Ragnarsdottir; Nicolas Pons; Nathalie Galleron; Benoît Quinquis; Florence Levenez; Hugo Roume; Gwen Falony; Sara Vieira-Silva; Jeroen Raes; Loa Clausen; Gry Kjaersdam Telléus; Fredrik Bäckhed; Matej Oresic; S Dusko Ehrlich; Oluf Pedersen
38203207,"Our Mental Health Is Determined by an Intrinsic Interplay between the Central Nervous System, Enteric Nerves, and Gut Microbiota.","Bacteria in the gut microbiome play an intrinsic part in immune activation, intestinal permeability, enteric reflex, and entero-endocrine signaling. The gut microbiota communicates with the central nervous system (CNS) through the production of bile acids, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), glutamate (Glu), γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), serotonin (5-HT), and histamine. A vast number of signals generated in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) reach the brain via afferent fibers of the vagus nerve (VN). Signals from the CNS are returned to entero-epithelial cells (EES) via efferent VN fibers and communicate with 100 to 500 million neurons in the submucosa and myenteric plexus of the gut wall, which is referred to as the enteric nervous system (ENS). Intercommunications between the gut and CNS regulate mood, cognitive behavior, and neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism, depression, and schizophrenia. The modulation, development, and renewal of nerves in the ENS and changes in the gut microbiome alter the synthesis and degradation of neurotransmitters, ultimately influencing our mental health. The more we decipher the gut microbiome and understand its effect on neurotransmission, the closer we may get to developing novel therapeutic and psychobiotic compounds to improve cognitive functions and prevent mental disorders. In this review, the intricate control of entero-endocrine signaling and immune responses that keep the gut microbiome in a balanced state, and the influence that changing gut bacteria have on neuropsychiatric disorders, are discussed.",International journal of molecular sciences,2023,Leon M T Dicks
37849234,Microbiota from Alzheimer's patients induce deficits in cognition and hippocampal neurogenesis.,"Alzheimer's disease is a complex neurodegenerative disorder leading to a decline in cognitive function and mental health. Recent research has positioned the gut microbiota as an important susceptibility factor in Alzheimer's disease by showing specific alterations in the gut microbiome composition of Alzheimer's patients and in rodent models. However, it is unknown whether gut microbiota alterations are causal in the manifestation of Alzheimer's symptoms. To understand the involvement of Alzheimer's patient gut microbiota in host physiology and behaviour, we transplanted faecal microbiota from Alzheimer's patients and age-matched healthy controls into microbiota-depleted young adult rats. We found impairments in behaviours reliant on adult hippocampal neurogenesis, an essential process for certain memory functions and mood, resulting from Alzheimer's patient transplants. Notably, the severity of impairments correlated with clinical cognitive scores in donor patients. Discrete changes in the rat caecal and hippocampal metabolome were also evident. As hippocampal neurogenesis cannot be measured in living humans but is modulated by the circulatory systemic environment, we assessed the impact of the Alzheimer's systemic environment on proxy neurogenesis readouts. Serum from Alzheimer's patients decreased neurogenesis in human cells in vitro and were associated with cognitive scores and key microbial genera. Our findings reveal for the first time, that Alzheimer's symptoms can be transferred to a healthy young organism via the gut microbiota, confirming a causal role of gut microbiota in Alzheimer's disease, and highlight hippocampal neurogenesis as a converging central cellular process regulating systemic circulatory and gut-mediated factors in Alzheimer's.",Brain : a journal of neurology,2023,Stefanie Grabrucker; Moira Marizzoni; Edina Silajdžić; Nicola Lopizzo; Elisa Mombelli; Sarah Nicolas; Sebastian Dohm-Hansen; Catia Scassellati; Davide Vito Moretti; Melissa Rosa; Karina Hoffmann; John F Cryan; Olivia F O'Leary; Jane A English; Aonghus Lavelle; Cora O'Neill; Sandrine Thuret; Annamaria Cattaneo; Yvonne M Nolan

Nevertheless, the establishment of causal relationships between these associations remains to be determined. Multiple mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were performed to genetically predict the causative impact of 196 gut microbiota and 83 metabolites on OSA. Two-sample MR was used to assess the potential association, and causality was evaluated using inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, and weighted median (WM) methods. Multivariable MR (MVMR) was employed to ascertain the causal independence between gut microbiota and the metabolites linked to OSA. Additionally, Cochran's Q test, the MR Egger intercept test and the MR Steiger test were used for the sensitivity analyses. The analysis of the 196 gut microbiota revealed that <i>genus</i>_<i>Ruminococcaceae</i> (<i>UCG009</i>) (P<sub>IVW</sub> = 0.010) and <i>genus</i>_<i>Subdoligranulum</i> (P<sub>IVW</sub> = 0.041) were associated with an increased risk of OSA onset.

36986226,The Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis: Psychoneuroimmunological Insights.,"There is growing interest in the role that the intestinal microbiota and the related autoimmune processes may have in the genesis and presentation of some psychiatric diseases. An alteration in the communication of the microbiota-gut-brain axis, which constitutes a communicative model between the central nervous system (CNS) and the gastro-enteric tract, has been identified as one of the possible causes of some psychiatric diseases. The purpose of this narrative review is to describe evidence supporting a role of the gut microbiota in psychiatric diseases and the impact of diet on microbiota and mental health. Change in the composition of the gut microbiota could determine an increase in the permeability of the intestinal barrier, leading to a cytokine storm. This could trigger a systemic inflammatory activation and immune response: this series of events could have repercussions on the release of some neurotransmitters, altering the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and reducing the presence of trophic brain factors. Although gut microbiota and psychiatric disorders seem to be connected, more effort is needed to understand the potential causative mechanisms underlying the interactions between these systems.",Nutrients,2023,Giuseppe Marano; Marianna Mazza; Francesco Maria Lisci; Michele Ciliberto; Gianandrea Traversi; Georgios Demetrios Kotzalidis; Domenico De Berardis; Lucrezia Laterza; Gabriele Sani; Antonio Gasbarrini; Eleonora Gaetani

37619773,The role of the indoles in microbiota-gut-brain axis and potential therapeutic targets: A focus on human neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases.,"At present, a large number of relevant studies have suggested that the changes in gut microbiota are related to the course of nervous system diseases, and the microbiota-gut-brain axis is necessary for the proper functioning of the nervous system. Indole and its derivatives, as the products of the gut microbiota metabolism of tryptophan, can be used as ligands to regulate inflammation and autoimmune response in vivo. In recent years, some studies have found that the levels of indole and its derivatives differ significantly between patients with central nervous system diseases and healthy individuals, suggesting that they may be important mediators for the involvement of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in the disease course. Tryptophan metabolites produced by gut microbiota are involved in multiple physiological reactions, take indole for example, it participates in the process of inflammation and anti-inflammatory effects through various cellular physiological activities mediated by aromatic hydrocarbon receptors (AHR), which can influence a variety of neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases. This review mainly explores and summarizes the relationship between indoles and human neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, including ischemic stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, cognitive impairment, depression and anxiety, and puts forward that the level of indoles can be regulated through various direct or indirect ways to improve the prognosis of central nervous system diseases and reverse the dysfunction of the microbiota-gut-brain axis.

38045052,Gut microbiota-derived short-chain fatty acids ameliorate methamphetamine-induced depression- and anxiety-like behaviors in a Sigmar-1 receptor-dependent manner.,"Methamphetamine (Meth) abuse can cause serious mental disorders, including anxiety and depression. The gut microbiota is a crucial contributor to maintaining host mental health. Here, we aim to investigate if microbiota participate in Meth-induced mental disorders, and the potential mechanisms involved. Here, 15 mg/kg Meth resulted in anxiety- and depression-like behaviors of mice successfully and suppressed the Sigma-1 receptor (SIGMAR1)/BDNF/TRKB pathway in the hippocampus. Meanwhile, Meth impaired gut homeostasis by arousing the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-related colonic inflammation, disturbing the gut microbiome and reducing the microbiota-derived short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Moreover, fecal microbiota from Meth-administrated mice mediated the colonic inflammation and reproduced anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in recipients. Further, SCFAs supplementation optimized Meth-induced microbial dysbiosis, ameliorated colonic inflammation, and repressed anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. Finally, <i>Sigmar1</i> knockout (<i>Sigmar1</i><sup>-/-</sup>) repressed the BDNF/TRKB pathway and produced similar behavioral phenotypes with Meth exposure, and eliminated the anti-anxiety and -depression effects of SCFAs. The activation of SIGMAR1 with fluvoxamine attenuated Meth-induced anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. Our findings indicated that gut microbiota-derived SCFAs could optimize gut homeostasis, and ameliorate Meth-induced mental disorders in a SIGMAR1-dependent manner. This study confirms the crucial role of microbiota in Meth-related mental disorders and provides a potential preemptive therapy.",Acta pharmaceutica Sinica.

36017855,Gut-Brain Axis and Neurological Disorders-How Microbiomes Affect our Mental Health.,"The gut microbiota is an essential part of the gastrointestinal tract and recent research, including clinical and preclinical studies, shed light on the interaction between the gut and the brain. A rising amount of evidence strongly proves the involvement of gut microbes in brain function and their contribution in altering behavior, mood, and ultimately in the pathogenesis of certain neurological conditions. The gut microbiota produces and modulates neurotransmitters such as GABA, serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, etc. Furthermore, there is a presence of a biological link between the microbiota, immune signaling, and CNS suggesting that microbial metabolites could regulate both neurological and immunological activities in the brain. Thus, this review focuses on the bidirectional communication between the gut and brain, its impact and role in the modulation of various neurological disorders, such as schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, etc., and attempts to explore the underlying mechanism for the same. The article also discusses studies involving germ-free mice, studies on the effects of faeces transfer of microbiota, and research involving gut microbiota composition in animal models. The effects of probiotics and prebiotics on neurological disorders are also discussed, along with the clinical studies for each of them. In a nutshell, extensive studies are required to explore this bidirectional communication between the gut and brain, which might help researchers develop new therapeutic targets in treating neurological disorders and increase our understanding of the gut-brain axis.",CNS & neurological disorders drug targets,2023,Nirav Yogesh Bhatia; Manjiri Prabhakar Jalgaonkar; Anuja Balu Hargude; Atul P Sherje; Manisha Jignesh Oza; Gaurav Mahesh Doshi
36650572,Risk factors for eating disorders: findings from a rapid review.,"Risk factors represent a range of complex variables associated with the onset, development, and course of eating disorders. Understanding these risk factors is vital for the refinement of aetiological models, which may inform the development of targeted, evidence-based prevention, early intervention, and treatment programs. This Rapid Review aimed to identify and summarise research studies conducted within the last 12 years, focusing on risk factors associated with eating disorders.The current review forms part of a series of Rapid Reviews to be published in a special issue in the Journal of Eating Disorders, funded by the Australian Government to inform the development of the National Eating Disorder Research and Translation Strategy 2021-2031. Three databases were searched for studies published between 2009 and 2021, published in English, and comprising high-level evidence studies (meta-analyses, systematic reviews, moderately sized randomised controlled studies, moderately sized controlled-cohort studies, or population studies). Data pertaining to risk factors for eating disorders were synthesised and outlined in the current paper.A total of 284 studies were included. The findings were divided into nine main categories: (1) genetics, (2) gastrointestinal microbiota and autoimmune reactions, (3) childhood and early adolescent exposures, (4) personality traits and comorbid mental health conditions, (5) gender, (6) socio-economic status, (7) ethnic minority, (8) body image and social influence, and (9) elite sports. A substantial amount of research exists supporting the role of inherited genetic risk in the development of eating disorders, with biological risk factors, such as the role of gut microbiota in dysregulation of appetite, an area of emerging evidence. Abuse, trauma and childhood obesity are strongly linked to eating disorders, however less conclusive evidence exists regarding developmental factors such as role of in-utero exposure to hormones. Comorbidities between eating disorders and mental health disorders, including personality and mood disorders, have been found to increase the severity of eating disorder symptomatology. Higher education attainment, body image-related factors, and use of appearance-focused social media are also associated with increased risk of eating disorder symptoms.Eating disorders are associated with multiple risk factors. An extensive amount of research has been conducted in the field; however, further studies are required to assess the causal nature of the risk factors identified in the current review. This will assist in understanding the sequelae of eating disorder development and in turn allow for enhancement of existing interventions and ultimately improved outcomes for individuals.",Journal of eating disorders,2023,Sarah Barakat; Siân A McLean; Emma Bryant; Anvi Le; Peta Marks; ; Stephen Touyz; Sarah Maguire
37914097,Priming of microglia with dysfunctional gut microbiota impairs hippocampal neurogenesis and fosters stress vulnerability of mice.,"Mental disorders may be involved in neuroinflammatory processes that are triggered by gut microbiota. How gut microbiota influence microglia-mediated sensitivity to stress remains unclear. Here we explored in an animal model of depression whether disruption of the gut microbiome primes hippocampal microglia, thereby impairing neurogenesis and sensitizing to stress.Male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) for 4 weeks, and effects on gut microbiota were assessed using 16S rRNA sequencing. Fecal microbiota was transplanted from control or CUMS mice into naïve animals. The depression-like behaviors of recipients were evaluated in a forced swimming test and sucrose preference test. The morphology and phenotype of microglia in the hippocampus of recipients were examined using immunohistochemistry, quantitative PCR, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The recipients were treated with lipopolysaccharide or chronic stress exposure, and effects were evaluated on behavior, microglial responses and hippocampal neurogenesis. Finally, we explored the ability of minocycline to reverse the effects of CUMS on hippocampal neurogenesis and stress sensitivity in recipients.CUMS altered the gut microbiome, leading to higher relative abundance of some bacteria (Helicobacter, Bacteroides, and Desulfovibrio) and lower relative abundance of some bacteria (Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Akkermansia). Fecal microbiota transplantation from CUMS mice to naïve animals induced microglial priming in the dentate gyrus of recipients. This microglia showed hyper-ramified morphology, and became more sensitive to LPS challenge or chronic stress, which characterized by more significant morphological changes and inflammatory responses, as well as impaired hippocampal neurogenesis and increased depressive-like behaviors. Giving minocycline to recipients reversed these effects of fecal transplantation.These findings suggest that gut microbiota from stressed animals can induce microglial priming in the dentate gyrus, which is associated with a hyper-immune response to stress and impaired hippocampal neurogenesis. Remodeling the gut microbiome or inhibiting microglial priming may be strategies to reduce sensitivity to stress.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2024,Hui He; Haili He; Li Mo; Zili You; Jinqiang Zhang

37892465,The Gut-Brain Axis in Schizophrenia: The Implications of the Gut Microbiome and SCFA Production.,"Schizophrenia, a severe mental illness affecting about 1% of the population, manifests during young adulthood, leading to abnormal mental function and behavior. Its multifactorial etiology involves genetic factors, experiences of adversity, infection, and gene-environment interactions. Emerging research indicates that maternal infection or stress during pregnancy may also increase schizophrenia risk in offspring. Recent research on the gut-brain axis highlights the gut microbiome's potential influence on central nervous system (CNS) function and mental health, including schizophrenia. The gut microbiota, located in the digestive system, has a significant role to play in human physiology, affecting immune system development, vitamin synthesis, and protection against pathogenic bacteria. Disruptions to the gut microbiota, caused by diet, medication use, environmental pollutants, and stress, may lead to imbalances with far-reaching effects on CNS function and mental health. Of interest are short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), metabolic byproducts produced by gut microbes during fermentation. SCFAs can cross the blood-brain barrier, influencing CNS activity, including microglia and cytokine modulation. The dysregulation of neurotransmitters produced by gut microbes may contribute to CNS disorders, including schizophrenia. This review explores the potential relationship between SCFAs, the gut microbiome, and schizophrenia. Our aim is to deepen the understanding of the gut-brain axis in schizophrenia and to elucidate its implications for future research and therapeutic approaches.",Nutrients,2023,Songhyun Ju; Yoonhwa Shin; Sunhee Han; Juhui Kwon; Tae Gyu Choi; Insug Kang; Sung Soo Kim
36738999,High-cholesterol diet promotes depression- and anxiety-like behaviors in mice by impact gut microbe and neuroinflammation.,"Neuropsychiatric disorders, including anxiety and depression, are one of the most common mental illnesses worldwide. A growing body of evidence shows that there is a complex relationship between dietary patterns and mental health. In our study, C57BL/6J mice were divided into three groups: control diet group (CON, 10 % kcal fat), high-cholesterol diet model group (HCD, 42.0 % kcal fat + 1.25 % kcal Cholesterol), and chronic restraint stress group (CRS, 10 % kcal fat) which as a positive control group for the depression model. Six weeks later, depressive- and anxiety-like behavior were evaluated for using the OFT, SPT and TST. Glucose intolerance and liver fat were detected by IGTT and liver lipid kit. The expression of peripheral and central inflammation was detected by LEGEND plex kits. 5-HT (also named 5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) and related receptors expression were monitored by ELISA, RT-PCR and Western blot. Meantime, gut microbe of stool samples was performed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Similar to CRS model, short-term HCD intervention induced anxiety and depression-like behavior behavioral abnormalities in mice. HCD consumption resulted in significantly increased body weight, liver fat (LDL-C, TC, TG), peripheral inflammation (IL-1β, MCP-1, IL-17A) and neuroinflammation (MCP-1). The concentration of 5-HT increased in the hippocampus, meanwhile, the expression of 5-HT receptor HTR2A was distinct in different regions of the brain tissue. More importantly, we found that compared with the CON diet, HCD induced the decrease of intestinal flora diversity, especially the decrease the relative abundance of Akkermansia_muciniphila, which was statistically significant. Further, Pearson correlation analysis showed that Akkermansia_muciniphila was significantly negatively correlated with the concentration of MCP-1, IL-17A in serum and 5-HT in hippocampus. Therefore, we speculated that the disorder of neuroinflammation induced by HCD consumption promotes depression- and anxiety-like behaviors in mice through the gut microbe.",Journal of affective disorders,2023,Lili Zou; Yaling Tian; Yuanfei Wang; Dongliang Chen; Xiaomin Lu; Ze Zeng; Zumin Chen; Chenli Lin; Yinji Liang
37925207,Food4healthKG: Knowledge graphs for food recommendations based on gut microbiota and mental health.,"Food is increasingly acknowledged as a powerful means to promote and maintain mental health. The introduction of the gut-brain axis has been instrumental in understanding the impact of food on mental health. It is widely reported that food can significantly influence gut microbiota metabolism, thereby playing a pivotal role in maintaining mental health. However, the vast amount of heterogeneous data published in recent research lacks systematic integration and application development. To remedy this, we construct a comprehensive knowledge graph, named Food4healthKG, focusing on food, gut microbiota, and mental diseases. The constructed workflow includes the integration of numerous heterogeneous data, entity linking to a normalized format, and the well-designed representation of the acquired knowledge. To illustrate the availability of Food4healthKG, we design two case studies: the knowledge query and the food recommendation based on Food4healthKG. Furthermore, we propose two evaluation methods to validate the quality of the results obtained from Food4healthKG. The results demonstrate the system's effectiveness in practical applications, particularly in providing convincing food recommendations based on gut microbiota and mental health.

38123016,The many faces of microbiota-gut-brain axis in autism spectrum disorder.,"The gut-brain axis is gaining more attention in neurodevelopmental disorders, especially autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Many factors can influence microbiota in early life, including host genetics and perinatal events (infections, mode of birth/delivery, medications, nutritional supply, and environmental stressors). The gut microbiome can influence blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, drug bioavailability, and social behaviors. Developing microbiota-based interventions such as probiotics, gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota transplantation, or metabolite supplementation may offer an exciting approach to treating ASD. This review highlights that RNA sequencing, metabolomics, and transcriptomics data are needed to understand how microbial modulators can influence ASD pathophysiology. Due to the substantial clinical heterogeneity of ASD, medical caretakers may be unlikely to develop a broad and effective general gut microbiota modulator. However, dietary modulation followed by administration of microbiota modulators is a promising option for treating ASD-related behavioral and gastrointestinal symptoms. Future work should focus on the accuracy of biomarker tests and developing specific psychobiotic agents tailored towards the gut microbiota seen in ASD patients, which may include developing individualized treatment options.",Life sciences,2024,Cinara L Gonçalves; Tejaswini Doifode; Victoria L Rezende; Maiara A Costa; J Marc Rhoads; Cesar A Soutullo

Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease are the most common and typical NDs. The exact mechanisms of the NDs occurrence and development remain unclear, which may be related to immune, oxidative stress, and abnormal aggregation of pathogenic proteins. Studies have suggested that gut microbiota (GM) influences brain function and plays an important role in regulating emotional and cognitive function. Recently, bile acids (BAs) have become the ""star molecule"" in the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis research. BAs have been reported to exert anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective activities in NDs. However, the role of BAs in the connection between GM and the central nervous system (CNS) is still unclear.

37557965,The interactions between host genome and gut microbiome increase the risk of psychiatric disorders: Mendelian randomization and biological annotation.,"The correlation between human gut microbiota and psychiatric diseases has long been recognized. Based on the heritability of the microbiome, genome-wide association studies on human genome and gut microbiome (mbGWAS) have revealed important host-microbiome interactions. However, establishing causal relationships between specific gut microbiome features and psychological conditions remains challenging due to insufficient sample sizes of previous studies of mbGWAS.Cross-cohort meta-analysis (via METAL) and multi-trait analysis (via MTAG) were used to enhance the statistical power of mbGWAS for identifying genetic variants and genes. Using two large mbGWAS studies (7,738 and 5,959 participants respectively) and12 disease-specific studies from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC), we performed bidirectional two-sample mendelian randomization (MR) analyses between microbial features and psychiatric diseases (up to 500,199 individuals). Additionally, we conducted downstream gene- and gene-set-based analyses to investigate the shared biology linking gut microbiota and psychiatric diseases.METAL and MTAG conducted in mbGWAS could boost power for gene prioritization and MR analysis. Increases in the number of lead SNPs and mapped genes were witnessed in 13/15 species and 5/10 genera after using METAL, and MTAG analysis gained an increase in sample size equivalent to expanding the original samples from 7% to 63%. Following METAL use, we identified a positive association between Bacteroides faecis and ADHD (OR, 1.09; 95 %CI, 1.02-1.16; P = 0.008). Bacteroides eggerthii and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron were observed to be positively associated with PTSD (OR, 1.11; 95 %CI, 1.03-1.20; P = 0.007; OR, 1.11; 95 %CI, 1.01-1.23; P = 0.03). These findings remained stable across statistical models and sensitivity analyses. No genetic liabilities to psychiatric diseases may alter the abundance of gut microorganisms.Using biological annotation, we identified that those genes contributing to microbiomes (e.g., GRIN2A and RBFOX1) are expressed and enriched in human brain tissues.Our statistical genetics strategy helps to enhance the power of mbGWAS, and our genetic findings offer new insights into biological pleiotropy and causal relationship between microbiota and psychiatric diseases.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2023,Liling Xiao; Siyi Liu; Yulu Wu; Yunqi Huang; Shiwan Tao; Yunjia Liu; Yiguo Tang; Min Xie; Qianshu Ma; Yubing Yin; Minhan Dai; Mengting Zhang; Elyse Llamocca; Hongsheng Gui; Qiang Wang

In addition, the concerns and possible solutions regarding the gut microbiome-based therapy are discussed.",Microbiological research,2023,Zhuoxuan Wu; Erkang Tian; Yuyang Chen; Zaiquan Dong; Qiang Peng
38868440,Schizophrenia and obesity: May the gut microbiota serve as a link for the pathogenesis?,"Schizophrenia (SZ) places a tremendous burden on public health as one of the leading causes of disability and death. SZ patients are more prone to developing obesity than the general population from the clinical practice. The development of obesity frequently causes poor psychiatric outcomes in SZ patients. In turn, maternal obesity during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of SZ in offspring, suggesting that these two disorders may have shared neuropathological mechanisms. The gut microbiota is well known to serve as a major regulator of bidirectional interactions between the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. It also plays a critical role in maintaining physical and mental health in humans. Recent studies have shown that the dysbiosis of gut microbiota is intimately associated with the onset of SZ and obesity through shared pathophysiological mechanisms, particularly the stimulation of immune inflammation. Therefore, gut microbiota may serve as a common biological basis for the etiology in both SZ and obesity, and the perturbed gut-brain axis may therefore account for the high prevalence of obesity in patients with SZ. On the basis of these findings, this review provides updated perspectives and intervention approaches on the etiology, prevention, and management of obesity in SZ patients by summarizing the recent findings on the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of SZ and obesity, highlighting the role of gut-derived inflammation.",iMeta,2023,Hui Wu; Yaxi Liu; Jie Wang; Shengyun Chen; Liwei Xie; Xiaoli Wu

However, their effects on the gut-brain axis have not been investigated to a great extent despite clear evidence that suggest bi-directional interactions between the gut microbiome and endogenous sex hormones. Moreover, oral contraceptives are prescribed during adolescence, a critical period of development during which several brain structures and systems, such as hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, undergo maturation. Considering that oral contraceptives could impact the developing adolescent brain and that these effects may be mediated by the gut-brain axis, further research investigating the effects of oral contraceptives on the gut-brain axis is imperative.

37004759,Gut-derived bacterial LPS attenuates incubation of methamphetamine craving via modulating microglia.,"The microbiota-gut-brain axis plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders, and the compositions of gut microbiota are altered by addictive drugs. However, the role of gut microbiota in the incubation of methamphetamine (METH) craving remains poorly understood.16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed to assess the richness and diversity of gut microbiota in METH self-administration model. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed to evaluate the integrity of intestinal barrier. Immunofluorescence and three-dimensional reconstruction were performed to assess the morphologic changes of microglia. Serum levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were determined using the rat enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to assess transcript levels of dopamine receptor, glutamate ionotropic AMPA receptor 3 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor.METH self-administration induced gut microbiota dysbiosis, intestinal barrier damage and microglia activation in the nucleus accumbens core (NAcc), which was partially recovered after prolonged withdrawal. Microbiota depletion via antibiotic treatment increased LPS levels and induced a marked change in the microglial morphology in the NAcc, as indicated by the decreases in the lengths and numbers of microglial branches. Depleting the gut microbiota also prevented the incubation of METH craving and increased the population of Klebsiella oxytoca. Furthermore, Klebsiella oxytoca treatment or exogenous administration of the gram-negative bacterial cell wall component LPS increased serum and central LPS levels, induced microglial morphological changes and reduced the dopamine receptor transcription in the NAcc. Both treatments and NAcc microinjections of gut-derived bacterial LPS significantly decreased METH craving after prolonged withdrawal.These data suggest that LPS from gut gram-negative bacteria may enter circulating blood, activate microglia in the brain and consequently decrease METH craving after withdrawal, which may have important implications for novel strategies to prevent METH addiction and relapse.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2023,Zhoulong Yu; Wenjun Chen; Libo Zhang; Yun Chen; Wenxi Chen; Shiqiu Meng; Lin Lu; Ying Han; Jie Shi
37845499,Emerging role of the host microbiome in neuropsychiatric disorders: overview and future directions.,"The human body harbors a diverse ecosystem of microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi, collectively known as the microbiota. Current research is increasingly focusing on the potential association between the microbiota and various neuropsychiatric disorders. The microbiota resides in various parts of the body, such as the oral cavity, nasal passages, lungs, gut, skin, bladder, and vagina. The gut microbiota in the gastrointestinal tract has received particular attention due to its high abundance and its potential role in psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. However, the microbiota presents in other body tissues, though less abundant, also plays crucial role in immune system and human homeostasis, thus influencing the development and progression of neuropsychiatric disorders. For example, oral microbiota imbalance and associated periodontitis might increase the risk for neuropsychiatric disorders. Additionally, studies using the postmortem brain samples have detected the widespread presence of oral bacteria in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. This article provides an overview of the emerging role of the host microbiota in neuropsychiatric disorders and discusses future directions, such as underlying biological mechanisms, reliable biomarkers associated with the host microbiota, and microbiota-targeted interventions, for research in this field.",Molecular psychiatry,2023,Kenji Hashimoto
37867494,"Exploring the gut microbiota: lifestyle choices, disease associations, and personal genomics.","The gut microbiota is a rich and dynamic ecosystem that actively interacts with the human body, playing a significant role in the state of health and disease of the host. Diet, exercise, mental health, and other factors have exhibited the ability to influence the gut bacterial composition, leading to changes that can prevent and improve, or favor and worsen, both intestinal and extra-intestinal conditions. Altered gut microbial states, or 'dysbiosis', associated with conditions and diseases are often characterized by shifts in bacterial abundance and diversity, including an impaired <i>Firmicutes</i> to <i>Bacteroidetes</i> ratio. By understanding the effect of lifestyle on the gut microbiota, personalized advice can be generated to suit each individual profile and foster the adoption of lifestyle changes that can both prevent and ameliorate dysbiosis. The delivery of effective and reliable advice, however, depends not only on the available research and current understanding of the topic, but also on the methods used to assess individuals and to discover the associations, which can introduce bias at multiple stages. The aim of this review is to summarize how human gut microbial variability is defined and what lifestyle choices and diseases have shown association with gut bacterial composition. Furthermore, popular methods to investigate the human gut microbiota are outlined, with a focus on the possible bias caused by the lack of use of standardized methods. Finally, an overview of the current state of personalized advice based on gut microbiota testing is presented, underlining its power and limitations.",Frontiers in nutrition,2023,Sharlize Pedroza Matute; Sasitaran Iyavoo
37174495,"Gut Microbiota and Behavioural Issues in Production, Performance, and Companion Animals: A Systematic Review.","The literature has identified poor nutrition as the leading factor in the manifestation of many behavioural issues in animals, including aggression, hyperalertness, and stereotypies. Literature focused on all species of interest consistently reported that although there were no significant differences in the richness of specific bacterial taxa in the microbiota of individual subjects with abnormal behaviour (termed alpha diversity), there was variability in species diversity between these subjects compared to controls (termed beta diversity). As seen in humans with mental disorders, animals exhibiting abnormal behaviour often have an enrichment of pro-inflammatory and lactic acid-producing bacteria and a reduction in butyrate-producing bacteria. It is evident from the literature that an association exists between gut microbiota diversity (and by extension, the concurrent production of microbial metabolites) and abnormal behavioural phenotypes across various species, including pigs, dogs, and horses. Similar microbiota population changes are also evident in human mental health patients. However, there are insufficient data to identify this association as a cause or effect. This review provides testable hypotheses for future research to establish causal relationships between gut microbiota and behavioural issues in animals, offering promising potential for the development of novel therapeutic and/or preventative interventions aimed at restoring a healthy gut-brain-immune axis to mitigate behavioural issues and, in turn, improve health, performance, and production in animals.",Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,2023,Bonnie Homer; Jackson Judd; Manijeh Mohammadi Dehcheshmeh; Esmaeil Ebrahimie; Darren J Trott
37108739,Circadian Disruption and Mental Health: The Chronotherapeutic Potential of Microbiome-Based and Dietary Strategies.,"Mental illness is alarmingly on the rise, and circadian disruptions linked to a modern lifestyle may largely explain this trend. Impaired circadian rhythms are associated with mental disorders. The evening chronotype, which is linked to circadian misalignment, is a risk factor for severe psychiatric symptoms and psychiatric metabolic comorbidities. Resynchronization of circadian rhythms commonly improves psychiatric symptoms. Furthermore, evidence indicates that preventing circadian misalignment may help reduce the risk of psychiatric disorders and the impact of neuro-immuno-metabolic disturbances in psychiatry. The gut microbiota exhibits diurnal rhythmicity, as largely governed by meal timing, which regulates the host's circadian rhythms. Temporal circadian regulation of feeding has emerged as a promising chronotherapeutic strategy to prevent and/or help with the treatment of mental illnesses, largely through the modulation of gut microbiota. Here, we provide an overview of the link between circadian disruption and mental illness. We summarize the connection between gut microbiota and circadian rhythms, supporting the idea that gut microbiota modulation may aid in preventing circadian misalignment and in the resynchronization of disrupted circadian rhythms. We describe diurnal microbiome rhythmicity and its related factors, highlighting the role of meal timing. Lastly, we emphasize the necessity and rationale for further research to develop effective and safe microbiome and dietary strategies based on chrononutrition to combat mental illness.",International journal of molecular sciences,2023,Pilar Codoñer-Franch; Marie Gombert; José Martínez-Raga; María Carmen Cenit

Our study aimed to determine how gut microbiota and metabolomes are related to the sleep quality among patients with depression and anxiety disorders by analyzing the datasets of our previous study.Samples were collected from 40 patients (depression: 32 patients [80.0%]); anxiety disorders: 8 patients [20.0%]) in this study. Gut microbiomes were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and gut metabolomes were analyzed by a mass spectrometry approach. Based on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), patients were categorized into two groups: the insomnia group (PSQI score ≥ 9, n = 20) and the non-insomnia group (PSQI score < 9, n = 20).The insomnia group showed a lower alpha diversity in the Chao1 and Shannon indices than the non-insomnia group after the false discovery rate (FDR) correction. The relative abundance of genus Bacteroides showed a positive correlation with PSQI scores in the non-insomnia group. The concentrations of glucosamine and N-methylglutamate were significantly higher in the insomnia group than in the non-insomnia group.Our findings suggest that specific taxa could affect the sleep quality among patients with depression and anxiety disorders.

38011787,Cryptotanshinone regulates gut microbiota and PI3K-AKT pathway in rats to alleviate CUMS induced depressive symptoms.,"Cryptotanshinone (CPT), a bioactive compound derived from the traditional Chinese herb Salvia miltiorrhiza, exhibits promising antidepressant properties. Employing a rat model subjected to Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress (CUMS), behavioral analyses (open field experiment, elevated cross maze experiment, sugar water preference experiment, forced swimming experiment) and inflammatory factor assessments were conducted to assess the efficacy of CPT in alleviating depressive symptoms and inflammatory responses induced by CUMS. Moreover, 16 S rDNA analysis revealed alterations in the gut microbiota of rats exposed to both CUMS and CPT administration. Notably, CPT administration was found to mitigate harmful bacterial shifts associated with depression. Preliminary exploration of the molecular mechanism underlying CPT's antidepressant effects via transcriptomics analysis and molecular docking indicated that CPT might exert its influence by regulating the PI3K-AKT pathway. This study sheds light on the potential therapeutic role of CPT in managing depressive disorders, offering a comprehensive understanding of its impact on behavior, inflammation, gut microbiota, and molecular pathways.",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2023,Li-Hua Bian; Si-Qi Wang; Wen-Jing Li; Jie Li; Yi Yin; Fang-Fu Ye; Jian-You Guo
37468912,Altered gut microbiota-host bile acid metabolism in IBS-D patients with liver depression and spleen deficiency pattern.,"Dysregulation of gut microbiota-host bile acid (BA) co-metabolism is a critical pathogenic factor of diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), instructed by pattern differentiation, is effective in treating IBS-D, in which liver depression and spleen deficiency (LDSD) is the most prevalent pattern. Still, it is unclear the linkage between the LDSD pattern and the BA metabolic phenotype.This study aimed to uncover the biological basis of the LDSD pattern from the BA metabolic perspective.Patients with IBS-D completed questionnaires regarding the irritable bowel severity scoring system (IBS-SSS), stool frequency, Stool Bristol scale, and Self-Rating Scales of mental health. Fasting blood and morning feces were collected to analyze the gut metagenome and BA-related indices/metabolites.IBS-D patients with LDSD had a higher incidence of BA overexcretion (41% vs. 23% non-LDSD) with significant elevations in fecal total BAs and serum BA precursor 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one levels. Compared to controls or non-LDSD patients, LDSD patients had a featured fecal BA profile, with higher proportions of deoxycholic acid (DCA), 7-ketodeoxycholic acid, and lithocholic acid. It is consistent with the BA-metabolizing genomic changes in the LDSD gut microbiota characterized by overabundances of 7-dehydroxylating bacteria and BA-inducible genes (baiCD/E/H). The score of bowel symptoms (stool frequency and abdominal pain) showing greater severity in the LDSD pattern were positively correlated with bai-expressing bacterial abundances and fecal DCA levels separately.We clarified a differed BA metabolic phenotype in IBS patients with LDSD, which closely correlates with the severity of bowel symptoms. It demonstrates that gut microbiota and host co-metabolism of BAs would provide crucial insight into the biology of the LDSD pattern and its internal relationship with IBS progression.",Chinese medicine,2023,Liqing Du; Zhaozhou Zhang; Lixiang Zhai; Shujun Xu; Wei Yang; Chunhua Huang; Chengyuan Lin; Linda L D Zhong; Zhaoxiang Bian; Ling Zhao
37548294,Challenges and priorities for researching the gut microbiota in individuals living with anorexia nervosa.,"The gut microbiota is implicated in several symptoms and biological pathways relevant to anorexia nervosa (AN). Investigations into the role of the gut microbiota in AN are growing, with a specific interest in the changes that occur in response to treatment. Findings suggest that microbial species may be associated with some of the symptoms common in AN, such as depression and gastrointestinal disturbances (GID). Therefore, researchers believe the gut microbiota may have therapeutic relevance. Whilst research in this field is rapidly expanding, the unique considerations relevant to conducting gut microbiota research in individuals with AN must be addressed.We provide an overview of the published literature investigating the relationship between the gut microbiota and symptoms and behaviors present in AN, discuss important challenges in gut microbiota research, and offer recommendations for addressing these. We conclude by summarizing research design priorities for the field to move forward.Several ways exist to reduce participant burden and accommodate challenges when researching the gut microbiota in individuals with AN.Recommendations from this article are foreseen to encourage scientific rigor and thoughtful protocol planning for microbiota research in AN, including ways to reduce participant burden. Employing such methods will contribute to a better understanding of the role of the gut microbiota in AN pathophysiology and treatment.The field of gut microbiota research is rapidly expanding, including the role of the gut microbiota in anorexia nervosa.

38010793,Multi-omics analyses demonstrate the modulating role of gut microbiota on the associations of unbalanced dietary intake with gastrointestinal symptoms in children with autism spectrum disorder.,"Our previous work revealed that unbalanced dietary intake was an important independent factor associated with constipation and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Growing evidence has shown the alterations in the gut microbiota and gut microbiota-derived metabolites in ASD. However, how the altered microbiota might affect the associations between unbalanced diets and GI symptoms in ASD remains unknown. We analyzed microbiome and metabolomics data in 90 ASD and 90 typically developing (TD) children based on 16S rRNA and untargeted metabolomics, together with dietary intake and GI symptoms assessment. We found that there existed 11 altered gut microbiota (FDR-corrected P-value <0.05) and 397 altered metabolites (P-value <0.05) in children with ASD compared with TD children. Among the 11 altered microbiota, the <i>Turicibacter</i>, <i>Coprococcus 1</i>, and <i>Lachnospiraceae FCS020 group</i> were positively correlated with constipation (FDR-corrected P-value <0.25). The Eggerthellaceae was positively correlated with total GI symptoms (FDR-corrected P-value <0.25). More importantly, three increased microbiota including <i>Turicibacter</i>, <i>Coprococcus 1</i>, and Eggerthellaceae positively modulated the associations of unbalanced dietary intake with constipation and total GI symptoms, and the decreased <i>Clostridium sp. BR31</i> negatively modulated their associations in ASD children (P-value <0.05). Together, the altered microbiota strengthens the relationship between unbalanced dietary intake and GI symptoms. Among the altered metabolites, ten metabolites derived from microbiota (<i>Turicibacter</i>, <i>Coprococcus 1</i>, Eggerthellaceae, and <i>Clostridium sp. BR31</i>) were screened out, enriched in eight metabolic pathways, and were identified to correlate with constipation and total GI symptoms in ASD children (FDR-corrected P-value <0.25). These metabolomics findings further support the modulating role of gut microbiota on the associations of unbalanced dietary intake with GI symptoms. Collectively, our research provides insights into the relationship between diet, the gut microbiota, and GI symptoms in children with ASD.",Gut microbes,2023,Hailin Li; Churui Liu; Saijun Huang; Xin Wang; Muqing Cao; Tingfeng Gu; Xiaoxuan Ou; Shuolin Pan; Zongyu Lin; Xiaotong Wang; Yanna Zhu; Jin Jing
37943628,Gut microbiota and child behavior in early puberty: does child sex play a role?,"A growing number of studies have indicated relations between the gut microbiota and mental health. However, to date, there is a scarcity of microbiota studies in community samples in early puberty. The current preregistered study (https://osf.io/wu2vt) investigated gut microbiota composition in relation to sex in low-risk children and explored behavioral associations with gut microbiota composition and metabolites in the same samples, together with the potential role of sex. Fecal microbiota composition was analyzed in 12-year-old children (<i>N</i> = 137) by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and quantitative PCR. Modest sex differences were observed in beta diversity. Generalized linear models showed consistent behavioral relations to both relative and absolute abundances of individual taxa, including positive associations between Parasutterella and mother-reported internalizing behavior, and negative associations between Odoribacter and mother-reported externalizing behavior. Additionally, Prevotella 9 was positively related to mother-reported externalizing behavior, confirming earlier findings on the same cohort at 5 years of age. Sex-related differences were found in behavioral relations to Ruminiclostridium 5, Alistipes, Streptococcus, Ruminiclostridium 9, Ruminococcaceae UCG-5, and Dialister, for relative abundances, as well as to Family XIII AD3011 group and an unidentified bacterium within the Tenericutes, for absolute abundances. Limited behavioral relations were observed regarding alpha diversity and fecal metabolites. Our findings describe links between the gut microbiota and child behavior, together with differences between child sexes in these relations, in low-risk early pubertal children. Importantly, this study confirmed earlier findings in this cohort of positive relations between Prevotella 9 and externalizing behavior at age 10 years. Results also show the merit of including absolute abundances in microbiota studies.",Gut microbes,2023,Yangwenshan Ou; Eline Rots; Clara Belzer; Hauke Smidt; Carolina de Weerth
38139446,A Pilot Interaction Analysis of Gut Microbiota and Peripheral Markers of Aging in Severe Psychiatric Disorders: A Role for <i>Lachnoclostridium</i>?,"Excessive predominance of pathological species in the gut microbiota could increase the production of inflammatory mediators at the gut level and, via modification of the gut-blood barrier, at the systemic level. This pro-inflammatory state could, in turn, increase biological aging that is generally proxied by telomere shortening. In this study, we present findings from a secondary interaction analysis of gut microbiota, aging, and inflammatory marker data from a cohort of patients with different diagnoses of severe mental disorders. We analyzed 15 controls, 35 patients with schizophrenia (SCZ), and 31 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) recruited among those attending a community mental health center (50 males and 31 females, mean and median age 46.8 and 46.3 years, respectively). We performed 16S rRNA sequencing as well as measurement of telomere length via quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. We applied statistical modeling with logistic regression to test for interaction between gut microbiota and these markers. Our results showed statistically significant interactions between telomere length and gut microbiota pointing to the genus <i>Lachnostridium</i>, which remained significantly associated with a reduced likelihood of MDD even after adjustment for a series of covariates. Although exploratory, these findings show that specific gut microbiota signatures overexpressing <i>Lachnoclostridium</i> and interacting with biological aging could modulate the liability for MDD.",International journal of molecular sciences,2023,Mirko Manchia; Pasquale Paribello; Claudia Pisanu; Donatella Congiu; Athos Antoniades; Paris Vogazianos; Federica Tozzi; Federica Pinna; Aristos Aristodimou; Paola Caria; Tinuccia Dettori; Daniela Virginia Frau; Cristina Cocco; Barbara Noli; Concetta Panebianco; Valerio Pazienza; Bernardo Carpiniello; Alessio Squassina
37604976,Transmission of Alzheimer's disease-associated microbiota dysbiosis and its impact on cognitive function: evidence from mice and patients.,"Spouses of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients are at a higher risk of developing incidental dementia. However, the causes and underlying mechanism of this clinical observation remain largely unknown. One possible explanation is linked to microbiota dysbiosis, a condition that has been associated with AD. However, it remains unclear whether gut microbiota dysbiosis can be transmitted from AD individuals to non-AD individuals and contribute to the development of AD pathogenesis and cognitive impairment. We, therefore, set out to perform both animal studies and clinical investigation by co-housing wild-type mice and AD transgenic mice, analyzing microbiota via 16S rRNA gene sequencing, measuring short-chain fatty acid amounts, and employing behavioral test, mass spectrometry, site-mutations and other methods. The present study revealed that co-housing between wild-type mice and AD transgenic mice or administrating feces of AD transgenic mice to wild-type mice resulted in AD-associated gut microbiota dysbiosis, Tau phosphorylation, and cognitive impairment in the wild-type mice. Gavage with Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium restored these changes in the wild-type mice. The oral and gut microbiota of AD patient partners resembled that of AD patients but differed from healthy controls, indicating the transmission of microbiota. The underlying mechanism of these findings includes that the butyric acid-mediated acetylation of GSK3β at lysine 15 regulated its phosphorylation at serine 9, consequently impacting Tau phosphorylation. Pending confirmative studies, these results provide insight into a potential link between the transmission of AD-associated microbiota dysbiosis and development of cognitive impairment, which underscore the need for further research in this area.",Molecular psychiatry,2023,Yiying Zhang; Yuan Shen; Ning Liufu; Ling Liu; Wei Li; Zhongyong Shi; Hailin Zheng; Xinchun Mei; Chih-Yu Chen; Zengliang Jiang; Shabnamsadat Abtahi; Yuanlin Dong; Feng Liang; Yujiang Shi; Leo L Cheng; Guang Yang; Jing X Kang; Jeremy E Wilkinson; Zhongcong Xie
37007475,Influence of mental health medication on microbiota in the elderly population in the Valencian region.,"Spain has an aging population; 19.93% of the Spanish population is over 65. Aging is accompanied by several health issues, including mental health disorders and changes in the gut microbiota. The gut-brain axis is a bidirectional network linking the central nervous system with gastrointestinal tract functions, and therefore, the gut microbiota can influence an individual's mental health. Furthermore, aging-related physiological changes affect the gut microbiota, with differences in taxa and their associated metabolic functions between younger and older people. Here, we took a case-control approach to study the interplay between gut microbiota and mental health of elderly people. Fecal and saliva samples from 101 healthy volunteers over 65 were collected, of which 28 (EE|MH group) reported using antidepressants or medication for anxiety or insomnia at the time of sampling. The rest of the volunteers (EE|NOMH group) were the control group. 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metagenomic sequencing were applied to determine the differences between intestinal and oral microbiota. Significant differences in genera were found, specifically eight in the gut microbiota, and five in the oral microbiota. Functional analysis of fecal samples showed differences in five orthologous genes related to tryptophan metabolism, the precursor of serotonin and melatonin, and in six categories related to serine metabolism, a precursor of tryptophan. Moreover, we found 29 metabolic pathways with significant inter-group differences, including pathways regulating longevity, the dopaminergic synapse, the serotoninergic synapse, and two amino acids.",Frontiers in microbiology,2023,Nicole Pesantes; Ana Barberá; Benjamí Pérez-Rocher; Alejandro Artacho; Sergio Luís Vargas; Andrés Moya; Susana Ruiz-Ruiz
36757367,Targeting the gut-microbiota-brain axis in irritable bowel disease to improve cognitive function - recent knowledge and emerging therapeutic opportunities.,"The brain-gut axis forms a bidirectional communication system between the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and cognitive brain areas. Disturbances to this system in disease states such as inflammatory bowel disease have consequences for neuronal activity and subsequent cognitive function. The gut-microbiota-brain axis refers to the communication between gut-resident bacteria and the brain. This circuits exists to detect gut microorganisms and relay information to specific areas of the central nervous system (CNS) that in turn, regulate gut physiology. Changes in both the stability and diversity of the gut microbiota have been implicated in several neuronal disorders, including depression, autism spectrum disorder Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. Correcting this imbalance with medicinal herbs, the metabolic products of dysregulated bacteria and probiotics have shown hope for the treatment of these neuronal disorders. In this review, we focus on recent advances in our understanding of the intricate connections between the gut-microbiota and the brain. We discuss the contribution of gut microbiota to neuronal disorders and the tangible links between diseases of the GI tract with cognitive function and behaviour. In this regard, we focus on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) given its strong links to brain function and anxiety disorders. This adds to the growing body of evidence supporting targeted therapeutic strategies to modulate the gut microbiota for the treatment of brain/mental-health-related disease.",Reviews in the neurosciences,2023,Heyong Tang; Xiaoqi Chen; Shun Huang; Gang Yin; Xiyang Wang; Guoming Shen
37852343,"Major depressive disorder as a neuro-immune disorder: Origin, mechanisms, and therapeutic opportunities.","Notwithstanding advances in understanding the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD), no single mechanism can explain all facets of this disorder. An expanding body of evidence indicates a putative role for the inflammatory response. Several meta-analyses showed an increase in systemic peripheral inflammatory markers in individuals with MDD. Numerous conditions and circumstances in the modern world may promote chronic systemic inflammation through mechanisms, including alterations in the gut microbiota. Peripheral cytokines may reach the brain and contribute to neuroinflammation through cellular, humoral, and neural pathways. On the other hand, antidepressant drugs may decrease peripheral levels of inflammatory markers. Anti-inflammatory drugs and nutritional strategies that reduce inflammation also could improve depressive symptoms. The present study provides a critical review of recent advances in the role of inflammation in the pathophysiology of MDD. Furthermore, this review discusses the role of glial cells and the main drivers of changes associated with neuroinflammation. Finally, we highlight possible novel neurotherapeutic targets for MDD that could exert antidepressant effects by modulating inflammation.",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,2023,Gislaine Z Réus; Luana M Manosso; João Quevedo; André F Carvalho

The current study aimed to explore the association between oral and gut microbiota in AD to clarify whether oral microbiota could ectopically colonize into the gut.16S rRNA sequence libraries were used to compare oral and gut microbial profiles in persons with AD and healthy controls (HC). Source Tracker and NetShift were used to identify bacteria responsible for ectopic colonization and indicate the driver function of ectopic colonization bacteria.The α-diversity of oral microbiota and intestinal microbiota was significantly decreased in persons with AD (all <i>p</i> < 0.05). Principal coordinate analysis indicated greater similarity between oral and gut microbiota in persons with AD than that in HC, and oral-gut overlaps in microbiota were found for 9 genera in persons with AD relative to only 3 genera in HC. The contribution ratio of oral microbiota to intestinal microbiota composition in AD is 5.26% based on Source Tracker，and the AD with ectopic colonization showed the daily maximum standard drinks, red blood cell counts, hemoglobin content, and PACS scores decreasing (all <i>p</i> < 0.05).Results highlight the connection between oral-gut microbiota in AD and suggest novel potential mechanistic possibilities.",Frontiers in microbiology,2023,Lingming Hu; Zhaojun Ni; Kangqing Zhao; Xiangxue Li; Xuejiao Gao; Yulin Kang; Zhoulong Yu; Ying Qin; Jingwen Zhao; Wenjuan Peng; Lin Lu; Hongqiang Sun
37659269,Disordered gut microbiota and changes in short-chain fatty acids and inflammatory processes in stress-vulnerable mice.,"Long-term exposure to chronic stress increases the incidence of depression. However, chronic stress is an associated risk factor in only a subset of individuals. Inflammation has been identified as a putative mechanism promoting stress vulnerability. Because of the gut microbiota's potential role as a source of inflammatory substances, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) may exert their influence on inflammation, emotional states, and cognition via the gut-brain axis. In this study, Classic behavioral tests were used to categorize C57BL/6 J mice into a CUMS-vulnerable and a CUMS-resilient group after they were exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). We compared the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences retrieved from fecal samples between control, CUMS-vulnerable, and CUMS-resilient mice. SCFAs in fecal samples were detected by liquid chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Hippocampal cytokine production and TLR4/MYD88/NF-κB inflammatory pathway activation were evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and western blotting. Then, we supplemented SCFAs in CUMS mice. we observed depression-like behavior and the expression of TLR4/MYD88/NF-κB inflammatory pathway in hippocampus of SCFAs supplementation mice. Susceptible mice to CUMS showed more severe symptoms of depression and anxiety, α diversity was significantly different, as well as higher expression of interleukin (IL)-1β and TLR4/MYD88/NF-κB inflammatory pathway components in the hippocampus. SCFA levels in the feces were significantly higher in CUMS-resilient mice than in control mice. Depressive behavior was reversed in CUMS-SCFAs group, and the protein level of TLR4/MYD88/NF-κB in hippocampus was decreased. Overall, these results provide new light on the possible involvement of the microbiome in the gut-brain axis development in depressive disorder and provide a theoretical basis for identifying novel therapeutic targets.",Journal of neuroimmunology,2023,Wenjuan Han; Yaxin Zheng; Lan Wang; Cuixia An
36945049,"Maternal weight, gut microbiota, and the association with early childhood behavior: the PREOBE follow-up study.","Maternal overweight and breastfeeding seem to have a significant impact on the gut microbiota colonization process, which co-occurs simultaneously with brain development and the establishment of the ""microbiota-gut-brain axis"", which potentially may affect behavior later in life. This study aimed to examine the influence of maternal overweight, obesity and/or gestational diabetes on the offspring behavior at 3.5 years of age and its association with the gut microbiota already established at 18 months of life.156 children born to overweight (OV, n = 45), obese (OB, n = 40) and normoweight (NW, n = 71) pregnant women participating in the PREOBE study were included in the current analysis. Stool samples were collected at 18 months of life and gut microbiome was obtained by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Behavioral problems were evaluated at 3.5 years by using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). ANOVA, Chi-Square Test, ANCOVA, Spearman's correlation, logistic regression model and generalized linear model (GLM) were performed.At 3.5 years of age, Children born to OV/OB mothers showed higher scores in behavioral problems than those born to NW mothers. Additionally, offspring born to OB mothers who developed gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) presented higher scores in attention/deficit hyperactivity and externalizing problems than those born to GDM OV/NW mothers. Fusicatenibacter abundance found at 18 months of age was associated to lower scores in total, internalizing and pervasive developmental problems, while an unidentified genus within Clostridiales and Flavonifractor families abundance showed a positive correlation with anxiety/depression and somatic complaints, respectively. On the other hand, children born to mothers with higher BMI who were breastfed presented elevated anxiety, internalizing problems, externalizing problems and total problems scores; likewise, their gut microbiota composition at 18 months of age showed positive correlation with behavioral problems at 3.5 years: Actinobacteria abundance and somatic complaints and between Fusobacteria abundance and withdrawn behavior and pervasive developmental problems.Our findings suggests that OV/OB and/or GDM during pregnancy is associated with higher behavioral problems scores in children at 3.5 years old. Additionally, associations between early life gut microbiota composition and later mental health in children was also found.",Child and adolescent psychiatry and mental health,2023,Ana Nieto-Ruiz; Tomás Cerdó; Belén Jordano; Francisco J Torres-Espínola; Mireia Escudero-Marín; María García-Ricobaraza; Mercedes G Bermúdez; José A García-Santos; Antonio Suárez; Cristina Campoy
36593394,Discovery of drug-omics associations in type 2 diabetes with generative deep-learning models.,"The application of multiple omics technologies in biomedical cohorts has the potential to reveal patient-level disease characteristics and individualized response to treatment. However, the scale and heterogeneous nature of multi-modal data makes integration and inference a non-trivial task. We developed a deep-learning-based framework, multi-omics variational autoencoders (MOVE), to integrate such data and applied it to a cohort of 789 people with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes with deep multi-omics phenotyping from the DIRECT consortium. Using in silico perturbations, we identified drug-omics associations across the multi-modal datasets for the 20 most prevalent drugs given to people with type 2 diabetes with substantially higher sensitivity than univariate statistical tests. From these, we among others, identified novel associations between metformin and the gut microbiota as well as opposite molecular responses for the two statins, simvastatin and atorvastatin. We used the associations to quantify drug-drug similarities, assess the degree of polypharmacy and conclude that drug effects are distributed across the multi-omics modalities.",Nature biotechnology,2023,Rosa Lundbye Allesøe; Agnete Troen Lundgaard; Ricardo Hernández Medina; Alejandro Aguayo-Orozco; Joachim Johansen; Jakob Nybo Nissen; Caroline Brorsson; Gianluca Mazzoni; Lili Niu; Jorge Hernansanz Biel; Cristina Leal Rodríguez; Valentas Brasas; Henry Webel; Michael Eriksen Benros; Anders Gorm Pedersen; Piotr Jaroslaw Chmura; Ulrik Plesner Jacobsen; Andrea Mari; Robert Koivula; Anubha Mahajan; Ana Vinuela; Juan Fernandez Tajes; Sapna Sharma; Mark Haid; Mun-Gwan Hong; Petra B Musholt; Federico De Masi; Josef Vogt; Helle Krogh Pedersen; Valborg Gudmundsdottir; Angus Jones; Gwen Kennedy; Jimmy Bell; E Louise Thomas; Gary Frost; Henrik Thomsen; Elizaveta Hansen; Tue Haldor Hansen; Henrik Vestergaard; Mirthe Muilwijk; Marieke T Blom; Leen M 't Hart; Francois Pattou; Violeta Raverdy; Soren Brage; Tarja Kokkola; Alison Heggie; Donna McEvoy; Miranda Mourby; Jane Kaye; Andrew Hattersley; Timothy McDonald; Martin Ridderstråle; Mark Walker; Ian Forgie; Giuseppe N Giordano; Imre Pavo; Hartmut Ruetten; Oluf Pedersen; Torben Hansen; Emmanouil Dermitzakis; Paul W Franks; Jochen M Schwenk; Jerzy Adamski; Mark I McCarthy; Ewan Pearson; Karina Banasik; Simon Rasmussen; Søren Brunak; 
37744899,Impact of clozapine monotherapy on gut microbiota and metabolism in people with schizophrenia.,"Clozapine is considered one of the most effective antipsychotic drugs, but it is most likely to cause metabolic abnormalities. Researchers have studied the causes of metabolic abnormalities caused by clozapine from multiple perspectives, but the reasons remain unclear.Characterize the gut microbiota of people with schizophrenia taking clozapine, exploring the association between gut microbiota and glucose lipid metabolic markers in schizophrenia patients taking clozapine.Sixty-one long-term inpatients with schizophrenia in clozapine monotherapy were selected as study subjects. We got four subgroups by sex and the presence of metabolic syndrome.16s analysis technology was applied at the genus level to determine the classification of gut microbiota. Then we compared the characteristics of gut microbiota and the association of gut microbiota with glucose lipid metabolic markers in each group.We found differences in the diversity of gut microbiota among groups. The association between gut microbiota and glucose lipid metabolic markers was complicated. Gender was an important differentiating factor. <i>Oscillibacter</i> has a low abundance. However, it was the only genus associated with glycemic or lipids in each group. Among metabolic syndromes, <i>Gemmiger</i> was positively correlated with most lipids in females but negatively correlated in males, showing gender differences. In female non-metabolic syndromes, <i>Bifidobacterium</i> lost its probiotic character; instead, showing pathogenicity, which has strong positive correlations with fasting blood glucose and low-density lipoprotein but negative correlations with Apolipoprotein A1. Maybe schizophrenia, taking clozapine, and gender factors influenced the gut microbiota, which complicated our findings.

36707651,Microbiota-gut-brain axis mechanisms in the complex network of bipolar disorders: potential clinical implications and translational opportunities.,"Bipolar disorders (BD) represent a severe leading disabling mental condition worldwide characterized by episodic and often progressive mood fluctuations with manic and depressive stages. The biological mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of BD remain incompletely understood, but it seems that there is a complex picture of genetic and environmental factors implicated. Nowadays, gut microbiota is in the spotlight of new research related to this kind of psychiatric disorder, as it can be consistently related to several pathophysiological events observed in BD. In the context of the so-called microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis, it is shown to have a strong influence on host neuromodulation and endocrine functions (i.e., controlling the synthesis of neurotransmitters like serotonin or mediating the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis), as well as in modulation of host immune responses, critically regulating intestinal, systemic and brain inflammation (neuroinflammation). The present review aims to elucidate pathophysiological mechanisms derived from the MGB axis disruption and possible therapeutic approaches mainly focusing on gut microbiota in the complex network of BD. Understanding the mechanisms of gut microbiota and its bidirectional communication with the immune and other systems can shed light on the discovery of new therapies for improving the clinical management of these patients. Besides, the effect of psychiatric drugs on gut microbiota currently used in BD patients, together with new therapeutical approaches targeting this ecosystem (dietary patterns, probiotics, prebiotics, and other novelties) will also be contemplated.",Molecular psychiatry,2023,Miguel A Ortega; Miguel Angel Álvarez-Mon; Cielo García-Montero; Óscar Fraile-Martínez; Jorge Monserrat; Lucia Martinez-Rozas; Roberto Rodríguez-Jiménez; Melchor Álvarez-Mon; Guillermo Lahera
37741061,The role of the gut-microbiota-brain axis via the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve in chronic inflammatory pain and comorbid spatial working memory impairment in complete Freund's adjuvant mice.,"Chronic inflammatory pain (CIP) is a common public medical problem, often accompanied by memory impairment. However, the mechanisms underlying CIP and comorbid memory impairment remain elusive. This study aimed to examine the role of the gut-microbiota-brain axis in CIP and comorbid memory impairment in mice treated with complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). 16S rRNA analysis showed the altered diversity of gut microbiota from day 1 to day 14 after CFA injection. Interestingly, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from healthy naive mice ameliorated comorbidities, such as mechanical allodynia, thermal hyperalgesia, spatial working memory impairment, neuroinflammation, and abnormal composition of gut microbiota in the CFA mice. Additionally, subdiaphragmatic vagotomy (SDV) blocked the onset of these comorbidities. Interestingly, the relative abundance of the bacterial genus or species was also correlated with these comorbidities after FMT or SDV. Therefore, our results suggest that the gut-microbiota-brain axis via the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve is crucial for the development of CIP and comorbid spatial working memory impairment in CFA mice.",Journal of psychiatric research,2023,Caibao Yue; Weiwei Luan; Hanwen Gu; Di Qiu; Xin Ding; Panmiao Liu; Xingming Wang; Kenji Hashimoto; Jian-Jun Yang

36990371,"Outrunning a bad diet: Interactions between exercise and a Western-style diet for adolescent mental health, metabolism and microbes.","Adolescence is a period of biological, psychological and social changes, and the peak time for the emergence of mental health problems. During this life stage, brain plasticity including hippocampal neurogenesis is increased, which is crucial for cognitive functions and regulation of emotional responses. The hippocampus is especially susceptible to environmental and lifestyle influences, mediated by changes in physiological systems, resulting in enhanced brain plasticity but also an elevated risk for developing mental health problems. Indeed, adolescence is accompanied by increased activation of the maturing hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, sensitivity to metabolic changes due to increased nutritional needs and hormonal changes, and gut microbiota maturation. Importantly, dietary habits and levels of physical activity significantly impact these systems. In this review, the interactions between exercise and Western-style diets, which are high in fat and sugar, on adolescent stress susceptibility, metabolism and the gut microbiota are explored. We provide an overview of current knowledge on implications of these interactions for hippocampal function and adolescent mental health, and speculate on potential mechanisms which require further investigation.",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,2023,Minke H C Nota; Sarah Nicolas; Olivia F O'Leary; Yvonne M Nolan
37049591,Dysbiosis of the Gut Microbiota and Kynurenine (Kyn) Pathway Activity as Potential Biomarkers in Patients with Major Depressive Disorder.,"With increasing attention paid to the concept of the microbiota-gut-brain axis, mounting evidence reveals that the gut microbiota is involved in a variety of neurological and psychiatric diseases. However, gut microbiota changes in major depressive disorder (MDD) patients and their association with disease mechanisms remain undefined. Fifty MDD patients and sixty healthy controls were recruited from the Shanghai Healthy Mental Center, China. Fecal samples were collected, and the compositional characteristics of the intestinal flora were determined in MDD patients by MiSeq sequencing. Venous blood was collected for the detection of plasma indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (Ido), kynurenine (Kyn) and tryptophan (Trp) levels. Stool samples of bacterial 16S sequencing was carried out. A total of 2,705,809 optimized sequences were obtained, with an average of 54,116 per sample. More unique OTUs were observed at the family, genus and species levels in the control group compared with the MDD cases. Further analysis showed significant changes in the α- and β-diversities and relative abundance levels of gut microbial entities in MDD patients, as well as elevated amounts of Ido and Kyn indicating Kyn pathway activation, KEGG bacterial 16S function prediction analysis shows a variety of amino acids and metabolic (including Ido, Trp and Kyn) changes in the body of patients with MDD. These may result in increased neurotoxic metabolites and reduced generation of serotonin in the disease process. These changed factors may potentially be utilized as biomarkers for MDD in the future, playing more important roles in the disease course.",Nutrients,2023,Ping Lin; Dan Li; Yun Shi; Qingtian Li; Xiaokui Guo; Ke Dong; Qing Chen; Xiaoyan Lou; Zhenhua Li; Ping Li; Weifeng Jin; Shuzi Chen; Yang Sun; Jing Sun; Xunjia Cheng
37774944,Gut-muscle-brain axis: Molecular mechanisms in neurodegenerative disorders and potential therapeutic efficacy of probiotic supplementation coupled with exercise.,"Increased longevity is often associated with age-related conditions. The most common neurodegenerative disorders in the older population are Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), associated with progressive neuronal loss leading to functional and cognitive impairments. Although symptomatic treatments are available, there is currently no cure for these conditions. Gut dysbiosis has been involved in the pathogenesis of AD and PD, thus interventions targeting the ""gut-brain axis"" could potentially prevent or delay these pathologies. Recent evidence suggests that the skeletal muscle and the gut microbiota can affect each other via the ""gut-muscle axis"". Importantly, cognitive functions in AD and PD patients significantly benefit from physical activity. In this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive picture of the crosstalk between the brain, the skeletal muscle and the gut microbiota, introducing the concept of ""gut-muscle-brain axis"". Moreover, we discuss human and animal studies exploring the modulatory role of exercise and probiotics on cognition in AD and PD. Collectively, the findings presented here support the potential benefits of physical activity and probiotic supplementation in AD and PD. Further studies will be needed to develop targeted and multimodal strategies, including lifestyle changes, to prevent or delay the course of these pathologies.",Neuropharmacology,2023,Ilaria Morella; Massimo Negro; Maurizia Dossena; Riccardo Brambilla; Giuseppe D'Antona
37485660,Flavonoids from Seabuckthorn (<i>Hippophae rhamnoides</i> L.) restore CUMS-induced depressive disorder and regulate the gut microbiota in mice.,"Seabuckthorn (<i>Hippophae rhamnoides</i> L.), which is enriched with flavonoids, including isorhamnetin, quercetin and kaempferol, is a representative example of ""medicine food homology"" targeting several diseases. Major depressive disorders seriously threaten mental health worldwide and may even lead to death. Chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depressive-like symptoms in mice are usually considered as the highest similarity to the situation in humans. Herein, we determined the potential functions of the flavonoid-enriched fraction from Seabuckthorn, which was named SBF, in treating major depressive disorder in mice. In the CUMS-induced mouse model, the intake of SBF reversed their depressive behaviors and relieved the CUMS-disturbed levels of neurotrophins, neurotransmitters, stress-related hormones, and inflammation-related cytokines. Additionally, the treatment of depressive mice with SBF showed ability to regulate the gut microbiota, especially in decreasing the abundance of <i>Lactobacillaceae</i>, while increasing the abundance of <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> at the family level. The results suggest the beneficial effects of Seabuckthorn flavonoids in functioning as a health food supplement to treat major depressive disorders.",Food & function,2023,Chen-Xi Xia; Alex Xiong Gao; Yue Zhu; Tina Ting-Xia Dong; Karl Wah-Keung Tsim
37127945,A systematic review on gut-brain axis aberrations in bipolar disorder and methods of balancing the gut microbiota.,"Bipolar disorder (BD) is a mood disorder that affects millions worldwide. Up to half of the diagnosed patients are reported to not receive adequate treatment. This study aims to assess the relationship between the gut-brain axis and BD and to discuss and compare the efficacy of varying methods of balancing gut microbiotas in BD.Using PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar from November 2021 to February 2022, we found 5310 studies on gut microbiota and its relation to BD. Using our inclusion criteria, 5283 studies were excluded. A total of 27 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. Also, 12 articles that met our criteria and eligibility criteria reported on 613 BD patients.Most studies analyzed found an overall difference in gut microbiota composition in bipolar patients compared to healthy controls, though the alterations found were not consistent. Differences in Lactobacillus, Faecalibacterium, and Ruminococcus abundance in BD compared to controls were found to be the most consistent across a few of the studies, but their effects on the gut-brain axis conflicted. Probiotic supplementation was found to lower patient rehospitalizations and significantly improve depressive symptoms and cognitive impairments among patients with BD.Multiple studies included in this review point toward a possible link between BD and the gut microbiota. Probiotic supplements and other gut-balancing therapies could serve as effective adjunctive methods for the treatment of BD. Notable limitations of the studies included for analysis were small sample sizes and majority observational study designs. Furthermore, the microbiota aberrations found in patients with BD were not consistent across multiple studies. Despite these limitations, our findings demonstrate the need for further research regarding the relationship between aberrant gut microbiota profiles and BD, as well as the effectiveness of gut balancing methods as adjunctive treatments.",Brain and behavior,2023,Crystal Obi-Azuike; Ruona Ebiai; Taneil Gibson; Ariana Hernandez; Asma Khan; Gibson Anugwom; Alexsandra Urhi; Sakshi Prasad; Sara Ait Souabni; Funso Oladunjoye

38204948,"Neuroendocrine, neurotransmitter, and gut microbiota imbalance contributing to potential psychiatric disorder prevalence in polycystic ovarian syndrome.","Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in women, affecting up to 15% of reproductive-aged women. Polycystic ovarian syndrome is a heterogeneous disorder, both in the sense that many different factors may play a role in its manifestation and that multiple systems throughout the body can be affected. Polycystic ovarian syndrome has been linked to an increased prevalence of various psychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety. Despite the socioeconomic effect that these disorders may have on patients with PCOS and society as a whole, this association is largely lacking in research. There are currently several theories regarding the link between PCOS and mental health. Some suggest that the overactive hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axes in PCOS patients may alter the hormonal profile and contribute to the development of psychiatric disorders. Other studies speculate that abnormal levels of neurotransmitters and neuronal signaling may play a role. Recently, more research has begun to focus on the gut-brain axis, addressing the nutritional needs of PCOS patients. Studies show that dietary factors such as probiotics and micronutrient supplementation may significantly improve psychiatric symptoms in PCOS patients while helping regulate neurotransmitter levels in the body. In this review, we examine different theories regarding the association between PCOS and psychiatric disorders and point out different areas of research that are needed to broaden our understanding of this association.",F&S reports,2023,Karis I Sarkisian; Lananh Ho; Jane Yang; Rachel Mandelbaum; Frank Z Stanczyk

The intervention comprised 1.2 g/d of ginger (4 capsules per day totaling 84 mg/d of active gingerols/shogaols) for 14 d following a 1-wk run-in period. Primary outcomes were gastrointestinal community composition, alpha and beta diversity, and differential abundance, measured using 16S rRNA gene sequencing of fecal samples. Secondary outcomes were gastrointestinal symptoms, bowel function, depression, anxiety, stress, fatigue, quality of life, and adverse events.Fifty-one participants were enrolled and analyzed (71% female; mean age 25 ± 3 y; ginger: n = 29, placebo: n = 22). There was a greater increase in relative abundance of phylum, Actinobacteria, observed following ginger supplementation compared to placebo (U: 145.0; z: -2.1; P = 0.033). Ginger was associated with a greater abundance of the genera Parabacteroides, Bacillus, Ruminococcaceae incertae sedis, unclassified Bacilli, families Defluviitaleaceae, Morganellaceae, and Bacillaceae as well as lower abundance of the genus Blautia and family Sphingomonadaceae (P < 0.05). An improvement in indigestion symptoms was observed with ginger supplementation (U: 196.0; z: -2.4; P = 0.015). No differences between ginger and placebo groups were found for alpha and beta diversity or other secondary outcomes. No moderate or severe adverse events were reported.Supplementation with ginger root powder was safe and altered aspects of gastrointestinal bacteria composition; however, it did not change alpha- or beta diversity, bowel function, gastrointestinal symptoms, mood, or quality of life in healthy adults. These results provide further understanding regarding the mechanisms of action of ginger supplementation.

38026003,The importance of the intestinal microbiota in humans and dogs in the neonatal period.,"The neonatal period represents a critical stage for the establishment and development of the gut microbiota, which profoundly influences the future health trajectory of individuals. This review examines the importance of intestinal microbiota in humans and dogs, aiming to elucidate the distinct characteristics and variations in the composition between these two species. In humans, the intestinal microbiota contributes to several crucial physiological processes, including digestion, nutrient absorption, immune system development, and modulation of host metabolism. Dysbiosis, an imbalance or disruption of the gut microbial community, has been linked to various disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, and even neurological conditions. Furthermore, recent research has unveiled the profound influence of the gut-brain axis, emphasizing the bidirectional communication between the gut microbiota and the central nervous system, impacting cognitive function and mental health. Similarly, alterations in the canine intestinal microbiota have been associated with gastrointestinal disorders, including chronic enteropathy, such as inflammatory bowel disease, food allergies, and ulcerative histiocytic colitis. However, our understanding of the intricacies and functional significance of the intestinal microbiota in dogs remains limited. Understanding the complex dynamics of the intestinal microbiota in both humans and dogs is crucial for devising effective strategies to promote health and manage disease. Moreover, exploring the similarities and differences in the gut microbial composition between these two species can facilitate translational research, potentially leading to innovative therapeutic interventions and strategies to enhance the well-being of both humans and dogs.",Animal reproduction,2023,Samara Beretta; Maricy Apparicio; Gilson Hélio Toniollo; Marita Vedovelli Cardozo
37630649,Microbiota in Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Endometriosis: Birds of a Feather Flock Together-A Review.,"Endometriosis and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are chronic conditions affecting up to 10% of the global population, imposing significant burdens on healthcare systems and patient quality of life. Interestingly, around 20% of endometriosis patients also present with symptoms indicative of IBS. The pathogenesis of both these multifactorial conditions remains to be fully elucidated, but connections to gut microbiota are becoming more apparent. Emerging research underscores significant differences in the gut microbiota composition between healthy individuals and those suffering from either endometriosis or IBS. Intestinal dysbiosis appears pivotal in both conditions, exerting an influence via similar mechanisms. It impacts intestinal permeability, triggers inflammatory reactions, and initiates immune responses. Furthermore, it is entwined in a bidirectional relationship with the brain, as part of the gut-brain axis, whereby dysbiosis influences and is influenced by mental health and pain perception. Recent years have witnessed the development of microbiota-focused therapies, such as low FODMAP diets, prebiotics, probiotics, antibiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation, designed to tackle dysbiosis and relieve symptoms.

37981054,Neuropsychiatric disturbances in mild cognitive impairment: A scientometric analysis.,"Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) have been extensively studied in dementia than its prodromal stage, known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). A scientometric study on BPSD in MCI would be valuable in synthesizing the existing body of research and providing insights into the trends, networks, and influencers within this area. We searched for related literature in the Web of Science database and extracted complete text and citation records of each publication. The primary objective was to map the research evolution of BPSD in MCI and highlight dominant research themes. The secondary objective was to identify research network characteristics (authors, journals, countries, and institutions) and abundances. A total of 12,369 studies published between 1980 and 2022 were included in the analysis. We found 51 distinct clusters from the co-cited reference network that were highly credible with significant modularity (Q = 0.856) and silhouette scores (S = 0.932). Five major research domains were identified: symptoms, diagnosis, brain substrates, biochemical pathways, and interventions. In recent years, the research focus in this area has been on gut microbiota, e-health, COVID-19, cognition, and delirium. Collectively, findings from this scientometric analysis can help clarify the scope and direction of future research and clinical practices.",Ageing research reviews,2023,Arisara Amrapala; Michel Sabé; Marco Solmi; Michael Maes
37414494,Neuroinflammation through the vagus nerve-dependent gut-microbiota-brain axis in treatment-resistant depression.,"Neuroinflammation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder (MDD), including treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Patients with TRD have higher levels of inflammatory biomarkers compared with responders to antidepressants. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the gut-microbiota-brain axis via the vagus nerve plays a key role in neuroinflammation. Preclinical and clinical data suggest that fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from MDD patients or rodents with depression-like behaviors cause depression-like behaviors in rodents through systemic inflammation. Importantly, subdiaphragmatic vagotomy blocked these depression-like phenotypes and systemic inflammation in rodents after FMT of depression-related microbes. Subdiaphragmatic vagotomy also blocked the antidepressant-like effects of serotonergic antidepressants in rodents. Preclinical findings suggest that the new antidepressant, (R)-ketamine (or arketamine), may restore the altered composition of gut microbiota in rodents with depression-like behaviors, contributing to the beneficial effects of arketamine. In this chapter, the author reviews the role of the vagus nerve-dependent gut-microbiota-brain axis in depression (including TRD), and also discuss the potential of FMT, vagus nerve stimulation, and arketamine for the treatment of TRD.",Progress in brain research,2023,Kenji Hashimoto
37046334,"Effects of prebiotic supplement on gut microbiota, drug bioavailability, and adverse effects in patients with colorectal cancer at different primary tumor locations receiving chemotherapy: study protocol for a randomized clinical trial.","The prevalence of colorectal cancer (CRC) worldwide is a huge challenge to human health. Primary tumor locations found to impact prognosis and response to therapy. The important role of gut microbiota in the progression and treatment of CRC has led to many attempts of alleviating chemotherapy-induced adverse effects using microecologics. However, the underlying mechanism of the difference in the prognosis of different primary tumor locations and the synergistic effect of prebiotics on chemotherapy need to be further elucidated. This study aims to explore the differences in tumor microbiota and examine the effectiveness of xylooligosaccharides (XOS) on gut microbiota, adverse effects, and bioavailability of chemotherapy drugs in CRC patients at different primary tumor locations.This is a double-blinded, randomized, parallel controlled clinical trial. Participants with left-sided CRC (LSCRC, n = 50) and right-sided CC (RSCC, n = 50) will randomly allocated to prebiotic group (n = 25) or control group (n = 25) and will receive either a daily XOS (3 g/day) or placebo, respectively, for 12 weeks. The primary outcomes will be the differences in the mucosa microbiota composition at different tumor locations and differences in gut microbiota composition, adverse effects, and blood concentration of capecitabine posttreatment. The secondary outcomes will include other blood indicators, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) concentration, quality of life, and mental health.This study will reveal the potential benefits of prebiotic for improving the gut microbiota composition, alleviating the adverse effects, and improving the efficacy of chemotherapy in patients with CRC. In addition, this study will provide data on the different distribution of tumor microbiota and the different changes of gut microbiota during treatment in LSCRC and RSCC, which may provide novel insights into personalized cancer treatment strategies based on primary tumor locations and gut microbiota in the future.Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ( www.chictr.org.cn ): ChiCTR2100046237.

37396336,Sex-specific effects of voluntary wheel running on behavior and the gut microbiota-immune-brain axis in mice.,"Physical exercise has been positioned as a promising strategy to prevent and/or alleviate anxiety and depression, but the biological processes associated with its effects on mental health have yet to be entirely determined. Although the prevalence of depression and anxiety in women is about twice that of men, very few studies have examined whether physical exercise could affect mental health differently according to sex. This study examined, in singly-housed mice, the sex-specific effects of voluntary exercise on depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors as well as on different markers along the gut microbiota-immune-brain axis. Male and female C57BL/6N mice had voluntary access to running wheels in their home-cages for 24 days or were left undisturbed in identical home-cages without running wheels. Behaviors were then examined in the open field, splash, elevated plus maze, and tail suspension tests. Gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, microglia activation-related genes, and tight junction proteins was determined in the jejunum and the hippocampus, while microbiota composition and predicted function were verified in cecum contents. Voluntary exercise reduced anxiety-like behaviors and altered grooming patterns in males exclusively. Although the exercise intervention resulted in changes to brain inflammatory activity and to cecal microbiota composition and inferred function in both sexes, reductions in the jejunal expression of pro-inflammatory markers were observed in females only. These findings support the view that voluntary exercise, even when performed during a short period, is beneficial for mental and intestinal health and that its sex-specific effects on behavior could be, at least in part, related to some components of the gut microbiota-immune-brain axis.","Brain, behavior, & immunity - health",2023,Zoë A P Williams; Joanna Kasia Szyszkowicz; Natasha Osborne; Bshaier Allehyany; Christophe Nadon; Maryann Chinonye Udechukwu; Ana Santos; Marie-Claude Audet
36943505,Ketogenic diet for mood disorders from animal models to clinical application.,"Mood disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD) are often resistant to current pharmacological treatment. Therefore, various alternative therapeutic approaches including diets are, therefore, under investigation. Ketogenic diet (KD) is effective for treatment-resistant epilepsy and metabolic diseases, however, only a few clinical studies suggest its beneficial effect also for mental disorders. Animal models are a useful tool to uncover the underlying mechanisms of therapeutic effects. Women have a twice-higher prevalence of mood disorders but very little is known about sex differences in nutritional psychiatry. In this review, we aim to summarize current knowledge of the sex-specific effects of KD in mood disorders. Ketone bodies improve mitochondrial functions and suppress oxidative stress, inducing neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects which are both beneficial for mental health. Limited data also suggest KD-induced improvement of monoaminergic circuits and hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis-the key pathophysiological pathways of mood disorders. Gut microbiome is an important mediator of the beneficial and detrimental effects of diet on brain functioning and mental health. Gut microbiota composition is affected in mood disorders but its role in the therapeutic effects of different diets, including KD, remains poorly understood. Still little is known about sex differences in the effects of KD on mental health as well as on metabolism and body weight. Some animal studies used both sexes but did not find differences in behavior, body weight loss or gut microbiota composition. More studies, both on a preclinical and clinical level, are needed to better understand sex-specific effects of KD on mental health.","Journal of neural transmission (Vienna, Austria : 1996)",2023,Ilya V Smolensky; Kilian Zajac-Bakri; Peter Gass; Dragos Inta

37498481,The Role of Gut Microbiota in Blood-Brain Barrier Disruption after Stroke.,"Growing evidence has proved that alterations in the gut microbiota have been linked to neurological disorders including stroke. Structural and functional disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is observed after stroke. In this context, there is pioneering evidence supporting that gut microbiota may be involved in the pathogenesis of stroke by regulating the BBB function. However, only a few experimental studies have been performed on stroke models to observe the BBB by altering the structure of gut microbiota, which warrant further exploration. Therefore, in order to provide a novel mechanism for stroke and highlight new insights into BBB modification as a stroke intervention, this review summarizes existing evidence of the relationship between gut microbiota and BBB integrity and discusses the mechanisms of gut microbiota on BBB dysfunction and its role in stroke.",Molecular neurobiology,2023,Meiqin Zeng; Meichang Peng; Jianhao Liang; Haitao Sun

This study aims to elucidate the hypothesis that schizophrenia is associated with disturbances in intestinal microflora and imbalance in intestinal metabolites. By exploring the intricate relationship between the gut and the brain, with the goal of offering fresh perspectives and valuable insights into the potential contribution of intestinal microbial and metabolites dysbiosis to the etiology of schizophrenia.In this study, we used a 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene sequence-based approach and an untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolic profiling approach to measure the gut microbiome and microbial metabolites from 44 healthy controls, 41 acute patients, and 39 remission patients, to evaluate whether microbial dysbiosis and microbial metabolite biomarkers were linked with the severity of schizophrenic symptoms.Here, we identified 20 dominant disturbances in the gut microbial composition of patients compared with healthy controls, with 3 orders, 4 families, 9 genera, and 4 species. Several unique bacterial taxa associated with schizophrenia severity. Compared with healthy controls, 145 unusual microflora metabolites were detected in the acute and remission groups, which were mainly involved in environmental information processing, metabolism, organismal systems, and human diseases in the Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway.

Long-term methods such as exercise and low-fat diets can help regulate this health issue, but 93.3 million Americans continue to struggle. Our research investigates if lifestyle changes can affect urinary inflammation markers and psychological aspects through the modification of gut microbiome composition. <b>Methods:</b> Our study included 16 healthy controls with normal BMI as a comparison group and 22 overweight/obese (OW/OB) adolescents. We collected demographic, clinical, psychological, stool, and urine sample data at enrollment and six months after implementing lifestyle modifications. Bacterial genomic data and inflammatory markers in these samples were analyzed. <b>Results:</b> The lifestyle interventions were associated with decreased inflammation and enhanced mental health among overweight teens. We observed differences in bacterial community compositions between healthy participants and those who underwent treatment, including exercise and dietary habit adjustments, although there was no significant change in bacterial species richness. Mental health correlated with gut microbiota compositions without any demographic influences. The research also uncovered connections between inflammatory markers, psychological factors, and gut microbiota phyla through carbohydrate metabolism alterations. <b>Conclusion</b>: Our findings demonstrate that lifestyle modifications are associated with improved mental health and a reduction in inflammation in overweight adolescents by adjusting the gut microbiota composition.",Nutrients,2023,Md Saimul Islam; Shyanne Page-Hefley; Anne P Hernandez; Luke Whelchel; Chiquito Crasto; Whitney Viator; Treyce Money; Babafela Awosile; Noel Howard; Tetyana L Vasylyeva

37995075,Microbiota Alters and Its Correlation with Molecular Regulation Underlying Depression in PCOS Patients.,"Depression is one of the complications in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) that leads to considerable mental health. Accumulating evidence suggests that human gut microbiomes are associated with the progression of PCOS and depression. However, whether microbiota influences depression development in PCOS patients is still uncharacterized. In this study, we employed metagenomic sequencing and transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) to profile the composition of the fecal microbiota and gene expression of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in depressed women with PCOS (PCOS-DP, n = 27) in comparison to mentally healthy women with PCOS (PCOS, n = 18) and compared with healthy control (HC, n = 27) and patients with major depressive disorder (MDD, n = 29). Gut microbiota assessment revealed distinct patterns in the relative abundance in the PCOS-DP compared to HC, MDD, and PCOS groups. Several gut microbes exhibited uniquely and significantly higher abundance in the PCOS-DP compared to PCOS patients, inducing EC Ruminococcus torques, Coprococcus comes, Megasphaera elsdenii, Acidaminococcus intestini, and Barnesiella viscericola. Bacteroides eggerthii was a potential gut microbial biomarker for the PCOS-DP. RNA-seq profiling identified that 35 and 37 genes were significantly elevated and downregulated in the PCOS-DP, respectively. The enhanced differential expressed genes (DEGs) in the PCOS-DP were enriched in pathways involved in signal transduction and endocrine and metabolic diseases, whereas several lipid metabolism pathways were downregulated. Intriguingly, genes correlated with the gut microbiota were found to be significantly enriched in pathways of neurodegenerative diseases and the immune system, suggesting that changes in the microbiota may have a systemic impact on the expression of neurodegenerative diseases and immune genes. Gut microbe-related DEGs of CREB3L3 and CCDC173 were possible molecular biomarkers and therapeutic targets of women with PCOS-DP. Our multi-omics data indicate shifts in the gut microbiome and host gene regulation in PCOS patients with depression, which is of possible etiological and diagnostic importance.",Molecular neurobiology,2023,Liying Yu; Xiaoyu Chen; Xuefeng Bai; Jingping Fang; Ming Sui
36969812,"Demonstrating a link between diet, gut microbiota and brain: <sup>14</sup>C radioactivity identified in the brain following gut microbial fermentation of <sup>14</sup>C-radiolabeled tyrosine in a pig model.","There is a need to better understand the relationship between the diet, the gut microbiota and mental health. Metabolites produced when the human gut microbiota metabolize amino acids may enter the bloodstream and have systemic effects. We hypothesize that fermentation of amino acids by a resistant protein-primed gut microbiota could yield potentially toxic metabolites and disturb the availability of neurotransmitter precursors to the brain. However, these mechanisms are challenging to investigate <i>via</i> typical <i>in vitro</i> and clinical methods.We developed a novel workflow using <sup>14</sup>C radiolabeling to investigate complex nutrient-disease relationships. The first three steps of the workflow are reported here. α-Linolenic acid (ALA) was used as a model nutrient to confirm the efficacy of the workflow, and tyrosine (Tyr) was the test nutrient. <sup>14</sup>C-Tyr was administered to male weanling pigs fed a high resistant protein diet, which primed the gut microbiota for fermenting protein. The hypotheses were; (1) that expected biodistribution of <sup>14</sup>C-ALA would be observed, and (2) that radioactivity from <sup>14</sup>C-Tyr, representing Tyr and other amino acids released from resistant protein following gut microbial fermentation, would be bioavailable to the brain.Radioactivity from the <sup>14</sup>C-ALA was detected in tissues reflecting normal utilization of this essential fatty acid. Radioactivity from the <sup>14</sup>C-Tyr was detected in the brain (0.15% of original dose).Metabolites of gut-fermented protein and specifically amino acid precursors to neurotransmitters such as tyrosine, are potentially able to affect brain function. By extension, resistant proteins in the diet reaching the gut microbiota, also have potential to release metabolites that can potentially affect brain function. The high specificity of detection of <sup>14</sup>C radioactivity demonstrates that the proposed workflow can similarly be applied to understand other key diet and health paradigms.",Frontiers in nutrition,2023,Margaret Murray; Christopher K Barlow; Scott Blundell; Mark Buecking; Anne Gibbon; Bernd Goeckener; Lisa M Kaminskas; Patricia Leitner; Sophie Selby-Pham; Andrew Sinclair; Habtewold D Waktola; Gary Williamson; Louise E Bennett

37511699,Pharmacomicrobiomics of Antidepressants in Depression: A Systematic Review.,"This systematic review evaluated the animal and human evidence for pharmacomicrobiomics (PMx) interactions of antidepressant medications. Studies of gut microbiota effects on functional and behavioral effects of antidepressants in human and animal models were identified from PubMed up to December 2022. Risk of bias was assessed, and results are presented as a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines. A total of 28 (21 animal, 7 human) studies were included in the review. The reviewed papers converged on three themes: (1) Antidepressants can alter the composition and metabolites of gut microbiota, (2) gut microbiota can alter the bioavailability of certain antidepressants, and (3) gut microbiota may modulate the clinical or modeled mood modifying effects of antidepressants. The majority (n = 22) of studies had at least moderate levels of bias present. While strong evidence is still lacking to understand the clinical role of antidepressant PMx in human health, there is evidence for interactions among antidepressants, microbiota changes, microbiota metabolite changes, and behavior.

GI infections including that due to viral infection is known to cause postinfection disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI); hence, we wish to review the long-term GI consequences following COVID-19, particularly post-COVID-19 DGBI.At least 12 cohort studies, four of which also included controls documented the occurrence of post-COVID-19 DGBI, particularly IBS following COVID-19. The risk factors for post-COVID-19 DGBI included female gender, symptomatic COVID-19, particularly GI symptoms, the severity of COVID-19, the occurrence of anosmia and ageusia, use of antibiotics and hospitalization during the acute illness, persistent GI symptoms beyond 1 month after recovery, presence of mental health factors, The putative mechanisms for post-COVID-19 DGBI include altered gut motility, visceral hypersensitivity, gut microbiota dysbiosis, GI inflammation, and immune activation, changes in intestinal permeability, and alterations in the enteroendocrine system and serotonin metabolism.Long-term sequelae of SARS-CoV2 infection may persist even after recovery from COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 are more likely to develop post-COVID-19 IBS than healthy controls.

37804926,Possible role of tryptophan metabolism along the microbiota-gut-brain axis on cognitive & behavioral aspects in Phenylketonuria.,"Cognitive and psychiatric disorders are well documented across the lifetime of patients with inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs). Gut microbiota impacts behavior and cognitive functions through the gut-brain axis (GBA). According to recent research, a broad spectrum of GBA disorders may be influenced by a perturbed Tryptophan (Trp) metabolism and are associated with alterations in composition or function of the gut microbiota. Furthermore, early-life diets may influence children's neurodevelopment and cognitive deficits in adulthood. In Phenylketonuria (PKU), since the main therapeutic intervention is based on a life-long restrictive diet, important alterations of gut microbiota have been observed. Studies on PKU highlight the impact of alterations of gut microbiota on the central nervous system (CNS), also investigating the involvement of metabolic pathways, such as Trp and kynurenine (KYN) metabolisms, involved in numerous neurodegenerative disorders. An alteration of Trp metabolism with an imbalance of the KYN pathway towards the production of neurotoxic metabolites implicated in numerous neurodegenerative and inflammatory diseases has been observed in PKU patients supplemented with Phe-free amino acid medical foods (AA-MF). The present review investigates the possible link between gut microbiota and the brain in IEMs, focusing on Trp metabolism in PKU. Considering the evidence collected, cognitive and behavioral well-being should always be monitored in routine IEMs clinical management. Further studies are required to evaluate the possible impact of Trp metabolism, through gut microbiota, on cognitive and behavioral functions in IEMs, to identify innovative dietetic strategies and improve quality of life and mental health of these patients.",Pharmacological research,2023,Sara Parolisi; Chiara Montanari; Elisa Borghi; Chiara Cazzorla; Juri Zuvadelli; Martina Tosi; Rita Barone; Giulia Bensi; Cristina Bonfanti; Carlo Dionisi Vici; Giacomo Biasucci; Alberto Burlina; Maria T Carbone; Elvira Verduci; 
37391847,Alterations of gut microbiota are associated with blood pressure: a cross-sectional clinical trial in Northwestern China.,"The human gut microbiota (GM) is involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension (HTN), and could be affected by various factors, including sex and geography. However, available data directly linking GM to HTN based on sex differences are limited.This study investigated the GM characteristics in HTN subjects in Northwestern China, and evaluate the associations of GM with blood pressure levels based on sex differences. A total of 87 HTN subjects and 45 controls were recruited with demographic and clinical characteristics documented. Fecal samples were collected for 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metagenomic sequencing.GM diversity was observed higher in females compared to males, and principal coordinate analysis showed an obvious segregation of females and males. Four predominant phyla of fecal GM included Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. LEfSe analysis indicated that phylum unidentified_Bacteria was enriched in HTN females, while Leuconostocaceae, Weissella and Weissella_cibaria were enriched in control females (P < 0.05). Functionally, ROC analysis revealed that Cellular Processes (0.796, 95% CI 0.620 ~ 0.916), Human Diseases (0.773, 95% CI 0.595 ~ 0.900), Signal transduction (0.806, 95% CI 0.631 ~ 0.922) and Two-component system (0.806, 95% CI 0.631 ~ 0.922) could differentiate HTN females as effective functional classifiers, which were also positively correlated with systolic blood pressure levels.This work provides evidence of fecal GM characteristics in HTN females and males in a northwestern Chinese population, further supporting the notion that GM dysbiosis may participate in the pathogenesis of HTN, and the role of sex differences should be considered.

37881577,Repeated Social Defeat Stress Induces an Inflammatory Gut Milieu by Altering the Mucosal Barrier Integrity and Gut Microbiota Homeostasis.,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition triggered by exposure to traumatic events in an individual's life. Patients with PTSD are also at a higher risk for comorbidities. However, it is not well understood how PTSD affects human health and/or promotes the risk for comorbidities. Nevertheless, patients with PTSD harbor a proinflammatory milieu and dysbiotic gut microbiota. Gut barrier integrity helps to maintain normal gut homeostasis and its dysregulation promotes gut dysbiosis and inflammation.We used a mouse model of repeated social defeat stress (RSDS), a preclinical model of PTSD. Behavioral studies, metagenomics analysis of the microbiome, gut permeability assay (on mouse colon, using an Ussing chamber), immunoblotting, and immunohistochemical analyses were performed. Polarized intestinal epithelial cells and 3-dimensional crypt cultures were used for mechanistic analysis.The RSDS mice harbor a heightened proinflammatory gut environment and microbiota dysbiosis. The RSDS mice further showed significant dysregulation of gut barrier functions, including transepithelial electrical resistance, mucin homeostasis, and antimicrobial responses. RSDS mice also showed a specific increase in intestinal expression of claudin-2, a tight junction protein, and epinephrine, a stress-induced neurotransmitter. Treating intestinal epithelial cells or 3-dimensional cultured crypts with norepinephrine or intestinal luminal contents (fecal contents) upregulated claudin-2 expression and inhibited transepithelial electrical resistance.Traumatic stress induces dysregulation of gut barrier functions, which may underlie the observed gut microbiota changes and proinflammatory gut milieu, all of which may have an interdependent effect on the health and increased risk of comorbidities in patients with PTSD.",Biological psychiatry global open science,2023,Santosh K Yadav; Rizwan Ahmad; Cassandra M Moshfegh; Jagadesan Sankarasubramanian; Vineet Joshi; Safwan K Elkhatib; Yashpal Singh Chhonker; Daryl J Murry; Geoffrey A Talmon; Chittibabu Guda; Adam J Case; Amar B Singh
37371676,Using the Microbiome as a Regenerative Medicine Strategy for Autoimmune Diseases.,"Autoimmune (AI) diseases, which present in a multitude of systemic manifestations, have been connected to many underlying factors. These factors include the environment, genetics, individual microbiomes, and diet. An individual's gut microbiota is an integral aspect of human functioning, as it is intimately integrated into the metabolic, mechanical, immunological, and neurologic pathways of the body. The microbiota dynamically changes throughout our lifetimes and is individually unique. While the gut microbiome is ever-adaptive, gut dysbiosis can exert a significant influence on physical and mental health. Gut dysbiosis is a common factor in various AI, and diets with elevated fat and sugar content have been linked to gut microbiome alterations, contributing to increased systemic inflammation. Additionally, multiple AI's have increased levels of certain inflammatory markers such as TNF-a, IL-6, and IL-17 that have been shown to contribute to arthropathy and are also linked to increased levels of gut dysbiosis. While chronic inflammation has been shown to affect many physiologic systems, this review explores the connection between gut microbiota, bone metabolism, and the skeletal and joint destruction associated with various AI, including psoriatic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, irritable bowel disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. This review aims to define the mechanisms of microbiome crosstalk between the cells of bone and cartilage, as well as to investigate the potential bidirectional connections between AI, bony and cartilaginous tissue, and the gut microbiome. By doing this, the review also introduces the concept of altering an individual's specific gut microbiota as a form of regenerative medicine and potential tailored therapy for joint destruction seen in AI. We hope to show multiple, specific ways to target the microbiome through diet changes, rebalancing microbial diversity, or decreasing specific microbes associated with increased gut permeability, leading to reduced systemic inflammation contributing to joint pathology. Additionally, we plan to show that diet alterations can promote beneficial changes in the gut microbiota, supporting the body's own endogenous processes to decrease inflammation and increase healing. This concept of microbial alteration falls under the definition of regenerative medicine and should be included accordingly. By implementing microbial alterations in regenerative medicine, this current study could lend increasing support to the current research on the associations of the gut microbiota, bone metabolism, and AI-related musculoskeletal pathology.",Biomedicines,2023,Kaitlin L Williams; Ryan Enslow; Shreyas Suresh; Camille Beaton; Mitchell Hodge; Amanda E Brooks

36910501,Efficacy of acupuncture in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease and its impact on gut microbiota: Study protocol for a randomized sham-controlled trial.,"Acupuncture is used as an adjuvant therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but available evidence for efficacy is limited so far. Growing studies suggest that resident gut microbiota contributes to the development and progression of AD. Meanwhile, acupuncture is reported to treat gastrointestinal and neurodegenerative disorders <i>via</i> the gut-brain axis. Therefore, our aim is to confirm the adjunctive therapeutic effects of acupuncture for AD, and explore the relationship between clinical efficacy and shifts of gut microbiota.This is a randomized, participant-masked, sham-controlled trial. One hundred and sixty participants with mild AD will be randomly assigned (1:1) to either active acupuncture or non-penetrating sham acupuncture (three times weekly for 14 weeks) added to donepezil treatment (5 mg per day for 28 weeks). The primary efficacy outcome is the change from baseline to week 28 in the Alzheimer's disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog12). Secondary efficacy outcomes include other assessments of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Alzheimer's disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL), and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Gut microbiota will be measured using 16S rRNA tag sequencing.This rigorous trial will provide high-quality evidence on the efficacy of acupuncture as adjunctive treatment for mild AD, and identify the possible mechanisms of acupuncture from gut microbiota.[https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05078944], ClinicalTrials.gov [NCT05078944].

37709081,Maternal exposure of mice to glyphosate induces depression- and anxiety-like behavior in the offspring via alterations of the gut-brain axis.,"The past decade has been characterized by increased awareness and de-stigmatization of mental health issues, in particular the most common neuropsychiatric disorders depression and anxiety. Further, with growing understanding of neurodevelopmental disorders such as attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder, the number of diagnosed patients has increased. The pathogenesis of these behavioral disorders is multifactorial and early-life exposure to environmental chemicals has been proposed to be a relevant risk factor that might mediate these effects by disturbances on the gut-brain-axis. However, for glyphosate, the most widely used pesticide worldwide, there are only limited and inconsistent findings that link chronic low-dose exposure in particular during early life to neurobehavioral disorders. Here, we explored the impact of maternal oral glyphosate exposure (0.5 and 50 mg/kg body weight/day) during pregnancy and the lactational period on offspring's behavior, brain gene expression and gut microbiota using a cross-generational mouse model. Behavioral analyses revealed a depression- and anxiety-like behavior as well as social deficits most notably in adult female offspring of glyphosate-exposed dams. Furthermore, the expression of tryptophan hydroxylase 2, an enzyme discussed to be linked to behavioral problems, was reduced in the hippocampus of female offspring and correlated to a glyphosate-induced DNA hypermethylation of the gene. Moreover, maternal glyphosate exposure significantly altered the gut microbiota in the female offspring including a decreased abundance of Akkermansia and increased abundance of Alistipes and Blautia, bacteria involved in tryptophan metabolism and associated with depression- and anxiety-like disorders. Our results suggest that glyphosate might influence the gut-brain axis crosstalk following in-utero and lactational exposure. This study underlines the importance of understanding the impact of exposure to pesticides on the gut-brain axis and further emphasizes the need for microbiome analyses to be compulsorily included in health risk assessments of pesticides.",The Science of the total environment,2023,Lisa Buchenauer; Sven-Bastiaan Haange; Mario Bauer; Ulrike E Rolle-Kampczyk; Marita Wagner; Johanna Stucke; Elena Elter; Beate Fink; Maren Vass; Martin von Bergen; Angela Schulz; Ana C Zenclussen; Kristin M Junge; Gabriele I Stangl; Tobias Polte

37836654,Protective Application of Chinese Herbal Compounds and Formulae in Intestinal Inflammation in Humans and Animals.,"Intestinal inflammation is a chronic gastrointestinal disorder with uncertain pathophysiology and causation that has significantly impacted both the physical and mental health of both people and animals. An increasing body of research has demonstrated the critical role of cellular signaling pathways in initiating and managing intestinal inflammation. This review focuses on the interactions of three cellular signaling pathways (TLR4/NF-κB, PI3K-AKT, MAPKs) with immunity and gut microbiota to explain the possible pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation. Traditional medicinal drugs frequently have drawbacks and negative side effects. This paper also summarizes the pharmacological mechanism and application of Chinese herbal compounds (Berberine, Sanguinarine, Astragalus polysaccharide, Curcumin, and Cannabinoids) and formulae (Wumei Wan, Gegen-Qinlian decoction, Banxia xiexin decoction) against intestinal inflammation. We show that the herbal compounds and formulae may influence the interactions among cell signaling pathways, immune function, and gut microbiota in humans and animals, exerting their immunomodulatory capacity and anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects. This demonstrates their strong potential to improve gut inflammation. We aim to promote herbal medicine and apply it to multispecies animals to achieve better health.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,Yang Yang; Gang Xiao; Pi Cheng; Jianguo Zeng; Yisong Liu
37199590,Healthy Human Fecal Microbiota Transplantation into Mice Attenuates MPTP-Induced Neurotoxicity via AMPK/SOD2 Pathway.,"Increasing evidence has shown that gut dysbacteriosis may play a crucial role in neuroinflammation in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the specific mechanisms that link gut microbiota to PD remain unexplored. Given the critical roles of blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction and mitochondrial dysfunction in the development of PD, we aimed to evaluate the interactions among the gut microbiota, BBB, and mitochondrial resistance to oxidation and inflammation in PD. We investigated the effects of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) on the physiopathology of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated mice. The aim was to explore the role of fecal microbiota from PD patients and healthy human controls in neuroinflammation, BBB components, and mitochondrial antioxidative capacity via the AMPK/SOD2 pathway. Compared to control mice, MPTP-treated mice exhibited elevated levels of Desulfovibrio, whereas mice given FMT from PD patients exhibited enriched levels of Akkermansia and mice given FMT from healthy humans showed no significant alterations in gut microbiota. Strikingly, FMT from PD patients to MPTP-treated mice significantly aggravated motor impairments, dopaminergic neurodegeneration, nigrostriatal glial activation and colonic inflammation, and inhibited the AMPK/SOD2 signaling pathway. However, FMT from healthy human controls greatly improved the aforementioned MPTP-caused effects. Surprisingly, the MPTP-treated mice displayed a significant loss in nigrostriatal pericytes, which was restored by FMT from healthy human controls. Our findings demonstrate that FMT from healthy human controls can correct gut dysbacteriosis and ameliorate neurodegeneration in the MPTP-induced PD mouse model by suppressing microgliosis and astrogliosis, ameliorating mitochondrial impairments via the AMPK/SOD2 pathway, and restoring the loss of nigrostriatal pericytes and BBB integrity. These findings raise the possibility that the alteration in the human gut microbiota may be a risk factor for PD and provide evidence for potential application of FMT in PD preclinical treatment.",Aging and disease,2023,Zhenchao Xie; Mahui Zhang; Yuqi Luo; Dana Jin; Xingfang Guo; Wanlin Yang; Jialing Zheng; Hongfei Zhang; Lu Zhang; Chao Deng; Wenhua Zheng; Eng-King Tan; Kunlin Jin; Shuzhen Zhu; Qing Wang

Similarly, probiotics supplementation improved the gut microbiota and reduced the duration of crying, abdominal distension, abdominal colic and diarrhoea.Non-invasive probiotic therapies are more useful to pregnant and lactating women and newborns.The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022372126).",Journal of global health,2023,Kurvatteppa Halemani; Asha P Shetty; Latha Thimmappa; Alwin Issac; Sanjay Dhiraaj; K Radha; Prabhaker Mishra; Edlin Glane Mathias
37927130,<i>Lactobacillus reuteri</i> ATG-F4 Alleviates Chronic Stress-induced Anhedonia by Modulating the Prefrontal Serotonergic System.,"Mental health is influenced by the gut-brain axis; for example, gut dysbiosis has been observed in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Gut microbial changes by fecal microbiota transplantation or probiotics treatment reportedly modulates depressive symptoms. However, it remains unclear how gut dysbiosis contributes to mental dysfunction, and how correction of the gut microbiota alleviates neuropsychiatric disorders. Our previous study showed that chronic consumption of <i>Lactobacillus reuteri</i> ATG-F4 (F4) induced neurometabolic alterations in healthy mice. Here, we investigated whether F4 exerted therapeutic effects on depressive-like behavior by influencing the central nervous system. Using chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) to induce anhedonia, a key symptom of MDD, we found that chronic F4 consumption alleviated CUS-induced anhedonic behaviors, accompanied by biochemical changes in the gut, serum, and brain. Serum and brain metabolite concentrations involved in tryptophan metabolism were regulated by CUS and F4. F4 consumption reduced the elevated levels of serotonin (5-HT) in the brain observed in the CUS group. Additionally, the increased expression of <i>Htr1a</i>, a subtype of the 5-HT receptor, in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of stressed mice was restored to levels observed in stress-naïve mice following F4 supplementation. We further demonstrated the role of <i>Htr1a</i> using AAV-shRNA to downregulate <i>Htr1a</i> in the mPFC of CUS mice, effectively reversing CUS-induced anhedonic behavior. Together, our findings suggest F4 as a potential therapeutic approach for relieving some depressive symptoms and highlight the involvement of the tryptophan metabolism in mitigating CUS-induced depressive-like behaviors through the action of this bacterium.",Experimental neurobiology,2023,Jiyun Lee; Eum-Ji Kim; Gun-Seok Park; Jeongseop Kim; Tae-Eun Kim; Yoo Jin Lee; Juyi Park; Jihee Kang; Ja Wook Koo; Tae-Yong Choi
37232729,The Effect of Probiotic Supplementation on the Gut-Brain Axis in Psychiatric Patients.,"The pathophysiology of several psychiatric diseases may entail disturbances in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and metabolic pathways. Variations in how these effects present themselves may be connected to individual variances in clinical symptoms and treatment responses, such as the observation that a significant fraction of participants do not respond to current antipsychotic drugs. A bidirectional signaling pathway between the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract is known as the microbiota-gut-brain axis. The large and small intestines contain more than 100 trillion microbial cells, contributing to the intestinal ecosystem's incredible complexity. Interactions between the microbiota and intestinal epithelium can alter brain physiology and affect mood and behavior. There has recently been a focus on how these relationships impact mental health. According to evidence, intestinal microbiota may play a role in neurological and mental illnesses. Intestinal metabolites of microbial origin, such as short-chain fatty acids, tryptophan metabolites, and bacterial components that might stimulate the host's immune system, are mentioned in this review. We aim to shed some on the growing role of gut microbiota in inducing/manipulating several psychiatric disorders, which may pave the way for novel microbiota-based therapies.",Current issues in molecular biology,2023,Hussein Sabit; Areej Kassab; Donia Alaa; Shaza Mohamed; Shaimaa Abdel-Ghany; Mohamed Mansy; Osama A Said; Mona A Khalifa; Halah Hafiz; Asmaa M Abushady
37228982,Gut-brain axis: altered microbiome and depression - review.,"The concept of a 'gut-brain axis' was recently developed when the complex communications between the brain and the gut became evident. The interaction may affect emotions, motivation, mood, and higher cognitive functions as well as gut homeostasis. Human microbe symbiosis's merits are now acknowledged to transcend human mental health. Research has recently indicated that the gut-brain axis plays a vital role in brain health maintenance. The term 'gut-brain axis' can only partially capture the intricacy of these interactions. Dysbiosis of the gut commensals has been seen in patients with psychiatric diseases, such as depression. Major depressive disorder is caused by complicated interactions between the individual gene and the environment. In a forced swimming test, P.

38068763,Analysis of the Efficacy of Diet and Short-Term Probiotic Intervention on Depressive Symptoms in Patients after Bariatric Surgery: A Randomized Double-Blind Placebo Controlled Pilot Study.,"(1) Background: studies have shown that some patients experience mental deterioration after bariatric surgery. (2) Methods: We examined whether the use of probiotics and improved eating habits can improve the mental health of people who suffered from mood disorders after bariatric surgery. We also analyzed patients' mental states, eating habits and microbiota. (3) Results: Depressive symptoms were observed in 45% of 200 bariatric patients. After 5 weeks, we noted an improvement in patients' mental functioning (reduction in BDI and HRSD), but it was not related to the probiotic used. The consumption of vegetables and whole grain cereals increased (DQI-I adequacy), the consumption of simple sugars and SFA decreased (moderation DQI-I), and the consumption of monounsaturated fatty acids increased it. In the feces of patients after RYGB, there was a significantly higher abundance of two members of the Muribaculaceae family, namely Veillonella and Roseburia, while those after SG had more Christensenellaceae R-7 group, Subdoligranulum, Oscillibacter, and UCG-005. (4) Conclusions: the noted differences in the composition of the gut microbiota (RYGB vs. SG) may be one of the determinants of the proper functioning of the gut-brain microbiota axis, although there is currently a need for further research into this topic using a larger group of patients and different probiotic doses.",Nutrients,2023,Natalia Komorniak; Mariusz Kaczmarczyk; Igor Łoniewski; Alexandra Martynova-Van Kley; Armen Nalian; Michał Wroński; Krzysztof Kaseja; Bartosz Kowalewski; Marcin Folwarski; Ewa Stachowska
37095530,"Positive mood-related gut microbiota in a long-term closed environment: a multiomics study based on the ""Lunar Palace 365"" experiment.","Psychological health risk is one of the most severe and complex risks in manned deep-space exploration and long-term closed environments. Recently, with the in-depth research of the microbiota-gut-brain axis, gut microbiota has been considered a new approach to maintain and improve psychological health. However, the correlation between gut microbiota and psychological changes inside long-term closed environments is still poorly understood. Herein, we used the ""Lunar Palace 365"" mission, a 1-year-long isolation study in the Lunar Palace 1 (a closed manned Bioregenerative Life Support System facility with excellent performance), to investigate the correlation between gut microbiota and psychological changes, in order to find some new potential psychobiotics to maintain and improve the psychological health of crew members.We report some altered gut microbiota that were associated with psychological changes in the long-term closed environment. Four potential psychobiotics (Bacteroides uniformis, Roseburia inulinivorans, Eubacterium rectale, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii) were identified. On the basis of metagenomic, metaproteomic, and metabolomic analyses, the four potential psychobiotics improved mood mainly through three pathways related to nervous system functions: first, by fermenting dietary fibers, they may produce short-chain fatty acids, such as butyric and propionic acids; second, they may regulate amino acid metabolism pathways of aspartic acid, glutamic acid, tryptophan, etc. (e.g., converting glutamic acid to gamma-aminobutyric acid; converting tryptophan to serotonin, kynurenic acid, or tryptamine); and third, they may regulate other pathways, such as taurine and cortisol metabolism. Furthermore, the results of animal experiments confirmed the positive regulatory effect and mechanism of these potential psychobiotics on mood.These observations reveal that gut microbiota contributed to a robust effect on the maintenance and improvement of mental health in a long-term closed environment. Our findings represent a key step towards a better understanding the role of the gut microbiome in mammalian mental health during space flight and provide a basis for future efforts to develop microbiota-based countermeasures that mitigate risks to crew mental health during future long-term human space expeditions on the moon or Mars. This study also provides an essential reference for future applications of psychobiotics to neuropsychiatric treatments.

38007616,Fiber intake and fiber intervention in depression and anxiety: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies and randomized controlled trials.,"Dietary fibers hold potential to influence depressive and anxiety outcomes by modulating the microbiota-gut-brain axis, which is increasingly recognized as an underlying factor in mental health maintenance.Evidence for the effects of fibers on depressive and anxiety outcomes remains unclear. To this end, a systematic literature review and a meta-analysis were conducted that included observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs).The PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and PsychINFO databases were searched for eligible studies.Study screening and risk-of-bias assessment were conducted by 2 independent reviewers.Meta-analyses via random effects models were performed to examine the (1) association between fiber intake and depressive and anxiety outcomes in observational studies, and (2) effect of fiber intervention on depressive and anxiety outcomes compared with placebo in RCTs. A total of 181 405 participants were included in 23 observational studies. In cross-sectional studies, an inverse association was observed between fiber intake and depressive (Cohen's d effect size [d]: -0.11; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.16, -0.05) and anxiety (d = -0.25; 95%CI, -0.38, -0.12) outcomes. In longitudinal studies, there was an inverse association between fiber intake and depressive outcomes (d = -0.07; 95%CI, -0.11, -0.04). In total, 740 participants were included in 10 RCTs, all of whom used fiber supplements. Of note, only 1 RCT included individuals with a clinical diagnosis of depression. No difference was found between fiber supplementation and placebo for depressive (d = -0.47; 95%CI, -1.26, 0.31) or anxiety (d = -0.30; 95%CI, -0.67, 0.07) outcomes.Although observational data suggest a potential benefit for higher fiber intake for depressive and anxiety outcomes, evidence from current RCTs does not support fiber supplementation for improving depressive or anxiety outcomes. More research, including RCTs in clinical populations and using a broad range of fibers, is needed.PROSPERO registration no.

37485386,Prebiotics for depression: how does the gut microbiota play a role?,"Depression, a mood disorder characterized by persistent feelings of sadness and aversion to activity that can interfere with daily life, is a condition of great concern. Prebiotics, which are non-digestible substances selectively utilized by host microorganisms for health benefits, have gained attention for their potential to improve overall wellness and alleviate various disorders including depression. This study aims to review clinical trials utilizing carbohydrate-type prebiotics such as inulin-type fructans, galactooligosaccharides (GOS), human milk oligosaccharides, resistant starch, prebiotic phytochemicals including epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), chlorogenic acids, resveratrol, and prebiotic lipids (n-3 polysaturated fatty acids) to determine their effects on depression. Our findings suggest that GOS at a daily dosage of 5 g and eicosapentaenoic acid at or less than 1 g can effectively mitigate depressive symptoms. While EGCG exhibits potential antidepressant properties, a higher dosage of 3 g/d may be necessary to elicit significant effects. The plausible mechanisms underlying the impact of prebiotics on depression include the synthesis of neurotransmitters, production of short-chain fatty acids, and regulation of inflammation.",Frontiers in nutrition,2023,Yongde Yang; Bi Zhou; Sheng Zhang; Liang Si; Xiaobo Liu; Fu Li

Data analysis was performed using Review Manager (5.4.1) and R.Chao1 and Shannon index levels in AD were significantly lower compared with healthy controls (HCs), and the Chao1 index was significantly lower in MCI compared with HCs. There was a significant difference in β diversity of gut microbiomes in patients (SCD, MCI, AD) compared with HCs. The relative abundance of Firmicutes at the phylum level was significantly lower in patients with AD and MCI than HCs. However, the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes at the phylum level was significantly higher in patients with MCI than HCs. There was an increasing trend for Enterobacteriaceae and a decreasing trend for Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae and Lactobacillus during AD; Lactobacillus showed a decreasing trend early in SCD.Our results indicated that there were gut microbiological abnormalities in AD, even as early as the SCD stage.

37071196,Development of the gut microbiota in the first 14 years of life and its relations to internalizing and externalizing difficulties and social anxiety during puberty.,"Relations between the gut microbiota and host mental health have been suggested by a growing number of case-control and cross-sectional studies, while supporting evidence is limited in large community samples followed during an extended period. Therefore, the current preregistered study ( https://osf.io/8ymav , September 7, 2022) described child gut microbiota development in the first 14 years of life and explored its relations to internalizing and externalizing difficulties and social anxiety in puberty, a period of high relevance for the development of mental health problems. Fecal microbiota composition was analysed by 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing in a total of 1003 samples from 193 children. Through a clustering method, four distinct microbial clusters were newly identified in puberty. Most children within three of these clusters remained in the same clusters from the age of 12 to 14 years, suggesting stability in microbial development and transition during this period. These three clusters were compositionally similar to enterotypes (i.e., a robust classification of the gut microbiota based on its composition across different populations) enriched in Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Ruminococcus, respectively. Two Prevotella 9-predominated clusters, including one reported by us earlier in middle childhood and the other one in puberty, were associated with more externalizing behavior at age 14. One Faecalibacterium-depleted pubertal cluster was related to more social anxiety at age 14. This finding was confirmed by a negative cross-sectional relation between Faecalibacterium and social anxiety in the 14-year-olds. The findings of this study continue to map gut microbiota development in a relatively large community sample followed from birth onwards, importantly extending our knowledge to puberty. Results indicate that Prevotella 9 and Faecalibacterium may be relevant microbial taxa in relation to externalizing behavior and social anxiety, respectively.

37343494,Gut microbes influence the development of central nervous system disorders through epigenetic inheritance.,"Central nervous system (CNS) disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and Alzheimer's disease (AD), affect quality of life of patients and pose significant economic and social burdens worldwide. Due to their obscure and complex pathogeneses, current therapies for these diseases have limited efficacy. Over the past decade, the gut microbiome has been shown to exhibit direct and indirect influences on the structure and function of the CNS, affecting multiple pathological pathways. In addition to the direct interactions between the gut microbiota and CNS, the gut microbiota and their metabolites can regulate epigenetic processes, including DNA methylation, histone modification, and regulation of non-coding RNAs. In this review, we discuss the tripartite relationship among gut microbiota, epigenetic inheritance, and CNS disorders. We suggest that gut microbes and their metabolites influence the pathogenesis of CNS disorders at the epigenetic level, which may inform the development of effective therapeutic strategies for CNS disorders.",Microbiological research,2023,Tianyou Liu; Dongru Du; Rui Zhao; Qinglian Xie; Zaiquan Dong

Komagataella pastoris KM71H is a yeast with probiotic properties and antidepressant-like effects in animal models of depression. Hence, we evaluated the antidepressant-like effects of K. pastoris KM71H in a model of antibiotic-induced intestinal dysbiosis in male Swiss mice. The mice received clindamycin (200 μg, intraperitoneal) and, after 24 h, were treated with K. pastoris KM71H at a dose of 8 log CFU/animal by intragastric administration (ig) or PBS (vehicle, ig) for 14 consecutive days. Afterward, the animals were subjected to behavioral tests and biochemical analyses. Our results showed that K. pastoris KM71H administration decreased the immobility time in the tail suspension test and increased grooming activity duration in the splash test in antibiotic-treated mice, thereby characterizing its antidepressant-like effect. We observed that these effects of K. pastoris KM71H were accompanied by the modulation of the intestinal microbiota, preservation of intestinal barrier integrity, and restoration of the mRNA levels of occludin, zonula occludens-1, zonula occludens-2, and toll-like receptor-4 in the small intestine, and interleukin-1β in the hippocampi of mice. Our findings provide solid evidence to support the development of K. pastoris KM71H as a new probiotic with antidepressant-like effects.",Molecular neurobiology,2023,Paloma T Birmann; Angela M Casaril; Ana Paula Pesarico; Rafael R Rodrigues; Fabricio R Conceição; Fernanda Severo Sabedra Sousa; Tiago Collares; Fabiana K Seixas; Lucielli Savegnago

In this study, we explored the association between gut microbiota and cognitive function in MDD and its possible mechanisms.We enrolled 57 patients with MDD and 30 healthy controls (HCs) and used 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis and shotgun metagenomic sequencing analysis to determine gut microbial composition.The richness and diversity of gut microbiota in patients with MDD were the same as those in HCs, but there were differences in the abundance of Bifidobacterium and Blautia. Compared with HCs, two strains (bin_32 and bin_55) were significantly increased, and one strain (bin_31) was significantly decreased in patients with MDD based on the strain-level meta-analysis.

Bin_55 had significant negative correlations with time to complete the Stroop-C, time to complete the Stroop-CW, and repeated animal words in 60 s but significant positive correlations with correct answers in 120 s on the Stroop-CW.This study only tested the cognitive function of MDD in a small sample, which may have caused some bias.Based on our strain-level analysis, we found that gut microbiota may be associated with the pathogenesis of MDD and may have potential effects on cognitive function.",Journal of affective disorders,2023,Zaiquan Dong; Qinglian Xie; Yanling Yuan; Xiaoling Shen; Yanni Hao; Jin Li; Haizhen Xu; Weihong Kuang
36804416,A snapshot of gut microbiota data from murine models of Autism Spectrum Disorder: Still a blurred picture.,"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in social communication and interaction and repetitive/stereotyped behaviors. In recent years, the role of microbiota-gut-brain axis in ASD pathogenesis received growing attention, appearing as an attractive therapeutic target. We provide a comprehensive overview of changes in microbiota composition in ASD murine models so far identified, and summarize the therapeutic approaches targeting the microbiota on ASD-like neurobehavioral profile. Although alterations in microbiota composition have been observed in both genetic and environmental murine models of ASD, a clear microbiota profile shared by different ASD murine models has not been identified. We documented substantial discrepancies among studies (often within the same model), likely due to several confounding factors (from sex and age of animals to housing conditions). Despite these limitations, ASD animal models (under standardized conditions) remain a useful tool to evaluate (i) the beneficial effects of manipulations of gut microbiota on behavioral abnormalities; (ii) underlying neurobiological mechanisms related to gut-brain axis; and (iii) to identify optimal time windows for therapeutic interventions.",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,2023,A M Tartaglione; V Pazienza; G Calamandrei; L Ricceri
36502554,Antibiotic use and the development of depression: A systematic review.,"Increasingly, disruption of the gastrointestinal ecosystem is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of several medical conditions, including depression. Antibiotics can induce substantial changes in the gastrointestinal microbiota and several lines of evidence suggest that antibiotics exposure may increase the risk of developing depression. This systematic review examined this potential association.PubMed, Ovid EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsychINFO databases, as well as unpublished resources, were searched for studies in humans published from 2000 onwards. The studies needed to consider the connection between antibiotic exposure (either alone or in combination with other antibiotics and medications) and the development of depressive symptoms and/or disorders (in isolation to other psychological conditions).Nine studies met the eligibility criteria. All were observational in nature. The studies were conducted in different age groups with various indications for receiving antibiotics. Together, these relatively low-quality studies suggest a potential association between antibiotic exposure and subsequent development of depression symptoms. Specifically, studies from the United Kingdom and Sweden indicate that the risk of depression is increased by at least 20%, with the former (over 1 million participants) reporting an increased risk with the number of courses and agents used, that persists with a slow decline over the ten years following exposure.The inherent limitations associated with the studies' methodologies make a reliable conclusion difficult. While the risk of antimicrobial resistance may prohibit large randomised clinical trials in healthy individuals, future placebo-controlled trials with antibiotics-based protocols (e.g. for acne) should explore their effect on mental health.",Journal of psychosomatic research,2023,Mahsa Pouranayatihosseinabad; Yihienew Bezabih; Jason Hawrelak; Gregory M Peterson; Felicity Veal; Corinne Mirkazemi

37569349,Microbial Reprogramming in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorders: A Review of Gut-Brain Communication and Emerging Evidence.,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a debilitating mental health disorder characterized by intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors (compulsions). Dysbiosis, an imbalance in the gut microbial composition, has been associated with various health conditions, including mental health disorders, autism, and inflammatory diseases. While the exact mechanisms underlying OCD remain unclear, this review presents a growing body of evidence suggesting a potential link between dysbiosis and the multifaceted etiology of OCD, interacting with genetic, neurobiological, immunological, and environmental factors. This review highlights the emerging evidence implicating the gut microbiota in the pathophysiology of OCD and its potential as a target for novel therapeutic approaches. We propose a model that positions dysbiosis as the central unifying element in the neurochemical, immunological, genetic, and environmental factors leading to OCD. The potential and challenges of microbial reprogramming strategies, such as probiotics and fecal transplants in OCD therapeutics, are discussed. This review raises awareness of the importance of adopting a holistic approach that considers the interplay between the gut and the brain to develop interventions that account for the multifaceted nature of OCD and contribute to the advancement of more personalized approaches.",International journal of molecular sciences,2023,Ghizlane Bendriss; Ross MacDonald; Clare McVeigh

38003647,Unveiling the Connection between Microbiota and Depressive Disorder through Machine Learning.,"In the last few years, investigation of the gut-brain axis and the connection between the gut microbiota and the human nervous system and mental health has become one of the most popular topics. Correlations between the taxonomic and functional changes in gut microbiota and major depressive disorder have been shown in several studies. Machine learning provides a promising approach to analyze large-scale metagenomic data and identify biomarkers associated with depression. In this work, machine learning algorithms, such as random forest, elastic net, and You Only Look Once (YOLO), were utilized to detect significant features in microbiome samples and classify individuals based on their disorder status. The analysis was conducted on metagenomic data obtained during the study of gut microbiota of healthy people and patients with major depressive disorder. The YOLO method showed the greatest effectiveness in the analysis of the metagenomic samples and confirmed the experimental results on the critical importance of a reduction in the amount of <i>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</i> for the manifestation of depression. These findings could contribute to a better understanding of the role of the gut microbiota in major depressive disorder and potentially lead the way for novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",International journal of molecular sciences,2023,Irina Y Angelova; Alexey S Kovtun; Olga V Averina; Tatiana A Koshenko; Valery N Danilenko
37304433,Altered gut microbiota profile in patients with perimenopausal panic disorder.,"Females in the perimenopausal period are susceptible to mood disorders. Perimenopausal panic disorder (PPD) is characterized by repeated and unpredictable panic attacks during perimenopause, and it impacts the patient's physical and mental health and social function. Pharmacotherapy is limited in the clinic, and its pathological mechanism is unclear. Recent studies have demonstrated that gut microbiota is strongly linked to emotion; however, the relation between PPD and microbiota is limitedly known.This study aimed to discover specific microbiota in PPD patients and the intrinsic connection between them. Gut microbiota was analyzed in PPD patients (<i>n</i> = 40) and healthy controls (<i>n</i> = 40) by 16S rRNA sequencing.The results showed reduced α-diversity (richness) in the gut microbiota of PPD patients. β-diversity indicated that PPD and healthy controls had different intestinal microbiota compositions. At the genus level, 30 species of microbiota abundance had significantly different between the PPD and healthy controls. In addition, HAMA, PDSS, and PASS scales were collected in two groups. It was found that Bacteroides and Alistipes were positively correlated with PASS, PDSS, and HAMA.Bacteroides and Alistipes dysbiosis dominate imbalanced microbiota in PPD patients. This microbial alteration may be a potential pathogenesis and physio-pathological feature of PPD. The distinct gut microbiota can be a potential diagnostic marker and a new therapeutic target for PPD.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2023,Shen Lin; Hongjin Wang; Jingjing Qiu; Minghong Li; Ebin Gao; Xiaofeng Wu; Yunxiang Xu; Guizhen Chen
37879416,Depression-like phenotypes in mice with hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury: A role of gut-microbiota-liver-brain axis via vagus nerve.,"Depression is a frequent symptom in patients with chronic liver disease; however, the mechanisms underlying this association remain unclear. Dysbiosis of gut microbiota plays a critical role in depression through the gut-brain axis via the vagus nerve. In this study, we investigated whether the gut-microbiota-liver-brain axis plays a role in depression-like phenotypes in mice with hepatic ischemia/reperfusion (HI/R) injury via the vagus nerve. Behavioral tests for depression-like behaviors were performed 7 days after sham or HI/R injury surgery. Mice with HI/R injury exhibited splenomegaly, systemic inflammation, depression-like behaviors, reduced expression of synaptic proteins in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), abnormal composition of gut microbiota, and altered blood metabolites and lipids. Furthermore, there were positive or negative correlations between the relative abundance of microbiome and behavioral data or blood metabolites (or lipids). Moreover, subdiaphragmatic vagotomy significantly blocked these changes in mice with HI/R injury. Notably, depression-like phenotypes in mice with HI/R injury were ameliorated after subsequent single injection of the new antidepressant arketamine. The current findings suggest that HI/R injury induces depression-like phenotypes in mice through the gut-microbiota-liver-brain axis via the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve. Furthermore, arketamine may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of depression in patients with chronic liver disease.",Journal of affective disorders,2024,Yong Yang; Akifumi Eguchi; Xiayun Wan; Chisato Mori; Kenji Hashimoto

37400971,Maternal microbiome disturbance induces deficits in the offspring's behaviors: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Recent evidence has suggested that changes in maternal gut microbiota in early life may generate neurobiological consequences associated with psychiatric-related abnormalities. However, the number of studies on humans investigating this problem is limited, and preclinical findings sometimes conflict. Therefore, we run a meta-analysis to examine whether maternal microbiota disturbance (MMD) during neurodevelopment might affect the offspring during adulthood. We found thirteen studies, from a set of 459 records selected by strategy registered on PROSPERO (#289224), to target preclinical studies that evaluated the behavioral outcomes of the rodents generated by dams submitted to perinatal enteric microbiota perturbation. The analysis revealed a significant effect size (SMD = -0.51, 95% CI = -0.79 to -0.22, <i>p</i> < .001, T2 = 0.54, I2 = 79.85%), indicating that MMD might provoke behavioral impairments in the adult offspring. The MMD also induces a significant effect size for the reduction of the sociability behavior (SMD = -0.63, 95% CI = -1.18 to -0.07, <i>p</i> = 0.011, T2 = 0.30, I2 = 76.11%) and obsessive-compulsive-like behavior (SMD = -0.68, 95% CI = -0.01 to -1.36, <i>p</i> = 0.009, T2 = 0.25, I2 = 62.82%) parameters. The effect size was not significant or inconclusive for memory and anxiety-like behavior, or inconclusive for schizophrenia-like and depressive-like behavior. Therefore, experimental perinatal MMD is vertically transmitted to the offspring, negatively impacting behavioral parameters related to psychiatric disorders.",Gut microbes,2023,Lucas Hassib; Cilene Lino de Oliveira; Guilherme Araujo Rouvier; Alexandre Kanashiro; Francisco Silveira Guimarães; Frederico Rogério Ferreira
39295905,The butyrate-producing and spore-forming bacterial genus <i>Coprococcus</i> as a potential biomarker for neurological disorders.,"The host-intestinal microbiome interaction has gained much scientific attention in the past two decades, boosted by advances in DNA sequencing and cultivation techniques. An accumulating amount of evidence shows that gut microbes play crucial roles in gut homeostasis, immune system education, and are associated with quality-of-life indicators. Beneficial health factors are associated with the digestion of dietary fibres in the colon and the subsequent production of short-chain fatty acids, including acetate, propionate, and butyrate. <i>Coprococcus</i> is a butyrate-producing genus in the phylum Firmicutes, and its abundance is inversely correlated with several neuropsychological and neurodegenerative disorders. Case-control studies provide strong evidence of decreased abundance of <i>Coprococcus</i> spp. in depressed individuals. The species <i>Coprococcus eutactus</i> has the unique capacity to use two separate pathways for butyrate synthesis and has been found to be depleted in children with delayed language development and adults with Parkinson's disease. The combined literature on <i>Coprococcus</i> and the gut microbiota-brain axis points towards enhanced butyrate production and reduced colonisation of pathogenic clades as factors explaining its association with health effects. The genus <i>Coprococcus</i> is a promising candidate for a mental health biomarker and an interesting lead for novel dietary-based preventive therapies for specific neurological disorders.","Gut microbiome (Cambridge, England)",2023,Fleur Notting; Walter Pirovano; Wilbert Sybesma; Remco Kort
36786865,Arketamine for cognitive impairment in psychiatric disorders.,"Cognitive impairment has been observed in patients with various psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, major depressive disorder (MDD), and bipolar disorder (BD). Although modern therapeutic drugs can improve certain symptoms (i.e., psychosis, depression) in these patients, these drugs have not been found to improve cognitive impairment. The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist (R,S)-ketamine has attracted attention as a rapidly acting antidepressant. In addition to its robust antidepressant effects, (R,S)-ketamine has been suggested to improve cognitive impairment in patients with MDD and BD, despite causing cognitive impairment in healthy control subjects. (R,S)-ketamine is a racemic mixture of equal amounts of (R)-ketamine (or arketamine) and (S)-ketamine (or esketamine). Arketamine has been found to have more potent antidepressant-like actions than esketamine in rodents. Interestingly, arketamine, but not esketamine, has been suggested to improve phencyclidine-induced cognitive deficits in mice. Furthermore, arketamine has been suggested to ameliorate cognitive deficits in rodent offspring after maternal immune activation. In the current article, it is proposed that arketamine has therapeutic potential for treating cognitive impairment in patients with psychiatric disorders. Additionally, the potential role of the gut-microbiome-brain axis in cognitive impairment in psychiatric disorders is discussed.",European archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience,2023,Kenji Hashimoto
37686747,Influence of Food Type on Human Psychological-Behavioral Responses and Crime Reduction.,"The purpose of this narrative review is to emphasize the importance of food consumption and meal selection on mental health and brain function, including psychological and behavioral reactions such as mood, loving relationships, violence, and criminal activity. Additionally, by being aware of the link between food and mental health, the community can be encouraged to make informed food choices in order to avoid unfavorable outcomes like criminality. Food behaviors are shifting significantly over the world. There are also significant changes in mood, sadness, happiness, and violence, as well as the spread of the variety and severity of mental diseases that lead to violent acts. Food intake and meal selection have evolved over the last ten years as the variety and accessibility of food options have become easier and more diverse. These modifications might have both beneficial and bad consequences. This article examines the relationship between food intake and its impact on marital satisfaction. The goal of this review is to support or refute the claim that food influences mood, love, or criminal behavior, or vice versa. Various diets can have an impact on one's mental health and brain, influencing psychological reactions and behavioral responses such as mood, loving relationships, violence, and even criminal activity. Food insecurity has been demonstrated in various studies to have a negative impact on health and psychological well-being, leading to despair, loss of happiness, marital conflict, and violence. For example, herbal extracts and flavonoids have the potential to improve gut microbiota and treat mood disorders. Understanding how the gut-brain axis communicates might help guide interventions for mood and cognitive function. Since the root of most diseases and behaviors is significantly related to the type of food consumed, this research addresses this issue in order to reduce the cost of treatment and prevention of crime and delinquency at the community level by consciously choosing the food consumed by the society. In other words, prevention is always better than cure.",Nutrients,2023,Masoud Heidari; Yalda Khodadadi Jokar; Shirin Madani; Sharifeh Shahi; Mohammad Sharif Shahi; Mohammad Goli
37150361,Gut microbiota maturity mediates the protective effect of siblings on food allergy.,"The mechanisms underlying the protective effect of older siblings on allergic disease remain unclear but may relate to the infant gut microbiota.We sought to investigate whether having older siblings decreases the risk of IgE-mediated food allergy by accelerating the maturation of the infant gut microbiota.In a birth cohort assembled using an unselected antenatal sampling frame (n = 1074), fecal samples were collected at 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year, and food allergy status at 1 year was determined by skin prick test and in-hospital food challenge. We used 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to derive amplicon sequence variants. Among a random subcohort (n = 323), microbiota-by-age z scores at each time point were calculated using fecal amplicon sequence variants to represent the gut microbiota maturation over the first year of life.A greater number of siblings was associated with a higher microbiota-by-age z score at age 1 year (β  = 0.15 per an additional sibling; 95% CI, 0.05-0.24; P = .003), which was in turn associated with decreased odds of food allergy (odds ratio, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.33-0.61; P < .001). Microbiota-by-age z scores mediated 63% of the protective effect of siblings. Analogous associations were not observed at younger ages.The protective effect of older siblings on the risk of developing IgE-mediated food allergy during infancy is substantially mediated by advanced maturation of the gut microbiota at age 1 year.",The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,2023,Yuan Gao; Jakob Stokholm; Martin O'Hely; Anne-Louise Ponsonby; Mimi L K Tang; Sarath Ranganathan; Richard Saffery; Leonard C Harrison; Fiona Collier; Lawrence Gray; David Burgner; John Molloy; Peter D Sly; Susanne Brix; Hanne Frøkiær; Peter Vuillermin; 
36875518,Disrupted diurnal oscillations of the gut microbiota in patients with alcohol dependence.,"Patients with alcohol dependence (AD) can exhibit gut dysbacteria. Dysbacteria may co-occur with disruptions of circadian rhythmicity of the gut flora, which can aggravate AD. Herein, this study aimed to investigate diurnal oscillations of the gut microbiota in AD patients.Thirty-two patients with AD, based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, and 20 healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. Demographic and clinical data were collected by self-report questionnaires. Fecal samples at 7:00 AM, 11:00 AM, 3:00 PM, and 7:00 PM were collected from each subject. 16S rDNA sequencing was conducted. Wilcoxon and Kruskal-Wallis tests were performed to characterize alterations and oscillations of the gut microbiota.We found that β-diversity of the gut microbiota in AD patients oscillated diurnally compared with healthy subjects (p = 0.01). Additionally, 0.66% of operational taxonomic units oscillated diurnally in AD patients versus 1.68% in healthy subjects. At different taxonomic levels, bacterial abundance oscillated diurnally in both groups, such as Pseudomonas and Prevotella pallens (all p < 0.05). β-diversity of the gut microbiota in AD patients with high daily alcohol consumption, high-level cravings, short AD durations, and mild withdrawal symptoms oscillated diurnally compared with other AD patients (all p < 0.05).The gut microbiota in AD patients exhibits disruptions of diurnal oscillation, which may provide novel insights into mechanisms of AD and the development of therapeutic strategies.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2023,Kangqing Zhao; Zhaojun Ni; Ying Qin; Ran Zhu; Zhoulong Yu; Yundong Ma; Wenhao Chen; Qiqing Sun; Zhong Wang; Yanjing Liu; Jingwen Zhao; Wenjuan Peng; Sifan Hu; Jie Shi; Lin Lu; Hongqiang Sun

37049619,Characteristics of the Gut Microbiome and Serum Metabolome in Patients with Functional Constipation.,"Functional constipation (FC) is a gastrointestinal disorder with high incidence, and it seriously affects patients' physical and mental health. Several studies have shown that the gut microbiome is associated with FC, but these studies have produced inconsistent findings, with few reflecting the relationship between the gut microbiome and metabolites. This study used 16S rRNA microbial genomics and non-target metabolome based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to analyze the gut microbiota composition and serum metabolic profiles of 30 FC patients and 28 healthy individuals. We found that patients with FC and healthy individuals have different gut microbiota structures and serum metabolic profiles. FC patients had more Bacteroides and butyrate-producing bacteria (Roseburia, Faecaliberium, Butyriccoccus). The upstream products of host arginine biosynthesis (2-oxoglutaric acid, <i>L</i>-glutamic acid, <i>N</i>-acetylornithine, and <i>L</i>-ornithine) were significantly reduced in FC patients' serum metabolites. In summary, our study describes the gut microbiome and serum metabolome of patients with functional constipation. It reveals that functional constipation may be associated with increased Bacteroidetes and downregulation of upstream products of host arginine biosynthesis, which may be potential markers for diagnosing functional constipation.",Nutrients,2023,Jialiang Wang; Linlin Wang; Qiangqing Yu; Nan Tang; Chunxia Mei; Hao Zhang; Gang Wang; Jian Lu; Wei Chen
36650644,Sex difference in prebiotics on gut and blood-brain barrier dysfunction underlying stress-induced anxiety and depression.,"Most of the previous studies have demonstrated the potential antidepressive and anxiolytic role of prebiotic supplement in male subjects, yet few have females enrolled. Herein, we explored whether prebiotics administration during chronic stress prevented depression-like and anxiety-like behavior in a sex-specific manner and the mechanism of behavioral differences caused by sex.Female and male C57 BL/J mice on normal diet were supplemented with or without a combination of fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) and galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) during 3- and 4-week chronic restraint stress (CRS) treatment, respectively. C57 BL/J mice on normal diet without CRS were used as controls. Behavior consequences, gut microbiota, dysfunction of gut and brain-blood barriers, and inflammatory profiles were measured.In the 3rd week, FOS + GOS administration attenuated stress-induced anxiety-like behavior in female, but not in male mice, and the anxiolytic effects in males were observed until the 4th week. However, protective effects of prebiotics on CRS-induced depression were not observed. Changes in the gene expression of tight junction proteins in the distal colon and hippocampus, and decreased number of colon goblet cells following CRS were restored by prebiotics only in females. In both female and male mice, prebiotics alleviated stress-induced BBB dysfunction and elevation in pro-inflammatory cytokines levels, and modulated gut microbiota caused by stress. Furthermore, correlation analysis revealed that anxiety-like behaviors were significantly correlated with levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and gene expression of tight junction proteins in the hippocampus of female mice, and the abundance of specific gut microbes was also correlated with anxiety-like behaviors, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and gene expression of tight junction proteins in the hippocampus of female mice.Female mice were more vulnerable to stress and prebiotics than males. The gut microbiota, gut and blood-brain barrier, and inflammatory response may mediate the protective effects of prebiotics on anxiety-like behaviors in female mice.",CNS neuroscience & therapeutics,2023,Jiajun Jiang; Yaoyang Fu; Anying Tang; Xingle Gao; Danhua Zhang; Yuting Shen; Tingting Mou; Shaohua Hu; Jingfang Gao; Jianbo Lai
36550591,Antidepression of Xingpijieyu formula targets gut microbiota derived from depressive disorder.,"This investigation aims to determine the antidepressant role of Xingpijieyu formula (XPJYF) mediated via gut microbiota (GM)-brain axis.We collected fecal microbiota from patients with depressive disorder (DD) and cultured microbiota in vitro. Some of microbiota were transplanted into germ-free rats with the intragastric administration of XPJYF grain at the dose of 1.533 g/kg/day. The behaviors were studied by forced swimming test, open field test, sucrose preference test, and body weight. Products of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis, neurotransmitter, and serum cytokines were investigated by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a biomarker of astrocyte, was quantified using immunofluorescence. Microbiota culturing in vitro after XPJYF treatment was analyze by 16 s RNA sequencing technology. We used lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to mimic activated rat primary astrocyte in vitro. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), cytokines, and oxidative stress factors were determined by western blotting, and glycometabolism in astrocyte was investigated by 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) uptake, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and glucose-1-phosphate (G1P) kits.Microbiota composition during 8 mg/ml of XPJYF (H12-8) for 12 h showed the more consistency. Lactococcus is enriched in DD-derived microbiota composition, and Biffdobacterium and Lactobacillus in H12-8 group. GLUCOSE1PMETAB-PWY and PWY-7328 of which biofunctions were dominantly encoded by Biffdobacterium were the top two of altered pathways. XPJYF improved behaviors and repressed astrocyte activation in depression rats. XPJYF elevated 2-DG uptake, ATP, glucose-1-phosphate, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and inhibited cytokines and oxidative stress in LPS-induced astrocyte.XPJYF treatment targets inflammation, activation, and glycometabolim in astrocyte via gut microbiota modulation, thereby improve animal behaviors, HPA axis dysfunction, and neurotransmitter synthesis in depression rats.",CNS neuroscience & therapeutics,2023,Yannan Li; Lixuan Yang; Junnan Li; Wei Gao; Zhonghui Zhao; Kaiqiang Dong; Wenzhe Duan; Baoan Dai; Rongjuan Guo

The behaviors were studied by forced swimming test, open field test, sucrose preference test, and body weight. Products of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis, neurotransmitter, and serum cytokines were investigated by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a biomarker of astrocyte, was quantified using immunofluorescence. Microbiota culturing in vitro after XPJYF treatment was analyze by 16 s RNA sequencing technology. We used lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to mimic activated rat primary astrocyte in vitro. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), cytokines, and oxidative stress factors were determined by western blotting, and glycometabolism in astrocyte was investigated by 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) uptake, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and glucose-1-phosphate (G1P) kits.Microbiota composition during 8 mg/ml of XPJYF (H12-8) for 12 h showed the more consistency. Lactococcus is enriched in DD-derived microbiota composition, and Biffdobacterium and Lactobacillus in H12-8 group. GLUCOSE1PMETAB-PWY and PWY-7328 of which biofunctions were dominantly encoded by Biffdobacterium were the top two of altered pathways. XPJYF improved behaviors and repressed astrocyte activation in depression rats. XPJYF elevated 2-DG uptake, ATP, glucose-1-phosphate, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and inhibited cytokines and oxidative stress in LPS-induced astrocyte.XPJYF treatment targets inflammation, activation, and glycometabolim in astrocyte via gut microbiota modulation, thereby improve animal behaviors, HPA axis dysfunction, and neurotransmitter synthesis in depression rats.",CNS neuroscience & therapeutics,2023,Yannan Li; Lixuan Yang; Junnan Li; Wei Gao; Zhonghui Zhao; Kaiqiang Dong; Wenzhe Duan; Baoan Dai; Rongjuan Guo
36549572,The effect of microbiome composition on impulsive and violent behavior: A systematic review.,"The impact of the microbiome on brain function and behavior has recently become an important research topic. We searched for a link between the gut microbiome and impulsive and violent behavior. We focused on critical factors influencing the microbiome establishment that may affect human health later in life, i.e., delivery mode, early-life feeding, and early antibiotic exposure. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. We included original human studies examining adults and children with impulsive and/or violent behavior that assessed the gut microbiota composition of participants, delivery mode, infant feeding mode, or early antibiotic exposure. Bibliographic searches yielded 429 articles, and 21 met the eligibility criteria. Two studies reported data on patients with schizophrenia with violent behavior, while 19 studies reported data on patients with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The results showed several bacterial taxa associated with ADHD symptomatology and with violent behavior in patients with schizophrenia. No association was found between delivery mode and impulsive behavior, nor did any articles relate infant feeding mode to violent human behavior. Those studies investigating early antibiotic exposure yielded ambiguous results. The heterogeneity of the data and the different methodologies of the included studies limited the external validity of the results. We found few studies that addressed the possible microbiome involvement in the pathophysiology of impulsive and violent behavior in humans. Our review revealed a gap in knowledge regarding links between the gut microbiome and these extreme behavioral patterns.",Behavioural brain research,2023,Michaela Langmajerová; Radka Roubalová; Antonín Šebela; Jan Vevera

37209162,Bacillus licheniformis prevents and reduces anxiety-like and depression-like behaviours.,"As common mental disorders, depression and anxiety impact people all around the world. Recent studies have found that the gut microbiome plays an important role in mental health. It is becoming possible to treat mental disorders by regulating the composition of the gut microbiota. Bacillus licheniformis is a probiotic used to treat gut diseases through balancing the gut microbiome during lasting years. Considering the role of gut microbiota in the gut-brain axis, this study used chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model rats to explore whether Bacillus licheniformis can prevent and treat depression and anxiety. We found that B. licheniformis reduced the depressive-like and anxiety-like behaviours of the rats during the CUMS process. Meanwhile, B. licheniformis changed the gut microbiota composition; increased the short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the colon, decreased kynurenine, norepinephrine, and glutamate levels; and increased the tryptophan, dopamine, epinephrine, and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain. After correlation analysis, we found Parabacteroides, Anaerostipes, Ruminococcus-2, and Blautia showed significant correlation with neurotransmitters and SCFAs, indicating the gut microbiome plays an important role in B. licheniformis reducing depressive-like behaviours. Therefore, this study suggested B. licheniformis may prevent depressive-like and anxiety-like behaviours while regulating the gut microbiota composition and increasing the SCFA levels in the colon to alter the levels of the neurotransmitters in the brain. KEY POINTS: • B. licheniformis reduced depressive-like and anxiety-like behaviours induced by the chronic unpredictable mild stress. • GABA levels in the brain are assonated with B. licheniformis regulating depressive-like and anxiety-like behaviours. • Gut microbiota composition alteration followed by metabolic changes may play a role in the GABA levels increase.",Applied microbiology and biotechnology,2023,Siyuan Feng; Chen Meng; Yiyuan Liu; Yue Yi; Axin Liang; Yingyu Zhang; Zikai Hao
37193253,Anxiety Disorders and Gut Dysbiosis in Primary Sjögren's Syndrome-Mediated Dry Eye Patients.,"Primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS), a disease that is associated with a high prevalence of psychological disorders, has become increasingly important. Interactions between the gut microbiota and ocular conditions have been identified in pSS. As mental intervention is frequently needed, this study aims to investigate the relationship between anxiety disorders and the gut microbiome in patients with pSS-mediated dry eye.Demographics and self-administered questionnaires were obtained. Faecal samples were evaluated using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing.The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-A) cut-off point of ≥ 8 points showed a sensitivity and specificity of 76.5% and 80.0%, respectively. In all participants, we found that the prevalence of anxiety disorder was 30.4%. Dry eye discomfort could promote an anxious state, and conversely, anxiety could threaten tear film and increase the risk of pSS activity. There was a certain correlation between anxiety disorder and gut dysbiosis. Prevotella was associated with dry eye severity (<i>p</i> <0.001). Bacteroidetes (<i>p</i> =0.046) and Odoribacter (<i>p</i> =0.001) were correlated with pSS activity.There is a bidirectional relationship between anxiety disorder and the gut microbiota in pSS-mediated dry eye. Alterations in certain classes of gut microbiota are associated with pSS activity and dry eye severity. Main gut microbiota alterations that have a facilitating impact on anxiety are emerging in pSS-mediated dry eye. Future studies are needed to explore specific therapeutic targets for improving mental health in pSS-mediated dry eye by microbiota intervention.",International journal of general medicine,2023,Yiting Zhang; Meiqi Gan; Yuqin He; Tingting Liu; Mei Xu
37576972,Profiles and diagnostic value of intestinal microbiota in schizophrenia patients with metabolic syndrome.,"It is widely thought that the intestinal microbiota plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders. However, the gut microbiota composition and characteristics of schizophrenia patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS) have been largely understudied. Herein, we investigated the association between the metabolic status of mainland Chinese schizophrenia patients with MetS and the intestinal microbiome.Fecal microbiota communities from 115 male schizophrenia patients (57 with MetS and 58 without MetS) were assessed by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. We assessed the variations of gut microbiome between both groups and explored potential associations between intestinal microbiota and parameters of MetS. In addition, the Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) based on the KEGG database was used to predict the function of intestinal microbiota. We also conducted Decision Tree Analysis to develop a diagnostic model for the MetS in patients with schizophrenia based on the composition of intestinal microbiota.The fecal microbial diversity significantly differed between groups with or without MetS (α-diversity (Shannon index and Simpson index): p=0.0155, p=0.0089; β-diversity: p=0.001). Moreover, the microbial composition was significantly different between the two groups, involving five phyla and 38 genera (p<0.05). In addition, a significant correlation was observed between the metabolic-related parameters and abundance of altered microbiota including HDL-c (r2 = 0.203, p=0.0005), GLU (r2 = 0.286, p=0.0005) and WC (r2 = 0.061, p=0.037). Furthermore, KEGG pathway analysis showed that 16 signaling pathways were significantly enriched between the two groups (p<0.05). Importantly, our diagnostic model based on five microorganisms established by decision tree analysis could effectively distinguish between patients with and without MetS (AUC = 0.94).Our study established the compositional and functional characteristics of intestinal microbiota in schizophrenia patients with MetS. These new findings provide novel insights into a better understanding of this disease and provide the theoretical basis for implementing new interventional therapies in clinical practice.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2023,Mengjuan Xing; Hui Gao; Lili Yao; Li Wang; Chengfang Zhang; Liping Zhu; Donghong Cui
36571897,"Repeated use of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine is associated with the resilience in mice after chronic social defeat stress: A role of gut-microbiota-brain axis.","3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), the most widely used illicit compound worldwide, is the most attractive therapeutic drug for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Recent observational studies of US adults demonstrated that lifetime MDMA use was associated with lower risk of depression. Here, we examined whether repeated administration of MDMA can affect resilience versus susceptibility in mice exposed to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS). CSDS produced splenomegaly, anhedonia-like phenotype, and higher plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the saline-treated mice. In contrast, CSDS did not cause these changes in the MDMA-treated mice. Analysis of gut microbiome found several microbes altered between saline + CSDS group and MDMA + CSDS group. Untargeted metabolomics analysis showed that plasma levels of N-epsilon-methyl-L-lysine in the saline + CSDS group were significantly higher than those in the control and MDMA + CSDS groups. Interestingly, there were positive correlations between plasma IL-6 levels and the abundance of several microbes (or plasma N-epsilon-methyl-L-lysine) in the three groups. Furthermore, there were also positive correlations between the abundance of several microbes and N-epsilon-methyl-L-lysine in the three groups. In conclusion, these data suggest that repeated administration of MDMA might contribute to stress resilience in mice subjected to CSDS through gut-microbiota-brain axis.",Psychiatry research,2023,Youge Qu; Akifumi Eguchi; Xiayun Wan; Li Ma; Lijia Chang; Jiajing Shan; Yong Yang; Chisato Mori; Kenji Hashimoto

37764088,Altered Gut Microbiota Composition Is Associated with Difficulty in Explicit Emotion Regulation in Young Children.,"Executive function (EF) consists of explicit emotion regulation (EER) and cognitive control (CC). Childhood EER in particular predicts mental and physical health in adulthood. Identifying factors affecting EER development has implications for lifelong physical and mental health. Gut microbiota (GM) has attracted attention as a potential biomarker for risk of physical and mental problems in adulthood. Furthermore, GM is related to brain function/structure, which plays a crucial role in emotional processing. However, little is known about how GM compositions are associated with the development of emotion regulation in early childhood. Therefore, in this study, we examined 257 children aged 3-4 to investigate links between GM and risk to EF. EF was measured using the Mother-Reported Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Preschool version. GM composition (alpha/beta diversity and genus abundance) was evaluated using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and compared between EF-risk and non-risk groups. Our results show that children with EER-risk (an index of inhibitory self-control) had a higher abundance of the genera <i>Actinomyces</i> and <i>Sutterella</i>. Although we have not established a direct link between GM and CC risk, our findings indicate that GM of preschoolers is closely associated with emotional processing and that EERrisk children have more inflammation-related bacteria.",Microorganisms,2023,Hideaki Fujihara; Michiko Matsunaga; Eriko Ueda; Takamasa Kajiwara; Aya K Takeda; Satoshi Watanabe; Kairi Baba; Keisuke Hagihara; Masako Myowa
36760344,Alteration of faecal microbiota balance related to long-term deep meditation.,"Advancements in research have confirmed that gut microbiota can influence health through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Meditation, as an inner mental exercise, can positively impact the regulation of an individual's physical and mental health. However, few studies have comprehensively investigated faecal microbiota following long-term (several years) deep meditation. Therefore, we propose that long-term meditation may regulate gut microbiota homeostasis and, in turn, affect physical and mental health.To investigate the effects of long-term deep meditation on the gut microbiome structure.To examine the intestinal flora, 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed on faecal samples of 56 Tibetan Buddhist monks and neighbouring residents. Based on the sequencing data, linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) was employed to identify differential intestinal microbial communities between the two groups. Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) analysis was used to predict the function of faecal microbiota. In addition, we evaluated biochemical indices in the plasma.The α-diversity indices of the meditation and control groups differed significantly. At the genus level, <i>Prevotella</i> and <i>Bacteroides</i> were significantly enriched in the meditation group. According to the LEfSe analysis, two beneficial bacterial genera (<i>Megamonas</i> and <i>Faecalibacterium</i>) were significantly enriched in the meditation group. Functional predictive analysis further showed that several pathways-including glycan biosynthesis, metabolism and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis-were significantly enriched in the meditation group. Moreover, plasma levels of clinical risk factors were significantly decreased in the meditation group, including total cholesterol and apolipoprotein B.Long-term traditional Tibetan Buddhist meditation may positively impact physical and mental health. We confirmed that the gut microbiota composition differed between the monks and control subjects. The microbiota enriched in monks was associated with a reduced risk of anxiety, depression and cardiovascular disease and could enhance immune function. Overall, these results suggest that meditation plays a positive role in psychosomatic conditions and well-being.",General psychiatry,2023,Ying Sun; Peijun Ju; Ting Xue; Usman Ali; Donghong Cui; Jinghong Chen

However, how the proteoglycan promotes the progress of CRC through interacting with bacteria and regulating the immune response of enteric neurons remains largely unknown. In the present study, we found that biglycan deficiency changed tumor distribution in a colitis-associated colon cancer model. Furthermore, we revealed that BGN deficiency inhibits tumor growth in an allograft tumor model and the migration of cancer cell by upregulating interleukin-10 expression in enteric neurons. Significantly, we demonstrated that biglycan deficiency enriched the abundance of <i>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</i> through competing with it for chondroitin sulfate to inhibit CRC progress. Our work provided new insights into the interaction between host proteoglycan and gut microbiota as well as the role of enteric neurons in the tumor microenvironment.",iScience,2023,Yuyu Xu; Fei Wang; Kai Mi; Xinyuan Wang; Danlei Wang; Qing Zhao; Jingjing Wang; Zhi Liu; Qingqing Zhang; Yang Liu; Xuemei Zhang; Xingyin Liu
37023596,Different roles of microbiota and genetics in the prediction of treatment response in major depressive disorder.,"The roles of gut microbiota and susceptibility genes in patients with major depression disorder (MDD) are not well understood. Examining the microbiome and host genetics might be helpful for clinical decision-making. Patients with MDD were recruited in this study and subsequently treated for eight weeks. We identified the differences between the population with a response after two weeks and those with a response after eight weeks. The factors that were significantly correlated with efficacy were used to predict the treatment response. The differences in the importance of microbiota and genetics in prediction were analyzed. Our study identified rs58010457 as a potentially key locus affecting the treatment effect. Different microbiota and enriched pathways might play different roles in the response after two and eight weeks. We found that the area under the curve (AUC) value was greater than 0.8 for both random forest models. The contribution of different components to the AUC was evaluated by removing genetic information, microbiota abundance, and pathway data. The gut microbiome was an important predictor of the response after eight weeks, while genetics was an important predictor of the response after two weeks. These results suggested a dynamic effect of interaction among genetics and gut microbes on treatment. Furthermore, these results provide new guidance for clinical decisions: in cases of inadequate treatment effects after two weeks, the composition of the intestinal flora can be improved by diet therapy, which could ultimately affect the efficacy.",Journal of psychiatric research,2023,Ke Han; Lei Ji; Qinglian Xie; Liangjie Liu; Xi Wu; Lin He; Yi Shi; Rong Zhang; Guang He; Zaiquan Dong; Tao Yu
37808915,Characterization of gut microbiota profile in Iranian patients with bipolar disorder compared to healthy controls.,"The human gut microbiota plays a crucial role in mental health through the gut-brain axis, impacting central nervous system functions, behavior, mood, and anxiety. Consequently, it is implicated in the development of neuropsychiatric disorders. This study aimed to assess and compare the gut microbiota profiles and populations of individuals with bipolar disorder and healthy individuals in Iran.Fecal samples were collected from 60 participants, including 30 bipolar patients (BPs) and 30 healthy controls (HCs), following rigorous entry criteria. Real-time quantitative PCR was utilized to evaluate the abundance of 10 bacterial genera/species and five bacterial phyla.Notably, <i>Actinobacteria</i> and <i>Lactobacillus</i> exhibited the greatest fold change in BPs compared to HCs at the phylum and genus level, respectively, among the bacteria with significant population differences. <i>Ruminococcus</i> emerged as the most abundant genus in both groups, while <i>Proteobacteria</i> and <i>Bacteroidetes</i> showed the highest abundance in BPs and HCs, respectively, at the phylum level. Importantly, our investigation revealed a lower <i>Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes</i> ratio, potentially serving as a health indicator, in HCs compared to BPs.This study marks the first examination of an Iranian population and provides compelling evidence of significant differences in gut microbiota composition between BPs and HCs, suggesting a potential link between brain functions and the gut microbial profile and population.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2023,Nassir Rashnaei; Abbas Akhavan Sepahi; Seyed Davar Siadat; Esmaeil Shahsavand-Ananloo; Golnaz Bahramali

37951975,"Effect of inulin supplementation on clinical symptoms, inflammatory and oxidative stress markers in women with migraine: study protocol for a randomized clinical trial.","Migraine is a complex, chronic, and debilitating multifactorial disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of headache and related symptoms. It typically begins in early ages and is more prevalent in women than in men. Recently, the gut-brain axis has emerged as a new candidate that may be linked to neurological diseases. We hypothesize that selective modulation of the intestinal microbiota, oxidative stress, and inflammation through inulin supplementation may improve clinical outcomes in these patients. Therefore, this study aims to examine the effects of high-performance inulin supplementation on clinical symptoms, mental health, quality of life (QOL), intestinal permeability, and inflammatory and oxidative stress factors in women with migraine.This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial involving 80 women with migraine who meet the inclusion criteria (aged between 20 and 50 years with a diagnosis of migraine by a neurologist based on the ICDH-3). Participants will be assigned to receive a daily dose of 10 g of inulin for 12 weeks (intervention group, n = 40) or 10 g of maltodextrin as a placebo for the same duration (control group, n = 40). The primary outcome will measure the variations in the frequency of headache experienced by the patients. Secondary outcomes will encompass serum levels of zonulin, high-sensitive C-reactive protein, total antioxidant capacity, total oxidant status, nitric oxide, mental status, QOL, duration, and severity of migraine attacks.This clinical trial aims to evaluate the effect of inulin supplementation on inflammatory status, oxidative stress, intestinal permeability, clinical symptoms, mental health, and QOL in women with migraine. The findings of this trial could contribute to the identification of mechanistic action and evidence-based clinical guidelines that address gut microbiota manipulation to maximize health benefits in the management of clinical outcomes in migraine patients.Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials ( www.irct.ir ) (ID: IRCT20121216011763N58).

36191806,A role of gut-microbiota-brain axis via subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve in depression-like phenotypes in Chrna7 knock-out mice.,"The α7 subtype of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7 nAChR: coded by Chrna7) is known to regulate the cholinergic ascending anti-inflammatory pathway. We previously reported that Chrna7 knock-out (KO) mice show depression-like behaviors through abnormal composition of gut microbiota and systemic inflammation. Given the role of subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve in gut-microbiota-brain axis, we investigated whether subdiaphragmatic vagotomy (SDV) could affect depression-like behaviors, abnormal composition of gut microbiota, and microbes-derived metabolites in Chrna7 KO mice. SDV blocked depression-like behaviors and reduced expression of synaptic proteins in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of Chrna7 KO mice.

36191806,A role of gut-microbiota-brain axis via subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve in depression-like phenotypes in Chrna7 knock-out mice.,"The α7 subtype of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7 nAChR: coded by Chrna7) is known to regulate the cholinergic ascending anti-inflammatory pathway. We previously reported that Chrna7 knock-out (KO) mice show depression-like behaviors through abnormal composition of gut microbiota and systemic inflammation. Given the role of subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve in gut-microbiota-brain axis, we investigated whether subdiaphragmatic vagotomy (SDV) could affect depression-like behaviors, abnormal composition of gut microbiota, and microbes-derived metabolites in Chrna7 KO mice. SDV blocked depression-like behaviors and reduced expression of synaptic proteins in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of Chrna7 KO mice. LEfSe (linear discriminant analysis effect size) analysis revealed that the species Lactobacillus sp. BL302, the species Lactobacillus hominis, and the species Lactobacillus reuteri, were identified as potential microbial markers in the KO + SDV group.

38222911,The functional roles of short chain fatty acids as postbiotics in human gut: future perspectives.,"The significance of gut microbiome and their metabolites (postbiotics) on human health could be a promising approach to treat various diseases that includes inflammatory bowel diseases, colon cancer, and many neurological disorders. Probiotics with potential mental health benefits (psychobiotics) can alter the gut-brain axis via immunological, humoral, neuronal, and metabolic pathways. Recently, probiotic bacteria like <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Bifidobacterium</i> have been demonstrated for SCFAs production, which play a crucial role in a variety of diseases. These acids could enhance the production of mucins, antimicrobial proteins (bacteriocins and peptides), cytokines (Interleukin 10 and 18) and neurotransmitters (serotonin) in the intestine to main the gut microbiota, intestinal barrier system and other immune functions.

37624502,The association between greenery type and gut microbiome in schizophrenia: did all greenspaces play the equivalent role?,"In recent years, attention has been focused on the benefit of greenspace on mental health, and it is suggested this link may vary with the type of greenspace. More and more studies have emphasized the influence of the gut microbiome on schizophrenia (SCZ). However, the effects of greenspaces on the gut microbiota in SCZ and the effect of different types of greenspaces on the gut microbiota remain unclear. We aim to examine if there were variations in the effects of various greenspace types on the gut microbiome in SCZ. Besides, we sink to explore important taxonomic compositions associated with different greenspace types. We recruited 243 objects with schizophrenia from Anhui Mental Health Center and collected fecal samples for 16Sr RNA gene sequencing. Three types of greenery coverage were calculated with different circular buffers (800, 1500, and 3000 m) corresponding to individual addresses. The association between greenspace and microbiome composition was analyzed with permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA). We conducted the linear regression to capture specific gut microbiome taxa associated with greenery coverage. Tree coverage was consistently associated with microbial composition in both 1500 m (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.007, P = 0.030) and 3000 m (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.007, P = 0.039). In contrast, there was no association with grass cover in any of the buffer zones. In the regression analysis, higher tree coverage was significantly correlated with the relative abundance of several taxa. Among them, tree coverage was positively associated with increased Bifidobacterium longum (β = 1.069, P = 0.004), which was the dominant composition in the gut microbiota. The relationship between greenspace and gut microbiome in SCZ differed by the type of greenspace. Besides, ""tree coverage"" may present a dominant effect on the important taxonomic composition. Our findings might provide instructive evidence for the design of urban greenspace to optimize health and well-being in SCZ as well as the whole people.",Environmental science and pollution research international,2023,Ning Wei; Shusi Wang; Xuanxuan Li; Rubing Pan; Weizhuo Yi; Jian Song; Li Liu; Jintao Liu; Jiajun Yuan; Rong Song; Jian Cheng; Hong Su

37954149,Reproducible microbiome composition signatures of anxiety and depressive symptoms.,"The gut microbiome is a significant contributor to mental health, with growing evidence linking its composition to anxiety and depressive disorders. Gut microbiome composition is associated with signs of anxiety and depression both in clinically diagnosed mood disorders and subclinically in the general population and may be influenced by dietary fibre intake and the presence of chronic pain. We provide an update of current evidence on the role of gut microbiome composition in depressive and anxiety disorders or symptoms by reviewing available studies. Analysing data from three independent cohorts (osteoarthritis 1 (OA1); n = 46, osteoarthritis 2 (OA2); n = 58, and healthy controls (CON); n = 67), we identified microbial composition signatures of anxiety and depressive symptoms at genus level and cross-validated our findings performing meta-analyses of our results with results from previously published studies. The genera <i>Bifidobacterium</i> (fixed-effect beta (95% CI) = -0.22 (-0.34, -0.10), p = 3.90e-04) and <i>Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group</i> (fixed-effect beta (95% CI) = -0.09 (-0.13, -0.05), p = 2.53e-06) were found to be the best predictors of anxiety and depressive symptoms, respectively, across our three cohorts and published literature taking into account demographic and lifestyle covariates, such as fibre intake. The association with anxiety was robust in accounting for heterogeneity between cohorts and supports previous observations of the potential prophylactic effect of <i>Bifidobacterium</i> against anxiety symptoms.",Computational and structural biotechnology journal,2023,Afroditi Kouraki; Anthony Kelly; Amrita Vijay; Sameer Gohir; Stuart Astbury; Vasileios Georgopoulos; Bonnie Millar; David Andrew Walsh; Eamonn Ferguson; Cristina Menni; Ana M Valdes

Gut dysbiosis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders. Oxymatrine (OMT) has therapeutic effects on inflammation-mediated diseases. Whether OMT exerts therapeutic effects on WMI after ICH and the role of gut microbiota involved in this process is largely unknown.Neurological deficits, WMI, gut microbial composition, intestinal barrier function, and systemic inflammation were investigated after ICH. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) was performed to elucidate the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of ICH.OMT promoted long-term neurological function recovery and ameliorated WMI in the peri-hematoma region and distal corticospinal tract (CST) region after ICH. ICH induced significant and persistent gut dysbiosis, which was obviously regulated by OMT. In addition, OMT alleviated intestinal barrier dysfunction and systemic inflammation. Correlation analysis revealed that gut microbiota alteration was significantly correlated with inflammation, intestinal barrier permeability, and neurological deficits after ICH. Moreover, OMT-induced gut microbiota alteration could confer protection against neurological deficits and intestinal barrier disruption.Our study demonstrates that OMT ameliorates ICH-induced WMI and neurological deficits by modulating gut microbiota.",CNS neuroscience & therapeutics,2023,Jing Li; Jianhao Liang; Meiqin Zeng; Kaijian Sun; Yunhao Luo; Huaping Zheng; Feng Li; Wen Yuan; Hongwei Zhou; Junshan Liu; Haitao Sun

37794974,A personalized diet intervention improves depression symptoms and changes microbiota and metabolite profiles among community-dwelling older adults.,"The impact of diet on mental well-being and gut microorganisms in humans is well recognized. However, research on the connections between food nutrients, gut microbiota, and mental health remains limited. To address this, the present study aimed to assess the effects of a personalized diet, based on individual needs and aligned with the Mediterranean diet principles, on depression symptoms, quality of life, nutritional intake, and gut microbiota changes among older adults living in the community.The intervention involved regular visits from a registered dietitian, who provided tailored dietary recommendations. During the 6-month study, participants completed questionnaires to evaluate their depression levels, quality of life, and dietary habits. Additionally, they provided stool samples for analysis of gut microbiota and metabolites.The results demonstrated that the personalized dietary intervention reduced depression symptoms and improved the quality of life among older adults. Furthermore, significant changes in the intake of certain nutrients, such as folate, lutein, zeaxanthin, EPA, and DHA, were observed following the intervention. Moreover, the intervention was associated with increased diversity in the gut microbiome and reduced total short-chain fatty acids, the main metabolites produced by gut microorganisms. The study also revealed correlations between food nutrients, gut microbiota, and mental health parameters.In conclusion, this research highlights the potential advantages of personalized dietary interventions in managing depression and enhancing overall well-being among older populations. It also sheds light on the role of gut microbiota and its metabolites in these effects. The findings offer valuable insights into the significance of nutrition and gut health for mental well-being in older adults.",Frontiers in nutrition,2023,Faiga Magzal; Silvia Turroni; Marco Fabbrini; Monica Barone; Adi Vitman Schorr; Ariella Ofran; Snait Tamir
37213508,Global research trends and focus on the link between colorectal cancer and gut flora: a bibliometric analysis from 2001 to 2021.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a highly prevalent cancer, and the global healthcare system bears a significant burden due to its incidence. Modulating the gut microbiota is a promising approach to enhance the efficacy of CRC treatment and reduce its adverse effects. The causal relationship between specific microorganisms' presence and CRC development has been widely validated. However, few studies have investigated this relationship using bibliometric methods. Therefore, this study analyzed the research hotspots and trends in human gut microbiology and CRC over the last two decades from a bibliometric perspective. The study aims to provide novel insights into basic and clinical research in this field.The articles and reviews on gut microbiota in CRC were obtained from the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC) on November 2, 2022. CiteSpace and VOSviewer were used to conduct the bibliometric and knowledge-map analysis.A total of 2,707 publications were obtained, with a rapid increase in the number of publications since 2015. The United States and China are the main contributors in this field and have established a network of partnerships in several countries. 414 academic journals have published articles on this topic. The author with the highest number of publications is Jun Yu from the Chinese University of Hong Kong. In addition to ""intestinal flora"" and ""colorectal cancer,"" high frequency terms in the keyword co-occurrence network analysis included inflammatory bowel disease, <i>Fusobacterium nucleatum</i>, inflammation, long-chain fatty acids, ulcerative colitis, bile acids, and resistant starch. Analysis of keyword trends using burst testing revealed that biomarkers, abnormal crypt foci, bifidobacteria, β-glucuronidase, short-chain fatty acids, bile acids, and DNA methylation are at the forefront of research in this area.The findings of this study provide a bibliometric analysis and visualization of the key research areas in gut microbiota and CRC over the past 20 years. The results suggest that the role of gut microbiota in CRC and its underlying mechanisms should be closely monitored, particularly in the areas of biomarkers, metabolic pathways, and DNA methylation, which may emerge as hot topics in this field.",Frontiers in microbiology,2023,Yonglong Chang; Qinling Ou; Xuhui Zhou; Jinhui Liu; Sifang Zhang
36877601,The role of vitamin D in depression and anxiety disorders: a review of the literature.,"Prevalence of mental health disorders continue to increase worldwide. Over the past decades, suboptimal vitamin D (VD) levels and gut dysbiosis have been associated with neurological dysfunction and psychiatric disorders.In this review, we examined the available literature on VD and mental health disorders, particularly depression and anxiety, in both clinical and pre-clinical studies.Our extensive review failed to find a link between VD deficiency, depression, and anxiety-related behavior in preclinical animal models. However, strong evidence suggests that VD supplementation may alleviate symptoms in chronically stressed rodents, with some promising evidence from clinical studies. Further, fecal microbiota transplantations suggest a potential role of gut microbiota in neuropsychiatric disorders, although the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. It has been postulated that serotonin, primarily produced by gut bacteria, may be a crucial factor. Hence, whether VD has the ability to impact gut microbiota and modulate serotonin synthesis warrants further investigation.Taken together, literature has suggested that VD may serve as a key regulator in the gut-brain axis to modulate gut microbiota and alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety. The inconsistent results of VD supplementation in clinical studies, particularly among VD deficient participants, suggests that current intake recommendations may need to be re-evaluated for individuals at-risk (i.e. prior to diagnosis) of developing depression and/or anxiety.",Nutritional neuroscience,2024,Karisa Renteria; Hien Nguyen; Gar Yee Koh

37432210,"The Influence of Topinambur and Inulin Preventive Supplementation on Microbiota, Anxious Behavior, Cognitive Functions and Neurogenesis in Mice Exposed to the Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress.","Daily living and functioning under stress can lead to mental health problems such as anxiety or depression. Over the past decades, a number of studies have been conducted to determine the relationship between the central nervous system (CNS), intestinal flora and bidirectional communication along the gut brain axis (GBA) in the maintaining of homeostasis. One of the most important factors regulating GBA functioning in exposure to stress may be a proper diet enriched in the supplementation with pre-, pro-and synbiotics. In the present study, we examined whether a 10-week oral preventive supplementation with natural prebiotics: topinambur powder (TPB) and chicory root inulin (INU) influenced an anxiety, depressive behavior and cognition in mice exposed to the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). Additionally, a fluoxetine (FLU) has been used as a reference antidepressive drug. Furthermore, we assessed the effect of TPB, INU and FLU administration on neurogenesis in mice exposed to CUMS and finally analyzed fecal microbiota for possible changes after TPB and INU supplementation in CUMS induced mice. Results obtained from the behavioral studies (elevated plaze maze, forced swim and Morris water maze test) indicated, that 10 week supplementation with TPB (250 mg/kg) and INU (66 mg/kg), similarly to FLU (12 mg/kg), significantly mitigated an anxiety and stress as well as protected learning and memory functions in the CUMS induced mice compared to the control stressed group. Additionally, TPB and INU CUMS mice showed significantly higher level of neurogenesis in comparison to control CUMS group. Interestingly, results obtained from the fecal microbiota analysis showed a beneficial effect of TPB and INU supplementation against CUMS-induced intestinal dysbiosis in mice. In conclusion, the obtained results showed that a long-term, preventive supplementation with TPB or INU alleviates the negative effects such as anxiety, cognitive disorders or dysbiosis in mice exposed to chronic unpredictable stress.",Nutrients,2023,Joanna Szala-Rycaj; Aleksandra Szewczyk; Mirosław Zagaja; Agnieszka Kaczmarczyk-Ziemba; Maciej Maj; Marta Andres-Mach

Compared with the USA and the world, the Chinese neurological and mental disorders DALY percent was least in the generation over 75 but rapidly increased in younger generations and surpassed the USA and/or the world in the last decades. The age-related upward pattern in Chinese disease burdens had not only shown in the presence of cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms, and diabetes mellitus but also appeared in the presence of depressive disorders, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, schizophrenia, headache disorders, anxiety disorders, conduct disorders, autism spectrum disorders, and eating disorders, successively. Additionally, the upward trend was associated with the dramatic dietary transition including a reduction in dietary quality and food production sustainability, during which the younger generation is more affected than the older. Following the increase in total calorie intake, alcohol intake, ratios of animal to vegetal foods, and poultry meat to pulses, the burdens of the above diseases continuously rose. Then, following the rise of the ratios of meat to pulses, eggs to pulses, and pork to pulses, the usage of fertilizers, the farming density of pigs, and the burdens of the above disease except diabetes mellitus were also ever-increasing. Even the usage of pesticides was positively correlated with the burdens of Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, cardiovascular diseases, and neoplasms.

Therefore, we hypothesized that PPI use may be an important and underappreciated cause of fatigue and reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in this population.Cross-sectional study.Kidney transplant recipients (≥1 year after transplantation) enrolled in the TransplantLines Biobank and Cohort Study.PPI use, PPI type, PPI dosage, and duration of PPI use.Fatigue and HRQoL, assessed using the validated Checklist Individual Strength 20 Revised questionnaire and Short Form-36 questionnaire.Logistic and linear regression.We included 937 kidney transplant recipients (mean age 56±13 years, 39% female) at a median of 3 (1-10) years after transplantation. PPI use was associated with fatigue severity (regression coefficient 4.02, 95% CI, 2.18 to 5.85, P<0.001), a higher risk of severe fatigue (OR 2.05, 95% CI, 1.48 to 2.84, P<0.001), lower physical HRQoL (regression coefficient-8.54, 95% CI, -11.54 to-5.54, P<0.001), and lower mental HRQoL (regression coefficient-4.66, 95% CI, -7.15 to-2.17, P<0.001). These associations were independent of potential confounders including age, time since transplantation, history of upper gastrointestinal disease, antiplatelet therapy, and the total number of medications. They were present among all individually assessed PPI types and were dose dependent. Duration of PPI exposure was only associated with fatigue severity.Residual confounding and inability to assess causal relationships.PPI use is independently associated with fatigue and lower HRQoL among kidney transplant recipients. PPI use might be an easily accessible target for alleviating fatigue and improving HRQoL among kidney transplant recipients. Further studies examining the effect of PPI exposure in this population are warranted.In this observational study, we investigated the association of proton pump inhibitors with fatigue and health-related quality of life among kidney transplant recipients. Our data showed that proton pump inhibitors were independently associated with fatigue severity, severe fatigue, and lower physical and mental health-related quality of life. These associations were present among all individually assessed proton pump inhibitor types and were dose dependent. While we await future studies on this topic, proton pump inhibitor use might be an easily accessible target for alleviating fatigue and improving health-related quality of life among kidney transplant recipients.",American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation,2023,Tim J Knobbe; Daan Kremer; Rianne M Douwes; Michele F Eisenga; António W Gomes-Neto; Coby Annema; J Casper Swarte; Frank Klont; Gerjan Navis; Stefan P Berger; Stephan J L Bakker; 
35711028,The Immune System and Depression: From Epidemiological to Clinical Evidence.,"Depression is a frequent mental disorder with a substantial contribution to years lived with disability worldwide. In the search for new treatment targets, the immune system's contribution to the pathogenesis of depression has received increased attention as immune activation has been associated with depression in various epidemiological and case-control studies. Epidemiological studies have shown that immune exposures such as severe infections and autoimmune disorders increase the risk of depression. Furthermore, immune system activation has been indicated in case-control studies of depression revealing higher levels of key pro-inflammatory cytokines among patients with depression than healthy controls, particularly in blood and to some extent in the cerebrospinal fluid. Moreover, brain imaging studies indicate increased microglial activity during depression, and gut microbiota studies have documented alterations of gut microbiota composition to be associated with depression. Based on findings from animal and human studies, several immune-mediated molecular mechanisms have been suggested to underlie the association between increased immunological activity and depression. However, the research is challenged by the heterogeneity of the depression diagnosis and - to some extent - the precision of currently available technology for immune biomarker quantification, particularly regarding the assessment of low-grade neuroinflammation. Nonetheless, an enhanced understanding of the complex interactions between the immune system and the brain in the context of depression could pave the way for precision medicine approaches with immune-modulating treatment as a promising additional option in the treatment of depression.",Current topics in behavioral neurosciences,2023,Nina Vindegaard Sørensen; Michael Eriksen Benros
36937822,Bone fragility during the COVID-19 pandemic: the role of macro- and micronutrients.,"Bone fragility is the susceptibility to fracture due to poor bone strength. This condition is usually associated with aging, comorbidities, disability, poor quality of life, and increased mortality. International guidelines for the management of patients with bone fragility include a nutritional approach, mainly aiming at optimal protein, calcium, and vitamin D intakes. Several biomechanical features of the skeleton, such as bone mineral density (BMD), trabecular and cortical microarchitecture, seem to be positively influenced by micro- and macronutrient intake. Patients with major fragility fractures are usually poor consumers of dairy products, fruit, and vegetables as well as of nutrients modulating gut microbiota. The COVID-19 pandemic has further aggravated the health status of patients with skeletal fragility, also in terms of unhealthy dietary patterns that might adversely affect bone health. In this narrative review, we discuss the role of macro- and micronutrients in patients with bone fragility during the COVID-19 pandemic.",Therapeutic advances in musculoskeletal disease,2023,Antimo Moretti; Sara Liguori; Marco Paoletta; Silvia Migliaccio; Giuseppe Toro; Francesca Gimigliano; Giovanni Iolascon
37156128,Comparison of gut microbiome profile in patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls - A plausible non-invasive biomarker?,"The human gut microbiome regulates brain function through the microbiome-gut-brain axis and is implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the relationship between the gut microbiome and the pathogenesis of schizophrenia (SCZ) is poorly defined, and very few studies have examined the effect of antipsychotic treatment response. We aim to study the differences in the gut microbiota among drug-naïve (DN SCZ) and risperidone-treated SCZ patients (RISP SCZ), compared to healthy controls (HCs). We recruited a total of 60 participants, from the clinical services of a large neuropsychiatric hospital, which included DN SCZ, RISP SCZ and HCs (n = 20 each). Fecal samples were analyzed using 16s rRNA sequencing in this cross-sectional study. No significant differences were found in taxa richness (alpha diversity) but microbial composition differed between SCZ patients (both DN and RISP) and HCs (PERMANOVA, p = 0.02). Linear Discriminant Analysis Effect Size (LEfSe) and Random Forest model identified the top six genera, which significantly differed in abundance between the study groups. A specific genus-level microbial panel of Ruminococcus, UCG005, Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 and Bifidobacterium could discriminate SCZ patients from HCs with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.79, HCs vs DN SCZ (AUC: 0.68), HCs vs RISP SCZ (AUC: 0.93) and DN SCZ vs RISP SCZ (AUC: 0.87). Our study identified distinct microbial signatures that could aid in the differentiation of DN SCZ, RISP SCZ, and HCs. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the role of the gut microbiome in SCZ pathophysiology and suggest potential targeted interventions.",Journal of psychiatric research,2023,Kuppan Gokulakrishnan; Joyappa Nikhil; Biju Viswanath; Chinnasamy Thirumoorthy; Sandhya Narasimhan; Bharanidharan Devarajan; Ebin Joseph; Arul Kevin Daniel David; Sapna Sharma; Kavitha Vasudevan; Vanteemar S Sreeraj; Bharath Holla; Venkataram Shivakumar; Monojit Debnath; Ganesan Venkatasubramanian; Shivarama Varambally
36693863,Data-independent acquisition boosts quantitative metaproteomics for deep characterization of gut microbiota.,"Metaproteomics can provide valuable insights into the functions of human gut microbiota (GM), but is challenging due to the extreme complexity and heterogeneity of GM. Data-independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry (MS) has been an emerging quantitative technique in conventional proteomics, but is still at the early stage of development in the field of metaproteomics. Herein, we applied library-free DIA (directDIA)-based metaproteomics and compared the directDIA with other MS-based quantification techniques for metaproteomics on simulated microbial communities and feces samples spiked with bacteria with known ratios, demonstrating the superior performance of directDIA by a comprehensive consideration of proteome coverage in identification as well as accuracy and precision in quantification. We characterized human GM in two cohorts of clinical fecal samples of pancreatic cancer (PC) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). About 70,000 microbial proteins were quantified in each cohort and annotated to profile the taxonomic and functional characteristics of GM in different diseases. Our work demonstrated the utility of directDIA in quantitative metaproteomics for investigating intestinal microbiota and its related disease pathogenesis.",NPJ biofilms and microbiomes,2023,Jinzhi Zhao; Yi Yang; Hua Xu; Jianxujie Zheng; Chengpin Shen; Tian Chen; Tao Wang; Bing Wang; Jia Yi; Dan Zhao; Enhui Wu; Qin Qin; Li Xia; Liang Qiao
37956855,"Role of the gut-brain axis via the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve in stress resilience of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine in mice exposed to chronic restrain stress.","3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is the most widely used illicit substance worldwide. Nevertheless, recent observational studies demonstrated that lifetime MDMA use among U.S. adults was associated with a lower risk of depression and suicide thoughts. We recently reported that the gut-brain axis may contribute to MDMA-induced stress resilience in mice. To further explore this, we investigated the effects of subdiaphragmatic vagotomy (SDV) in modulating the stress resilience effects of MDMA in mice subjected to chronic restrain stress (CRS). Pretreatment with MDMA (10 mg/kg/day for 14 days) blocked anhedonia-like behavior and reduced expression of synaptic proteins and brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of CRS-exposed mice. Interestingly, SDV blocked the beneficial effects of MDMA on these alterations in CRS-exposed mice. Analysis of gut microbiome revealed alterations in four measures of α-diversity between the sham + MDMA + CRS group and the SDV + MDMA + CRS group. Moreover, specific microbes differed between the vehicle + CRS group and the MDMA + CRS group, and further differences in microbial composition were observed among all four groups. Untargeted metabolomics analysis showed that SDV prevented the increase in plasma levels of three compounds [lactic acid, 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2,2,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidinol, 8-acetyl-7-hydroxyvumaline] observed in the sham + MDMA + CRS group. Interestingly, positive correlations were found between the plasma levels of two of these compounds and the abundance of several microbes across all groups. In conclusion, our data suggest that the gut-brain axis via the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve might contribute to the stress resilience of MDMA.",Neurobiology of disease,2023,Youge Qu; Akifumi Eguchi; Li Ma; Xiayun Wan; Chisato Mori; Kenji Hashimoto
37995475,Guardians of Rest? Investigating the gut microbiota in central hypersomnolence disorders.,"In recent years, there has been an increased interest in elucidating the influence of the gut microbiota on sleep physiology. The gut microbiota affects the central nervous system by modulating neuronal pathways through the neuroendocrine and immune system, the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, and various metabolic pathways. The gut microbiota can also influence circadian rhythms. In this study, we observed the gut microbiota composition of patients suffering from narcolepsy type 1, narcolepsy type 2, and idiopathic hypersomnia. We did not observe any changes in the alpha diversity of the gut microbiota among patient groups and healthy controls. We observed changes in beta diversity in accordance with Jaccard dissimilarities between the control group and groups of patients suffering from narcolepsy type 1 and idiopathic hypersomnia. Our results indicate that both these patient groups differ from controls relative to the presence of rare bacterial taxa. However, after adjustment for various confounding factors such as BMI, age, and gender, there were no statistical differences among the groups. This indicates that the divergence in beta diversity in the narcolepsy type 1 and idiopathic hypersomnia groups did not arise due to sleep disturbances.

36216056,Effects of urban particulate matter on gut microbiome and partial schizophrenia-like symptoms in mice: Evidence from shotgun metagenomic and metabolomic profiling.,"Epidemiological evidence reported that particulate matter (PM) was associated with increased schizophrenia (SCZ) risk. Disturbance of gut microbiome was involved in SCZ. However, it remains unclear whether PM induces SCZ-like symptoms and how gut microbiome regulates them. Therefore, a multi-omics animal experiment was conducted to verify how urban PM induces SCZ-like behavior and altered gut microbiota and metabolic pathways.Using a completely random design, mice were divided into three groups: PM group, control group and MK801 group, which received daily tracheal instillation of PM solution, sterile PBS solution and intraperitoneal injection of MK801 (establish SCZ model), respectively. After a 14-day intervention, feces were collected for multi-omics testing (shotgun metagenomic sequencing and untargeted metabolomic profiling), followed by open field test, tail suspension test, and passive avoidance test. Besides, fecal microbiome of PM group and control group were transplanted into ""pseudo-sterile"" mice, then behavioral tests were conducted.Similar to MK801 group, mice in PM group showed SCZ-like symptoms, including increased spontaneous activity, excitability, anxiety and decreased learning and spatial memory. PM exposure significantly increased the relative abundance of Verrucomicrobia and decreased that of Fibrobacteres et al. The metabolism pathways of estrogen signaling (estriol, 16-glucuronide-estriol and 21-desoxycortisol) and choline metabolism (phosphocholine) were significantly altered by PM exposure. Verrucomicrobia was negatively correlated with the level of estriol, which was correlated with decreased learning and spatial memory. Fibrobacteres and Deinococcus-Thermus were positively correlated with the level of phosphocholine, which was correlated with increased spontaneous activity, excitability and anxiety.

37377497,Insights into the potential benefits of triphala polyphenols toward the promotion of resilience against stress-induced depression and cognitive impairment.,"In response to environmental challenges, stress is a common reaction, but dysregulation of the stress response can lead to neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression and cognitive impairment. Particularly, there is ample evidence that overexposure to mental stress can have lasting detrimental consequences for psychological health, cognitive function, and ultimately well-being. In fact, some individuals are resilient to the same stressor. A major benefit of enhancing stress resilience in at-risk groups is that it may help prevent the onset of stress-induced mental health problems. A potential therapeutic strategy for maintaining a healthy life is to address stress-induced health problems with botanicals or dietary supplements such as polyphenols. Triphala, also known as Zhe Busong decoction in Tibetan, is a well-recognized <i>Ayurvedic</i> polyherbal medicine comprising dried fruits from three different plant species. As a promising food-sourced phytotherapy, triphala polyphenols have been used throughout history to treat a variety of medical conditions, including brain health maintenance. Nevertheless, a comprehensive review is still lacking. Here, the primary objective of this review article is to provide an overview of the classification, safety, and pharmacokinetics of triphala polyphenols, as well as recommendations for the development of triphala polyphenols as a novel therapeutic strategy for promoting resilience in susceptible individuals. Additionally, we summarize recent advances demonstrating that triphala polyphenols are beneficial to cognitive and psychological resilience by regulating 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) receptors, gut microbiota, and antioxidant-related signaling pathways. Overall, scientific exploration of triphala polyphenols is warranted to understand their therapeutic efficacy. In addition to providing novel insights into the mechanisms of triphala polyphenols for promoting stress resilience, blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability and systemic bioavailability of triphala polyphenols also need to be improved by the research community. Moreover, well-designed clinical trials are needed to increase the scientific validity of triphala polyphenols' beneficial effects for preventing and treating cognitive impairment and psychological dysfunction.",Current research in food science,2023,Wenjun Wang; Olufola Oladoyin Ige; Yi Ding; Mengshan He; Pan Long; Shaohui Wang; Yi Zhang; Xudong Wen
36624505,Safety and feasibility of faecal microbiota transplant for major depressive disorder: study protocol for a pilot randomised controlled trial.,"Mental disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD), are a leading cause of non-fatal burden of disease globally. Current conventional treatments for depression have significant limitations, and there have been few new treatments in decades. The microbiota-gut-brain-axis is now recognised as playing a role in mental and brain health, and promising preclinical and clinical data suggest Faecal Microbiota Transplants (FMT) may be efficacious for treating a range of mental illnesses. However, there are no existing published studies in humans evaluating the efficacy of FMT for MDD.This protocol describes an 8-week, triple-blind, 2:1 parallel group, randomised controlled pilot trial (n = 15), of enema-delivered FMT treatment (n = 10) compared with a placebo enema (n = 5) in adults with moderate-to-severe MDD. There will be a further 26-week follow-up to monitor longer-term safety. Participants will receive four FMT or placebo enemas over four consecutive days. The primary aims of the study are to evaluate feasibility and safety of FMT as an adjunctive treatment for MDD in adults. Changes in gut microbiota will be assessed as a secondary outcome. Other data will be collected, including changes in depression and anxiety symptoms, and safety parameters.Modification of the microbiota-gut-brain axis via FMT is a promising potential treatment for MDD, but there are no published rigorous clinical trials evaluating its use. If this study finds that our FMT strategy is safe and feasible, a larger fully powered RCT is planned.

36493975,Key role of the gut-microbiota-brain axis via the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve in demyelination of the cuprizone-treated mouse brain.,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common demyelinating disease that attacks the central nervous system. Dietary intake of cuprizone (CPZ) produces demyelination resembling that of patients with MS. Given the role of the vagus nerve in gut-microbiota-brain axis in development of MS, we performed this study to investigate whether subdiaphragmatic vagotomy (SDV) affects demyelination in CPZ-treated mice. SDV significantly ameliorated demyelination and microglial activation in the brain compared with sham-operated CPZ-treated mice. Furthermore, 16S ribosomal RNA analysis revealed that SDV significantly improved the abnormal gut microbiota composition of CPZ-treated mice. An untargeted metabolomic analysis demonstrated that SDV significantly improved abnormal blood levels of metabolites in CPZ-treated mice compared with sham-operated CPZ-treated mice. Notably, there were correlations between demyelination or microglial activation in the brain and the relative abundance of several microbiome populations, suggesting a link between gut microbiota and the brain. There were also correlations between demyelination or microglial activation in the brain and blood levels of metabolites.

36881113,Mesenchymal stem-cell-derived microvesicles ameliorate MPTP-induced neurotoxicity in mice: a role of the gut-microbiota-brain axis.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Increasing evidence suggests the role of the gut-microbiota-brain axis in the pathogenesis of PD. Mesenchymal stem-cell-derived microvesicles (MSC-MVs) have emerged as a therapeutic potential for neurological disorders over the last years.The objective of this study was to investigate whether MSC-MVs could improve PD-like neurotoxicity in mice after administration of MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine).MPTP-induced reductions in the dopamine transporter and tyrosine hydroxylase expressions in the striatum and substantia nigra (SNr) were attenuated after a subsequent single administration of MSC-MVs. Increases in the phosphorylated α-synuclein (p-α-Syn)/α-Syn ratio in the striatum, SNr, and colon after MPTP injection were also attenuated after MSC-MVs injection. Furthermore, MSC-MVs restored MPTP-induced abnormalities of the gut microbiota composition. Interestingly, positive correlations between the genus Dubosiella and the p-α-Syn/α-Syn ratio were observed in the brain and colon, suggesting their roles in the gut-microbiota-brain communication. Moreover, MSC-MVs attenuated MPTP-induced reduction of the metabolite, 3,6-dihydroxy-2-[3-methoxy-4-(sulfooxy)phenyl]-7-(sulfinooxy)-3,4-dihydro-2H-1-benzopyran-5-olate, in the blood. Interestingly, a negative correlation between this compound and the p-α-Syn/α-Syn ratio was observed in the brain and colon.These data suggest that MSC-MVs could ameliorate MPTP-induced neurotoxicity in the brain and colon via the gut-microbiota-brain axis. Therefore, MSC-MVs would have a new therapeutic potential for neurological disorders such as PD.",Psychopharmacology,2023,Yaoyu Pu; Qiuhong Wu; Qiuping Zhang; Tianwen Huang; Ji Wen; Long Wei; Kenji Hashimoto; Yi Liu
36871911,The effect of exercise on suicidal ideation and behaviors: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Although exercise may positively impact those with mental or other medical illnesses, there is a lack of understanding on how it influences suicidal ideation or risk.We conducted a PRISMA 2020-compliant systematic review searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, and PsycINFO from inception to June 21, 2022. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating exercise and suicidal ideation in subjects with mental or physical conditions were included. Random-effects meta-analysis was conducted. The primary outcome was suicidal ideation. We assessed bias of studies with risk of bias 2 tool.We identified 17 RCTs encompassing 1021 participants. Depression was the most included condition (71 %, k = 12). Mean follow up was 10.0 weeks (SD = 5.2). Post-intervention suicidal ideation (SMD = -1.09, CI -3.08-0.90, p = 0.20, k = 5) was not significantly different between exercise and control groups. Suicide attempts were significantly reduced in participants randomized to exercise interventions as compared to inactive controls (OR = 0.23, CI 0.09-0.67, p = 0.04, k = 2). Fourteen studies (82 %) were at high risk of bias.This meta-analysis is limited by few, underpowered and heterogenous studies.Overall, our meta-analysis did not find a significant decrease in suicidal ideation or mortality between exercise and control groups. However, exercise did significantly decrease suicide attempts.

37354486,Blood-borne extracellular vesicles of bacteria and intestinal cells in patients with psychotic disorders.,"Human cells and bacteria secrete extracellular vesicles (EV) which play a role in intercellular communication. EV from the host intestinal epithelium are involved in the regulation of bacterial gene expression and growth. Bacterial EV (bactEV) produced in the intestine can pass to various tissues where they deliver biomolecules to many kinds of cells, including neurons. Emerging data indicate that gut microbiota is altered in patients with psychotic disorders. We hypothesized that the amount and content of blood-borne EV from intestinal cells and bactEV in psychotic patients would differ from healthy controls.We analyzed for human intestinal proteins by proteomics, for bactEV by metaproteomic analysis, and by measuring the level of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in blood-borne EV from patients with psychotic disorders (<i>n</i> = 25), tested twice, in the acute phase of psychosis and after improvement, with age- and sex-matched healthy controls (<i>n</i> = 25).Patients with psychotic disorders had lower LPS levels in their EV compared to healthy controls (<i>p</i> = .027). Metaproteome analyses confirmed LPS finding and identified Firmicute<i>s</i> and Bacteroidetes as dominating phyla. Total amounts of human intestine proteins in EV isolated from blood was lower in patients compared to controls (<i>p</i> = .02).Our results suggest that bactEV and host intestinal EV are decreased in patients with psychosis and that this topic is worthy of further investigation given potential pathophysiological implications.

The modifiable gut microbiome might be a potential target for intervention to improve neurobiological functions through the gut-microbiome-brain axis.In this case-control study, gut microbiota of 132 patients with SCZ and increased waist circumference were compared with gut microbiota of two age- and sex-matched control groups, composed of 132 healthy individuals and 132 individuals with metabolic syndrome. Shotgun sequencing was used to characterize fecal samples at the taxonomic and functional levels. Cognition of the patients with SCZ was evaluated using the Brief Assessment of Cognition instrument.SCZ gut microbiota differed significantly from those of healthy control subjects and individuals with metabolic syndrome in terms of richness and global composition. SCZ gut microbiota were notably enriched in <i>Flavonifractor plautii</i>, <i>Collinsella aerofaciens</i>, <i>Bilophila wadsworthia</i>, and <i>Sellimonas intestinalis</i>, while depleted in <i>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</i>, <i>Ruminococcus lactaris</i>, <i>Ruminococcus bicirculans</i>, and <i>Veillonella rogosae</i>. Functional potential of the gut microbiota accounted for 11% of cognition variability. In particular, the bacterial functional module for synthesizing tyrosine, a precursor for dopamine, was in SCZ cases positively associated with cognitive score (ρ = 0.34, <i>q</i> ≤ .1).Overall, this study shows that the gut microbiome of patients with SCZ differs greatly from that of healthy control subjects or individuals with metabolic syndrome.

37233680,Positive Effects of Probiotic Therapy in Patients with Post-Infectious Fatigue.,"Post-infectious fatigue is a common complication that can lead to decreased physical efficiency, depression, and impaired quality of life. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota has been proposed as a contributing factor, as the gut-brain axis plays an important role in regulating physical and mental health. This pilot study aimed to investigate the severity of fatigue and depression, as well as the quality of life of 70 patients with post-infectious fatigue who received a multi-strain probiotic preparation or placebo in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients completed questionnaires to assess their fatigue (fatigue severity scale (FSS)), mood (Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II)), and quality of life (short form-36 (SF-36)) at baseline and after 3 and 6 months of treatment. Routine laboratory parameters were also assessed, including immune-mediated changes in tryptophan and phenylalanine metabolism. The intervention was effective in improving fatigue, mood, and quality of life in both the probiotic and placebo groups, with greater improvements seen in the probiotic group. FSS and BDI-II scores declined significantly under treatment with both probiotics and placebo, but patients who received probiotics had significantly lower FSS (<i>p</i> < 0.001) and BDI-II (<i>p</i> < 0.001) scores after 6 months. Quality of life scores improved significantly in patients who received probiotics (<i>p</i> < 0.001), while patients taking a placebo only saw improvements in the ""Physical limitation"" and ""Energy/Fatigue"" subcategories. After 6 months neopterin was higher in patients receiving placebo, while no longitudinal changes in interferon-gamma mediated biochemical pathways were observed. These findings suggest that probiotics may be a promising intervention for improving the health of patients with post-infectious fatigue, potentially through modulating the gut-brain axis.",Metabolites,2023,Katharina Obermoser; Natascha Brigo; Andrea Schroll; Pablo Monfort-Lanzas; Johanna M Gostner; Sabine Engl; Simon Geisler; Miriam Knoll; Harald Schennach; Günter Weiss; Dietmar Fuchs; Rosa Bellmann-Weiler; Katharina Kurz
36517709,Porphyra haitanensis Polysaccharides Attenuates Blood Lipid via Gut-Liver Axis in Diet-Induced High-Fat Mesocricetus auratus through Multiple Integrated Omics.,"Hyperlipidemia is currently a global public health problem severely affecting people's physical and mental health, as well as their quality of life.The present study is aimed at revealing the mechanism of Porphyra haitanensis polysaccharide (PHP) in decreasing blood lipids by acting through gut-liver axis in Mesocricetus auratus fed a high-fat diet. PHP significantly prevented increases in serum total cholesterol, triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and alleviated damage to liver cells induced by a high-fat diet M. auratus, in a dose-dependent manner. PHP promotes proliferation of Muribaculaceae and Faecalibaculum, thereby enhancing the production of butyric acid both in the colon and liver, particularly high-dose PHP (HPHP). Low-dose PHP (LPHP) promotes the expression of phosphatidylcholine metabolites and fatty acid transport genes, and inhibits the expression of genes involved in fat degradation (Abhd5), adipogenesis (Me1), fatty acid synthesis (Fasn and Pnpla3), and fatty acid chain elongation (Elovl6) in the liver. However, HPHP inhibits the expression of triglyceride metabolites and promotes the expression of fatty acid transporter (CD36), fatty acid oxidation (Acacb), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARg) genes in the liver.PHP regulates lipid metabolism through the gut microbiota, and the gut-liver axis plays an important role in its hypolipidemic effects.",Molecular nutrition & food research,2023,Hongliang Zeng; Peilin Chen; Zhiyun Wang; Xiaoke Hu; Yi Zhang; Baodong Zheng
36804535,Beneficial effects of arketamine on the reduced bone mineral density in susceptible mice after chronic social defeat stress: Role of the gut-microbiota-bone-brain axis.,"Patients with depression exhibit reduced bone mineral density (BMD). We previously reported that the new antidepressant arketamine improved the reduced BMD seen in chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) susceptible mice and ovariectomized mice. Considering the role of the gut microbiota in maintaining bone health, the current study investigated whether the gut microbiota, along with metabolites derived from the microbiome, play a role in the beneficial actions of arketamine with respect to the anhedonia-like behavior and reduced BMD seen in CSDS susceptible mice. A single administration of arketamine (10 mg/kg) ameliorated anhedonia-like behavior and decreased femoral neck cortical (and total) BMD in CSDS susceptible mice. There was a negative correlation between anhedonia-like behavior and BMD. Furthermore, significant differences in the abundance of microbiota (and plasma metabolites) were found between the CSDS + saline and CSDS + arketamine groups. Correlations were observed between the abundance of certain microbiota (and plasma metabolites) and cortical (and total) BMD. These data suggest that, in addition to its anti-anhedonia effect, arketamine might ameliorate the reduced cortical (and total) BMD seen in CSDS susceptible mice through the gut-microbiota-bone-brain axis. Therefore, arketamine could serve as a drug therapy for depressed patients with low BMD.

37291666,A comprehensive look at the psychoneuroimmunoendocrinology of spinal cord injury and its progression: mechanisms and clinical opportunities.,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating and disabling medical condition generally caused by a traumatic event (primary injury). This initial trauma is accompanied by a set of biological mechanisms directed to ameliorate neural damage but also exacerbate initial damage (secondary injury). The alterations that occur in the spinal cord have not only local but also systemic consequences and virtually all organs and tissues of the body incur important changes after SCI, explaining the progression and detrimental consequences related to this condition. Psychoneuroimmunoendocrinology (PNIE) is a growing area of research aiming to integrate and explore the interactions among the different systems that compose the human organism, considering the mind and the body as a whole. The initial traumatic event and the consequent neurological disruption trigger immune, endocrine, and multisystem dysfunction, which in turn affect the patient's psyche and well-being. In the present review, we will explore the most important local and systemic consequences of SCI from a PNIE perspective, defining the changes occurring in each system and how all these mechanisms are interconnected. Finally, potential clinical approaches derived from this knowledge will also be collectively presented with the aim to develop integrative therapies to maximize the clinical management of these patients.",Military Medical Research,2023,Miguel A Ortega; Oscar Fraile-Martinez; Cielo García-Montero; Sergio Haro; Miguel Ángel Álvarez-Mon; Diego De Leon-Oliva; Ana M Gomez-Lahoz; Jorge Monserrat; Mar Atienza-Pérez; David Díaz; Elisa Lopez-Dolado; Melchor Álvarez-Mon
36900437,Fermented Wheat Germ Alleviates Depression-like Behavior in Rats with Chronic and Unpredictable Mild Stress.,"Depression is a chronic mental illness with devastating effects on a person's physical and mental health. Studies have reported that food fermentation with probiotics can enrich the nutritional values of food and produce functional microorganisms that can alleviate depression and anxiety. Wheat germ is an inexpensive raw material that is rich in bioactive ingredients. For example, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is reported to have antidepressant effects. Several studies concluded that <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> is a GABA-producing bacteria and can alleviate depression. Herein, fermented wheat germs (FWGs) were used to treat stress-induced depression. FWG was prepared by fermenting wheat germs with <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i>. The chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model was established in rats, and these rats were treated with FWG for four weeks to evaluate the effects of FWG in relieving depression. In addition, the study also analyzed the potential anti-depressive mechanism of FWG based on behavioral changes, physiological and biochemical index changes, and intestinal flora changes in depressed rats. The results demonstrated that FWG improved depression-like behaviors and increased neurotransmitter levels in the hippocampus of CUMS model rats. In addition, FWG effectively altered the gut microbiota structure and remodeled the gut microbiota in CUMS rats, restored neurotransmitter levels in depressed rats through the brain-gut axis, and restored amino acid metabolic functions. In conclusion, we suggest that FWG has antidepressant effects, and its potential mechanism may act by restoring the disordered brain-gut axis.","Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,Zheyuan Hu; Penghui Zhao; Aimei Liao; Long Pan; Jie Zhang; Yuqi Dong; Jihong Huang; Weiwei He; Xingqi Ou
36462169,Elevated Systemic Levels of Markers Reflecting Intestinal Barrier Dysfunction and Inflammasome Activation Are Correlated in Severe Mental Illness.,"Gut microbiota alterations have been reported in severe mental illness (SMI) but fewer studies have probed for signs of gut barrier disruption and inflammation. We hypothesized that gut leakage of microbial products due to intestinal inflammation could contribute to systemic inflammasome activation in SMI.We measured plasma levels of the chemokine CCL25 and soluble mucosal vascular addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (sMAdCAM-1) as markers of T cell homing, adhesion and inflammation in the gut, lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) and intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) as markers of bacterial translocation and gut barrier dysfunction, in a large SMI cohort (n = 567) including schizophrenia (SCZ, n = 389) and affective disorder (AFF, n = 178), relative to healthy controls (HC, n = 418). We assessed associations with plasma IL-18 and IL-18BPa and leukocyte mRNA expression of NLRP3 and NLRC4 as markers of inflammasome activation.Our main findings were: (1) higher levels of sMAdCAM-1 (P = .002), I-FABP (P = 7.6E-11), CCL25 (P = 9.6E-05) and LBP (P = 2.6E-04) in SMI compared to HC in age, sex, BMI, CRP and freezer storage time adjusted analysis; (2) the highest levels of sMAdCAM-1 and CCL25 (both P = 2.6E-04) were observed in SCZ and I-FABP (P = 2.5E-10) and LBP (3) in AFF; and (3), I-FABP correlated with IL-18BPa levels and LBP correlated with NLRC4.Our findings support that intestinal barrier inflammation and dysfunction in SMI could contribute to systemic inflammation through inflammasome activation.",Schizophrenia bulletin,2023,Søren B Jensen; Mashhood A Sheikh; Ibrahim A Akkouh; Attila Szabo; Kevin S O'Connell; Tove Lekva; John A Engh; Ingrid Agartz; Torbjørn Elvsåshagen; Monica B E G Ormerod; Melissa A Weibell; Erik Johnsen; Rune A Kroken; Ingrid Melle; Ole K Drange; Terje Nærland; Arne E Vaaler; Lars T Westlye; Pål Aukrust; Srdjan Djurovic; Nils Eiel Steen; Ole A Andreassen; Thor Ueland
37447374,Serotonin Transporter (SERT) Expression Modulates the Composition of the Western-Diet-Induced Microbiota in Aged Female Mice.,"<b>Background.</b> The serotonin transporter (SERT), highly expressed in the gut and brain, is implicated in metabolic processes. A genetic variant of the upstream regulatory region of the <i>SLC6A4</i> gene encoding SERT, the so-called short (s) allele, in comparison with the long (l) allele, results in the decreased function of this transporter, altered serotonergic regulation, an increased risk of psychiatric pathology and type-2 diabetes and obesity, especially in older women. Aged female mice with the complete (<i>Sert</i><sup>-/-</sup>: KO) or partial (<i>Sert</i><sup>+/-</sup>: HET) loss of SERT exhibit more pronounced negative effects following their exposure to a Western diet in comparison to wild-type (<i>Sert</i><sup>+/+</sup>: WT) animals. <b>Aims.</b> We hypothesized that these effects might be mediated by an altered gut microbiota, which has been shown to influence serotonin metabolism. We performed V4 16S rRNA sequencing of the gut microbiota in 12-month-old WT, KO and HET female mice that were housed on a control or Western diet for three weeks. <b>Results.</b> The relative abundance of 11 genera was increased, and the abundance of 6 genera was decreased in the Western-diet-housed mice compared to the controls. There were correlations between the abundance of <i>Streptococcus</i> and <i>Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014</i> and the expression of the pro-inflammatory marker Toll-like-Receptor 4 (<i>Tlr4</i>) in the dorsal raphe, as well as the expression of the mitochondrial activity marker perixome-proliferator-activated-receptor-cofactor-1b (<i>Ppargc1b</i>) in the prefrontal cortex. Although there was no significant impact of genotype on the microbiota in animals fed with the Control diet, there were significant interactions between diet and genotype. Following FDR correction, the Western diet increased the relative abundance of <i>Intestinimonas</i> and <i>Atopostipes</i> in the KO animals, which was not observed in the other groups. <i>Erysipelatoclostridium</i> abundance was increased by the Western diet in the WT group but not in HET or KO animals. <b>Conclusions.</b> The enhanced effects of a challenge with a Western diet in SERT-deficient mice include the altered representation of several gut genera, such as <i>Intestinimonas</i>, <i>Atopostipes</i> and <i>Erysipelatoclostridium</i>, which are also implicated in serotonergic and lipid metabolism. The manipulation of these genera may prove useful in individuals with the short SERT allele.",Nutrients,2023,Mirjam Bloemendaal; Ekaterina Veniaminova; Daniel C Anthony; Anna Gorlova; Priscilla Vlaming; Adel Khairetdinova; Raymond Cespuglio; Klaus Peter Lesch; Alejandro Arias Vasquez; Tatyana Strekalova
38132705,Association of homelessness and diet on the gut microbiome: a United States-Veteran Microbiome Project (US-VMP) study.,"Military veterans account for 8% of homeless individuals living in the United States. To highlight associations between history of homelessness and the gut microbiome, we compared the gut microbiome of veterans who reported having a previous experience of homelessness to those from individuals who reported never having experienced a period of homelessness. Moreover, we examined the impact of the cumulative exposure of prior and current homelessness to understand possible associations between these experiences and the gut microbiome. Microbiome samples underwent genomic sequencing and were analyzed based on alpha diversity, beta diversity, and taxonomic differences. Additionally, demographic information, dietary data, and mental health history were collected. A lifetime history of homelessness was found to be associated with alcohol use disorder, substance use disorder, and healthy eating index compared to those without such a history. In terms of differences in gut microbiota, beta diversity was significantly different between veterans who had experienced homelessness and veterans who had never been homeless (<i>P</i> = 0.047, weighted UniFrac), while alpha diversity was similar. The microbial community differences were, in part, driven by a lower relative abundance of <i>Akkermansia</i> in veterans who had experienced homelessness (mean; range [in percentages], 1.07; 0-33.9) compared to veterans who had never been homeless (2.02; 0-36.8) (<i>P</i> = 0.014, ancom-bc2).

36710917,Metagenomic data reveals microbiome characteristics of culture-negative brain abscess samples.,"A brain abscess is a focal collection of pus in the brain parenchyma surrounded by a well-vascularized collagenous capsule in response to an infection. The microbiome of brain abscesses has been shown to be polymicrobial, dominated by uncultivable and anaerobic organisms of odontogenic origin. The data provided in this article includes the sequences of bacterial 16S rRNA gene from three culture-negative brain abscess samples suspected to have poly-microbial aetiology based on Sanger sequencing. DNA was extracted from brain abscess samples, and targeted-metagenomics sequencing was done by amplifying the full-length bacterial 16S rRNA followed by a nested PCR for V3-V4 regions using universal and specific primers. The barcoded amplicons were sequenced on Illumina MiSeq V2 instrument to generate 0.5M, 250bp paired-end reads/sample. The total sequencing reads were 455966, 345746, and 438658 for samples P32, P49, and P8, respectively. Bioinformatics tools such as FLASH, VSEARCH, and QIIME1 were used to process the reads generated for Operational Taxonomic Unit analysis (OTU). Bacterial species belonging to phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Fusobacteria were abundant in samples P49 and P8, which are mainly anaerobic and microaerophilic bacteria. These are typical of the human oral/gut microbiota and are implicated in brain abscess formation. Sample P32 showed the abundance of bacterial species belonging to phyla Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, which are commonly found in the environment. Raw data files are available at the Sequence Read Archive (SRA), National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), and data information can be found at the BioProject, PRJNA785100 under the accession numbers SRX13271109, SRX13271110, SRX13295897.

37181872,Autism spectrum disorder research: knowledge mapping of progress and focus between 2011 and 2022.,"In recent years, a large number of studies have focused on autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The present study used bibliometric analysis to describe the state of ASD research over the past decade and identify its trends and research fronts.Studies on ASD published from 2011 to 2022 were obtained from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC). Bibliometrix, CiteSpace, and VOSviewer were used for bibliometric analysis.A total of 57,108 studies were included in the systematic search, and articles were published in more than 6,000 journals. The number of publications increased by 181.7% (2,623 in 2011 and 7,390 in 2021). The articles in the field of genetics are widely cited in immunology, clinical research, and psychological research. Keywords co-occurrence analysis revealed that ""causative mechanisms,"" ""clinical features,"" and ""intervention features"" were the three main clusters of ASD research. Over the past decade, genetic variants associated with ASD have gained increasing attention, and immune dysbiosis and gut microbiota are the new development frontiers after 2015.This study uses a bibliometric approach to visualize and quantitatively describe autism research over the last decade. Neuroscience, genetics, brain imaging studies, and gut microbiome studies improve our understanding of autism. In addition, the microbe-gut-brain axis may be an exciting research direction for ASD in the future. Therefore, through visual analysis of autism literature, this paper shows the development process, research hotspots, and cutting-edge trends in this field to provide theoretical reference for the development of autism in the future.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2023,Miaomiao Jiang; Tianlan Lu; Kang Yang; Xianjing Li; Liyang Zhao; Dai Zhang; Jun Li; Lifang Wang

A cross-over design allowed each group to receive probiotics and placebo for 3  months each in reverse order. A small subset of participants was examined online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. After 6  months a small number of volunteers were additionally assessed after 2  months without any intervention. Primary outcome measures included changes in cognitive functions assessed using brief tests and a neuropsychological battery and changes in mood assessed using validated questionnaires. Secondary outcome measures included changes in self-report and subjective measures using depression and anxiety questionnaires, seven visual analog scales of subjective feelings (memory, digestion, etc.), and physical performance.At baseline, the probiotic-placebo group A (<i>n</i> = 40, age 69 ± 7 years, education 16 ± 3 years, 63% females, body mass index 28.5 ± 6, subjective memory complaint in 43%) did not differ from the placebo-probiotic group B (<i>n</i> = 32) in any of the sociodemographic characteristics and evaluated measures including cognitive status. At follow-up visits after 3, 6, and 8  months, no cross-sectional differences in any of the measures were found between the groups except worse sentence recall of the ALBA test after 3  months of probiotic use. Score changes were not observed for all cognitive tests but one in any group between visits 1 and 3 and between visits 3 and 6. The only change was observed for the TMT B test after the first three months but no change was observed after the second three months.The treatment with human probiotics and prebiotics did not improve cognitive, affective, or physical measures in community-dwelling individuals with normal or mildly impaired cognitive functions.clinicaltrials.gov, identifier NCT05051501.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2023,Ales Bartos; Josefina Weinerova; Sofia Diondet

This study explored the potential anti-depressant effects of ginsenoside Rh4 and its mechanisms of action. The results showed that Rh4 could significantly inhibit depression-like behavior in the depression mouse model and alleviate neuronal damage and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis disorder. Concurrently, Rh4 inhibits hippocampal neuronal apoptosis and synaptic structural damage due to the overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines and overactivation of microglia and astrocytes by inhibiting the immune-inflammatory response and signaling molecular interaction pathways. Rh4 can also improve intestinal flora and increase the short-chain fatty-acids content. The correlation analysis indicated that the Rh4-inhibited LPS/NLRP3/caspase-1/IL-1β signaling pathway plays a key role in ameliorating depression. Therefore, this study provides valuable insights into the mode of action of Rh4 on the brain-gut axis in depression, suggesting that Rh4 may be a promising clinical drug for the treatment of depression.",Food chemistry,2023,Jingjing Shao; Xiaoxuan Ma; Linlin Qu; Pei Ma; Rong Huang; Daidi Fan

37627638,Multi-Omics Approach Reveals Prebiotic and Potential Antioxidant Effects of Essential Oils from the Mediterranean Diet on Cardiometabolic Disorder Using Humanized Gnotobiotic Mice.,"Essential oils sourced from herbs commonly used in the Mediterranean diet have demonstrated advantageous attributes as nutraceuticals and prebiotics within a model of severe cardiometabolic disorder. The primary objective of this study was to assess the influences exerted by essential oils derived from thyme (<i>Thymus vulgaris</i>) and oregano (<i>Origanum vulgare</i>) via a comprehensive multi-omics approach within a gnotobiotic murine model featuring colonic microbiota acquired from patients diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD) and type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Our findings demonstrated prebiotic and potential antioxidant effects elicited by these essential oils. We observed a substantial increase in the relative abundance of the <i>Lactobacillus</i> genus in the gut microbiota, accompanied by higher levels of short-chain fatty acids and a reduction in trimethylamine N-oxide levels and protein oxidation in the plasma. Moreover, functional enrichment analysis of the cardiac tissue proteome unveiled an over-representation of pathways related to mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, and cardiac contraction. These findings provide compelling evidence of the prebiotic and antioxidant actions of thyme- and oregano-derived essential oils, which extend to cardiac function. These results encourage further investigation into the promising utility of essential oils derived from herbs commonly used in the Mediterranean diet as potential nutraceutical interventions for mitigating chronic diseases linked to CAD and T2DM.","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,María José Sánchez-Quintero; Josué Delgado; Laura Martín Chaves; Dina Medina-Vera; Mora Murri; Víctor M Becerra-Muñoz; Mario Estévez; María G Crespo-Leiro; Guillermo Paz López; Andrés González-Jiménez; Juan A G Ranea; María Isabel Queipo-Ortuño; Isaac Plaza-Andrades; Jorge Rodríguez-Capitán; Francisco Javier Pavón-Morón; Manuel F Jiménez-Navarro
37469436,"Exopolysaccharide is the potential effector of <i>Lactobacillus fermentum</i> PS150, a hypnotic psychobiotic strain.","Psychobiotics are a class of probiotics that confer beneficial effects on the mental health of the host. We have previously reported hypnotic effects of a psychobiotic strain, <i>Lactobacillus fermentum</i> PS150 (PS150), which significantly shortens sleep latency in experimental mice, and effectively ameliorate sleep disturbances caused by either caffeine consumption or a novel environment. In the present study, we discovered a <i>L. fermentum</i> strain, GR1009, isolated from the same source of PS150, and found that GR1009 is phenotypically distinct but genetically similar to PS150. Compared with PS150, GR1009 have no significant hypnotic effects in the pentobarbital-induced sleep test in mice. In addition, we found that heat-killed PS150 exhibited hypnotic effects and altered the gut microbiota in a manner similar to live bacteria, suggesting that a heat-stable effector, such as exopolysaccharide (EPS), could be responsible for these effects. Our comparative genomics analysis also revealed distinct genetic characteristics in EPS biosynthesis between GR1009 and PS150. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy imaging showed a sheet-like EPS structure in PS150, while GR1009 displayed no apparent EPS structure. Using the phenol-sulfate assay, we found that the sugar content value of the crude extract containing EPS (C-EPS) from PS150 was approximately five times higher than that of GR1009, indicating that GR1009 has a lower EPS production activity than PS150. Through the pentobarbital-induced sleep test, we confirmed the hypnotic effects of the C-EPS isolated from PS150, as evidenced by a significant reduction in sleep latency and recovery time following oral administration in mice. In summary, we utilized a comparative approach to delineate differences between PS150 and GR1009 and proposed that EPS may serve as a key factor that mediates the observed hypnotic effect.",Frontiers in microbiology,2023,Chin-Lin Huang; Hsu-Feng Chu; Chien-Chen Wu; Fu-Sheng Deng; Pei-Jun Wen; Shao-Ping Chien; Chi-Hsein Chao; Ying-Tsong Chen; Mei-Kuang Lu; Ying-Chieh Tsai
37400661,Isoalantolactone relieves depression-like behaviors in mice after chronic social defeat stress via the gut-brain axis.,"The management of depression continues to be challenging despite the variety of available antidepressants. Herbal medicines are used in many cultures but lack stringent testing to understand their efficacy and mechanism of action. Isoalantolactone (LAT) from Elecampane (Inula helenium) improved the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS)-induced anhedonia-like phenotype in mice comparable to fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).Compare the effects of LAT and fluoxetine on depression-like behaviors in mice exposed to CSDS.The CSDS-induced decrease in protein expression of postsynaptic density (PSD95), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and glutamate receptor subunit-1 (GluA1) in the prefrontal cortex was restored by LAT. LAT showed robust anti-inflammatory activity and can lessen the increase in IL-6 and TNF-α caused by CSDS. CSDS altered the gut microbiota at the taxonomic level, resulting in significant changes in α- and β-diversity. LAT treatment reestablished the bacterial abundance and diversity and increased the production of butyric acid in the gut that was inhibited by CSDS. The levels of butyric acid were negatively correlated with the abundance of Bacteroidetes, and positively correlated with those of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes across all treatment groups.The current data suggest that, similar to fluoxetine, LAT show antidepressant-like effects in mice exposed to CSDS through the modulation of the gut-brain axis.",Psychopharmacology,2023,Siming Wang; Qihan Cai; Lu Xu; Yanan Sun; Mengmeng Wang; Yu Wang; Lili Zhang; Keqing Li; Zhiyu Ni

37294054,EphB6 deficiency in intestinal neurons promotes tumor growth in colorectal cancer by neurotransmitter GABA signaling.,"EphB6 belongs to the receptor tyrosine kinase, whose low expression is associated with shorter survival of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. But the role and mechanism of EphB6 in the progression of CRC need further study. In addition, EphB6 was mainly expressed in intestinal neurons. But how EphB6 is involved in functions of intestinal neurons has not been known. In our study, we constructed a mouse xenograft model of CRC by injecting CMT93 cells into the rectum of EphB6-deficient mice. We found that the deletion of EphB6 in mice promoted tumor growth of CMT93 cells in a xenograft model of CRC, which was independent of changes in the gut microbiota. Interestingly, inhibition of intestinal neurons by injecting botulinum toxin A into rectum of EphB6-deficient mice could eliminate the promotive effect of EphB6 deficiency on tumor growth in the xenograft model of CRC. Mechanically, the deletion of EphB6 in mice promoted the tumor growth in CRC by increasing GABA in the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, EphB6 deficiency in mice increased the expression of synaptosomal-associated protein 25 in the intestinal myenteric plexus, which mediated the release of GABA. Our study concluded that EphB6 knockout in mice promotes tumor growth of CMT93 cells in a xenograft model of CRC by modulating GABA release. Our study found a new regulating mechanism of EphB6 on the tumor progression in CRC that is dependent on intestinal neurons.",Carcinogenesis,2023,Hao Yu; Xiao-Kang Qin; Kai-Wen Yin; Zi-Ming Li; En-De Ni; Jian-Ming Yang; Xun-Hua Liu; Ai-Jun Zhou; Shu-Ji Li; Tian-Ming Gao; Ying Li; Jian-Ming Li

38406183,"Gut microbiota, nutrition, and mental health.","The human brain remains one of the greatest challenges for modern medicine, yet it is one of the most integral and sometimes overlooked aspects of medicine. The human brain consists of roughly 100 billion neurons, 100 trillion neuronal connections and consumes about 20-25% of the body's energy. Emerging evidence highlights that insufficient or inadequate nutrition is linked to an increased risk of brain health, mental health, and psychological functioning compromise. A core component of this relationship includes the intricate dynamics of the brain-gut-microbiota (BGM) system, which is a progressively recognized factor in the sphere of mental/brain health. The bidirectional relationship between the brain, gut, and gut microbiota along the BGM system not only affects nutrient absorption and utilization, but also it exerts substantial influence on cognitive processes, mood regulation, neuroplasticity, and other indices of mental/brain health. Neuroplasticity is the brain's capacity for adaptation and neural regeneration in response to stimuli. Understanding neuroplasticity and considering interventions that enhance the remarkable ability of the brain to change through experience constitutes a burgeoning area of research that has substantial potential for improving well-being, resilience, and overall brain health through optimal nutrition and lifestyle interventions. The nexus of lifestyle interventions and both academic and clinical perspectives of nutritional neuroscience emerges as a potent tool to enhance patient outcomes, proactively mitigate mental/brain health challenges, and improve the management and treatment of existing mental/brain health conditions by championing health-promoting dietary patterns, rectifying nutritional deficiencies, and seamlessly integrating nutrition-centered strategies into clinical care.",Frontiers in nutrition,2024,Gia Merlo; Gabrielle Bachtel; Steven G Sugden
38278378,Fermented foods: Harnessing their potential to modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis for mental health.,"Over the past two decades, whole food supplementation strategies have been leveraged to target mental health. In addition, there has been increasing attention on the ability of gut microbes, so called psychobiotics, to positively impact behaviour though the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Fermented foods offer themselves as a combined whole food microbiota modulating intervention. Indeed, they contain potentially beneficial microbes, microbial metabolites and other bioactives, which are being harnessed to target the microbiota-gut-brain axis for positive benefits. This review highlights the diverse nature of fermented foods in terms of the raw materials used and type of fermentation employed, and summarises their potential to shape composition of the gut microbiota, the gut to brain communication pathways including the immune system and, ultimately, modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Throughout, we identify knowledge gaps and challenges faced in designing human studies for investigating the mental health-promoting potential of individual fermented foods or components thereof. Importantly, we also suggest solutions that can advance understanding of the therapeutic merit of fermented foods to modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis.",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,2024,Ramya Balasubramanian; Elizabeth Schneider; Eoin Gunnigle; Paul D Cotter; John F Cryan
38972900,Humid heat environment causes anxiety-like disorder via impairing gut microbiota and bile acid metabolism in mice.,"Climate and environmental changes threaten human mental health, but the impacts of specific environmental conditions on neuropsychiatric disorders remain largely unclear. Here, we show the impact of a humid heat environment on the brain and the gut microbiota using a conditioned housing male mouse model. We demonstrate that a humid heat environment can cause anxiety-like behaviour in male mice. Microbial 16 S rRNA sequencing analysis reveals that a humid heat environment caused gut microbiota dysbiosis (e.g., decreased abundance of Lactobacillus murinus), and metabolomics reveals an increase in serum levels of secondary bile acids (e.g., lithocholic acid). Moreover, increased neuroinflammation is indicated by the elevated expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the serum and cortex, activated PI3K/AKT/NF-κB signalling and a microglial response in the cortex. Strikingly, transplantation of the microbiota from mice reared in a humid heat environment readily recapitulates these abnormalities in germ-free mice, and these abnormalities are markedly reversed by Lactobacillus murinus administration. Human samples collected during the humid heat season also show a decrease in Lactobacillus murinus abundance and an increase in the serum lithocholic acid concentration. In conclusion, gut microbiota dysbiosis induced by a humid heat environment drives the progression of anxiety disorders by impairing bile acid metabolism and enhancing neuroinflammation, and probiotic administration is a potential therapeutic strategy for these disorders.",Nature communications,2024,Huandi Weng; Li Deng; Tianyuan Wang; Huachong Xu; Jialin Wu; Qinji Zhou; Lingtai Yu; Boli Chen; Li'an Huang; Yibo Qu; Libing Zhou; Xiaoyin Chen
38353184,Stressed to the Core: Inflammation and Intestinal Permeability Link Stress-Related Gut Microbiota Shifts to Mental Health Outcomes.,"Stress levels are surging, alongside the incidence of stress-related psychiatric disorders. Perhaps a related phenomenon, especially in urban areas, the human gut contains fewer bacterial species than ever before. Although the functional implications of this absence are unclear, one consequence may be reduced stress resilience. Preclinical and clinical evidence has shown how stress exposure can alter the gut microbiota and their metabolites, affecting host physiology. Also, stress-related shifts in the gut microbiota jeopardize tight junctions of the gut barrier. In this context, bacteria and bacterial products can translocate from the gut to the bloodstream, lymph nodes, and other organs, thereby modifying systemic inflammatory responses. Heightened circulating inflammation can be an etiological factor in stress-related psychiatric disorders, including some cases of depression. In this review, we detail preclinical and clinical evidence that traces these brain-to-gut-to-brain pathways that underlie stress-related psychiatric disorders and potentially affect their responsivity to conventional psychiatric medications. We also review evidence for interventions that modulate the gut microbiota (e.g., antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics) to reduce stress responses and psychiatric symptoms.

38582087,Gut bacteria-driven homovanillic acid alleviates depression by modulating synaptic integrity.,"The gut-brain axis is implicated in depression development, yet its underlying mechanism remains unclear. We observed depleted gut bacterial species, including Bifidobacterium longum and Roseburia intestinalis, and the neurotransmitter homovanillic acid (HVA) in individuals with depression and mouse depression models. Although R. intestinalis does not directly produce HVA, it enhances B. longum abundance, leading to HVA generation. This highlights a synergistic interaction among gut microbiota in regulating intestinal neurotransmitter production. Administering HVA, B. longum, or R. intestinalis to mouse models with chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) and corticosterone (CORT)-induced depression significantly improved depressive symptoms. Mechanistically, HVA inhibited synaptic autophagic death by preventing excessive degradation of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) and SQSTM1/p62 proteins, protecting hippocampal neurons' presynaptic membrane. These findings underscore the role of the gut microbial metabolism in modulating synaptic integrity and provide insights into potential novel treatment strategies for depression.",Cell metabolism,2024,Mingliang Zhao; Zhenxing Ren; Aihua Zhao; Yajun Tang; Junliang Kuang; Mengci Li; Tianlu Chen; Shouli Wang; Jieyi Wang; Huiheng Zhang; Jijun Wang; Tianhong Zhang; Jiahui Zeng; Xiaohua Liu; Guoxiang Xie; Penghong Liu; Ning Sun; Tianhao Bao; Tongtong Nie; Jingchao Lin; Ping Liu; Yuanyi Zheng; Xiaojiao Zheng; Tiemin Liu; Wei Jia

Herein, we conducted a multi-omics analysis of fecal and blood samples obtained from an observational cohort including MDD patients (n = 99) and healthy control (HC, n = 50). 16S rRNA sequencing of gut microbiota showed structural alterations in MDD, as characterized by increased Enterococcus. Metagenomics sequencing of gut microbiota showed substantial functional alterations including upregulation in the superpathway of the glyoxylate cycle and fatty acid degradation and downregulation in various metabolic pathways in MDD. Plasma metabolomics revealed decreased amino acids and bile acids, together with increased sphingolipids and cholesterol esters in MDD. Notably, metabolites involved in arginine and proline metabolism were decreased while sphingolipid metabolic pathway were increased. Mass cytometry analysis of blood immune cell subtypes showed rises in proinflammatory immune subsets and declines in anti-inflammatory immune subsets in MDD. Furthermore, our findings revealed disease severity-related factors of MDD. Interestingly, we classified MDD into two immune subtypes that were highly correlated with disease relapse. Moreover, we established discriminative signatures that differentiate MDD from HC.

37914097,Priming of microglia with dysfunctional gut microbiota impairs hippocampal neurogenesis and fosters stress vulnerability of mice.,"Mental disorders may be involved in neuroinflammatory processes that are triggered by gut microbiota. How gut microbiota influence microglia-mediated sensitivity to stress remains unclear. Here we explored in an animal model of depression whether disruption of the gut microbiome primes hippocampal microglia, thereby impairing neurogenesis and sensitizing to stress.Male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) for 4 weeks, and effects on gut microbiota were assessed using 16S rRNA sequencing. Fecal microbiota was transplanted from control or CUMS mice into naïve animals. The depression-like behaviors of recipients were evaluated in a forced swimming test and sucrose preference test. The morphology and phenotype of microglia in the hippocampus of recipients were examined using immunohistochemistry, quantitative PCR, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The recipients were treated with lipopolysaccharide or chronic stress exposure, and effects were evaluated on behavior, microglial responses and hippocampal neurogenesis. Finally, we explored the ability of minocycline to reverse the effects of CUMS on hippocampal neurogenesis and stress sensitivity in recipients.CUMS altered the gut microbiome, leading to higher relative abundance of some bacteria (Helicobacter, Bacteroides, and Desulfovibrio) and lower relative abundance of some bacteria (Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Akkermansia). Fecal microbiota transplantation from CUMS mice to naïve animals induced microglial priming in the dentate gyrus of recipients. This microglia showed hyper-ramified morphology, and became more sensitive to LPS challenge or chronic stress, which characterized by more significant morphological changes and inflammatory responses, as well as impaired hippocampal neurogenesis and increased depressive-like behaviors. Giving minocycline to recipients reversed these effects of fecal transplantation.These findings suggest that gut microbiota from stressed animals can induce microglial priming in the dentate gyrus, which is associated with a hyper-immune response to stress and impaired hippocampal neurogenesis. Remodeling the gut microbiome or inhibiting microglial priming may be strategies to reduce sensitivity to stress.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2024,Hui He; Haili He; Li Mo; Zili You; Jinqiang Zhang

38421082,Unraveling the gut-brain connection: The association of microbiota-linked structural brain biomarkers with behavior and mental health.,"The gut microbiota can influence human behavior. However, due to the massive multiple-testing problem, research into the relationship between microbiome ecosystems and the human brain faces drawbacks. This problem arises when attempting to correlate thousands of gut bacteria with thousands of brain voxels.We performed brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans on 133 participants and applied machine-learning algorithms (Ridge regressions) combined with permutation tests. Using this approach, we were able to correlate specific gut bacterial families with brain MRI signals, circumventing the difficulties of massive multiple testing while considering sex, age, and body mass index as confounding factors.The relative abundance (RA) of the Selenomonadaceae, Clostridiaceae, and Veillonellaceae families in the gut was associated with altered cerebellar, visual, and frontal T2-mapping and diffusion tensor imaging measures. Conversely, decreased relative abundance of the Eubacteriaceae family was also linked to T2-mapping values in the cerebellum. Significantly, the brain regions associated with the gut microbiome were also correlated with depressive symptoms and attentional deficits.Our analytical strategy offers a promising approach for identifying potential brain biomarkers influenced by gut microbiota. By gathering a deeper understanding of the microbiota-brain connection, we can gain insights into the underlying mechanisms and potentially develop targeted interventions to mitigate the detrimental effects of dysbiosis on brain function and mental health.",Psychiatry and clinical neurosciences,2024,Oren Contreras-Rodriguez; Gerard Blasco; Carles Biarnés; Josep Puig; Maria Arnoriaga-Rodríguez; Clàudia Coll-Martinez; Jordi Gich; Lluís Ramió-Torrentà; Anna Motger-Albertí; Vicente Pérez-Brocal; Andrés Moya; Joaquim Radua; José Manuel Fernández-Real
37962812,Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis and Antidepressant Treatment.,"In the treatment of depressive disorders, conventional antidepressant therapy has been the mainstay of clinical management, along with well-established nonpharmacological interventions such as various kinds of psychotherapy. Over the last 2 decades, there has been considerable interest in the role of the gastrointestinal system and its microbiota on brain function, behavior, and mental health. Components of what is referred to as the microbiota-gut-brain axis have been uncovered, and further research has elicited functional capabilities such as ""gut-brain modules."" Some studies have found associations with compositional alterations of gut microbiota in patients with depressive disorders and individuals experiencing symptoms of depression. Regarding the pathogenesis and neurobiology of depression itself, there appears to be a multifactorial contribution, in addition to the theories involving deficits in catecholaminergic and monoamine neurotransmission. Interestingly, there is evidence to suggest that antidepressants may play a role in modulating the gut microbiota, thereby possibly having an impact on the microbiota-gut-brain axis in this manner. The development of prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics has led to studies investigating not only their impact on the microbiota but also their therapeutic value in mental health. These psychobiotics have the potential to be used as therapeutic adjuncts in the treatment of depression. Regarding future directions, and in an attempt to further understand the role of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in depression, more studies such as those involving fecal microbiota transplantation will be required. In addition to recent findings, it is also suggested that more research will have to be undertaken to elicit whether specific strains of gut organisms are linked to depression. In terms of further investigation of the therapeutic potential of prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics as adjuncts to antidepressant treatment, we also expect there to be more research targeting specific microorganisms, as well as a strong focus on the effects of specific prebiotic fibers from an individualized (personalized) point of view.",Current topics in behavioral neurosciences,2024,David Antoine Lachmansingh; Aonghus Lavelle; John F Cryan; Gerard Clarke
38123016,The many faces of microbiota-gut-brain axis in autism spectrum disorder.,"The gut-brain axis is gaining more attention in neurodevelopmental disorders, especially autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Many factors can influence microbiota in early life, including host genetics and perinatal events (infections, mode of birth/delivery, medications, nutritional supply, and environmental stressors). The gut microbiome can influence blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, drug bioavailability, and social behaviors. Developing microbiota-based interventions such as probiotics, gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota transplantation, or metabolite supplementation may offer an exciting approach to treating ASD. This review highlights that RNA sequencing, metabolomics, and transcriptomics data are needed to understand how microbial modulators can influence ASD pathophysiology. Due to the substantial clinical heterogeneity of ASD, medical caretakers may be unlikely to develop a broad and effective general gut microbiota modulator. However, dietary modulation followed by administration of microbiota modulators is a promising option for treating ASD-related behavioral and gastrointestinal symptoms.

It is believed that the disease primarily affects the organism through inflammatory pathways. With the aim of improving early diagnosis and targeted therapy, it is crucial to identify the specific gut microbiota associated with COVID-19 and to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying processes. The present study sought to investigate the potential causal relationship between the gut microbiota and COVID-19, and to determine the extent to which inflammatory proteins act as mediators in this relationship.Bidirectional mendelian randomization (MR) and Two-step mediated MR analyses were applied to examine causative associations among 196 gut microbiota, 91 inflammatory proteins and COVID-19. The main analytical method used in the MR was the random effects inverse variance weighted (IVW) method. This was complemented by the Bayesian weighted Mendelian randomization (BWMR) method, which was utilized to test the hypothesis of MR. In order for the results to be deemed reliable, statistical significance was required for both methods. Validation was then carried out using an external dataset, and further meta-analyses were conducted to authenticate that the association was reliable.Results of our research indicated that seven gut microbiota were actively associated to the COVID-19 risk. Five inflammatory proteins were associated with COVID-19 risk, of which three were positively and two were negatively identified with COVID-19. Further validation was carried out using sensitivity analyses. Mediated MR results revealed that CCL2 was a possible mediator of causality of family Bifidobacteriaceae and order Bifidobacteriales with COVID-19, mediating at a ratio of 12.73%.Suggesting a genetic causation between specific gut microbiota and COVID-19, our present research emphasizes the underlying mediating role of CCL2, an inflammatory factor, and contributes to a deeper understanding of the mechanism of action underlying COVID-19.",Frontiers in immunology,2024,Yuling Chen; Chang Chen

Therefore, attention to the studies of the pathogenesis of the disease in order to find novel ways of early diagnosis and treatment is increasing among the scientific and medical communities. Special attention is drawn to a biomarker and therapeutic strategy through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. It is known that the symbiotic interactions between the gut microbes and the host can affect mental health. The review analyzes the mechanisms and ways of action of the gut microbiota on the pathophysiology of depression. The possibility of using knowledge about the taxonomic composition and metabolic profile of the microbiota of patients with depression to select gene compositions (metagenomic signature) as biomarkers of the disease is evaluated. The use of in silico technologies (machine learning) for the diagnosis of depression based on the biomarkers of the gut microbiota is given. Alternative approaches to the treatment of depression are being considered by balancing the microbial composition through dietary modifications and the use of additives, namely probiotics, postbiotics (including vesicles) and prebiotics as psychobiotics, and fecal transplantation. The bacterium <i>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</i> is under consideration as a promising new-generation probiotic and auxiliary diagnostic biomarker of depression.

38576868,Bipolar disorder and the gut microbiota: a bibliometric analysis.,"Previous studies have explored the relationship between bipolar disorder and gut microbiota. However, there has been no bibliometric analysis to summarize and analyze these publications. Our objective was to perform a bibliometric analysis to investigate the current status and frontiers of the publications in the field of the association between bipolar disorder and the gut microbiota.We retrieved publications concerning the interplay between the gut microbiota and bipolar disorder from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC). The analysis was executed using WoSCC's literature analysis tool and VOSviewer 1.6.16.In total, we identified 177 publications originating from 362 institutions across 39 countries/regions, and these articles were disseminated in 104 different journals. The most productive institutions, authors, countries/regions, and journals were Zhejiang University contributing 18 publications, Shaohua Hu authoring 12 publications, China with 53 publications, and <i>Frontiers in Psychiatry</i> with 11 publications. The first high-cited document was published in the Journal of Psychiatric Research in 2017, and authored by Evans. In this article, they found gut microbiome composition was associated with BD and its illness severity, and they concluded that targeting the gut microbiota may be helpful to develop the effective treatment for bipolar disorder. The top 5 keywords with the highest frequency except for bipolar disorder and gut microbiota were as follows: depression, inflammation, probiotic, gut-brain axis, and anxiety.In conclusion, this is the first bibliometric analysis to explore the publications in the field of the association between bipolar disorder and the gut microbiota. The main research hotspots regarding this field were the characteristics, abundance, and diversity of gut microbiome in bipolar disorder, the role of treatment and gut microbiome in bipolar disorder, microbiome-brain connections in bipolar disorder, and interventions for bipolar disorder based on microbiota composition modification.

Kefir has been shown to have many beneficial health effects; however, its effect on PCOS is unknown. This study aimed to examine the effect of kefir on the intestinal microbiota and health outcomes in PCOS. In this intervention study, 17 women with PCOS consumed 250 mL/day of kefir (containing <i>Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens</i> subsp. <i>kefiranofaciens</i>, <i>Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens</i> subsp. <i>kefirgranum</i>, <i>Lactobacillus kefiri</i>, <i>Lactobacillus acidophilus</i>, <i>Lactobacillus parakefiri</i>, <i>Lactobacillus bulgaricus</i>, <i>Lactobacillus reuteri</i>, <i>Lactobacillus casei</i>, <i>Lactobacillus fermentum</i>, <i>Lactobacillus helveticus</i>, <i>Lactococcus lactis</i>, <i>Leuconostoc mesentereoides</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium bifidum</i>, <i>Streptococcus thermophilus</i>, <i>Kluyveromyces marxianus</i>, <i>Kluyveromyces lactis</i>, <i>Acetobacter pasteurianus</i>, and <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) for 8 weeks. Food consumption and physical activity records, anthropometrical measurements, quality of life, and fecal and blood samples were taken at the study's beginning and end. Quality of life in mental health (58.8 ± 15.08; 64.0 ± 15.23, respectively) and physical function (95.00 and 100.00, respectively) categories showed a significant increase after kefir intervention (<i>p</i> < .05). Additionally, Interleukin-6 (IL-6), one of the inflammatory cytokines, significantly decreased (174.00 and 109.10 ng/L, respectively) (<i>p</i> < .05). The intestinal barrier permeability was evaluated with zonulin, and no significant change was observed. Gut microbiota analysis showed that while the relative abundance of the class Bacilli and genus <i>Lactococcus</i> significantly increased, the genus <i>Holdemania</i> decreased with kefir consumption (<i>p</i> < .05). In conclusion, kefir appears to be beneficial for improving the microbiota and some health outcomes, like reducing inflammation and improving quality of life in PCOS.

38735387,Association of intestinal anti-inflammatory drug target genes with psychiatric Disorders: A Mendelian randomization study.,"Psychiatric disorders present a substantial global public health burden with limited drug options. The gut-brain axis connects inflammatory bowel diseases and psychiatric disorders, which often have comorbidities. While some evidence hints at anti-inflammatory drugs aiding in treating psychiatric conditions, the specific effects of intestinal anti-inflammatory drugs remain unclear.This study investigates the causal effect of intestinal anti-inflammatory drug targets on psychiatric disorders. We hypothesize that these drug targets may offer new insights into the treatment and prevention of such disorders. Additionally, we explore gut microbiota's mediating role between drug target genes and psychiatric disorders.We performed two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) using summary data from existing expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and protein QTL in the brain, along with public genome-wide association studies of disease. We also explored gut microbiota's mediating effect. The statistics encompassed six psychiatric disorders involving 9,725-500,199 individuals. Colocalization analysis enhanced the MR evidence.We uncovered a causal link between TPMT (a target of olsalazine) expression in the amygdala and bipolar disorder (BD) risk (odds ratio [OR] = 1.08; P = 4.29 × 10<sup>-4</sup>). This association was observed even when the sigmoid colon and whole blood eQTL were considered as exposures. Colocalization analysis revealed a shared genetic variant (rs11751561) between TPMT expression and BD, with a posterior probability of 61.6 %. Interestingly, this causal effect was influenced by a decrease in the gut microbiota abundance of the genus Roseburia (effect proportion = 10.05 %). Moreover, elevated ACAT1 expression was associated with higher obsessive-compulsive disorder risk (OR = 1.62; P = 3.64 × 10<sup>-4</sup>; posterior probability = 3.1 %).These findings provide novel targets for the treatment of psychiatric disorders, underscore the potential of repurposing olsalazine, and emphasize the importance of TPMT and ACAT1 in future drug development.",Journal of advanced research,2024,Guorui Zhao; Zhe Lu; Yundan Liao; Yaoyao Sun; Yuyanan Zhang; Zhewei Kang; Xiaoyang Feng; Junyuan Sun; Weihua Yue

Composing the microbiota-gut-brain axis, the gut microbiota and its metabolites regulate the central nervous system through neural, endocrine and immune pathways to ensure the normal functioning of the organism, tuning individuals' health and disease status. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), the main bioactive metabolites of the gut microbiota, are involved in several neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression. SCFAs have essential effects on each component of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in depression. In the present review, the roles of major SCFAs (acetate, propionate and butyrate) in the pathophysiology of depression are summarised with respect to chronic cerebral hypoperfusion, neuroinflammation, host epigenome and neuroendocrine alterations.

Prebiotics, non-digestible food ingredients that beneficially affect the host by selectively stimulating the growth and/or activity of beneficial microorganisms, have emerged as a key modulator of this complex microbial community. This review article explores the evolution of the prebiotic concept, delineates various types of prebiotics, including fructans, galactooligosaccharides, xylooligosaccharides, chitooligosaccharides, lactulose, resistant starch, and polyphenols, and elucidates their impact on the gut microbiota composition. We delve into the mechanisms through which prebiotics exert their effects, particularly focusing on producing short-chain fatty acids and modulating the gut microbiota towards a health-promoting composition. The implications of prebiotics on human health are extensively reviewed, focusing on conditions such as obesity, inflammatory bowel disease, immune function, and mental health. The review further discusses the emerging concept of synbiotics-combinations of prebiotics and probiotics that synergistically enhance gut health-and highlights the market potential of prebiotics in response to a growing demand for functional foods. By consolidating current knowledge and identifying areas for future research, this review aims to enhance understanding of prebiotics' role in health and disease, underscoring their importance in maintaining a healthy gut microbiome and overall well-being.",International journal of molecular sciences,2024,Suyeon Yoo; Suk-Chae Jung; Kihyuck Kwak; Jun-Seob Kim

38426291,The microbiota-gut-brain axis in Huntington's disease: pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic targets.,"Huntington's disease (HD) is a currently incurable neurogenerative disorder and is typically characterized by progressive movement disorder (including chorea), cognitive deficits (culminating in dementia), psychiatric abnormalities (the most common of which is depression), and peripheral symptoms (including gastrointestinal dysfunction). There are currently no approved disease-modifying therapies available for HD, with death usually occurring approximately 10-25 years after onset, but some therapies hold promising potential. HD subjects are often burdened by chronic diarrhea, constipation, esophageal and gastric inflammation, and a susceptibility to diabetes. Our understanding of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in HD is in its infancy and growing evidence from preclinical and clinical studies suggests a role of gut microbial population imbalance (gut dysbiosis) in HD pathophysiology. The gut and the brain can communicate through the enteric nervous system, immune system, vagus nerve, and microbiota-derived-metabolites including short-chain fatty acids, bile acids, and branched-chain amino acids. This review summarizes supporting evidence demonstrating the alterations in bacterial and fungal composition that may be associated with HD. We focus on mechanisms through which gut dysbiosis may compromise brain and gut health, thus triggering neuroinflammatory responses, and further highlight outcomes of attempts to modulate the gut microbiota as promising therapeutic strategies for HD. Ultimately, we discuss the dearth of data and the need for more longitudinal and translational studies in this nascent field. We suggest future directions to improve our understanding of the association between gut microbes and the pathogenesis of HD, and other 'brain and body disorders'.",The FEBS journal,2024,Millicent N Ekwudo; Carolina Gubert; Anthony J Hannan
37307822,Brain-Gut-Microbiota Axis in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A Historical Overview and Future Directions.,"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease which is strongly associated with age. The incidence of ALS increases from the age of 40 and peaks between the ages of 65 and 70. Most patients die of respiratory muscle paralysis or lung infections within three to five years of the appearance of symptoms, dealing a huge blow to patients and their families. With aging populations, improved diagnostic methods and changes in reporting criteria, the incidence of ALS is likely to show an upward trend in the coming decades. Despite extensive researches have been done, the cause and pathogenesis of ALS remains unclear. In recent decades, large quantities of studies focusing on gut microbiota have shown that gut microbiota and its metabolites seem to change the evolvement of ALS through the brain-gut-microbiota axis, and in turn, the progression of ALS will exacerbate the imbalance of gut microbiota, thereby forming a vicious cycle. This suggests that further exploration and identification of the function of gut microbiota in ALS may be crucial to break the bottleneck in the diagnosis and treatment of this disease. Hence, the current review summarizes and discusses the latest research advancement and future directions of ALS and brain-gut-microbiota axis, so as to help relevant researchers gain correlative information instantly.",Aging and disease,2024,Shilan Chen; Xinhong Cai; Lin Lao; Yuxuan Wang; Huanxing Su; Haitao Sun
39287570,Diet and the gut microbiota-immune axis in the context of perinatal mental health: Protocol for a prospective cohort study.,"Physiological and psychosocial changes experienced by women during the perinatal period may put them at risk for postpartum mental health disturbances. Accumulating evidence suggests that dietary patterns may influence mental health through the modulation of the gut microbiota and its effects on host immune activity. Thus, targeting the gut microbiota via dietary intake could serve as both a preventative and therapeutic strategy in improving perinatal mental health.Here, we present a protocol for a prospective cohort study that primarily aims to determine if diet quality during pregnancy is protective against postpartum depression severity. Secondary objectives will examine if microbiota- and blood-based inflammatory markers may be associated with the relationship between prenatal diet quality and postpartum depression severity, as well as with associations between additional dietary and mental health outcomes.Dietary patterns and mental health symptoms will be documented in 100 pregnant women at 4 time points during pregnancy and postpartum. Participants will also provide stool and blood samples at the same time points to determine microbiota composition and predicted function and inflammatory factors, respectively.

38960582,Integrated metagenomic and metabolomic analysis reveals distinctive stage-specific gut-microbiome-derived metabolites in intracranial aneurysms.,"Our study aimed to explore the influence of gut microbiota and their metabolites on intracranial aneurysms (IA) progression and pinpoint-related metabolic biomarkers derived from the gut microbiome.We recruited 358 patients with unruptured IA (UIA) and 161 with ruptured IA (RIA) from two distinct geographical regions for conducting an integrated analysis of plasma metabolomics and faecal metagenomics. Machine learning algorithms were employed to develop a classifier model, subsequently validated in an independent cohort. Mouse models of IA were established to verify the potential role of the specific metabolite identified.Distinct shifts in taxonomic and functional profiles of gut microbiota and their related metabolites were observed in different IA stages. Notably, tryptophan metabolites, particularly indoxyl sulfate (IS), were significantly higher in plasma of RIA. Meanwhile, upregulated tryptophanase expression and indole-producing microbiota were observed in gut microbiome of RIA. A model harnessing gut-microbiome-derived tryptophan metabolites demonstrated remarkable efficacy in distinguishing RIA from UIA patients in the validation cohort (AUC=0.97). Gut microbiota depletion by antibiotics decreased plasma IS concentration, reduced IA formation and rupture in mice, and downregulated matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression in aneurysmal walls with elastin degradation reduction. Supplement of IS reversed the effect of gut microbiota depletion.Our investigation highlights the potential of gut-microbiome-derived tryptophan metabolites as biomarkers for distinguishing RIA from UIA patients. The findings suggest a novel pathogenic role for gut-microbiome-derived IS in elastin degradation in the IA wall leading to the rupture of IA.",Gut,2024,Haitao Sun; Kaijian Sun; Hao Tian; Xiheng Chen; Shixing Su; Yi Tu; Shilan Chen; Jiaxuan Wang; Meichang Peng; Meiqin Zeng; Xin Li; Yunhao Luo; Yugu Xie; Xin Feng; Zhuang Li; Xin Zhang; Xifeng Li; Yanchao Liu; Wei Ye; Zhengrui Chen; Zhaohua Zhu; Youxiang Li; Fangbo Xia; Hongwei Zhou; Chuanzhi Duan
38914414,Exploring the gut-brain Axis: Potential therapeutic impact of Psychobiotics on mental health.,"One of the most challenging and controversial issues in microbiome research is related to gut microbial metabolism and neuropsychological disorders. Psychobiotics affect human behavior and central nervous system processes via the gut-brain axis, involving neuronal, immune, and metabolic pathways. They have therapeutic potential in the treatment of several neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders such as depression, anxiety, autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, Huntington's disease, anorexia nervosa, and multiple sclerosis. However, the mechanisms underlying the interaction between psychobiotics and the abovementioned diseases need further exploration. This review focuses on the relationship between gut microbiota and its impact on neurological and neurodegenerative disorders, examining the potential of psychobiotics as a preventive and therapeutic approach, summarising recent research on the gut-brain axis and the potential beneficial effects of psychobiotics, highlighting the need for further research and investigation in this area.",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,2024,Ana-Maria Cocean; Dan Cristian Vodnar
38421192,Sleep deprivation-induced anxiety-like behaviors are associated with alterations in the gut microbiota and metabolites.,"The present study aimed to characterize the gut microbiota and serum metabolome changes associated with sleep deprivation (SD) as well as to explore the potential benefits of multi-probiotic supplementation in alleviating SD-related mental health disorders. Rats were subjected to 7 days of SD, followed by 14 days of multi-probiotics or saline administration. Open-field tests were conducted at baseline, end of SD (day 7), and after 14 days of saline or multi-probiotic gavage (day 21). Metagenomic sequencing was conducted on fecal samples, and serum metabolites were measured by untargeted liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry. At day 7, anxiety-like behaviors, including significant decreases in total movement distance (<i>P</i> = 0.0002) and staying time in the central zone (<i>P</i> = 0.021), were observed. In addition, increased levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; <i>P</i> = 0.028) and decreased levels of uridine (<i>P</i> = 0.018) and tryptophan (<i>P</i> = 0.01) were detected in rats after 7 days of SD. After SD, the richness of the gut bacterial community increased, and the levels of <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i>, <i>Muribaculum intestinale</i>, and <i>Bacteroides caecimuris</i> decreased. The changes in the host metabolism and gut microbiota composition were strongly associated with the anxiety-like behaviors caused by SD. In addition, multi-probiotic supplementation for 14 days modestly improved the anxiety-like behaviors in SD rats but significantly reduced the serum level of LPS (<i>P</i> = 0.045). In conclusion, SD induces changes in the gut microbiota and serum metabolites, which may contribute to the development of chronic inflammatory responses and affect the gut-brain axis, causing anxiety-like behaviors. Probiotic supplementation significantly reduces serum LPS, which may alleviate the influence of chronic inflammation.The disturbance in the gut microbiome and serum metabolome induced by SD may be involved in anxiety-like behaviors. Probiotic supplementation decreases serum levels of LPS, but this reduction may be insufficient for alleviating SD-induced anxiety-like behaviors.",Microbiology spectrum,2024,Nana Zhang; Xuefeng Gao; Donghao Li; Lijuan Xu; Guanzhou Zhou; Mengqi Xu; Lihua Peng; Gang Sun; Fei Pan; Yan Li; Rongrong Ren; Ruolan Huang; Yunsheng Yang; Zikai Wang
38908788,Gut microbiota dynamics and association with chronic kidney disease: A longitudinal study within the PREDIMED-Plus trial.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) represents a global health concern, disproportionately affecting the elderly with heightened cardiovascular risk. The emerging focus on the gut microbiota's role in CKD pathophysiology represents a pivotal area in nephrology; however, the evidence on this topic is limited. This observational prospective study, in the framework of the PREDIMED-Plus trial, investigates associations between gut microbiota composition and the 1-year trajectory of CKD in 343 participants aged 55-75 years with high cardiovascular risk.Kidney function was assessed at baseline and at 1-year of follow-up through the estimated glomerular filtration rate based on cystatin C (eGFR-CysC) and CKD defined by eGFR-CysC <60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. Participants were grouped based on their 1-year CKD trajectory: Group 1 maintained normal status or improved from CKD to normal, while Group 2 maintained CKD or worsened from normal to CKD. Fecal microbiota composition was assessed through 16S sequencing.We observed differences in gut microbiota composition between CKD trajectory groups. Notably, the baseline relative abundance of Lachnoclostridium and Lachnospira, both butyrate-producing genera, was lower in participants maintaining or progressing to CKD. Longitudinally, a decrease in Lachnospira abundance was associated with CKD progression. The improved Chao1 index after 1-year follow-up suggests a link between enhanced microbial richness and stable/better kidney function.The findings underscore the potential of gut microbiota analysis in non-invasively monitoring CKD, especially in older populations, and hint at future interventions targeting gut microbiota to manage CKD progression.

39375584,"Animal and plant protein intake association with mental health, tryptophan metabolites pathways, and gut microbiota in healthy women: a cross-sectional study.","Mental health is affected by tryptophane (TRP) metabolism regulation. Diet-influenced gut microbiome regulates TRP metabolism. Thus, the present study aimed to explore the relationship between type of dietary protein intake, gut microbiota, TRP metabolites homeostasis, and mental well-being in healthy women. 91 healthy females aged 18-50 were recruited based on the study protocol. Validate and reliable questionnaires assessed dietary intake and mental health. Biochemical tests and gut microbiota composition were analyzed following the manufacturer's instructions for each enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA) kit and Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) methods respectively. Regression methods were used to estimate the considered associations. The results show that in the fully adjusted model, plant protein consumption was partially inversely associated with depression risk (OR = 0.27; 95% CI: 0.06, 1.09; P = 0.06). Higher dietary animal protein intake was marginally associated with psychological distress (OR = 2.59; 95% CI: 0.91, 7.34; P = 0.07). KYN to serotonin ratio was inversely associated with animal protein consumption (ß = 1.10; 95% CI: -0.13, 2.33; P = 0.07). Firmicutes/Bacteriodetes ratio (β = -1.27 × 103, SE = 5.99 × 102, P = 0.03) was lower in the top tertile of plant protein. A partially negative correlation was found between dietary animal protein and Prevotella abundance (β = -9.20 × 1018, SE = 5.04 × 1018, P = 0.06). Overall, significant inverse associations were found between a diet high in plant protein with mental disorders, KYN levels, and Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio while adhering to higher animal protein could predispose women to psychological stress.",BMC microbiology,2024,Neda Soveid; Bahareh Barkhidarian; Mahsa Samadi; Mahsa Hatami; Fatemeh Gholami; Mir Saeid Yekaninejad; Ahmad Saedisomeolia; Maryam Karbasian; Seyed Davar Siadat; Khadijeh Mirzaei
38302874,Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction: associations with gut microbiota and genes expression of intestinal serotonergic pathway.,"Pediatric chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (PIPO) is a rare disease characterized by symptoms and radiological signs suggestive of intestinal obstruction, in the absence of lumen-occluding lesions. It results from an extremely severe impairment of propulsive motility. The intestinal endocrine system (IES) jointly with the enteric nervous system (ENS) regulates secreto-motor functions via different hormones and bioactive messengers/neurotransmitters. The neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) (or serotonin) is linked to intestinal peristalsis and secretory reflexes. Gut microbiota and its interplay with ENS affect 5-HT synthesis, release, and the subsequent serotonin receptor activation. To date, the interplay between 5-HT and gut microbiota in PIPO remains largely unclear. This study aimed to assess correlations between mucosa associated microbiota (MAM), intestinal serotonin-related genes expression in PIPO. To this purpose, biopsies of the colon, ileum and duodenum have been collected from 7 PIPO patients, and 7 age-/sex-matched healthy controls. After DNA extraction, the MAM was assessed by next generation sequencing (NGS) of the V3-V4 region of the bacterial RNA 16 S, on an Illumina Miseq platform. The expression of genes implicated in serotoninergic pathway (TPH1, SLC6A4, 5-HTR3 and 5-HTR4) was established by qPCR, and correlations with MAM and clinical parameters of PIPO have been evaluated.Our results revealed that PIPO patients exhibit a MAM with a different composition and with dysbiosis, i.e. with a lower biodiversity and fewer less connected species with a greater number of non-synergistic relationships, compared to controls. qPCR results revealed modifications in the expression of serotonin-related intestinal genes in PIPO patients, when compared to controls. Correlation analysis do not reveal any kind of connection.For the first time, we report in PIPO patients a specific MAM associated to underlying pathology and an altered intestinal serotonin pathway. A possible dysfunction of the serotonin pathway, possibly related to or triggered by an altered microbiota, may contribute to dysmotility in PIPO patients. The results of our pilot study provide the basis for new biomarkers and innovative therapies targeting the microbiota or serotonin pathways in PIPO patients.",BMC microbiology,2024,Giulia Radocchia; Massimiliano Marazzato; Karim Ben Harbi; Elena Capuzzo; Fabrizio Pantanella; Roberto De Giorgio; Matteo Guarino; Anna Costanzini; Letizia Zenzeri; Pasquale Parisi; Alessandro Ferretti; Enrico Felici; Anna Teresa Palamara; Giovanni Di Nardo; Serena Schippa
38508549,Along the microbiota-gut-brain axis: Use of plant polysaccharides to improve mental disorders.,"With the development of gut microbiota-specific interventions for mental disorders, the interactions between plant polysaccharides and microbiota in the intestinal and their consequent effects are becoming increasingly important. In this review, we discussed the role of plant polysaccharides in improving various mental disorders via the microbiota-gut-brain axis. The chemical and structural characteristics and metabolites of these plant polysaccharides were summarised. Plant polysaccharides and their metabolites have great potential for reshaping gut microbiota profiles through gut microbiota-dependent fermentation. Along the microbiota-gut-brain axis, the consequent pharmacological processes that lead to the elimination of the symptoms of mental disorders include 1) regulation of the central monoamine neurotransmitters, amino acid transmitters and cholinergic signalling system; 2) alleviation of central and peripheral inflammation mainly through the NLRP3/NF-κB-related signalling pathway; 3) inhibition of neuronal apoptosis; and 4) enhancement of antioxidant activities. According to this review, monosaccharide glucose and structure -4-α-Glcp-(1→ are the most potent compositions of the most reported plant polysaccharides. However, the causal structure-activity relationship remains to be extensively explored. Moreover, mechanistic elucidation, safety verification, and additional rigorous human studies are expected to advance plant polysaccharide-based product development targeting the microbiota-gut-brain axis for people with mental disorders.",International journal of biological macromolecules,2024,Jiayu Gao; Ying Liang; Pu Liu
39417049,Challenges in integrating traditional Chinese medicine and gut microbiota research for insomnia treatment.,"The gut microbiome is an extensive variety of bacteria with a range of metabolic capabilities that can be pathogenic, beneficial, or opportunistic. Changes in the gut microbiota's composition can affect the link between gut integrity and host health as well as cause disruptions to numerous neurological systems. The second most prevalent mental health problem, insomnia has a negative social and economic impact. Currently, it is becoming increasingly obvious how crucial it is to preserve the delicate balance of gut microbiota to treat illness-related symptoms like insomnia. Although traditional Chinese medicine has proposed an effective strategy against insomnia through gut microbiota alteration in animal models, studies in human models are limited. This decreases the predictive value of the studies in terms of human outcomes. This editorial places an emphasis on cultural sensitivity rather than scientific reasoning that promotes the use of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). We aim to emphasize the concern that promoting TCM could divert resources from conventional medical research, leading to suboptimal care.",World journal of clinical cases,2024,Maham Bilal; Abdulqadir J Nashwan
38700338,Association between gut microbiota dysbiosis and poor functional outcomes in acute ischemic stroke patients with COVID-19 infection.,"Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients with active COVID-19 infection often have more severe symptoms and worse recovery. COVID-19 infection can cause gut microbiota dysbiosis, which is also a risk factor for poor outcomes in AIS patients. However, the association between gut microbiota and functional outcomes among AIS patients with COVID-19 infection has not been fully clarified yet. In this study, we performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize the gut microbial community among AIS patients with acute COVID-19 infection, AIS patients with post-acute COVID-19 infection, and AIS patients without COVID-19 infection. We found that AIS patients with acute COVID-19 experienced poorer recovery and significant gut dysbiosis, characterized by higher levels of <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> and lower levels of <i>Ruminococcaceae</i> and <i>Lachnospiraceae</i>. Furthermore, a shorter time window (less than 28 days) between COVID-19 infection and stroke was identified as a risk factor for poor functional outcomes in AIS patients with COVID-19, and the enrichment of <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> was indicated as a mediator in the relationship between infection time window and poor stroke outcomes. Our findings highlight the importance of early intervention after COVID-19 infection, especially by regulating the gut microbiota, which plays a role in the prognosis of AIS patients with COVID-19 infection.IMPORTANCEThe gut microbiota plays an important role in the association between respiratory system and cerebrovascular system through the gut-lung axis and gut-brain axis. However, the specific connection between gut bacteria and the functional outcomes of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients with COVID-19 is not fully understood yet. In our study, we observed a significant decrease in bacterial diversity and shifts in the abundance of key bacterial families in AIS patients with acute COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, we identified that the time window was a critical influence factor for stroke outcomes, and the enrichment of <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> acted as a mediator in the relationship between the infection time window and poor stroke outcomes. Our research provides a new perspective on the complex interplay among AIS, COVID-19 infection, and gut microbiota dysbiosis. Moreover, recognizing <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> as a potential mediator of poor stroke prognosis offers a novel avenue for future exploration and therapeutic interventions.",mSystems,2024,Jiaying Chen; Xuxuan Gao; Jingru Liang; Qiheng Wu; Linlin Shen; Yifeng Zheng; Yu Ma; Yuping Peng; Yan He; Jia Yin

The mediating role of BMI was subsequently explored using mediation analysis via two-step MR.MR evidence suggested the <i>Bifidobacterium</i> genus (β=-0.03; 95% CI -0.05 to -0.02; p<0.001 and β=-0.03; 95% CI -0.05 to -0.02; p<0.001) and Actinobacteria phylum (β=-0.04; 95% CI -0.06 to -0.02; p<0.001 and β=-0.03; 95% CI -0.05 to -0.03; p=0.001) had protective effects on both anhedonia and depressed mood. The Actinobacteria phylum also had protective effects on appetite changes (β=-0.04; 95% CI -0.06 to -0.01; p=0.005), while the Family XI had an antiprotective effect (β=0.03; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.04; p<0.001). The Bifidobacteriaceae family (β=-0.01; 95% CI -0.02 to -0.01; p=0.001) and Actinobacteria phylum (β=-0.02; 95% CI -0.03 to -0.01; p=0.001) showed protective effects against suicidality. The two-step MR analysis revealed that BMI also acted as a mediating moderator between the Actinobacteria phylum and appetite changes (mediated proportion, 34.42%) and that BMI partially mediated the effect of the <i>Bifidobacterium</i> genus (14.14% and 8.05%) and Actinobacteria phylum (13.10% and 8.31%) on both anhedonia and depressed mood.These findings suggest a potential therapeutic effect of Actinobacteria and <i>Bifidobacterium</i> on both depression and obesity.

38901183,Diverse mechanisms by which chemical pollutant exposure alters gut microbiota metabolism and inflammation.,"The human gut microbiome, the host, and the environment are inextricably linked across the life course with significant health impacts. Consisting of trillions of bacteria, fungi, viruses, and other micro-organisms, microbiota living within our gut are particularly dynamic and responsible for digestion and metabolism of diverse classes of ingested chemical pollutants. Exposure to chemical pollutants not only in early life but throughout growth and into adulthood can alter human hosts' ability to absorb and metabolize xenobiotics, nutrients, and other components critical to health and longevity. Inflammation is a common mechanism underlying multiple environmentally related chronic conditions, including cardiovascular disease, multiple cancer types, and mental health. While growing research supports complex interactions between pollutants and the gut microbiome, significant gaps exist. Few reviews provide descriptions of the complex mechanisms by which chemical pollutants interact with the host microbiome through either direct or indirect pathways to alter disease risk, with a particular focus on inflammatory pathways. This review focuses on examples of several classes of pollutants commonly ingested by humans, including (i) heavy metals, (ii) persistent organic pollutants (POPs), and (iii) nitrates. Digestive enzymes and gut microbes are the first line of absorption and metabolism of these chemicals, and gut microbes have been shown to alter compounds from a less to more toxic state influencing subsequent distribution and excretion. In addition, chemical pollutants may interact with or alter the selection of more harmful and less commensal microbiota, leading to gut dysbiosis, and changes in receptor-mediated signaling pathways that alter the integrity and function of the gut intestinal tract. Arsenic, cadmium, and lead (heavy metals), influence the microbiome directly by altering different classes of bacteria, and subsequently driving inflammation through metabolite production and different signaling pathways (LPS/TLR4 or proteoglycan/TLR2 pathways). POPs can alter gut microbial composition either directly or indirectly depending on their ability to activate key signaling pathways within the intestine (e.g., PCB-126 and AHR). Nitrates and nitrites' effect on the gut and host may depend on their ability to be transformed to secondary and tertiary metabolites by gut bacteria. Future research should continue to support foundational research both in vitro, in vivo, and longitudinal population-based research to better identify opportunities for prevention, gain additional mechanistic insights into the complex interactions between environmental pollutants and the microbiome and support additional translational science.",Environment international,2024,Menna Teffera; Alex C Veith; Sean Ronnekleiv-Kelly; Christopher A Bradfield; Maria Nikodemova; Lisa Tussing-Humphreys; Kristen Malecki
39375215,Association of the newly proposed dietary index for gut microbiota and depression: the mediation effect of phenotypic age and body mass index.,"Gut microbiota and depression have garnered attention. The dietary index for gut microbiota (DI-GM) is a newly proposed index that reflects the diversity of gut microbiota, yet its association with depression remains unstudied.Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were analyzed. Depression was assessed using Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Dietary recall data were used to calculate the DI-GM (including components beneficial and unfavorable to gut microbiota). Multivariable weighted logistic and linear regression were employed to investigate the association of DI-GM with depression and total PHQ-9 score. The potential mediating role of phenotypic age and body mass index (BMI) was explored. Secondary analyses included subgroup analyses, restricted cubic spline (RCS), and multiple imputation.A higher DI-GM and beneficial gut microbiota score were associated with a lower prevalence of depression (DI-GM: OR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.89, 0.99; beneficial gut microbiota score: OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.82, 0.94) and lower total PHQ-9 score (DI-GM: β=-0.09, 95% CI=-0.14, -0.04; beneficial gut microbiota: β=-0.15, 95% CI=-0.21, -0.08). RCS indicated a non-linear relationship between DI-GM and depression. A significant mediating effect of phenotypic age (proportion of mediation: 19.81%, 95% CI: 12.86-63.00%) and BMI (proportion of mediation: 16.49%, 95% CI: 12.87-62.00%) was observed.The newly proposed DI-GM was negatively associated with the prevalence of depression and total PHQ-9 score.

38582194,Evolution and the critical role of the microbiota in the reduced mental and physical health associated with low socioeconomic status (SES).,"The evolution of the gut-microbiota-brain axis in animals reveals that microbial inputs influence metabolism, the regulation of inflammation and the development of organs, including the brain. Inflammatory, neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders are more prevalent in people of low socioeconomic status (SES). Many aspects of low SES reduce exposure to the microbial inputs on which we are in a state of evolved dependence, whereas the lifestyle of wealthy citizens maintains these exposures. This partially explains the health deficit of low SES, so focussing on our evolutionary history and on environmental and lifestyle factors that distort microbial exposures might help to mitigate that deficit. But the human microbiota is complex and we have poor understanding of its functions at the microbial and mechanistic levels, and in the brain. Perhaps its composition is more flexible than the microbiota of animals that have restricted habitats and less diverse diets? These uncertainties are discussed in relation to the encouraging but frustrating results of attempts to treat psychiatric disorders by modulating the microbiota.",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,2024,Graham A W Rook
38318337,"Exploring the interplay between running exercises, microbial diversity, and tryptophan metabolism along the microbiota-gut-brain axis.","The emergent recognition of the gut-brain axis connection has shed light on the role of the microbiota in modulating the gut-brain axis's functions. Several microbial metabolites, such as serotonin, kynurenine, tryptamine, indole, and their derivatives originating from tryptophan metabolism have been implicated in influencing this axis. In our study, we aimed to investigate the impact of running exercises on microbial tryptophan metabolism using a mouse model. We conducted a multi-omics analysis to obtain a comprehensive insight into the changes in tryptophan metabolism along the microbiota-gut-brain axis induced by running exercises. The analyses integrated multiple components, such as tryptophan changes and metabolite levels in the gut, blood, hippocampus, and brainstem. Fecal microbiota analysis aimed to examine the composition and diversity of the gut microbiota, and taxon-function analysis explored the associations between specific microbial taxa and functional activities in tryptophan metabolism. Our findings revealed significant alterations in tryptophan metabolism across multiple sites, including the gut, blood, hippocampus, and brainstem. The outcomes indicate a shift in microbiota diversity and tryptophan metabolizing capabilities within the running group, linked to increased tryptophan transportation to the hippocampus and brainstem through circulation. Moreover, the symbiotic association between <i>Romboutsia</i> and <i>A. muciniphila</i> indicated their potential contribution to modifying the gut microenvironment and influencing tryptophan transport to the hippocampus and brainstem.

Microbiota features associated with malnutrition were used to predict clinical outcomes.Patients with malnutrition (51%) had a different microbiota composition compared to those who were well-nourished during hospitalization (ANOSIM R = 0.079, P = 0.003). Patients with severe malnutrition showed poorer α-diversity at admission (Shannon P = 0.012, Simpson P = 0.018) and follow-up (Shannon P = 0.023, Chao1 P = 0.008). Differential abundance of Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group, Subdoligranulum, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were significantly lower and inversely associated with malnutrition, while Corynebacterium, Ruminococcaceae Incertae Sedis, and Fusobacterium were significantly increased and positively associated with malnutrition. Corynebacterium, Ruminococcaceae Incertae Sedis, and the overall composition were important predictors of critical care in patients with malnutrition during hospitalization.Older adults with malnutrition, especially in a severe stage, may be subject to substantial gut microbial disturbances during hospitalization. The gut microbiota profile of patients with malnutrition might help us to predict worse clinical outcomes.","Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)",2024,Shirley S Muñoz-Fernandez; Flavia B Garcez; Julio C G Alencar; Amália A Bastos; John E Morley; Tommy Cederholm; Ivan Aprahamian; Heraldo P de Souza; Thiago J Avelino-Silva; Laure B Bindels; Sandra M L Ribeiro

Emerging research highlights the pivotal role of the gut microbiome in the development of diverse mental health conditions. This study aims to explore the causal effects and interactions of the gut microbiome, metabolites, immune cells, lipids, and inflammatory proteins on the risk of anorexia nervosa through mediation and multi-omics Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis.This study used data from the FinnGen genome-wide association study (GWAS) of AN (N = 402,625), integrated with GWAS data on 473 of gut microbiota (N = 5959), 233 metabolites (N = 136,016), 731 immune cells (N = 3757), 179 lipids (N = 7174), and 91 inflammatory proteins (N = 14,824).

39458270,Depressive Symptoms and Gut Microbiota after Bowel Preparation and Colonoscopy: A Pre-Post Intervention Study.,"Mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) is essential for visualisation of the colon during colonoscopy. Previous studies have identified changes in gut microbiota composition after MBP and colonoscopy. Considering the gut microbiota is increasingly implicated in psychiatry, we explored the potential impact of this intervention on mood and the microbiota-gut-brain axis. We conducted a pre-post intervention study in adults, with timepoints of one week before and one month after MBP and colonoscopy. Our primary outcome was change in average Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale depression sub-scores. We examined changes in average anxiety, stress, and quality of life scores and gut microbiota composition using 16S rRNA sequencing. We further explored associations between changes in depressive symptoms and gut microbiota and conducted post hoc analyses to explore potential effect modifiers. Average depressive symptom scores decreased one month post-procedure compared to baseline (n = 59; adjusted β = -0.64; 95%CI: -1.18, -0.11). Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) appeared to moderate this relationship (β = 1.78; 95%CI: 0.292, 3.26); depressive symptoms increased in those with, and decreased in those without, IBS. Reduced alpha diversity, modest effects on beta-diversity, and increases in health-associated genera were observed one month post-procedure. Increases in the CLR-transformed abundances of <i>Ruminococcaceae UCG-009</i> were associated with improvements in depressive symptoms. There is preliminary evidence of a potential mental health effect of MBP and colonoscopy, particularly for those with IBS, which may be associated with changes to the gut microbiota. Further research is required to confirm these findings and their clinical relevance.",Microorganisms,2024,Amelia J McGuinness; Martin O'Hely; Douglas Stupart; David Watters; Samantha L Dawson; Christopher Hair; Michael Berk; Mohammadreza Mohebbi; Amy Loughman; Glenn Guest; Felice N Jacka
38892694,A Cross Talking between the Gut Microbiota and Metabolites of Participants in a Confined Environment.,"Certain workplaces, like deep-sea voyages, subject workers to chronic psychological stress and circadian rhythm disorders due to confined environments and frequent shifts. In this study, participants lived in a strictly controlled confined environment, and we analyzed the effects of a confined environment on gut microbiota and metabolites. The results showed that living in confined environments can significantly alter both the gut microbiota and the gut metabolome, particularly affecting lipid metabolism pathways like glycerophospholipid metabolism. There was a significant reduction in the abundance of <i>Faecalibacterium</i> and <i>Bacteroides</i>, while <i>Blautia</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, and <i>Collinsella</i> showed significant increases. An association analysis revealed a strong correlation between changes in the gut microbiota and the metabolome. Four upregulated lipid metabolites may serve as biomarkers for damage induced by confined environments, and certain gut microbiota alterations, such as those involving <i>Faecalibacterium</i> and <i>Bacteroides</i>, could be potential psychobiotics or therapeutic targets for enhancing mental health in a confined environment.",Nutrients,2024,Xin Song; Ziying Wang; Yongjun Xia; Zheng Chen; Guangqiang Wang; Yijin Yang; Beiwei Zhu; Lianzhong Ai; Haodan Xu; Chuan Wang
39335452,Prior Appendicectomy and Gut Microbiota Re-Establishment in Adults after Bowel Preparation and Colonoscopy.,"Emerging evidence suggests that the human vermiform appendix is not a vestigial organ but rather an immunological organ of biological relevance. It is hypothesised that the appendix acts as a bacterial 'safe house' for commensal gut bacteria and facilitates re-inoculation of the colon after disruption through the release of biofilms. To date, no studies have attempted to explore this potential mechanistic function of the appendix. We conducted a pre-post intervention study in adults (n = 59) exploring re-establishment of the gut microbiota in those with and without an appendix after colonic disruption via bowel preparation and colonoscopy. Gut microbiota composition was measured one week before and one month after bowel preparation and colonoscopy using 16S rRNA sequencing. We observed between group differences in gut microbiota composition between those with (n = 45) and without (n = 13) an appendix at baseline. These differences were no longer evident one-month post-procedure, suggesting that this procedure may have 'reset' any potential appendix-related differences between groups. Both groups experienced reductions in gut microbiota richness and shifts in beta diversity post-procedure, with greater changes in those without an appendix, and there were five bacterial genera whose re-establishment post-procedure appeared to be moderated by appendicectomy status. This small experimental study provides preliminary evidence of a potential differential re-establishment of the gut microbiota after disruption in those with and without an appendix, warranting further investigation into the potential role of the appendix as a microbial safe house.",Biomedicines,2024,Amelia J McGuinness; Martin O'Hely; Douglas Stupart; David Watters; Samantha L Dawson; Christopher Hair; Michael Berk; Mohammadreza Mohebbi; Amy Loughman; Glenn Guest; Felice N Jacka
39260135,Microbiota-gut-brain axis: Natural antidepressants molecular mechanism.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a severe mental health condition characterized by persistent depression, impaired cognition, and reduced activity. Increasing evidence suggests that gut microbiota (GM) imbalance is closely linked to the emergence and advancement of MDD, highlighting the potential significance of regulating the ""Microbiota-Gut-Brain"" (MGB) axis to impact the development of MDD. Natural products (NPs), characterized by broad biological activities, low toxicity, and multi-target characteristics, offer unique advantages in antidepressant treatment by regulating MGB axis.This review was aimed to explore the intricate relationship between the GM and the brain, as well as host responses, and investigated the mechanisms underlying the MGB axis in MDD development. It also explored the pharmacological mechanisms by which NPs modulate MGB axis to exert antidepressant effects and addressed current research limitations. Additionally, it proposed new strategies for future preclinical and clinical applications in the MDD domain.To study the effects and mechanism by which NPs exert antidepressant effects through mediating the MGB axis, data were collected from Web of Science, PubMed, ScienceDirect from initial establishment to March 2024. NPs were classified and summarized by their mechanisms of action.NPs, such as flavonoids,alkaloids,polysaccharides,saponins, terpenoids, can treat MDD by regulating the MGB axis. Its mechanism includes balancing GM, regulating metabolites and neurotransmitters such as SCAFs, 5-HT, BDNF, inhibiting neuroinflammation, improving neural plasticity, and increasing neurogenesis.NPs display good antidepressant effects, and have potential value for clinical application in the prevention and treatment of MDD by regulating the MGB axis. However, in-depth study of the mechanisms by which antidepressant medications affect MGB axis will also require considerable effort in clinical and preclinical research, which is essential for the development of effective antidepressant treatments.",Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,2024,Yitong Lu; Xiaowen Yu; Zhongling Wang; Linghui Kong; Zhenyuan Jiang; Ruirui Shang; Xia Zhong; Shimeng Lv; Guangheng Zhang; Haonan Gao; Ni Yang
39092201,Stress and the gut-brain axis: an inflammatory perspective.,"The gut-brain axis (GBA) plays a dominant role in maintaining homeostasis as well as contributes to mental health maintenance. The pathways that underpin the axis expand from macroscopic interactions with the nervous system, to the molecular signals that include microbial metabolites, tight junction protein expression, or cytokines released during inflammation. The dysfunctional GBA has been repeatedly linked to the occurrence of anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors development. The importance of the inflammatory aspects of the altered GBA has recently been highlighted in the literature. Here we summarize current reports on GBA signaling which involves the immune response within the intestinal and blood-brain barrier (BBB). We also emphasize the effect of stress response on altering barriers' permeability, and the therapeutic potential of microbiota restoration by probiotic administration or microbiota transplantation, based on the latest animal studies. Most research performed on various stress models showed an association between anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors, dysbiosis of gut microbiota, and disruption of intestinal permeability with simultaneous changes in BBB integrity. It could be postulated that under stress conditions impaired communication across BBB may therefore represent a significant mechanism allowing the gut microbiota to affect brain functions.",Frontiers in molecular neuroscience,2024,Julia Morys; Andrzej Małecki; Marta Nowacka-Chmielewska
39339804,Balancing the Oral-Gut-Brain Axis with Diet.,"<b>Background:</b> The oral microbiota is the second largest microbial community in humans. It contributes considerably to microbial diversity and health effects, much like the gut microbiota. Despite physical and chemical barriers separating the oral cavity from the gastrointestinal tract, bidirectional microbial transmission occurs between the two regions, influencing overall host health. <b>Method:</b> This review explores the intricate interplay of the oral-gut-brain axis, highlighting the pivotal role of the oral microbiota in systemic health and ageing, and how it can be influenced by diet. <b>Results:</b> Recent research suggests a relationship between oral diseases, such as periodontitis, and gastrointestinal problems, highlighting the broader significance of the oral-gut axis in systemic diseases, as well as the oral-gut-brain axis in neurological disorders and mental health. Diet influences microbial diversity in the oral cavity and the gut. While certain diets/dietary components improve both gut and oral health, others, such as fermentable carbohydrates, can promote oral pathogens while boosting gut health. <b>Conclusions:</b> Understanding these dynamics is key for promoting a healthy oral-gut-brain axis through dietary interventions that support microbial diversity and mitigate age-related health risks.",Nutrients,2024,Rebecca Kerstens; Yong Zhi Ng; Sven Pettersson; Anusha Jayaraman
38922485,Characterization of Gut Microbiota in Rats and Rhesus Monkeys After Methamphetamine Self-administration.,"Methamphetamine (MA) is one of the most abused drugs globally, but the mechanism of its addiction remains unclear. Several animal studies have shown that the gut microbiota (GM) influences addictive behaviors, but the pattern of GM changes during addiction in animals of different species remains unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the association between dynamic changes in GM and MA self-administration acquisition among two classical mammals, rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) and rats, MA self-administration models. Male Sprague-Dawley rats and male rhesus monkeys were subjected to classical MA self-administration training, and fecal samples were collected before and after MA self-administration training, respectively. 16S rRNA sequencing was used for GM analyses. We found that GM changes were more pronounced in rats than in rhesus monkeys, as evidenced by more GM taxa producing significant differences before and after MA self-administration training in rats than in monkeys. We also found that the expression of the genus Clostridia_vadinBB60_group significantly decreased after MA self-administration training in both rats and rhesus monkeys. Lactobacillus changes were significantly negatively correlated with total MA uptake in rats (Pearson R =  - 0.666, p = 0.035; Spearman R =  - 0.721, p = 0.023), whereas its change was also highly negatively correlated with total MA uptake in rhesus monkeys (Pearson R =  - 0.882, p = 0.118; Spearman R =  - 1.000, p = 0.083), although this was not significant. These findings suggest that MA causes significant alterations in GM in both rhesus monkeys and rats and that the genus Lactobacillus might be a common therapeutic target for MA uptake prevention across the species.",Molecular neurobiology,2024,Li He; Jia-Hui Zhou; Huan Li; Wen-Lei Zhang; Tie-Qiao Liu; Hai-Feng Jiang; Rong-Wei Zhai; Xiao-Jie Zhang
38815661,Gut microbiota composition links to variation in functional domains across psychiatric disorders.,"Changes in microbial composition are observed in various psychiatric disorders, but their specificity to certain symptoms or processes remains unclear. This study explores the associations between the gut microbiota composition and the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) domains of functioning, representing symptom domains, specifically focusing on stress-related and neurodevelopmental disorders in patients with and without psychiatric comorbidity.The gut microbiota was analyzed in 369 participants, comprising 272 individuals diagnosed with a mood disorder, anxiety disorder, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and/or substance use disorder, as well as 97 psychiatrically unaffected individuals. The RDoC domains were estimated using principal component analysis (PCA) with oblique rotation on a range of psychiatric, psychological, and personality measures. Associations between the gut microbiota and the functional domains were assessed using multiple linear regression and permanova, adjusted for age, sex, diet, smoking, medication use and comorbidity status.Four functional domains, aligning with RDoC's negative valence, social processes, cognitive systems, and arousal/regulatory systems domains, were identified. Significant associations were found between these domains and eight microbial genera, including associations of negative valence with the abundance of the genera Sellimonas, CHKCI001, Clostridium sensu stricto 1, Oscillibacter, and Flavonifractor; social processes with Sellimonas; cognitive systems with Sporobacter and Hungatella; and arousal/regulatory systems with Ruminococcus torques (all p<sub>FDR</sub> < 0.05).Our findings demonstrate associations between the gut microbiota and the domains of functioning across patients and unaffected individuals, potentially mediated by immune-related processes. These results open avenues for microbiota-focused personalized interventions, considering psychiatric comorbidity. However, further research is warranted to establish causality and elucidate mechanistic pathways.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2024,Danique Mulder; Babette Jakobi; Yingjie Shi; Peter Mulders; Josina D Kist; Rose M Collard; Janna N Vrijsen; Phillip van Eijndhoven; Indira Tendolkar; Mirjam Bloemendaal; Alejandro Arias Vasquez

Studies with fecal microbiota, 16 s RNA sequencing and QIIME pipelines were included. Studies using antibiotics, probiotics, and medications such as antidepressants were excluded. Additionally, studies based on a single gender were excluded as gender impacts microbiota changes in MDD. Four studies addressed differences in microbiota with MDD and another four assessed shifts occurring with a low FODMAP diet. The abundance of <i>Bacteroidetes</i>, <i>Bacteroidaceae</i> and <i>Bacteroides</i> were lower in individuals with MDD but increased with a low FODMAP diet. Abundance of <i>Ruminoccaceae</i> was lower and <i>Bilophila</i> was higher with both a low FODMAP diet and MDD. These results provide preliminary evidence that a low FODMAP diet might drive changes in microbiota that also benefit people with MDD.

The abundance of <i>Bacteroidetes</i>, <i>Bacteroidaceae</i> and <i>Bacteroides</i> were lower in individuals with MDD but increased with a low FODMAP diet. Abundance of <i>Ruminoccaceae</i> was lower and <i>Bilophila</i> was higher with both a low FODMAP diet and MDD. These results provide preliminary evidence that a low FODMAP diet might drive changes in microbiota that also benefit people with MDD. Further research to assess whether a low FODMAP diet can treat MDD through modification of targeted microbiota is warranted.",Frontiers in nutrition,2023,Simone O'Neill; Michelle Minehan; Catherine R Knight-Agarwal; David B Pyne
38892525,Is the Mediterranean Low Fodmap Diet Effective in Managing Irritable Bowel Syndrome Symptoms and Gut Microbiota? An Innovative Research Protocol.,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms can be effectively managed with the low FODMAP diet. However, its efficacy in reducing inflammation is not yet proven. On the contrary, the Mediterranean diet has anti-inflammatory properties with proven efficacy in treating chronic low-grade inflammation-related diseases.To publicly share our protocol evaluating the efficacy of the Mediterranean low-FODMAP (MED-LFD) versus NICE recommendations (British National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) diet in managing IBS symptoms and quality of life.Participants meeting the Rome IV criteria will be randomly assigned to MED-LFD or NICE recommendations and they will be followed for six months. Efficacy, symptom relief, quality of life and mental health will be assessed using validated questionnaires. In addition, fecal samples will be analyzed to assess gut microbiota, and to measure branched and short-chain fatty acids, and volatile organic compounds (metabolic byproducts from bacteria). Expected results and discussion: By publicly sharing this clinical study protocol, we aim to improve research quality in the field of IBS management by allowing for peer review feedback, preventing data manipulation, reducing redundant research efforts, mitigating publication bias, and empowering patient decision-making. We expect that this protocol will show that MED-LFD can effectively alleviate IBS symptoms and it will provide pathophysiology insights on its efficacy. The new dietary pattern that combines the LFD and the MED approaches allows for the observation of the synergistic action of both diets, with the MED's anti-inflammatory and prebiotic properties enhancing the effects of the LFD while minimizing its limitations.

38869657,"Effects of Bifidobacterium breve 207-1 on regulating lifestyle behaviors and mental wellness in healthy adults based on the microbiome-gut-brain axis: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.","Our study aimed to explore the efficacy of Bifidobacterium breve 207-1 on specific neurotransmitters and hormones and the ability to regulate lifestyle behaviors in healthy adults.In total, 120 healthy adults with high mental stress, overweight, insomnia, and constipation were randomly assigned to receive low-dose B. breve 207-1 (LD, n = 40), high-dose B. breve 207-1 (HD, n = 40), or placebo (n = 40) for 28 days. Fecal and blood samples were collected and questionnaires were answered before and after the trial. Neurotransmitters and serum hormones were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The gut microbiota composition was assessed using 16 S rRNA sequencing. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) concentrations were determined via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).The primary outcome of our study was changes in mental wellness, including neurotransmitters, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrena (HPA) axis hormones, and the psychological scales. The results showed that γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) increased significantly and the HPA axis hormones were suppressed overall in the probiotic groups while 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) did not change significantly. However, there was no significant change in mood scale scores. The secondary outcome focused on the ability of 207-1 to regulate the body and lifestyle of healthy adults (e.g., sleep, diet, exercise, etc.). The PSQI scores in the probiotics groups significantly decreased, indicating improved sleep quality. Meanwhile, the probiotic groups had a slight increase in exercise consumption while dietary intake stabilized. By physical examination, the participants showed weight loss although no statistically significant difference was observed between the groups. Then, validated by gut microbiota, changes in the gut microbiota were observed under the effective intervention of 207-1 while short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) increased in the LD group, particularly acetic and propionic acids. There was a slight decrease in alpha-diversity in the HD group.Bifidobacterium breve 207-1 entered the organism and affected neurotransmitter and the HPA axis hormone levels via the microbiome-gut-brain axis. Meanwhile, 207-1 supplementation improved daily lifestyle behaviors in healthy adults, which may in turn lead to changes in their bodies (e.g. weight and lipid metabolism). However, this study did not find significant mood-modulating efficacy. The mechanism of the overall study is unclear, but we hypothesize that SCFAs may be the key pathway, and more experiments are needed for validation in the future.This trial was retrospectively registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry under the accession number ChiCTR2300069453 on March 16, 2023.",European journal of nutrition,2024,Jinxing Li; Yapeng Li; Jincheng Zhao; Liang Li; Yunyi Wang; Fei Chen; Yuchen Li; Ruyue Cheng; Fang He; Xiaolei Ze; Xi Shen
38889540,Treating chronic stress and chronic pain by manipulating gut microbiota with diet: can we kill two birds with one stone?,"<b>Background:</b> Chronic stress and chronic pain are closely linked by the capacity to exacerbate each other, sharing common roots in the brain and in the gut. The strict intersection between these two neurological diseases makes important to have a therapeutic strategy aimed at preventing both to maintain mental health in patients. Diet is an modifiable lifestyle factor associated with gut-brain axis diseases and there is growing interest in its use as adjuvant to main therapies. Several evidence attest the impact of specific diets or nutrients on chronic stress-related disorders and pain with a good degree of certainty. A daily adequate intake of foods containing micronutrients such as amino acids, minerals and vitamins, as well as the reduction in the consumption of processed food products can have a positive impact on microbiota and gut health. Many nutrients are endowed of prebiotic, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and neuroprotective potential which make them useful tools helping the management of chronic stress and pain in patients. Dietary regimes, as intermittent fasting or caloric restriction, are promising, although further studies are needed to optimize protocols according to patient's medical history, age and sex. Moreover, by supporting gut microbiota health with diet is possible to attenuate comorbidities such as obesity, gastrointestinal dysfunction and mood disorders, thus reducing healthcare costs related to chronic stress or pain.<b>Objective:</b> This review summarize the most recent evidence on the microbiota-mediated beneficial effects of macro- and micronutrients, dietary-related factors, specific nutritional regimens and dietary intervention on these pathological conditions.",Nutritional neuroscience,2024,Alessia Costa; Elena Lucarini
38479554,Social isolation induces intestinal barrier disorder and imbalances gut microbiota in mice.,"Social isolation, a known stressor, can have detrimental effects on both physical and mental health. Recent scientific attention has been drawn to the gut-brain axis, a bidirectional communication system between the central nervous system and gut microbiota, suggesting that gut microbes may influence brain function. This study aimed to explore the impact of social isolation on the intestinal barrier and gut microbiota. 40 male BALB/c mice were either individually housed or kept in groups for 8 and 15 weeks. Socially isolated mice exhibited increased anxiety-like behavior, with significant differences between the 8-week and 15-week isolation groups (P < 0.05). After 8 weeks of isolation, there was a reduction in tight junction protein expression in the intestinal mechanical barrier. Furthermore, after 15 weeks of isolation, both tight junction protein and mucin expression, key components of the intestinal chemical barrier, decreased. This was accompanied by a substantial increase in inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 mRNA, IL-10, and TNF-α) in colon tissue in the 15-week isolated group (P < 0.05). Additionally, Illumina MiSequencing revealed significant alterations in the gut microbiota of socially isolated mice, including reduced Firmicutes and Bacteroides compared to the control group.

39237483,Temperament in Early Childhood Is Associated With Gut Microbiota Composition and Diversity.,"Temperament is a key predictor of human mental health and cognitive and emotional development. Although human fear behavior is reportedly associated with gut microbiome in infancy, infant gut microbiota changes dramatically during the first 5 years, when the diversity and composition of gut microbiome are established. This period is crucial for the development of the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in emotion regulation. Therefore, this study investigated the relationship between temperament and gut microbiota in 284 preschool children aged 3-4 years. Child temperament was assessed by maternal reports of the Children's Behavior Questionnaire. Gut microbiota (alpha/beta diversity and genera abundance) was evaluated using 16S rRNA sequencing of stool samples. A low abundance of anti-inflammatory bacteria (e.g., Faecalibacterium) and a high abundance of pro-inflammatory bacteria (e.g., Eggerthella, Flavonifractor) were associated with higher negative emotionality and stress response (i.e., negative affectivity, β = -0.17, p = 0.004) and lower positive emotionality and reward-seeking (i.e., surgency/extraversion, β = 0.15, p = 0.013). Additionally, gut microbiota diversity was associated with speed of response initiation (i.e., impulsivity, a specific aspect of surgency/extraversion, β = 0.16, p = 0.008). This study provides insight into the biological mechanisms of temperament and takes important steps toward identifying predictive markers of psychological/emotional risk.",Developmental psychobiology,2024,Eriko Ueda; Michiko Matsunaga; Hideaki Fujihara; Takamasa Kajiwara; Aya K Takeda; Satoshi Watanabe; Keisuke Hagihara; Masako Myowa
38801922,The impact of depression-mediated gut microbiota composition on Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Mendelian study.,"This study uses a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to delineate the causal influence of gut microbiota on the occurrence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), concurrently assessing the potential mediating function of depression within this framework.Several two-sample MR methods were used to assess the causal repercussions of gut microbiota on the onset of both IBS and depression. Following this, gut microbiota and depression, which demonstrated notable causal associations, were integrated as exposure variables in a multivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR) framework to construct a model encompassing gut microbiota, depression, and IBS. Mediation effects were assessed by examining the indirect pathway of gut microbiota → depression → IBS.Two-sample MR analysis unveiled a statistically significant causal association (P < 0.05) between specific bacterial group within the gut microbiota, notably p_Actinobacteria(OR = 0.829225), c_Clostridia(OR = 0.798897), s_Desulfovibrio_piger(OR = 1.163912), g_Streptococcus(OR = 1.132735), c_Actinobacteria(OR = 0.829224), and the onset of IBS. In the MVMR analysis, the relationship between depression and IBS was significant across Model 3, Model 7, Model 8, and Model 13 (P < 0.05). Assessment of mediation effects revealed that c_Clostridia and o_Clostridiales indirectly impacted IBS through depression, with masking effect ratios of 168.46 % and 168.44 %, respectively.These findings underscore a resilient causal association between the composition of gut microbiota and the initiation of IBS. Furthermore, depression serves as a mediator for particular groups of gut bacteria, thereby contributing to the development of IBS. These observations imply that interventions targeting mental health may potentially alleviate the risk of IBS onset attributable to adverse configurations of gut microbiota.",Journal of affective disorders,2024,Yi Huang; Endian Zheng; Mei Hu; Xinxin Yang; Qiaoli Lan; Yingcong Yu; Beibei Xu
38848976,Deciphering the gut microbiota's (Coprococcus and Subdoligranulum) impact on depression: Network pharmacology and molecular dynamics simulation.,"Depression, a prevalent mental health condition, significantly impacts global mental impairment rates. While antidepressants are commonly used, treatment-resistant depression (TRD) poses a challenge. Emerging research highlights the role of the gut microbiota in depression through the gut-brain axis. This study identifies key genes associated with depression influenced by specific gut microbiota, Coprococcus and Subdoligranulum. Using bioinformatics tools, potential targets were elucidated, and molecular docking studies were performed. Furthermore, gene expression analysis identified hub-genes related to depression, intersecting with metabolite targets. Protein-protein interaction analysis revealed pivotal targets such as PTGS2 and MMP9. Molecular docking demonstrated 3-Indolepropionic acid's superior affinity over (R)-3-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)lactate. Physicochemical properties and toxicity profiles were compared, suggesting favorable attributes for 3-Indolepropionic acid. Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed stability and interactions of compounds with target proteins. This comprehensive approach sheds light on the complex interplay between gut microbiota, genes, and depression, emphasizing the potential for microbiota-targeted interventions in mental health management.","Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior",2024,Sarvesh Sabarathinam

Therefore, this study aimed to characterize differences in self-reported symptoms, gut microbiota composition, and wellbeing (i.e., sleep quality, mood, and physical (PHQ) and mental wellbeing) between athletes with and without GI symptoms. In addition, we assessed the potential impact of a 3-week multi-ingredient fermented whey supplement in the GI complaints group, without a control group, on the gut microbiota and self-reported GI symptoms and wellbeing. A total of 50 athletes (24.7 ± 4.5 years) with GI issues (GI group at baseline, GI-B) and 21 athletes (25.4 ± 5.3 years) without GI issues (non-GI group, NGI) were included. At baseline, there was a significant difference in the total gastrointestinal symptom rating scale (GSRS) score (24.1 ± 8.48 vs. 30.3 ± 8.82, <i>p</i> = 0.008) and a trend difference in PHQ (33.9 ± 10.7 vs. 30.3 ± 8.82, <i>p</i> = 0.081), but no differences (<i>p</i> > 0.05) were seen for other outcomes, including gut microbiota metrics, between groups. After 3-week supplementation, the GI group (GI-S) showed increased <i>Bifidobacterium</i> relative abundance (<i>p</i> < 0.05), reported a lower number of severe GI complaints (from 72% to 54%, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and PHQ declined (<i>p</i> = 0.010). In conclusion, well-trained athletes with GI complaints reported more severe GI symptoms than an athletic reference group, without showing clear differences in wellbeing or microbiota composition.

39063241,Opioid Use and Gut Dysbiosis in Cancer Pain Patients.,"Opioids are commonly used for the management of severe chronic cancer pain. Their well-known pharmacological effects on the gastrointestinal system, particularly opioid-induced constipation (OIC), are the most common limiting factors in the optimization of analgesia, and have led to the wide use of laxatives and/or peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonists (PAMORAs). A growing interest has been recently recorded in the possible effects of opioid treatment on the gut microbiota. Preclinical and clinical data, as presented in this review, showed that alterations of the gut microbiota play a role in modulating opioid-mediated analgesia and tolerability, including constipation. Moreover, due to the bidirectional crosstalk between gut bacteria and the central nervous system, gut dysbiosis may be crucial in modulating opioid reward and addictive behavior. The microbiota may also modulate pain regulation and tolerance, by activating microglial cells and inducing the release of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which sustain neuroinflammation. In the subset of cancer patients, the clinical meaning of opioid-induced gut dysbiosis, particularly its possible interference with the efficacy of chemotherapy and immunotherapy, is still unclear. Gut dysbiosis could be a new target for treatment in cancer patients. Restoring the physiological amount of specific gut bacteria may represent a promising therapeutic option for managing gastrointestinal symptoms and optimizing analgesia for cancer patients using opioids.",International journal of molecular sciences,2024,Flaminia Coluzzi; Maria Sole Scerpa; Chiara Loffredo; Marina Borro; Joseph V Pergolizzi; Jo Ann LeQuang; Elisa Alessandri; Maurizio Simmaco; Monica Rocco
38351227,Systematic identification of the role of gut microbiota in mental disorders: a TwinsUK cohort study.,"Mental disorders are complex disorders influenced by multiple genetic, environmental, and biological factors. Specific microbiota imbalances seem to affect mental health status. However, the mechanisms by which microbiota disturbances impact the presence of depression, stress, anxiety, and eating disorders remain poorly understood. Currently, there are no robust biomarkers identified. We proposed a novel pyramid-layer design to accurately identify microbial/metabolomic signatures underlying mental disorders in the TwinsUK registry. Monozygotic and dizygotic twins discordant for mental disorders were screened, in a pairwise manner, for differentially abundant bacterial genera and circulating metabolites. In addition, multivariate analyses were performed, accounting for individual-level confounders. Our pyramid-layer study design allowed us to overcome the limitations of cross-sectional study designs with significant confounder effects and resulted in an association of the abundance of genus Parabacteroides with the diagnosis of mental disorders. Future research should explore the potential role of Parabacteroides as a mediator of mental health status.

The literature search for this review was conducted using PubMed and Scopus, employing keywords and phrases related to maternal stress, ethanol exposure, gut microbiota, microbiome, gut-brain axis, diet, dysbiosis, progesterone, placenta, prenatal development, immunity, inflammation, and depression to identify relevant studies in both preclinical and human research. Only a limited number of reviews were included to support the arguments. The search encompassed studies from the 1990s to the present. This review begins by exploring the role of microbiota in modulating host health and disease. It then examines how disturbances in maternal microbiota can affect the offspring's immune system. The analysis continues by investigating the interplay between stress and dysbiosis, focusing on how prenatal maternal stress influences both maternal and offspring microbiota and its implications for susceptibility to depression. The review also considers the impact of ethanol consumption on gut dysbiosis, with an emphasis on the effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on both maternal and offspring microbiota. Finally, it is suggested that maternal gut microbiota dysbiosis may be significantly exacerbated by the combined effects of stress and ethanol exposure, leading to immune system dysfunction and chronic inflammation, which could increase the risk of depression in the offspring. These interactions underscore the potential for novel mental health interventions that address the gut-brain axis, especially in relation to maternal and offspring health.",International journal of molecular sciences,2024,Rosana Camarini; Priscila Marianno; Maylin Hanampa-Maquera; Samuel Dos Santos Oliveira; Niels Olsen Saraiva Câmara

38776563,Microbiota-brain axis: Exploring the role of gut microbiota in psychiatric disorders - A comprehensive review.,"Mental illness is a hidden epidemic in modern science that has gradually spread worldwide. According to estimates from the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 10% of the world's population suffers from various mental diseases each year. Worldwide, financial and health burdens on society are increasing annually. Therefore, understanding the different factors that can influence mental illness is required to formulate novel and effective treatments and interventions to combat mental illness. Gut microbiota, consisting of diverse microbial communities residing in the gastrointestinal tract, exert profound effects on the central nervous system through the gut-brain axis. The gut-brain axis serves as a conduit for bidirectional communication between the two systems, enabling the gut microbiota to affect emotional and cognitive functions. Dysbiosis, or an imbalance in the gut microbiota, is associated with an increased susceptibility to mental health disorders and psychiatric illnesses. Gut microbiota is one of the most diverse and abundant groups of microbes that have been found to interact with the central nervous system and play important physiological functions in the human gut, thus greatly affecting the development of mental illnesses. The interaction between gut microbiota and mental health-related illnesses is a multifaceted and promising field of study.

39027446,Potential role of gut microbiota in major depressive disorder: A review.,"Interactions between the gut microbiota and host immunity are sophisticated, dynamic, and host-dependent. Scientists have recently conducted research showing that disturbances in the gut bacterial community can lead to a decrease in some metabolites and, consequently, to behaviors such as depression. Exposure to stressors dropped the relative abundance of bacteria in the genus <i>Bacteroides</i> while soaring the relative abundance of bacteria in the genus <i>Clostridium</i>, <i>Coprococcus</i>, <i>Dialister</i>, and Oscillibacter, <i>which</i> were also reduced in people with depression. Microbiota and innate immunity are in a bilateral relationship. The gut microbiota has been shown to induce the synthesis of antimicrobial proteins such as catalysidins, type C lectins, and defensins. Probiotic bacteria can modulate depressive behavior through GABA signaling. The gut microbiome produces essential metabolites such as neurotransmitters, tryptophan metabolites, and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that can act on the CNS. In the case of dysbiosis, due to mucin changes, the ratio of intestinal-derived molecules may change and contribute to depression. Psychotropics, including <i>Bifidobacterium longum</i> NCC3001, <i>Clostridium butyricum</i> CBM588, and <i>Lactobacillus acidophilus,</i> have mental health benefits, and can have a positive effect on the host-brain relationship, and have antidepressant effects.

In the present work, we describe some nutrigenomic effects of dietary fiber, phenolic compounds (plant secondary metabolites), and fatty acids on mental health outcomes, with emphasis on their possible interactions with genetic and epigenetic aspects. Prebiotics, through their effects on the gut microbiota, have been associated with modulation in the neuroendocrine response to stress and the facilitation of the processing of positive emotions. Some of the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms include the serotonin neurotransmitter system (<i>TPH1</i> gene) and the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (inhibition of histone deacetylases). The consumption of phenolic compounds exerts a positive role in neurocognitive domains. The evidence showing the involvement of genetic and epigenetic factors comes mainly from animal models, highlighting the role of epigenetic mechanisms through miRNAs and methyltransferases as well as the effect on the expression of apoptotic-related genes.

CBD interacts with the endocannabinoid system, a complex cell-signaling system that plays a crucial role in regulating various physiological processes, maintaining homeostasis, participating in social and behavioral processing, and neuronal development and maturation with great relevance to ASD. Furthermore, preliminary findings from clinical trials indicate that CBD may have a modulatory effect on specific ASD symptoms and comorbidities in humans. Interestingly, emerging evidence suggests that CBD may influence the gut microbiota, with implications for the bidirectional communication between the gut and the central nervous system. CBD is a safe drug with low induction of side effects. As it has a multi-target pharmacological profile, it becomes a candidate compound for treating the central symptoms and comorbidities of ASD.",International review of neurobiology,2024,João F C Pedrazzi; Lucas Hassib; Frederico R Ferreira; Jaime C Hallak; Elaine Del-Bel; José A Crippa
39426041,"Comparative analysis of gut microbiota in major depressive disorder and schizophrenia during hospitalisation - the case-control, post hoc study.","The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between gut microbiota and major depressive disorder (MDD) and schizophrenia (SCZ) by comparing 36 inpatients with these conditions to 29 healthy controls (HC) matched for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI). Individuals with SCZ exhibited greater microbiota richness compared to HC (FDR P(Q)=0.028). Taxonomically, while no significant differences were observed between the microbiota of MDD and SCZ patients in a head-to-head comparison, both patient groups differed significantly when compared to HC. Interestingly, besides common patterns (such as a higher abundance of Erysipelotrichaceae UCG-003 and Streptococcus, and a lower abundance of Lachnospiraceae ND3007 group), unique patterns were exhibited only in MDD (with a higher abundance of Anaerostipes, Q=0.004) or SCZ (with a higher abundance of Sutterella, Q=0.001, and a lower abundance of Clostridium sensu stricto 1, Q=0.002). The Random Forest algorithm identified Ruminococcus torques group, Lachnospiraceae UCG-001, and Erysipelotrichaceae UCG-003 as highly discriminative features for both SCZ and MDD, while Suturella and Holdemania were unique features for SZC, and Lachnospiraceae genus CAG-56 and Anaerostipes for MDD. Additionally, between 50 % and 60 % of the differentially abundant taxa were found among the top 10 influential features in the RF models. In conclusion, while no significant differences were found between the microbiota of MDD and SCZ patients, distinct microbial patterns were found in each group when compared to HC. The study did not confirm universal microbial biomarkers reported in other studies but showed that the observed differences concern the bacteria associated with inflammation, the production of short chain fatty acids (SCFA), and the synthesis of metabolites linked to mental health (lactic acid, gamma-aminobutyric acid - GABA). The application of machine learning holds promise for further understanding the complex relationship between microbiota and these psychiatric disorders. The observed results should be treated with caution due to the limitations of this study (mainly sample size), therefore further researches under standardized environmental conditions with consistent analytical and bioinformatics approaches are warranted.",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2024,Agata Misera; Mariusz Kaczmarczyk; Igor Łoniewski; Paweł Liśkiewicz; Konrad Podsiadło; Błażej Misiak; Karolina Skonieczna-Żydecka; Jerzy Samochowiec
38660662,Causal roles of gut microbiota in cholangiocarcinoma etiology suggested by genetic study.,"Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a highly malignant biliary tract cancer with poor prognosis. Previous studies have implicated the gut microbiota in CCA, but evidence for causal mechanisms is lacking.To investigate the causal relationship between gut microbiota and CCA risk.We performed a two-sample mendelian randomization study to evaluate potential causal associations between gut microbiota and CCA risk using genome-wide association study summary statistics for 196 gut microbial taxa and CCA. Genetic variants were used as instrumental variables. Multiple sensitivity analyses assessed result robustness.Fifteen gut microbial taxa showed significant causal associations with CCA risk. Higher genetically predicted abundance of <i>genus Eubacteriumnodatum group</i>, <i>genus Ruminococcustorques group</i>, <i>genus Coprococcus</i>, <i>genus Dorea</i>, and <i>phylum Actinobacteria</i> were associated with reduced risk of gallbladder cancer and extrahepatic CCA. Increased intrahepatic CCA risk was associated with higher abundance of <i>family Veillonellaceae</i>, <i>genus Alistipes</i>, <i>order Enterobacteriales</i>, and <i>phylum Firmicutes.</i> Protective effects against CCA were suggested for <i>genus Collinsella</i>, <i>genus Eisenbergiella</i>, <i>genus Anaerostipes</i>, <i>genus Paraprevotella</i>, <i>genus Parasutterella</i>, and <i>phylum Verrucomicrobia.</i> Sensitivity analyses indicated these findings were reliable without pleiotropy.This pioneering study provides novel evidence that specific gut microbiota may play causal roles in CCA risk. Further experimental validation of these candidate microbes is warranted to consolidate causality and mechanisms.",World journal of gastrointestinal oncology,2024,Zhi-Tao Chen; Chen-Chen Ding; Kai-Lei Chen; Yang-Jun Gu; Chi-Cheng Lu; Qi-Yong Li
38589422,Transplantation of gut microbiota derived from patients with schizophrenia induces schizophrenia-like behaviors and dysregulated brain transcript response in mice.,"Schizophrenia (SCZ), as a neurodevelopmental disorder and devastating disease, affects approximately 1% of the world population. Although numerous studies have attempted to elucidate the causes of SCZ occurrence, it is not clearly understood. Recently, the emerging roles of the gut microbiota in a range of brain disorders, including SCZ, have attracted much attention. While the molecular mechanism of gut microbiota in regulating the pathogenesis of SCZ is still lacking. Here, we first confirmed the difference of gut microbiome between SCZ patients and healthy controls, and then, we performed fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to clarify the roles of SCZ patients-derived microbiota in a specific pathogen free (SPF) mice model. 16 S rDNA sequencing confirmed that a significant difference of gut microbiome was present between two groups of FMT mice, which has a similar trend with the above human gut microbiome. Furthermore, we found that transplantation of fecal microbiota from SCZ patients into SPF mice was sufficient to induce schizophrenia-like (SCZ-like) symptoms, such as deficits in sociability and hyperactivity. Furthermore, the brains of mice colonized with SCZ microbiota displayed dysregulated transcript response and alternative splicing of SCZ-relevant genes. Moreover, 10 key genes were identified to be correlated with SCZ by an integrative transcriptome data analysis. Finally, 4 key genes were identified to be correlated with the 12 differential genera between two groups of FMT mice. Our results thus demonstrated that the gut microbiome might modify the transcriptomic profile in the brain, thereby modulating social behavior, and our present study can help better understand the link between gut microbiota and SCZ pathogenesis through the gut-brain axis.","Schizophrenia (Heidelberg, Germany)",2024,Nana Wei; Mingliang Ju; Xichen Su; Yan Zhang; Yonghe Huang; Xinyue Rao; Li Cui; Zhibing Lin; Yi Dong
38983862,Current landscape of fecal microbiota transplantation in treating depression.,"Depression, projected to be the predominant contributor to the global disease burden, is a complex condition with diverse symptoms including mood disturbances and cognitive impairments. Traditional treatments such as medication and psychotherapy often fall short, prompting the pursuit of alternative interventions. Recent research has highlighted the significant role of gut microbiota in mental health, influencing emotional and neural regulation. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), the infusion of fecal matter from a healthy donor into the gut of a patient, emerges as a promising strategy to ameliorate depressive symptoms by restoring gut microbial balance. The microbial-gut-brain (MGB) axis represents a critical pathway through which to potentially rectify dysbiosis and modulate neuropsychiatric outcomes. Preclinical studies reveal that FMT can enhance neurochemicals and reduce inflammatory markers, thereby alleviating depressive behaviors. Moreover, FMT has shown promise in clinical settings, improving gastrointestinal symptoms and overall quality of life in patients with depression. The review highlights the role of the gut-brain axis in depression and the need for further research to validate the long-term safety and efficacy of FMT, identify specific therapeutic microbial strains, and develop targeted microbial modulation strategies. Advancing our understanding of FMT could revolutionize depression treatment, shifting the paradigm toward microbiome-targeting therapies.",Frontiers in immunology,2024,Qi Zhang; Yajun Bi; Boyu Zhang; Qiong Jiang; Chao Kam Mou; Lelin Lei; Yibo Deng; Yutong Li; Jing Yu; Wei Liu; Jinzhu Zhao
39015337,Investigations of microbiota composition and neuroactive pathways in association with symptoms of stress and depression in a cohort of healthy women.,"Despite mounting evidence of gut-brain involvement in psychiatric conditions, functional data remain limited, and analyses of other microbial niches, such as the vaginal microbiota, are lacking in relation to mental health. This aim of this study was to investigate if the connections between the gut microbiome and mental health observed in populations with a clinical diagnosis of mental illness extend to healthy women experiencing stress and depressive symptoms. Additionally, this study examined the functional pathways of the gut microbiota according to the levels of psychological symptoms. Furthermore, the study aimed to explore potential correlations between the vaginal microbiome and mental health parameters in young women without psychiatric diagnoses.In this cross-sectional study, 160 healthy Danish women (aged 18-40 years) filled out questionnaires with validated scales measuring symptoms of stress and depression and frequency of dietary intake. Fecal and vaginal microbiota samples were collected at the beginning of the menstrual cycle and vaginal samples were also collected at cycle day 8-12 and 18-22. Shotgun metagenomic profiling of the gut and vaginal microbiome was performed. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) was used for functional profiling and 56 Gut Brain Modules were analyzed in the fecal samples.The relative abundance in the gut of the genera <i>Escherichia</i>, <i>Parabacteroides</i>, and <i>Shigella</i> was higher in women with elevated depressive symptoms. Women with high perceived stress showed a tendency of increased abundance of <i>Escherichia</i>, <i>Shigella</i>, and <i>Blautia</i>. Amongst others, the potentially pathogenic genera, Escherichia and Shigella correlate with alterations in the neuroactive pathways such as the glutamatergic, GABAeric, dopaminergic, and Kynurenine pathways. Vaginosis symptoms were more prevalent in women reporting high levels of stress and depressive symptoms.The findings of this study support the concept of a microbiota-associated effect on the neuroactive pathways even in healthy young women. This suggest, that targeting the gut microbiome could be a promising approach for future psychiatric interventions.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2024,Zahra Bashir; Luisa W Hugerth; Maria Christine Krog; Stefanie Prast-Nielsen; Gabriella Edfeldt; Fredrik Boulund; Simon Rønnow Schacht; Inge Tetens; Lars Engstrand; Ina Schuppe-Koistinen; Emma Fransson; Henriette Svarre Nielsen
39134099,Contrasting the pharmacokinetic performance and gut microbiota effects of an amorphous solid dispersion and lipid nanoemulsion for a poorly water-soluble anti-psychotic.,"Increasing attention is being afforded to understanding the bidirectional relationship that exists between oral drugs and the gut microbiota. Often overlooked, however, is the impact that pharmaceutical excipients exert on the gut microbiota. Subsequently, in this study, we contrasted the pharmacokinetic performance and gut microbiota interactions between two commonly employed formulations for poorly soluble compounds, namely 1) an amorphous solid dispersion (ASD) stabilised by poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) K-30, and 2) a lipid nanoemulsion (LNE) comprised of medium chain glycerides and lecithin. The poorly soluble antipsychotic, lurasidone, was formulated with ASD and LNE due to its rate-limiting dissolution, poor oral bioavailability, and significant food effect. Both the ASD and LNE were shown to facilitate lurasidone supersaturation within in vitro dissolution studies simulating the gastrointestinal environment. This translated into profound improvements in oral pharmacokinetics in rats, with the ASD and LNE exerting comparable ∼ 2.5-fold improvements in lurasidone bioavailability, compared to the pure drug. The oral formulations imparted contrasting effects on the gut microbiota, with the LNE depleting the richness and abundance of the microbial ecosystem, as evidenced through reductions in alpha diversity (Chao1 index) and operational taxonomical units (OTUs). In contrast, the ASD exerted a 'gut neutral' effect, whereby a mild enrichment of alpha diversity and OTUs was observed. Importantly, this suggests that ASDs are effective solubility-enhancing formulations that can be used without comprising the integrity of the gut microbiota - an integral consideration in the treatment of mental health disorders, such as schizophrenia, due to the role of the gut microbiota in regulating mood and cognition.",European journal of pharmaceutics and biopharmaceutics : official journal of Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Pharmazeutische Verfahrenstechnik e.V,2024,Tahlia R Meola; Srinivas Kamath; Aurelia S Elz; Clive A Prestidge; Anthony Wignall; Paul Joyce

37071196,Development of the gut microbiota in the first 14 years of life and its relations to internalizing and externalizing difficulties and social anxiety during puberty.,"Relations between the gut microbiota and host mental health have been suggested by a growing number of case-control and cross-sectional studies, while supporting evidence is limited in large community samples followed during an extended period. Therefore, the current preregistered study ( https://osf.io/8ymav , September 7, 2022) described child gut microbiota development in the first 14 years of life and explored its relations to internalizing and externalizing difficulties and social anxiety in puberty, a period of high relevance for the development of mental health problems. Fecal microbiota composition was analysed by 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing in a total of 1003 samples from 193 children. Through a clustering method, four distinct microbial clusters were newly identified in puberty. Most children within three of these clusters remained in the same clusters from the age of 12 to 14 years, suggesting stability in microbial development and transition during this period. These three clusters were compositionally similar to enterotypes (i.e., a robust classification of the gut microbiota based on its composition across different populations) enriched in Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Ruminococcus, respectively. Two Prevotella 9-predominated clusters, including one reported by us earlier in middle childhood and the other one in puberty, were associated with more externalizing behavior at age 14. One Faecalibacterium-depleted pubertal cluster was related to more social anxiety at age 14. This finding was confirmed by a negative cross-sectional relation between Faecalibacterium and social anxiety in the 14-year-olds. The findings of this study continue to map gut microbiota development in a relatively large community sample followed from birth onwards, importantly extending our knowledge to puberty. Results indicate that Prevotella 9 and Faecalibacterium may be relevant microbial taxa in relation to externalizing behavior and social anxiety, respectively.

Specifically, probiotics have drawn more attention as effective alternative treatments, considering the rising cost of antidepressant and anti-anxiety drugs and the high risk of side effects. Depression and anxiety disorders are among the most common mental illnesses in the world's population, characterised by low mood, poor general interest, and cognitive or motor dysfunction. Thus, this study analysed published literature on anxiety, depression, and probiotic supplementation from PubMed and Scopus, focusing on the last twenty years. This study focused on the effect of probiotics on mental health as they have drawn more attention because of their extensive clinical applications and positive impact on various diseases. Numerous studies have demonstrated how the gut microbiota might be critical for mood regulation and how probiotics can affect host health by regulating the gut-brain axis. By comparing the different works analysed, it was possible to identify a strategy by which they are selected and employed and, at the same time, to assess how the effect of probiotics can be optimised using postbiotics, an innovation to improve mental well-being in humans.",Journal of traditional and complementary medicine,2024,Sara Ferrari; Simone Mulè; Francesca Parini; Rebecca Galla; Sara Ruga; Giorgia Rosso; Arianna Brovero; Claudio Molinari; Francesca Uberti

Behavioral tests for depression-like behaviors were performed 7 days after sham or HI/R injury surgery. Mice with HI/R injury exhibited splenomegaly, systemic inflammation, depression-like behaviors, reduced expression of synaptic proteins in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), abnormal composition of gut microbiota, and altered blood metabolites and lipids. Furthermore, there were positive or negative correlations between the relative abundance of microbiome and behavioral data or blood metabolites (or lipids). Moreover, subdiaphragmatic vagotomy significantly blocked these changes in mice with HI/R injury. Notably, depression-like phenotypes in mice with HI/R injury were ameliorated after subsequent single injection of the new antidepressant arketamine.

38350463,Gut production of GABA by a probiotic formula: an in vitro study.,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of a probiotic formula on the production of neuroactive compounds in different parts of the colon in batch culture and in vitro gut simulator experiments. Thirteen lactic acid bacterial strains, belonging to the species Levilactobacillus brevis, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei, Ligilactobacillus salivarius, Streptococcus thermophilus, were characterised for their in vitro ability to produce neurotransmitters. L. brevis P30021 and L. plantarum P30025 were selected based on their capability to produce γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and acetylcholine in vitro. A probiotic formulation with potential psychobiotic activity was prepared and tested in a batch culture of human microbiota monitoring the formation of GABA and acetylcholine. Samples of the three colonic tracts were taken from the Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbiota (SHIME®) evaluating the production of GABA and other neurotransmitters by LC-MS. Short chain fatty acids (SCFA) by GC and microbiota composition by 16S rRNA gene sequencing were also determined. Probiotic supplementation led to the formation of GABA and acetylcholine with a decrease in glutamate concentrations in the in vitro batch fermentation. Production of GABA after the treatment with probiotics was confirmed in the SHIME® short-term experiment. No differences in short-chain fatty acids were observed up to 72 h of fermentation. Different microbiota composition was found in the three different parts of the colon, with a higher abundance of Veillonellaceae in the ascending colon vessels. The probiotic-exposed microbiota showed higher levels of Bacteroides, a gut microbe associated with anti-inflammatory activities and a potential GABA producer. Results demonstrate the impact of the tested probiotic formula on gut microbiota structure and GABA production. In conclusion, the probiotic treatment changed the microbiota composition and increased neuroactive metabolites production, indicating promising potential as psychobiotics, even if further clinical evidence is needed to confirm the effectiveness of these probiotics in improving mental health.",Beneficial microbes,2024,M Casertano; C Fryganas; V Valentino; A D Troise; P Vitaglione; V Fogliano; D Ercolini
39021622,Baseline gut microbiota profiles affect treatment response in patients with depression.,"The role of the gut microbiota in the pathophysiology of depression has been explored in numerous studies, which have confirmed that the baseline gut microbial profiles of patients with depression differ from those of healthy individuals. The gut microbiome affects metabolic activity in the immune and central nervous systems and regulates intestinal ecology through the neuroendocrine system. Additionally, baseline changes in the gut microbiota differed among patients with depression who demonstrated varying treatment response. Currently, probiotics are an emerging treatment for depression; however, the efficacy of modulating the gut microbiota in the treatment of depression remains uncertain. Additionally, the mechanisms by which changes in the gut microbiota affect treatment response in patients with depression remain unclear. In this review, we aimed to summarize the differences in the baseline gut microbiota between the remission and non-remission groups after antidepressant therapy. Additionally, we summarized the possible mechanisms that may contribute to antidepressant resistance through the effects of the gut microbiome on the immune and nervous systems, various enzymes, bioaccumulation, and blood-brain barrier, and provide a basis for treating depression by targeting the gut microbiota.",Frontiers in microbiology,2024,Yingjing Xie; Hanwen Zhu; Yanling Yuan; Xuan Guan; Qinglian Xie; Zaiquan Dong
39203794,Effects of Physical Exercise on the Microbiota in Irritable Bowel Syndrome.,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a prevalent functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, and constipation. Recent studies have underscored the significant role of the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBS. Physical exercise, as a non-pharmacological intervention, has been proposed to alleviate IBS symptoms by modulating the gut microbiota. Aerobic exercise, such as running, swimming, and cycling, has been shown to enhance the diversity and abundance of beneficial gut bacteria, including Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. These bacteria produce short-chain fatty acids that possess anti-inflammatory properties and support gut barrier integrity. Studies involving IBS patients participating in structured aerobic exercise programs have reported significant improvements in their gut microbiota's composition and diversity, alongside an alleviation of symptoms like abdominal pain and bloating. Additionally, exercise positively influences mental health by reducing stress and improving mood, which can further relieve IBS symptoms via the gut-brain axis. Long-term exercise interventions provide sustained benefits, maintaining the gut microbiota's diversity and stability, supporting immune functions, and reducing systemic inflammation. However, exercise programs must be tailored to individual needs to avoid exacerbating IBS symptoms. Personalized exercise plans starting with low-to-moderate intensity and gradually increasing in intensity can maximize the benefits and minimize risks. This review examines the impact of various types and intensities of physical exercise on the gut microbiota in IBS patients, highlighting the need for further studies to explore optimal exercise protocols. Future research should include larger sample sizes, longer follow-up periods, and examine the synergistic effects of exercise and other lifestyle modifications. Integrating physical exercise into comprehensive IBS management plans can enhance symptom control and improve patients' quality of life.",Nutrients,2024,Chunpeng Li; Jianmin Li; Qiaorui Zhou; Can Wang; Jiahui Hu; Chang Liu
38565567,Gamma-aminobutyric acid as a potential postbiotic mediator in the gut-brain axis.,"Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) plays a crucial role in the central nervous system as an inhibitory neurotransmitter. Imbalances of this neurotransmitter are associated with neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, and psychological disorders, including anxiety, depression, and stress. Since GABA has long been believed to not cross the blood-brain barrier, the effects of circulating GABA on the brain are neglected. However, emerging evidence has demonstrated that changes in both circulating and brain levels of GABA are associated with changes in gut microbiota composition and that changes in GABA levels and microbiota composition play a role in modulating mental health. This recent research has raised the possibility that GABA may be a potent mediator of the gut-brain axis. This review article will cover up-to-date information about GABA-producing microorganisms isolated from human gut and food sources, explanation why those microorganisms produce GABA, food factors inducing gut-GABA production, evidence suggesting GABA as a mediator linking between gut microbiota and mental health, including anxiety, depression, stress, epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and novel information regarding homocarnosine-a predominant brain peptide that is a putative downstream mediator of GABA in regulating brain functions. This review will help us to understand how the gut microbiota and GABA-homocarnosine metabolism play a significant role in brain functions. Nonetheless, it could support further research on the use of GABA production-inducing microorganisms and food factors as agents to treat neurological and psychological disorders.",NPJ science of food,2024,Jason D Braga; Masubon Thongngam; Thanutchaporn Kumrungsee
39065244,Gut Microbiota Composition Is Causally Linked to Multiple Sclerosis: A Mendelian Randomization Analysis.,"Accumulating evidence links the microbial communities inhabiting the gut to the pathophysiological processes underlying multiple sclerosis (MS). However, most studies on the microbiome in MS are correlative in nature, thus being at risk of confounding and reverse causality. Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses allow the estimation of the causal relationship between a risk factor and an outcome of interest using genetic variants as proxies for environmental exposures. Here, we performed a two-sample MR to assess the causality between the gut microbiome and MS. We extracted genetic instruments from summary statistics from three large genome-wide association studies (GWASs) on the gut microbiome (18,340, 8959, and 7738 subjects). The exposure data were derived from the latest GWAS on MS susceptibility (47,429 patients and 68,374 controls). We pinpointed several microbial strains whose abundance is linked with enhanced MS risk (<i>Actinobacteria</i> class, <i>Bifidobacteriaceae</i> family, <i>Lactobacillus</i> genus) or protection (<i>Prevotella</i> spp., <i>Lachnospiranaceae</i> genus, <i>Negativibacillus</i> genus). The largest risk effect was seen for <i>Ruminococcus Torques</i> (OR, 2.89, 95% C.I. 1.67-5, <i>p</i> = 1.51 × 10<sup>-4</sup>), while <i>Akkermansia municiphila</i> emerged as strongly protective (OR, 0.43, 95% C.I. 0.32-0.57, <i>p</i> = 1.37 × 10<sup>-8</sup>). Our findings support a causal relationship between the gut microbiome and MS susceptibility, reinforcing the relevance of the microbiome-gut-brain axis in disease etiology, opening wider perspectives on host-environmental interactions for MS prevention.",Microorganisms,2024,Valeria Zancan; Martina Nasello; Rachele Bigi; Roberta Reniè; Maria Chiara Buscarinu; Rosella Mechelli; Giovanni Ristori; Marco Salvetti; Gianmarco Bellucci
38903788,"Investigating the effects of radiation, T cell depletion, and bone marrow transplantation on murine gut microbiota.","Microbiome research has gained much attention in recent years as the importance of gut microbiota in regulating host health becomes increasingly evident. However, the impact of radiation on the microbiota in the murine bone marrow transplantation model is still poorly understood. In this paper, we present key findings from our study on how radiation, followed by bone marrow transplantation with or without T cell depletion, impacts the microbiota in the ileum and caecum. Our findings show that radiation has different effects on the microbiota of the two intestinal regions, with the caecum showing increased interindividual variation, suggesting an impaired ability of the host to regulate microbial symbionts, consistent with the Anna Karenina principle. Additionally, we observed changes in the ileum composition, including an increase in bacterial taxa that are important modulators of host health, such as <i>Akkermansia</i> and <i>Faecalibaculum</i>. In contrast, radiation in the caecum was associated with an increased abundance of several common commensal taxa in the gut, including <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> and <i>Bacteroides</i>. Finally, we found that high doses of radiation had more substantial effects on the caecal microbiota of the T-cell-depleted group than that of the non-T-cell-depleted group. Overall, our results contribute to a better understanding of the complex relationship between radiation and the gut microbiota in the context of bone marrow transplantation and highlight the importance of considering different intestinal regions when studying microbiome responses to environmental stressors.",Frontiers in microbiology,2024,Jakub Kreisinger; James Dooley; Kailash Singh; Dagmar Čížková; Lucie Schmiedová; Barbora Bendová; Adrian Liston; Alena Moudra
38405047,Depression and the Aberrant Intestinal Microbiome.,"Depression is one of the most common mental health disorders affecting adults in the United States. The current treatment is the combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. Recently, the evidence linking gut microbiome dysregulation to the development of depression has grown. The pathophysiology is currently poorly understood, although leading hypotheses include involvement of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, a bidirectional relationship between the gut microbiome and the central nervous system, and production of signaling molecules by the gut microbiome. Available and emerging treatments of the aberrant microbiome include antidepressants, antibiotics, diet modification, probiotics, and fecal microbiota transplant. This article explores the interconnectivity of gut microbiota and depression and treatments targeted toward the gut, reviews the gastroenterologist's potential role in managing gut dysbiosis in patients with depression, and highlights research topics to be addressed to create evidence-based guidelines.",Gastroenterology & hepatology,2024,Ann F Kopera; Yii Chun Khiew; Mohd Amer Alsamman; Mark C Mattar; Raena S Olsen; David B Doman
38875919,Antibiotic exposure and depression incidence: A cohort study of the Korean population.,"Recent research highlights the crucial role of the gut-brain axis in understanding depression etiologies. While burgeoning studies suggest an association between disruptions in gut microbiota and the development of depression, limited longitudinal studies have investigated this link. To address this gap, we conducted a retrospective cohort study using National Health Insurance Service-Health Screening Cohort (NHIS-HEALS) data in South Korea, involving 199,144 individuals aged 40-79. We examined the impact of cumulative antibiotic exposure (2004-2008) on subsequent depression incidence (2009-2013) by conducting Cox proportional hazards regressions. Our findings show an increasing depression risk with extended antibiotic exposure after adjusting for comorbidities and behavioral covariates. A broader antibiotic spectrum was associated with a higher depression risk. These trends persisted after adjusting for the original antibiotic indications. In conclusion, our study highlights the duration-dependent association between antibiotic exposure and increased depression risk, offering insights into depression etiologies and relevant novel therapeutic tools, and advocating for heightened antibiotic stewardship considering their impact on mental health.",Psychiatry research,2024,Jaewon Lee; Sun Jae Park; Seulggie Choi; Jooyoung Chang; Young Jun Park; Seogsong Jeong; Joung Sik Son; Gyeongsil Lee; Joseph C Ahn; Jihoon Andrew Kim; Sang Min Park
39125364,Maternal Fiber Intake and Perinatal Depression and Anxiety.,"(1) Background: Dietary fiber can significantly alter gut microbiota composition. The role of the gut microbiome in the Gut-Brain Axis and modulation of neuropsychiatric disease is increasingly recognized. The role of antenatal diet, particularly fiber intake, in mitigating maternal mental health disorders remains unexplored. The objective of this review is to investigate the association between maternal fiber intake and perinatal depression and anxiety (PDA). (2) Methods: A literature review of PubMed and Google Scholar was conducted using appropriate keyword/MeSH terms for pregnancy, diet, fiber, and mental health. Observational and clinical trials published between 2015 and 2021 were included and data pertaining to dietary patterns (DP), food intake, mental health, and demographic data were extracted. The top three fiber-containing food groups (FG) per study were identified using a sum rank scoring system of fiber per 100 g and fiber per serving size. The consumption of these top three fiber FGs was then ranked for each dietary pattern/group. Mental health outcomes for each study were simplified into three categories of improved, no change, and worsened. The relationship between top three fiber FGs consumed within each DP and mental health outcomes was analyzed using Spearman's correlation. (3) Results: Thirteen of fifty-two studies met the inclusion criteria. Ten (76.9%) studies assessed DPs (seven examined depression only, two examined depression and anxiety, and one examined anxiety only). Seven (53.9%) studies reported at least one significant positive relationship between mental health outcomes and DPs while three reported at least one negative outcome. Three (23.1%) studies compared intake of different food groups between depressed and non-depressed groups. In studies of DPs, the average consumption ranking of the top three fiber FGs bore a significant inverse association with mental health outcomes [r = -0.419 (95%CI: -0.672--0.078)] <i>p</i> = 0.015. In studies comparing the intake of different FGs between depressed and non-depressed groups, the consumption of top-ranking fiber foods was higher in the non-depressed groups, but significantly higher in four of the ten high fiber FGs. (4) Conclusions: This study reframes findings from previously published studies of maternal diet and mental health outcomes to focus on fiber intake specifically, using a fiber ranking system. A significant correlation between lower intake of fiber and poorer mental health outcomes warrants further investigation in future studies.",Nutrients,2024,Neda Ebrahimi; Tiffany Turner; Faith Gallant; Abinaa Chandrakumar; Roshni Kohli; Rebecca Lester; Victoria Forte; Kieran Cooley
38748594,Microbiota transplantation in restoring cesarean-related infant dysbiosis: a new frontier.,"C-section is crucial in reducing maternal and neonatal mortality when medically indicated, but one of its side effects could be the disruption of vertical transmission of maternal-infant microbiota during delivery, potentially leading to gut dysbiosis and increased disease risks in C-section infants. To address such dysbiosis, it seems reasonable to supplement ""what is missing"" during C-section procedure. This idea has prompted several clinical trials, including proof-of-concept, investigating interventions like vaginal microbial seeding, oral administration of maternal vaginal microbes and even oral administration of maternal fecal materials. Hereby, we have summarized these trials to help understand the current state of these researches, highlighting the predominantly pilot nature of most of these studies and emphasizing the need for well-designed studies with larger sample to guide evidence-based medicine in the future.",Gut microbes,2024,Sina Liu; Xiaoxia Luo; Lepeng Zhou; Ri-Hua Xie; Yan He
39187187,Is anxiety and depression transmissible? Depressed mother rats transmit anxiety- and depression-like phenotypes to cohabited rat pups through gut microbiota assimilation.,"This study is to investigate the role of gut microbiota transmission in the development of anxiety/depression in offspring exposed to maternal depression.Offspring rats were cohabitated with their depressed mother or father rats (which exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)) for 2, 4, and 6 months, the anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, and interaction/caring activities between mother/father and their pups were detected. The gut microbiota composition and its relationship with behaviors were analyzed. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) was performed to establish the gut microbiota of depressed/normal mother rats in the offspring rats to further confirm the role of ""depressive gut microbiota"" transmission in mediating the anxiety/depression in the pups.Anxiety and depression phenotypes can be transmitted from depressed mother rats to their cohabited offspring. Frequent interactions and gut microbiota assimilation were observed between rat mothers and their pups. Remodeling of the gut microbiota in pups by FMT could induce or attenuate anxiety- and depression-like phenotypes depending on the origin of the fecal microbiota. By comparison, the pups cohabiting with depressed father rats exhibited milder anxiety and depression.These data together support that depressed mothers can transmit anxiety/depression to their pups through gut microbiota assimilation, which is related to frequent interactions. Our study reinforces the significance of mental health of mothers in preventing the occurrence of childhood anxiety and depression, and pointing out the possibility of remodeling intestinal microbiota as an effective therapeutic approach for treating anxiety/depression in children.",Journal of affective disorders,2024,Huiliang Zhang; Hui Wei; Xuan Qin; Haiyue Song; Mengzhe Yang; Lun Zhang; Yi Liu; Zhuoqun Wang; Yiren Zhang; Yiwen Lai; Jiayu Yang; Yu Chen; Zhongshan Chen; Ji Zeng; Xiaochuan Wang; Rong Liu
38350544,Exploring environmental exposomes and the gut-brain nexus: Unveiling the impact of pesticide exposure.,"This review delves into the escalating concern of environmental pollutants and their profound impact on human health in the context of the modern surge in global diseases. The utilisation of chemicals in food production, which results in residues in food, has emerged as a major concern nowadays. By exploring the intricate relationship between environmental pollutants and gut microbiota, the study reveals a dynamic bidirectional interplay, as modifying microbiota profile influences metabolic pathways and subsequent brain functions. This review will first provide an overview of potential exposomes and their effect to gut health. This paper is then emphasis the connection of gut brain function by analysing microbiome markers with neurotoxicity responses. We then take pesticide as example of exposome to elucidate their influence to biomarkers biosynthesis pathways and subsequent brain functions. The interconnection between neuroendocrine and neuromodulators elements and the gut-brain axis emerges as a pivotal factor in regulating mental health and brain development. Thus, manipulation of gut microbiota function at the onset of stress may offer a potential avenue for the prevention and treatment for mental disorder and other neurodegenerative illness.",Environmental research,2024,Shing Ching Khoo; Nan Zhang; Vijitra Luang-In; Meng Shien Goh; Christian Sonne; Nyuk Ling Ma
38226944,Gut microbiota composition may be an indicator of erectile dysfunction.,"Erectile Dysfunction (ED) is considered a physical and mental illness. A variety of potential associations between gut microbiota and health or disease have been found. By comparing the gut microbiota of healthy controls and ED patients, our study investigated the relationship between ED and gut microbiota. The results revealed that the ED group exhibited a significantly higher relative abundance of Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Lachnoclostridium, Escherichia-Shigella and Megamonas, while showing a significantly lower relative abundance of Bifidobacterium compared to the control group. The dysbiosis of gut microbiota played a role in the onset and progression of ED by influencing the gut barrier, cardiovascular system and mental health, which provided a novel perspective on understanding the pathophysiology of ED. What is more, we had identified several key gut microbiota. By combining 16S rRNA sequencing with machine learning techniques, we were able to uncover the significant value and impact of gut microbiota in the early detection of ED.",Microbial biotechnology,2024,Yu Qiao; Jianhuai Chen; Yongsheng Jiang; Ziheng Zhang; Heng Wang; Tao Liu; Zhaoxu Yang; Guangbo Fu; Yun Chen
39339649,Nutraceutical Capsules LL1 and Silymarin Supplementation Act on Mood and Sleep Quality Perception by Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis: A Pilot Clinical Study.,"Stress, unhealthy lifestyle, and sleep disturbance worsen cognitive function in mood disorders, prompting a rise in the development of integrative health approaches. The recent investigations in the gut-brain axis field highlight the strong interplay among microbiota, inflammation, and mental health. Thus, this study aimed to investigate a new nutraceutical formulation comprising prebiotics, minerals, and silymarin's impact on microbiota, inflammation, mood, and sleep quality. The study evaluated the LL1 + silymarin capsule supplementation over 180 days in overweight adults. We analyzed the fecal gut microbiota using partial 16S rRNA sequences, measured cytokine expression via CBA, collected anthropometric data, quality of life, and sleep questionnaire responses, and obtained plasma samples for metabolic and hormonal analysis at baseline (T0) and 180 days (T180) post-supplementation. Our findings revealed significant reshaping in gut microbiota composition at the phylum, genus, and species levels, especially in the butyrate-producer bacteria post-supplementation. These changes in gut microbiota were linked to enhancements in sleep quality, mood perception, cytokine expression, and anthropometric measures which microbiota-derived short-chain fatty acids might enhance. The supplementation tested in this study seems to be able to improve microbiota composition, reflecting anthropometrics and inflammation, as well as sleep quality and mood improvement.",Nutrients,2024,Aline Boveto Santamarina; Victor Nehmi Filho; Jéssica Alves de Freitas; Lucas Augusto Moysés Franco; Joyce Vanessa Fonseca; Roberta Cristina Martins; José Antônio Orellana Turri; Bruna Fernanda Rio Branco da Silva; Arianne Fagotti Gusmão; Eloísa Helena Ribeiro Olivieri; José Pinhata Otoch; Ana Flávia Marçal Pessoa
39121711,The gut-microbiome in adult Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder - A Meta-analysis.,"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental condition that persists into adulthood in the majority of individuals. While the gut-microbiome seems to be relevant for ADHD, the few publications on gut-microbial alterations in ADHD are inconsistent, in the investigated phenotypes, sequencing method/region, preprocessing, statistical approaches, and findings. To identify gut-microbiome alterations in adult ADHD, robust across studies and statistical approaches, we harmonized bioinformatic pipelines and analyses of raw 16S rRNA sequencing data from four adult ADHD case-control studies (N<sub>ADHD</sub>=312, N<sub>NoADHD</sub>=305). We investigated diversity and differential abundance of selected genera (logistic regression and ANOVA-like Differential Expression tool), corrected for age and sex, and meta-analyzed the study results. Converging results were investigated for association with hyperactive/impulsive and inattentive symptoms across all participants. Beta diversity was associated with ADHD diagnosis but showed significant heterogeneity between cohorts, despite harmonized analyses. Several genera were robustly associated with adult ADHD; e.g., Ruminococcus_torques_group (LogOdds=0.17, p<sub>fdr</sub>=4.42 × 10<sup>-2</sup>), which was more abundant in adults with ADHD, and Eubacterium_xylanophilum_group (LogOdds= -0.12, p<sub>fdr</sub>=6.9 × 10<sup>-3</sup>), which was less abundant in ADHD. Ruminococcus_torques_group was further associated with hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms and Eisenbergiella with inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity (p<sub>fdr</sub><0.05). The literature points towards a role of these genera in inflammatory processes. Irreproducible results in the field of gut-microbiota research, due to between study heterogeneity and small sample sizes, stress the need for meta-analytic approaches and large sample sizes. While we robustly identified genera associated with adult ADHD, that might overall be considered beneficial or risk-conferring, functional studies are needed to shed light on these properties.",European neuropsychopharmacology : the journal of the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology,2024,Babette Jakobi; Priscilla Vlaming; Danique Mulder; Marta Ribases; Vanesa Richarte; Josep Antoni Ramos-Quiroga; Indira Tendolkar; Philip van Eijndhoven; Janna N Vrijsen; Jan Buitelaar; Barbara Franke; Martine Hoogman; Mirjam Bloemendaal; Alejandro Arias-Vasquez
39195546,Alterations in Vagal Tone Are Associated with Changes in the Gut Microbiota of Adults with Anxiety and Depression Symptoms: Analysis of Fecal Metabolite Profiles.,"Accumulating evidence suggests that interactions between the brain and gut microbiota significantly impact brain function and mental health. In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether young, healthy adults without psychiatric diagnoses exhibit differences in metabolic stool and microbiota profiles based on depression/anxiety scores and heart rate variability (HRV) parameters. Untargeted nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabolomics was used to identify fecal metabolic profiles. Results were subjected to multivariate analysis through principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and the metabolites were identified through VIP score. Metabolites separating asymptomatic and symptomatic groups were acetate, valine, and glutamate, followed by sugar regions, glutamine, acetone, valerate, and acetoacetate. The main metabolites identified in high vagal tone (HVT) and low vagal tone (LVT) groups were acetate, valerate, and glutamate, followed by propionate and butyrate. In addition to the metabolites identified by the PLS-DA test, significant differences in aspartate, sarcosine, malate, and methionine were observed between the groups. Levels of acetoacetate were higher in both symptomatic and LVT groups. Valerate levels were significantly increased in the symptomatic group, while isovalerate, propionate, glutamate, and acetone levels were significantly increased in the LVT group. Furthermore, distinct abundance between groups was only confirmed for the Firmicutes phylum. Differences between participants with high and low vagal tone suggest that certain metabolites are involved in communication between the vagus nerve and the brain.",Metabolites,2024,Laura Pasqualette; Tatiana Kelly da Silva Fidalgo; Liana Bastos Freitas-Fernandes; Gabriela Guerra Leal Souza; Luís Aureliano Imbiriba; Leandro Araujo Lobo; Eliane Volchan; Regina Maria Cavalcanti Pilotto Domingues; Ana Paula Valente; Karla Rodrigues Miranda
39247907,Modifications in the Composition of the Gut Microbiota in Rats Induced by Chronic Sleep Deprivation: Potential Relation to Mental Disorders.,"Sleep deprivation(SD) has numerous negative effects on mental health. A growing body of research has confirmed the implication of gut microbiota in mental disorders. However, the specific modifications in mammalian gut microbiota following SD exhibit variations across different studies.Male specific-pathogen-free Wistar rats were given a modified multiple-platform exposure for 7 days of SD. Fecal samples were obtained from the control and SD groups both at baseline and after 7 days of SD. We utilized 16S rDNA gene sequencing to investigate the gut microbial composition and functional pathways in rats.Analysis of the microbiota composition revealed a significant change in gut microbial composition after chronic SD, especially at the phylum level. The relative abundances of <i>p_Firmicutes, g_Romboutsia</i>, and <i>g_Enterococcus</i> increased, whereas those of <i>p_Bacteroidetes, p_Verrucomicrobia, p_Fusobacteria, g_Akkermansia</i>, and <i>g_Cetobacterium</i> decreased in animals after chronic SD compared with controls or animals before SD. The ratio of <i>Firmicutes</i> to <i>Bacteroidetes</i> exhibited an increase following SD. The relative abundance of gut microbiota related to the functional pathways of GABAergic and glutamatergic synapses was observed to be diminished in rats following SD compared to pre-SD.Collectively, these findings suggest that chronic SD causes significant alterations in both the structural composition and functional pathways of the gut microbiome. Further researches are necessary to investigate the chronological and causal connections among SD, the gut microbiota and mental disorders.",Nature and science of sleep,2024,Li-Ming Zheng; Yan Li
38852801,Levilactobacillus brevis SG031 modulates mood-related behaviors and attenuates stress-related sleep disturbance and autonomic dysfunction via gut microbiota modulation in Wistar-Kyoto rats.,"The probiotic bacterium Levilactobacillus brevis (L. brevis) has been proposed as a potential solution to manage mood disorders and alleviate stress-related sleep disturbances. However, the underlying mechanisms of its effects have not been fully elucidated. The aim of this study was to explore the impact and potential mechanisms of L. brevis SG031 supplementation on anxiety/depression-like behaviors and stress-induced changes in sleep patterns and sleep-related autonomic function.Male Wistar-Kyoto rats were administered low, medium, or high doses of L. brevis SG031 or a vehicle for 4 weeks, followed by behavioral tests to evaluate anxiety and depression. After an additional 2 weeks of SG031 or vehicle administration, a cage-exchange paradigm was performed with 24-hour physiological signal measurements under different stress conditions. Fecal samples were collected to construct a 16S rRNA library and assess fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs).High-dose SG031 administration yielded reduced depression-like responses and enhanced social interaction in behavioral tests. It also exhibited a protective effect against stress-induced sleep disturbance characterized by decreased sleep time, increased awake time, and autonomic dysfunction during sleep. Fecal examination indicated that high-dose SG031 administration exerted beneficial effects on gut health by maintaining the gut microbial abundance, preserving stability of the microbial composition, and enriching the gut with SCFAs, which were associated with improvements in sleep and autonomic function.These findings collectively underscore the multifaceted potential of SG031 in addressing mental health and stress-related sleep challenges through the modulation of the gut microbiota.",Life sciences,2024,Chieh-Wen Chen; Hung-Chang Chen; Sheng-Chieh She; Chun-Ting Lai; Wei-Jen Chen; Terry B J Kuo; Cheryl C H Yang
38959253,Perturbations in gut microbiota composition in schizophrenia.,"Schizophrenia is a severe, complex and long-term psychiatric disorder with unclear etiology. Gut microbes influence the central nervous system via the gut-brain axis. Consequently, investigations of the relationship between gut microbes and schizophrenia are warranted. This study involved 29 patients with schizophrenia and 30 age-matched normal controls. After 16S rRNA gene sequencing and whole-genome shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we analyzed microbial diversity, composition, and function. According to 16S rRNA and metagenomic gene sequencing results, patients with schizophrenia had higher abundances of Clostridium and Megasphaera. Functional analysis showed that sphingolipid, phosphonates and phosphinates, as well as glutamine metabolism were associated with the occurrence and development of schizophrenia. Our data suggest that the gut microbiota exerts an effect on patients with schizophrenia, providing valuable insights into the potential regulation of in the context of this disorder.",PloS one,2024,YiMeng Wang; SiGuo Bi; XiaoLong Li; YuTao Zhong; DongDong Qi
38663221,Effects of antipsychotics on the gastrointestinal microbiota: A systematic review.,"Antipsychotics (APs) have been increasingly prescribed for psychiatric disorders from schizophrenia to disruptive behavioral conditions. These drugs have been associated with considerable side effects, such as weight gain, and increasing evidence has also indicated that its use impacts gut microbiota (GM), although this connection is still little understood. To assess APs effects on the GM of patients starting or ongoing treatment, a systematic review was carried out in PubMed and Scopus databases. Twelve articles were considered eligible for the review, which investigated the effects of risperidone (5 studies), quetiapine (3), amilsupride (1), olanzapine (1), and unspecified atypical drugs (2). Eleven reported changes in GM in response to APs, and associations between the abundance of bacterial groups and different metabolic parameters were described by most of them. However, the studies were noticeably heterogeneous considering design, methods, and results. In this way, the effects of APs on GM composition and diversity were inconclusive. Despite the uncertain interactions, a more comprehensive understanding on how microbiota is affected by APs may help to optimize treatment, potentially minimizing side effects and improving adherence to treatment.",Psychiatry research,2024,Marcela França Dias; Yago Jean de Almeida Nogueira; Marco Aurélio Romano-Silva; Débora Marques de Miranda
39331265,Identification of hsa-miR-193a-5p-SURF4 axis related to the gut microbiota-metabolites- cytokines in lung cancer based on Mendelian randomization study and bioinformatics analysis.,"Lung cancer is a significant disease that affects people's physical and mental health. Currently, the treatment outcomes still do not meet clinical needs, and the causes of the disease are still unclear, therefore further exploration is needed.We analyzed the exposure factors of lung cancer, including gut microbiota, serum metabolites, and cytokines, through Mendelian randomization studies and bioinformatics analysis. We identified common SNPs and performed gene annotation, leading to the discovery of the key gene SURF4, which may affect the onset of lung cancer. We validated the oncogenic function and mechanism of SURF4 through public data analysis using GO and KEGG, and constructed a ceRNA network, revealing the lung cancer oncogenic pathway involving lncRNA/pseudogene-microRNA-SURF4.We first conducted a Mendelian randomization analysis on 418 gut microbiota, 1400 serum metabolites, and 41 cytokines in relation to lung cancer. We found that 16 gut microbiota, 29 serum metabolites, and 2 cytokines were closely associated with lung cancer. Further comparison of all differential SNPs revealed that rs550057 on chromosome 9 was a common SNP among these three exposure factors, indicating its crucial role in lung cancer formation. Through gene functional annotation using R language, we found that the expression of 15 genes, including SURF4, was influenced by rs550057. By querying these 15 genes from public databases for their differential expression and prognosis in lung cancer, we found significant differences in SURF4, MED22, and RPL7A. Furthermore, by querying the expression and correlation coefficients of upstream microRNAs of these three genes through the starBase website, we found that hsa-miR-193a-5p-SURF4 had the most significant effect on lung cancer. Through GO and KEGG analysis of SURF4-related genes, we identified the molecular pathways associated metabolic synthesis and microbial infection related to the promotion of lung cancer by SURF4. This validated the results of the previous Mendelian randomization study. Furthermore, we constructed a ceRNA network for SURF4 and identified two upstream differentially expressed pseudogenes and nine lncRNAs, confirming the functionality of the pseudogene/lncRNA-microRNA-SUFR4 pathway.In summary, we have elucidated the regulatory role of the pseudogene/lncRNA-microRNA-SUFR4 pathway in the progression of lung cancer, combining the research hotspots of gut microbiota-serum metabolites-cytokines. We have also confirmed the pathway and mechanism through SURF4 and its related genes promoting lung cancer formation. This may provide effective therapeutic methods for lung cancer and serve as a potential prognostic marker.",Discover oncology,2024,Jie Yu; Sibo Meng; Tiantian Xuan; Zhanmei Wang; Linli Qu; Fangli Cao; Jiaxin Li
39458509,Gut-Brain Axis and Psychopathology: Exploring the Impact of Diet with a Focus on the Low-FODMAP Approach.,"The gut-brain axis (GBA) is a bidirectional communication network connecting the central nervous system with the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, influencing both mental and physical health. Recent research has underscored the significant role of diet in modulating this axis, with attention to how specific dietary patterns can impact anxiety and depression, particularly when linked to disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBIs), like intestinal bowel syndrome (IBS).This narrative review examines the effects of specific diet regimens on the GBA and its potential role in managing psychopathology, focusing on anxiety and depression, IBS, and the low-FODMAP diet. We conducted a search on PubMed and MEDLINE by combining the following key terms: ""Gut-Brain Axis"", ""Irritable Bowel Syndrome"", ""Low FODMAP diet"", ""Mediterranean Diet"", ""Psychopathology"", ""Anxiety and Depression"", and ""Gut Microbiota"". We applied the following filters: ""Clinical Trials"", ""Randomized Controlled Trials"", ""Reviews"", ""Meta-Analyses"", and ""Systematic Reviews"". In total, 59 papers were included.Low-FODMAP diet, originally developed to alleviate GI symptoms in IBS, may also positively influence mental health by modulating the GBA and improving the gut microbiota (GM) composition. New insights suggest that combining the low-FODMAP diet with the Mediterranean diet could offer a synergistic effect, enhancing both GI and psychological therapeutic outcomes.Understanding the complex interactions between diet, the GM, and mental health opens new avenues for holistic approaches to managing psychopathology, particularly when linked to GI symptoms.",Nutrients,2024,Emanuela Ribichini; Giulia Scalese; Chiara Mocci; Carola Severi
39291634,"A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel trial to test the effect of inulin supplementation on migraine headache characteristics, quality of life and mental health symptoms in women with migraine.","Migraine is a complex neurovascular disorder characterized by recurrent headache attacks that are often accompanied by symptoms such as vomiting, nausea, and sensitivity to sound or light. Preventing migraine attacks is highly important. Recent research has indicated that alterations in gut microbiota may influence the underlying mechanisms of migraines. This study aimed to investigate the effects of inulin supplementation on migraine headache characteristics, quality of life (QOL), and mental health symptoms in women with migraines. In a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial, 80 women with migraines aged 20 to 50 years were randomly assigned to receive 10 g day<sup>-1</sup> of inulin or a placebo supplement for 12 weeks. Severity, frequency, and duration of migraine attacks, as well as depression, anxiety, stress, QOL, and headache impact test (HIT-6) scores, were examined at the start of the study and after 12 weeks of intervention. In this study, the primary outcome focused on the frequency of headache attacks, while secondary outcomes encompassed the duration and severity of headache attacks, QOL, and mental health. There was a significant reduction in severity (-1.95 <i>vs.</i> -0.84, <i>P</i> = 0.004), duration (-6.95 <i>vs.</i> -2.05, <i>P</i> = 0.023), frequency (-2.09 <i>vs.</i> -0.37, <i>P</i> < 0.001), and HIT-6 score (-10.30 <i>vs.</i> -6.52, <i>P</i> < 0.023) in the inulin group compared with the control. Inulin supplementation improved mental health symptoms, including depression (-4.47 <i>vs.</i> -1.45, <i>P</i> < 0.001), anxiety (-4.37 <i>vs.</i> -0.70, <i>P</i> < 0.001), and stress (-4.40 <i>vs.</i> -1.50, <i>P</i> < 0.001). However, no significant difference was observed between the two groups regarding changes in QOL score. This study provides evidence supporting the beneficial effects of inulin supplement on migraine symptoms and mental health status in women with migraines. Further studies are necessary to confirm these findings. <b>Trial registration:</b> Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (https://www.irct.ir) (ID: IRCT20121216011763N58).",Food & function,2024,Mahdi Vajdi; Fariborz Khorvash; Gholamreza Askari
38332676,Repeated (<i>S</i>)-ketamine administration ameliorates the spatial working memory impairment in mice with chronic pain: role of the gut microbiota-brain axis.,"Chronic pain is commonly linked with diminished working memory. This study explores the impact of the anesthetic (<i>S</i>)-ketamine on spatial working memory in a chronic constriction injury (CCI) mouse model, focusing on gut microbiome. We found that multiple doses of (<i>S</i>)-ketamine, unlike a single dose, counteracted the reduced spontaneous alteration percentage (%SA) in the Y-maze spatial working memory test, without affecting mechanical or thermal pain sensitivity. Additionally, repeated (<i>S</i>)-ketamine treatments improved the abnormal composition of the gut microbiome (β-diversity), as indicated by fecal 16S rRNA analysis, and increased levels of butyrate, a key gut - brain axis mediator. Protein analysis showed that these treatments also corrected the upregulated histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) and downregulated brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampi of CCI mice. Remarkably, fecal microbiota transplantation from mice treated repeatedly with (<i>S</i>)-ketamine to CCI mice restored %SA and hippocampal BDNF levels in CCI mice. Butyrate supplementation alone also improved %SA, BDNF, and HDAC2 levels in CCI mice. Furthermore, the TrkB receptor antagonist ANA-12 negated the beneficial effects of repeated (<i>S</i>)-ketamine on spatial working memory impairment in CCI mice. These results indicate that repeated (<i>S</i>)-ketamine administration ameliorates spatial working memory impairment in CCI mice, mediated by a gut microbiota - brain axis, primarily through the enhancement of hippocampal BDNF - TrkB signaling by butyrate.",Gut microbes,2024,Yubin Jiang; Xingming Wang; Jiawei Chen; Yibao Zhang; Kenji Hashimoto; Jian-Jun Yang; Zhiqiang Zhou
38847603,Comparative analysis of pectin and prebiotics on human microbiota modulation in early life stages and adults.,"The gut microbiota is essential in human health, influencing various physiological processes ranging from digestion and metabolism to immune function and mental health. Dietary fiber pectins and prebiotics have emerged as key modulators of gut microbiota composition and function, offering potential therapeutic implications for promoting gut health and preventing intestinal inflammatory diseases. In this review, we explore the modulation of gut microbiota by dietary fiber pectins and prebiotics in infants and adults. We begin with an overview of the gut microbiota composition and function in different age groups, highlighting the factors in shaping microbial communities in both age groups, especially the effect of diet. We then delve into the impact of dietary fiber pectins and prebiotics on gut microbiota composition and function, examining their effects on digestive health, intestinal barrier integrity, immune function, metabolic health, and mental health across different life stages. We further compare how aging affects the gut function and immune system, and we discuss the main health outcomes associated with dietary fiber intake and prebiotics, including the impact on digestive health, improvement in immune function, improvement in cholesterol and glucose metabolism, weight management, mental health, and prevention of diseases. Finally, we highlight the challenges and future directions for research. By advancing the understanding of gut microbiota dynamics and translating scientific insights into clinical practice, it could harness the full potential of dietary fiber pectins and prebiotics to optimize gut health, improve overall well-being across the lifespan, and increase longevity.",Food & function,2024,Janaina Lombello Santos Donadio; João Paulo Fabi
38928361,A Narrative Review of Intestinal Microbiota's Impact on Migraine with Psychopathologies.,"Migraine is a common and debilitating neurological disorder characterized by the recurrent attack of pulsating headaches typically localized on one side of the head associated with other disabling symptoms, such as nausea, increased sensitivity to light, sound and smell and mood changes. Various clinical factors, including the excessive use of migraine medication, inadequate acute treatment and stressful events, can contribute to the worsening of the condition, which may evolve to chronic migraine, that is, a headache present on >15 days/month for at least 3 months. Chronic migraine is frequently associated with various comorbidities, including anxiety and mood disorders, particularly depression, which complicate the prognosis, response to treatment and overall clinical outcomes. Emerging research indicates a connection between alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota and mental health conditions, particularly anxiety and depression, which are considered disorders of the gut-brain axis. This underscores the potential of modulating the gut microbiota as a new avenue for managing these conditions. In this context, it is interesting to investigate whether migraine, particularly in its chronic form, exhibits a dysbiosis profile similar to that observed in individuals with anxiety and depression. This could pave the way for interventions aimed at modulating the gut microbiota for treating difficult-to-manage migraines.",International journal of molecular sciences,2024,Miriam Francavilla; Sara Facchetti; Chiara Demartini; Anna Maria Zanaboni; Chiara Amoroso; Sara Bottiroli; Cristina Tassorelli; Rosaria Greco
39267834,Changes in the gut microbiota of esophageal carcinoma patients based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"This study conducts a systematic review through meta-analysis, comparing the composition and diversity of the gut microbiome in patients with esophageal cancer and healthy individuals, and explores the relationship between risk factors and related factors of esophageal cancer.According to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), we comprehensively searched the databases of PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library. In addition, we applied the R programming language version 4.0.3 and Stata 15.1 software for data analysis. We also implemented the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), funnel plot analysis, Egger's test, and Begg's test to assess the risk of bias.In this study, a total of 328 studies were identified through the literature search. Among them, 117 duplicate studies were removed, and 202 studies were excluded based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Finally, 9 studies were included in the analysis, involving a total of 216 patients with esophageal carcinoma and 352 healthy controls. Four studies provided Chao1 index for quantitative consolidation (ES = 637.41, 95% CI: 549.16 to 725.66, p = 0.000, I<sup>2</sup> = 98.2%). Two studies [27, 29] reported ACE index (ES = 438.89, 95% CI: 362.42 to 515.35, p = 0.000, I<sup>2</sup> = 97%). Seven studies [26,27,29,30,32] reported the Shannon index for quantitative consolidation (ES = 4.38, 95% CI: 3.95 to 4.81, p = 0.000, I<sup>2</sup> = 99%). At the phylum level, the abundance of Bacteroidetes(ES = 37.8, 95% CI: 25.75 to 49.85, p = 0.000, I2 = 87.2%) and Proteobacteria(ES = 7.48, 95% CI: 5.02 to 8.85, p = 0.04, I<sup>2</sup> = 2.4%) have statistical difference between ESCC and HC. There was no significant difference between ESCC and HC in the abundance of genera(p>0.05).This observational meta-analysis revealed that changes in the GM were correlated with esophageal carcinoma, and variations in some advantageous GM might involve regional differences.

38974216,Vitamin-mediated interaction between the gut microbiome and mitochondria in depression: A systematic review-based integrated perspective.,"Depression is one of the world's most prevalent mental disorders and its treatment remains suboptimal. Depression is a systemic disease with highly complex biological mechanisms. Emerging evidence points towards the involvement of mitochondria, microbiome and vitamins in its pathophysiology. Mitochondrial energy production was shown to be lowered in patients with depression. Mitochondrial energy production depends on vitamins, which are available from food, but are also synthesized by the gut microbiota. Several studies reported altered vitamin levels as well as changes in the gut microbiome composition and its vitamin metabolism in patients with depression. Therefore, the question of a connection between mitochondria and gut microbiome and vitamins influencing the mental health arises. This review aims to systematically investigate a combination of the topics - depression, mitochondria, microbiome, and vitamins - to generate an overview of a novel yet extremely complex and interconnected research field. A systematic literature search yielded 34 articles, and the results were summarized and bundled to develop this new integrative perspective on mitochondrial function mediated by the microbiome and microbiome-derived vitamins in depression. Furthermore, by discussing the research gaps this review aims to encourage innovative research approaches to better understand the biology of depression, which could result in optimized therapeutic approaches.","Brain, behavior, & immunity - health",2024,Ellen Bisle; Suchithra Varadarajan; Iris-Tatjana Kolassa
38401573,A role of gut-brain axis on prophylactic actions of arketamine in male mice exposed to chronic restrain stress.,"The gut-brain axis, which includes gut microbiota and microbiome-derived metabolites, might be implicated in depression. We reported the sustained prophylactic effects of a new antidepressant arketamine in chronic restrain stress (CRS) model of depression. In this study, we investigated the role of gut-brain axis on the prophylactic effects of arketamine in the CRS (7 days) model. Pretreatment with arketamine (10 mg/kg, 1 day prior to the CRS onset) significantly prevented CRS-induced body weight loss, increased immobility time of forced swimming test, decreased sucrose preference of sucrose preference test, and reduced expressions of synaptic proteins (GluA1 and PSD-95) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in the male mice. Gut microbiota analysis showed that pretreatment with arketamine might restore altered abundance of gut microbiota in CRS-exposed mice. An untargeted metabolomics analysis revealed four metabolites (e.g., L-leucine, N-acetyl-l-glutamine, 2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-[4-(dimethylamino)phenyl]acrylonitrile, L-threonine amide) that were altered between control and CRS group; however, there were found to be altered between the saline + CRS group and the arketamine + CRS group. Network analysis demonstrated correlations among synaptic proteins in the PFC and certain microbiota, and blood metabolites. These findings suggest that gut-brain axis, including its metabolites, might partially contribute to the persistent prophylactic effects of arketamine in the CRS model.","Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior",2024,Li Ma; Akifumi Eguchi; Guilin Liu; Youge Qu; Xiayun Wan; Rumi Murayama; Chisato Mori; Kenji Hashimoto
38722169,"Preface: Special issue: ""Ion channels and genetic epilepsy"".","This preface introduces the Journal of Neurochemistry Special Issue on Advances in Epilepsy Research. Epilepsy is a devastating disease characterized by recurrent seizures. Despite the addition of numerous therapeutics over the last few decades epilepsy patients resistant to standard of care treatments remains stubbornly high. This highlights a clear unmet clinical need and the importance of new research into this disease. One major advance over the last two decades has been the recognition that genetic factors play a significant role in the underlying pathogenesis of epilepsy. Much of our insights into the pathogenic mechanisms underlying genetic epilepsy has come from research into genes that encode ion channels. In this issue, there are up-to-date reviews discussing epilepsy caused by variation in HCN channels, voltage-dependent sodium channels, voltage-dependent calcium channels, and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. The reviews highlight our understanding of the genotype-phenotype relationships and the identification of precision medicine approaches. Complimenting this is a review on metabolic aspects modulating ion channels in genetic disease. This issue also has fundamental research manuscripts investigating how currently approved drugs may rescue NMDA receptor dysfunction and how in vitro neuron cultures can be used to probe network scale deficits and drug impacts in SCN2A disease. Other primary data manuscripts include those focusing on metabolic therapies, gut microbiota, and new in vivo screening tools for identifying novel anti-seizure drugs. Collectively, manuscripts published as part of this edition highlight recent research gains, especially in our understanding of genetic causes of epilepsy involving ion channels.",Journal of neurochemistry,2024,Christopher A Reid

38756585,The gut-brain-axis: A positive relationship between gut microbial dysbiosis and glioblastoma brain tumour.,"The glioblastoma brain tumour (GBM) stands out as the most aggressive and resistant-to-treatment malignancy. Nevertheless, the gut-brain connection plays a pivotal role in influencing the growth and activation of the central nervous system. In this particular investigation, we aimed to assess and characterize the gut microbial ecosystem in GBM patients, both quantitatively and qualitatively. We collected faecal samples from 15 healthy volunteers and 25 GBM patients. To delve into the microbial content, we employed PCR-DGGE, targeting the V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene, and conducted qPCR to measure the levels of crucial intestinal bacteria. For a more in-depth analysis, high-throughput sequencing was performed on a selection of 20 random faecal samples (10 from healthy individuals and 10 from GBM patients), targeting the V3+V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Our findings from examining the richness and diversity of the gut microbiota unveiled that GBM patients exhibited significantly higher microbial diversity compared to healthy individuals. At the phylum level, Proteobacteria saw a significant increase, while <i>Firmicutes</i> experienced a noteworthy decrease in the GBM group. Moving down to the family level, we observed significantly elevated levels of <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i>, <i>Bacteroidaceae</i>, and <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> in GBM patients, while levels of <i>Veillonellaceae</i>, <i>Rikenellaceae</i>, and <i>Prevotellaceae</i> were notably lower. Delving into genera statistics, we noted a substantial increase in the abundance of <i>Parasutterella</i>, <i>Escherichia-Shigella</i>, and <i>Bacteroides</i>, alongside significantly lower levels of <i>Ruminococcus 2</i>, <i>Faecalibacterium</i>, and <i>Prevotella_9</i> in the GBM group compared to the control group. Furthermore, when examining specific species, we found a significant increase in <i>Bacteroides vulgatus</i> and <i>Escherichia coli</i> in the GBM group. These observations collectively indicate a marked dysbiosis in the gut microbial composition of GBM patients. Additionally, the GBM group exhibited notably higher levels of alpha diversity when compared to the control group. This increase in diversity suggests a significant bacterial overgrowth in the gut of GBM patients in contrast to the controls. As a result, this research opens up potential avenues to gain a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms, pathways, and potential treatments for GBM, stemming from the significant implications of gut microbial dysbiosis in these patients.",Heliyon,2024,Hafiz Muhammad Ishaq; Riffat Yasin; Imran Shair Mohammad; Yang Fan; Huan Li; Muhammad Shahzad; Jiru Xu

Psychiatric comorbidities, including depression and anxiety, are more prevalent in IBD patients than in healthy individuals. Evidence suggests that varying levels of neuroinflammation might underlie these states in IBD patients. Within this context, microglia are the crucial non-neural cells in the brain responsible for innate immune responses following inflammatory insults. Alterations in microglia's functions, such as secretory profile, phagocytic activity, and synaptic pruning, might play significant roles in mediating psychiatric manifestations of IBD. In this review, we discuss the role played by microglia in IBD-associated comorbidities.",Cells,2024,Gohar Fakhfouri; Nataša R Mijailović; Reza Rahimian
38606411,Markers of intestinal barrier damage in patients with chronic insomnia disorder.,"Insomnia disorder stands out as one of the prevalent clinical sleep and psychiatric disorders. Prior research has unequivocally demonstrated variations in the diversity and abundance of gut microbiota among individuals with insomnia disorder. These alterations may play a direct or indirect role in the onset and progression of insomnia disorder by compromising the integrity of the intestinal barrier. This study aims to evaluate the impairment of the intestinal barrier in individuals with insomnia disorder by scrutinizing the serum functionality of this barrier.45 patients with chronic insomnia disorder and 30 matched healthy volunteers were meticulously selected based on inclusion criteria. ELISA technology was employed to measure serum levels of diamine oxidase (DAO), D-lactic acid (D-LA), intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP), and endothelin (ET). Spearman correlation analysis was used to explore the relationship between intestinal mucosal markers and clinical characteristics. Data were analyzed using SPSS 26.0.Compared to the healthy control group, the insomnia disorder group exhibited significantly elevated scores on subjective mood and sleep scales (GAD-7, PHQ-9, HAMA, HAMD, PSQI, and ISI) (P < 0.05). Overnight PSG indicated a notable increase in bed time, total wake time, sleep onset latency, and wake after sleep onset in individuals with insomnia disorder. Additionally, there was a decrease in sleep efficiency and alterations in sleep structure (increased proportion of N1 and N3 stages, prolonged N1 stage) (P < 0.05). The chronic insomnia disorder group displayed significantly reduced concentrations of serum DAO, D-LA, I-FABP, and ET (P < 0.05). Furthermore, significant positive correlations were identified between intestinal epithelial barrier markers and sleep efficiency, while negative correlations were found with wake after sleep onset, total wake time, PSQI, HAMA, and HAMD. Additionally, D-LA levels were significantly positively correlated with ET concentrations.Individuals with chronic insomnia disorder manifest disruptions in sleep structure, heightened susceptibility to anxiety and depressive moods, and impaired intestinal barrier function. These findings suggest that the occurrence and development of insomnia disorder may be linked to the impairment of the intestinal barrier.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2024,Yixian Cai; Di Gong; Ting Xiang; Xiaotao Zhang; Jiyang Pan
38273106,Human microbiota from drug-naive patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder drives behavioral symptoms and neuroinflammation via succinic acid in mice.,"Emerging evidence suggests that the gut microbiota is closely related to psychiatric disorders. However, little is known about the role of the gut microbiota in the development of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Here, to investigate the contribution of gut microbiota to the pathogenesis of OCD, we transplanted fecal microbiota from first-episode, drug-naive OCD patients or demographically matched healthy individuals into antibiotic-treated specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice and showed that colonization with OCD microbiota is sufficient to induce core behavioral deficits, including abnormal anxiety-like and compulsive-like behaviors. The fecal microbiota was analyzed using 16 S rRNA full-length sequencing, and the results demonstrated a clear separation of the fecal microbiota of mice colonized with OCD and control microbiota. Notably, microbiota from OCD-colonized mice resulted in injured neuronal morphology and function in the mPFC, with inflammation in the mPFC and colon. Unbiased metabolomic analyses of the serum and mPFC region revealed the accumulation of succinic acid (SA) in OCD-colonized mice. SA impeded neuronal activity and induced an inflammatory response in both the colon and mPFC, impacting intestinal permeability and brain function, which act as vital signal mediators in gut microbiota-brain-immune crosstalk. Manipulations of dimethyl malonate (DM) have been reported to exert neuroprotective effects by suppressing the oxidation of accumulated succinic acid, attenuating the downstream inflammatory response and neuronal damage, and can help to partly improve abnormal behavior and reduce neuroinflammation and intestinal inflammation in OCD-colonized mice. We propose that the gut microbiota likely regulates brain function and behaviors in mice via succinic acid signaling, which contributes to the pathophysiology of OCD through gut-brain crosstalk and may provide new insights into the treatment of this disorder.",Molecular psychiatry,2024,Ying-Dan Zhang; Dong-Dong Shi; Bing-Bing Liao; Yi Li; Sen Zhang; Jian Gao; Liang-Jun Lin; Zhen Wang
38792361,"The Potential Role of the Ketogenic Diet in Serious Mental Illness: Current Evidence, Safety, and Practical Advice.","The ketogenic diet (KD) is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet that mimics the physiological state of fasting. The potential therapeutic effects in many chronic conditions have led to the gaining popularity of the KD. The KD has been demonstrated to alleviate inflammation and oxidative stress, modulate the gut microbiota community, and improve metabolic health markers. The modification of these factors has been a potential therapeutic target in serious mental illness (SMI): bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia. The number of clinical trials assessing the effect of the KD on SMI is still limited. Preliminary research, predominantly case studies, suggests potential therapeutic effects, including weight gain reduction, improved carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, decrease in disease-related symptoms, increased energy and quality of life, and, in some cases, changes in pharmacotherapy (reduction in number or dosage of medication). However, these findings necessitate further investigation through larger-scale clinical trials. Initiation of the KD should occur in a hospital setting and with strict care of a physician and dietitian due to potential side effects of the diet and the possibility of exacerbating adverse effects of pharmacotherapy. An increasing number of ongoing studies examining the KD's effect on mental disorders highlights its potential role in the adjunctive treatment of SMI.",Journal of clinical medicine,2024,Joanna Rog; Zuzanna Wingralek; Katarzyna Nowak; Monika Grudzień; Arkadiusz Grunwald; Agnieszka Banaszek; Hanna Karakula-Juchnowicz

Over the past decades, suboptimal vitamin D (VD) levels and gut dysbiosis have been associated with neurological dysfunction and psychiatric disorders.In this review, we examined the available literature on VD and mental health disorders, particularly depression and anxiety, in both clinical and pre-clinical studies.Our extensive review failed to find a link between VD deficiency, depression, and anxiety-related behavior in preclinical animal models. However, strong evidence suggests that VD supplementation may alleviate symptoms in chronically stressed rodents, with some promising evidence from clinical studies. Further, fecal microbiota transplantations suggest a potential role of gut microbiota in neuropsychiatric disorders, although the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. It has been postulated that serotonin, primarily produced by gut bacteria, may be a crucial factor. Hence, whether VD has the ability to impact gut microbiota and modulate serotonin synthesis warrants further investigation.Taken together, literature has suggested that VD may serve as a key regulator in the gut-brain axis to modulate gut microbiota and alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety. The inconsistent results of VD supplementation in clinical studies, particularly among VD deficient participants, suggests that current intake recommendations may need to be re-evaluated for individuals at-risk (i.e. prior to diagnosis) of developing depression and/or anxiety.",Nutritional neuroscience,2024,Karisa Renteria; Hien Nguyen; Gar Yee Koh

39158758,The Antidepressant- and Anxiolytic-Like Effects of the Phosphodiesterase Type-5 Inhibitor Tadalafil are Associated with the Modulation of the Gut-Brain Axis During CNS Autoimmunity.,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a debilitating disease that severely affects the central nervous system (CNS). Apart from neurological symptoms, it is also characterized by neuropsychiatric comorbidities, such as anxiety and depression. Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE5Is) such as Sildenafil and Tadalafil have been shown to possess antidepressant-like effects, but the mechanisms underpinning such effects are not fully characterized. To address this question, we used the EAE model of MS, behavioral tests, immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, western blot, and 16 S rRNA sequencing. Here, we showed that depressive-like behavior in Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice is due to neuroinflammation, reduced synaptic plasticity, dysfunction in glutamatergic neurotransmission, glucocorticoid receptor (GR) resistance, increased blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and immune cell infiltration to the CNS, as well as inflammation, increased intestinal permeability, and immune cell infiltration in the distal colon. Furthermore, 16 S rRNA sequencing revealed that behavioral dysfunction in EAE mice is associated with changes in the gut microbiota, such as an increased abundance of Firmicutes and Saccharibacteria and a reduction in Proteobacteria, Parabacteroides, and Desulfovibrio. Moreover, we detected an increased abundance of Erysipelotrichaceae and Desulfovibrionaceae and a reduced abundance of Lactobacillus johnsonii. Surprisingly, we showed that Tadalafil likely exerts antidepressant-like effects by targeting all aforementioned disease aspects. In conclusion, our work demonstrated that anxiety- and depressive-like behavior in EAE is associated with a plethora of neuroimmune and gut microbiota-mediated mechanisms and that Tadalafil exerts antidepressant-like effects probably by targeting these mechanisms. Harnessing the knowledge of these mechanisms of action of Tadalafil is important to pave the way for future clinical trials with depressed patients.",Journal of neuroimmune pharmacology : the official journal of the Society on NeuroImmune Pharmacology,2024,Eduardo Duarte-Silva; Alice Chevrollier Oriá; Ingrid Prata Mendonça; Igor Henrique Rodrigues Paiva; Klyvia Leuthier Dos Santos; Amanda Juliana Sales; José Roberto Botelho de Souza; Michael Maes; Sven Guenther Meuth; Christina Alves Peixoto
38650872,The emerging roles of microbiota-derived extracellular vesicles in psychiatric disorders.,"Major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder are three major psychiatric disorders that significantly impact the well-being and overall health of patients. Some researches indicate that abnormalities in the gut microbiota can trigger certain psychiatric diseases. Microbiota-derived extracellular vesicles have the ability to transfer bioactive compounds into host cells, altering signaling and biological processes, ultimately influencing the mental health and illness of the host. This review aims to investigate the emerging roles of microbiota-derived extracellular vesicles in these three major psychiatric disorders and discusses their roles as diagnostic biomarkers and therapies for these psychiatric disorders.",Frontiers in microbiology,2024,Chuang Guo; Yulong Bai; Pengfei Li; Kuanjun He
38331354,Depression-like phenotypes in mice following common bile duct ligation: Insights into the gut-liver-brain axis via the vagus nerve.,"Depression frequently occurs in patients with liver cirrhosis, yet the reasons for this correlation are not fully understood. Dysbiosis of gut microbiota has been implicated in depression through the gut-brain axis via the vagus nerve. This study explored the potential role of the gut-liver-brain axis via the vagus nerve in depression-like phenotypes in mice with liver cirrhosis. These mice underwent common bile duct ligation (CBDL), a method used to stimulate liver cirrhosis. To assess depression-like behaviors, behavioral tests were conducted 10 days following either sham or CBDL surgeries. The mice with CBDL displayed symptoms such as splenomegaly, elevated plasma levels of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α, depression-like behaviors, decreased levels of synaptic proteins in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), disrupted gut microbiota balance, and changes in blood metabolites (or lipids). Additionally, there were positive or negative correlations between the relative abundance of microbiome and behavioral data or blood metabolites (or lipids). Significantly, these changes were reversed in CBDL mice by performing a subdiaphragmatic vagotomy. Intriguingly, depression-like phenotypes in mice with CBDL were improved after a single injection of arketamine, a new antidepressant. These results suggest that CBDL-induced depression-like phenotypes in mice are mediated through the gut-liver-brain axis via the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve, and that arketamine might offer a new treatment approach for depression in liver cirrhosis patients.",Neurobiology of disease,2024,Yong Yang; Akifumi Eguchi; Chisato Mori; Kenji Hashimoto
38317780,Gut microbiota regulate stress resistance by influencing microglia-neuron interactions in the hippocampus.,"Communication among the brain, gut and microbiota in the gut is known to affect the susceptibility to stress, but the mechanisms involved are unclear. Here we demonstrated that stress resistance in mice was associated with more abundant <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Akkermansia</i> in the gut, but less abundant <i>Bacteroides, Alloprevotella, Helicobacter, Lachnoclostridium, Blautia, Roseburia, Colidextibacter</i> and <i>Lachnospiraceae NK4A136</i>. Stress-sensitive animals showed higher permeability and stronger immune responses in their colon, as well as higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum. Their hippocampus also showed more extensive microglial activation, abnormal interactions between microglia and neurons, and lower synaptic plasticity. Transplanting fecal microbiota from stress-sensitive mice into naïve ones perturbed microglia-neuron interactions and impaired synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, translating to more depression-like behavior after stress exposure. Conversely, transplanting fecal microbiota from stress-resistant mice into naïve ones protected microglia from activation and preserved synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, leading to less depression-like behavior after stress exposure. These results suggested that gut microbiota may influence resilience to chronic psychological stress by regulating microglia-neuron interactions in the hippocampus.","Brain, behavior, & immunity - health",2024,Haili He; Hui He; Li Mo; Qingsong Yuan; Chenghong Xiao; Qiman Ma; Saini Yi; Tao Zhou; Zili You; Jinqiang Zhang
39303815,Metformin reprograms tryptophan metabolism via gut microbiome-derived bile acid metabolites to ameliorate depression-Like behaviors in mice.,"As an adjunct therapy, metformin enhances the efficacy of conventional antidepressant medications. However, its mode of action remains unclear. Here, metformin was found to ameliorate depression-like behaviors in mice exposed to chronic restraint stress (CRS) by normalizing the dysbiotic gut microbiome. Fecal transplants from metformin-treated mice ameliorated depressive behaviors in stressed mice. Microbiome profiling revealed that Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila), in particular, was markedly increased in the gut by metformin and that oral administration of this species alone was sufficient to reverse CRS-induced depressive behaviors and normalize aberrant stress-induced 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) metabolism in the brain and gut. Untargeted metabolomic profiling further identified the bile acid metabolites taurocholate and deoxycholic acid as direct A. muciniphila-derived molecules that are, individually, sufficient to rescue the CRS-induced impaired 5-HT metabolism and depression-like behaviors. Thus, we report metformin reprograms 5-HT metabolism via microbiome-brain interactions to mitigate depressive syndromes, providing novel insights into gut microbiota-derived bile acids as potential therapeutic candidates for depressive mood disorders from bench to bedside.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2024,Xiaoxian Xie; Wenwen Li; Ze Xiong; Junyu Xu; Tailin Liao; Lei Sun; Haoshen Xu; Mengya Zhang; Jiafeng Zhou; Wenzheng Xiong; Zhengwei Fu; Zezhi Li; Qi Han; Donghong Cui; Daniel C Anthony
38606523,"Current iron therapy in the light of regulation, intestinal microbiome, and toxicity: are we prescribing too much iron?","Iron deficiency is a widespread global health concern with varying prevalence rates across different regions. In developing countries, scarcity of food and chronic infections contribute to iron deficiency, while in industrialized nations, reduced food intake and dietary preferences affect iron status. Other causes that can lead to iron deficiency are conditions and diseases that result in reduced intestinal iron absorption and blood loss. In addition, iron absorption and its bioavailability are influenced by the composition of the diet. Individuals with increased iron needs, including infants, adolescents, and athletes, are particularly vulnerable to deficiency. Severe iron deficiency can lead to anemia with performance intolerance or shortness of breath. In addition, even without anemia, iron deficiency leads to mental and physical fatigue, which points to the fundamental biological importance of iron, especially in mitochondrial function and the respiratory chain. Standard oral iron supplementation often results in gastrointestinal side effects and poor compliance. Low-dose iron therapy seems to be a valid and reasonable therapeutic option due to reduced hepatic hepcidin formation, facilitating efficient iron resorption, replenishment of iron storage, and causing significantly fewer side effects. Elevated iron levels influence gut microbiota composition, favoring pathogenic bacteria and potentially disrupting metabolic and immune functions. Protective bacteria, such as bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, are particularly susceptible to increased iron levels. Dysbiosis resulting from iron supplementation may contribute to gastrointestinal disorders, inflammatory bowel disease, and metabolic disturbances. Furthermore, gut microbiota alterations have been linked to mental health issues. Future iron therapy should consider low-dose supplementation to mitigate adverse effects and the impact on the gut microbiome. A comprehensive understanding of the interplay between iron intake, gut microbiota, and human health is crucial for optimizing therapeutic approaches and minimizing potential risks associated with iron supplementation.",Critical reviews in clinical laboratory sciences,2024,Anaëlle L Dentand; Morton G Schubert; Pierre-Alexandre Krayenbuehl
38463411,A Possible Role of Akkermansia muciniphila in the Treatment of Olanzapine-Induced Weight Gain.,"Second-generation antipsychotics are mainly used in both acute and long-term treatment of major psychiatric disorders. Although better tolerated than first-generation antipsychotic drugs, they can frequently induce weight gain and metabolic disorders, of these, olanzapine is one of the drugs more likely to induce these side effects. There is consistent evidence of the role of gut microbiota in modulating the gut-brain axis with complex crosstalk with the host involving satiety signaling pathways, food intake behavior, and weight and metabolic regulation. Second-generation antipsychotics induce important gut microbiota modification thus contributing together with the central and peripheral receptors blockade mechanism to weight gain induction and metabolic impairment. These drugs can alter the composition of gut microbiota and induce dysbiosis, often reducing the concentration of <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i>, a bacterium that is also decreased in patients with diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, or chronic inflammatory diseases. Probiotic administration can be a safe and well-tolerated approach to modulate microbiota and offer an integrative strategy in psychiatric patients suffering antipsychotic side effects. Multiple strain probiotics and <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> alone have been administered both in mice models and in clinical populations demonstrating efficacy on antipsychotic-induced metabolic impairment and showing a contribution in reducing induced weight gain. <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> can improve several parameters altered by olanzapine administration, such as weight gain, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, liver function, systemic inflammation, and gut barrier function. Although we do not have jet trials in the psychiatric population, this probiotic may be a complementary approach to treating olanzapine-induced weight gain and metabolic side effects.",Cureus,2024,Francesca Bertossi

38944290,Splenic nerve denervation attenuates depression-like behaviors in Chrna7 knock-out mice via the spleen-gut-brain axis.,"Growing evidence highlights the role of the spleen-brain axis in inflammation-associated depression. The α7-subtype of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7 nAChR, encoded by the Chrna7 gene) is implicated in systemic inflammation, with Chrna7 knock-out (KO) mice displaying depression-like behaviors. Yet, the influence of spleen nerve on depression-like behaviors in these KO mice remains to be elucidated.We investigated the effects of the splenic nerve denervation (SND) on depression-like behaviors, the protein expression in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and the gut microbiota composition in Chrna7 KO mice.SND markedly alleviated depression-like behaviors and the reduced expression of GluA1 and postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95) in the PFC of Chrna7 KO mice. No changes in α-diversity of gut microbiota were noted among the control, KO + sham, and KO + SND groups. However, significant differences in β-diversity of gut microbiota were noted among the groups. Notable alterations in various microbiota (e.g., Fluviimonas_pallidilutea, Maribacter_arcticus, Parvibacter_caecicola) and plasma metabolites (e.g., helicide, N-acetyl-L-aspartic acid, α-D-galactose 1-phosphate, choline, creatine) were observed between KO + sham and KO + SND groups. Interestingly, correlations were found between the relative abundance of specific microbiota and other outcomes, including synaptic proteins, metabolites and behavioral data.The underlying mechanisms remain to be fully understood.Our findings indicate that the splenic nerve contributes to depression-like phenotypes in Chrna7 KO mice via the spleen-gut-brain axis.",Journal of affective disorders,2024,Yong Yang; Akifumi Eguchi; Chisato Mori; Kenji Hashimoto
39199404,The Influence of Cecal Microbiota Transplantation on Chicken Injurious Behavior: Perspective in Human Neuropsychiatric Research.,"Numerous studies have evidenced that neuropsychiatric disorders (mental illness and emotional disturbances) with aggression (or violence) pose a significant challenge to public health and contribute to a substantial economic burden worldwide. Especially, social disorganization (or social inequality) associated with childhood adversity has long-lasting effects on mental health, increasing the risk of developing neuropsychiatric disorders. Intestinal bacteria, functionally as an endocrine organ and a second brain, release various immunomodulators and bioactive compounds directly or indirectly regulating a host's physiological and behavioral homeostasis. Under various social challenges, stress-induced dysbiosis increases gut permeability causes serial reactions: releasing neurotoxic compounds, leading to neuroinflammation and neuronal injury, and eventually neuropsychiatric disorders associated with aggressive, violent, or impulsive behavior in humans and various animals via a complex bidirectional communication of the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis. The dysregulation of the MGB axis has also been recognized as one of the reasons for the prevalence of social stress-induced injurious behaviors (feather pecking, aggression, and cannibalistic pecking) in chickens. However, existing knowledge of preventing and treating these disorders in both humans and chickens is not well understood. In previous studies, we developed a non-mammal model in an abnormal behavioral investigation by rationalizing the effects of gut microbiota on injurious behaviors in chickens. Based on our earlier success, the perspective article outlines the possibility of reducing stress-induced injurious behaviors in chickens through modifying gut microbiota via cecal microbiota transplantation, with the potential for providing a biotherapeutic rationale for preventing injurious behaviors among individuals with mental disorders via restoring gut microbiota diversity and function.",Biomolecules,2024,Yuechi Fu; Heng-Wei Cheng
39163908,Gaba-producing lactobacilli boost cognitive reactivity to negative mood without improving cognitive performance: A human Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Cross-Over study.,"Psychobiotic bacteria are probiotics able to influence stress-related behavior, sleep, and cognitive outcomes. Several in vitro and human studies were performed to assess their physiological potential, to find strains having psychotropic activity in humans, and to elucidate the metabolic pathways involved. In our previous in vitro study, we identified two strains Levilactobacillus brevis P30021 and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum P30025, able to produce GABA and acetylcholine, being promising candidates to provide an effect on mood and cognitive performance.To investigate the effects of probiotics in the alleviation on the cognitive performance of moderately stressed healthy adults. Secondary outcomes were related to mood improvement, production of GABA, glutamate, acetylcholine, and choline and modification of the microbiota composition.A 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study investigated the effects of a probiotic formulation (Levilactobacillus brevis P30021 and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum P30025) on psychological, memory, and cognition parameters in 44 (Probiotic = 44, Placebo = 43) adults with a mean age of 29 ± 5.7 years old by CogState Battery test. Subjects-inclusion criteria was a mild-moderate (18.7 ± 4.06) stress upon diagnosis using the DASS-42 questionnaire.Probiotic treatment had no effect on subjective stress measures. The probiotic formulation showed a significant beneficial effect on depressive symptoms by reducing cognitive reactivity to sad mood (p = 0.034). Rumination significantly improved after intake of the probiotic (p = 0.006), suggesting a potential benefit in reducing the negative cognitive effects associated with depression and improving overall mental health. When stratifying the treated subjects according to the response, we found an increase in the abundance of the probiotic genera in the gut microbiota of positive responders (p = 0.009 for Lactiplantibacillus and p = 0.004 for L.brevis). No relevant correlations were observed between the neurotransmitter concentration in the faecal sample, scores of LEIDS, DASS-42, and cognitive tests.We highlight the potential of this probiotic preparation to act as psycobiotics for the relief of negative mood feelings. The assessment of the psychotropic effects of dietary interventions in human participants has many challenges. Further interventional studies investigating the effect of these psychobiotic bacteria in populations with stressed-related disorders are required including longer period of intervention and larger sample size in order to verify the effects of the treatment on further stress-related indicators.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2024,Melania Casertano; Matthijs Dekker; Vincenzo Valentino; Francesca De Filippis; Vincenzo Fogliano; Danilo Ercolini
39386896,Unveiling the gut microbiota blueprint of schizophrenia: a multilevel omics approach.,"Schizophrenia is a persistent incurable mental disorder and is characterized by the manifestation of negative emotions and behaviors with anxiety and depression, fear and insecurity, self-harm and social withdrawal. The intricate molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain largely elusive. Accumulating evidence points towards the gut microbiota exerting an influence on brain function via the gut-brain axis, potentially contributing to the development of schizophrenia. Therefore, the objective of this study is to delineate the gut microbial composition and metabolic profile of fecal samples from individuals with schizophrenia.Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene sequencing were employed to analyze fecal metabolites and gut microbiota profiles in a cohort of 29 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and 30 normal controls. The microbial composition of fecal samples was determined through the 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and microbial α-diversity and β-diversity indices were calculated. Principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were performed to analyze the distribution of samples. The metabolites and gut microbiota exhibiting differential expression were identified through the application of biological variance criteria. Co-occurrence analysis of bacteria and metabolites was conducted using the spearman's rank correlation coefficient and visualized in a circular layout with the Cytoscape software.The findings of the study indicated a lack of substantial evidence supporting significant disparities in α-diversity and β-diversity between individuals with schizophrenia and normal controls. In terms of metabolomics, a discernible pattern in sample distribution between the two groups was observed. Our analysis has revealed 30 bacterial species and 45 fecal metabolites that exhibited notable differences in abundance between individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia and normal controls. These alterations in multilevel omics have led to the development of a co-expression network associated with schizophrenia. The perturbed microbial genes and fecal metabolites consistently demonstrated associations with amino acid and lipid metabolism, which play essential roles in regulating the central nervous system.Our results offered profound insights into the impact of imbalanced gut microbiota and metabolism on brain function in individuals with schizophrenia.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2024,DongDong Qi; Peng Liu; YiMeng Wang; XuGuang Tai; ShiFa Ma

39364125,Differences in the human gut microbiota with varying depressive symptom severity scores.,"Depression is a prevalent mental health disorder, and its incidence has increased further because of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The gut microbiome has been suggested as a potential target for mental health treatment because of the bidirectional communication system between the brain and gastrointestinal tract, known as the gut-brain axis. We aimed to investigate the relationship between the human gut microbiome and depression screening by analyzing the abundance and types of microbiomes among individuals living in Japan, where mental health awareness and support may differ from those in other countries owing to cultural factors. We used a data-driven approach to evaluate the gut microbiome of participants who underwent commercial gut microbiota testing services and completed a questionnaire survey that included a test for scoring depressive tendencies. Our data analysis results indicated that no significant differences in gut microbiome composition were found among the groups based on their depression screening scores. However, the results also indicated the potential existence of a few differentially abundant bacterial taxa. Specifically, the detected bacterial changes in abundance suggest that the Bifidobacteriaceae, Streptococcaceae, and Veillonellaceae families are candidates for differentially abundant bacteria. Our findings should contribute to the growing body of research on the relationship between gut microbiome and mental health, highlighting the potential of microbiome-based interventions for depression treatment. The limitations of this study include the lack of clear medical information on the participants' diagnoses. Future research could benefit from a larger sample size and more detailed clinical information.","Bioscience of microbiota, food and health",2024,Yuka Masamura; Ryuichi Kubo; Yuki Midorikawa; Natsuko O Shinozaki; Satoshi Watanabe; Sayumi Maekawa; Aya K Takeda; Tazro Ohta

This study aims to explore the potential effect of <i>Bifidobacterium breve</i> BB05 supplements on the DCS. Initially, fifty healthy and fifty diarrheal students were recruited in the observational experiment and allocated into control and diarrhea groups, respectively. Subsequently, one hundred diarrheal students were newly recruited in the intervention experiment and randomly allocated into placebo and probiotic groups, both treated for 2 weeks. Questionnaires (BSS, HAMA-14, and HDRS-17) were performed to assess the students' diarrheal states and mental health at baseline and post-treatment. Fecal samples underwent 16S rRNA sequencing and Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay to evaluate gut microbiota and fecal metabolite alternations. Results indicated that <i>B. breve</i> BB05 supplementation significantly enriched (<i>p</i> < 0.05) the reduced gut microbial diversity caused by diarrhea. Diarrhea resulted in notable alterations in gut microbiota composition, as exhibited by elevated <i>Collinsella</i> and <i>Streptococcus</i>, alongside substantially decreased <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, <i>Bacteroides</i>, and <i>Prevotella</i>, while <i>B. breve</i> BB05 supplementation partially restored the compromised gut microbiota at both the phylum and genus levels, particularly by increasing <i>Bifidobacterium</i> and <i>Roseburia</i> (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Importantly, questionnaire results suggested that <i>B. breve</i> BB05 administration achieved superior efficacy in relieving diarrhea symptoms and the associated anxiety and depression in college students. An increased fecal concentration of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) was also observed in the probiotic group, while Acetylcholine (ACH), Epinephrine (EPI), and Noradrenaline/Norepinephrine (NANE) reduced, revealing the potential of <i>B. breve</i> BB05 in alleviating anxiety and depression via modulating the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Furthermore, correlation analysis suggested that the altered microbiota and fecal neurotransmitters were closely associated with the mental symptoms.

38292207,Gut-Brain Axis Impact on Canine Anxiety Disorders: New Challenges for Behavioral Veterinary Medicine.,"Anxiety disorders in dogs are ever-growing and represent an important concern in the veterinary behavior field. These disorders are often disregarded in veterinary clinical practice, negatively impacting the animal's and owner's quality of life. Moreover, these anxiety disorders can potentially result in the abandonment or euthanasia of dogs. Growing evidence shows that the gut microbiota is a central player in the gut-brain axis. A variety of microorganisms inhabit the intestines of dogs, which are essential in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. These microbes can impact mental health through several mechanisms, including metabolic, neural, endocrine, and immune-mediated pathways. The disruption of a balanced composition of resident commensal communities, or dysbiosis, is implicated in several pathological conditions, including mental disorders such as anxiety. Studies carried out in rodent models and humans demonstrate that the intestinal microbiota can influence mental health through these mechanisms, including anxiety disorders. Furthermore, novel therapeutic strategies using prebiotics and probiotics have been shown to ameliorate anxiety-related symptoms. However, regarding the canine veterinary behavior field, there is still a lack of insightful research on this topic. In this review, we explore the few but relevant studies performed on canine anxiety disorders. We agree that innovative bacterial therapeutical approaches for canine anxiety disorders will become a promising field of investigation and certainly pave the way for new approaches to these behavioral conditions.",Veterinary medicine international,2024,Carina Sacoor; John D Marugg; Nuno R Lima; Nuno Empadinhas; Liliana Montezinho

The potential of JPJDF to inhibit CRC through modulation of intestinal microbiota and their metabolites remains uncertain.This study aims to further investigate the therapeutic mechanisms of JPJDF in CRC.CAC mouse models were developed using azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). Intestinal tissues and contents underwent 16S rRNA gene sequencing and untargeted metabolomics analysis. Serum levels of IL-1β and TNF-α were measured using ELISA. Immunohistochemistry was utilized to assess the expression of Ki67, ZO-1, Occludin, CD68, and CD206. Furthermore, western blotting was performed to evaluate the protein expression of AhR and NF-κB.JPJDF inhibited colorectal tumourigenesis in AOM/DSS treated mice, while also suppressing tumor cell proliferation and upregulating the expression of tight junction proteins. The results of 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis revealed that JPJDF altered intestinal microbiota composition by increasing the abundance of beneficial bacteria. Additionally, JPJDF reduced tryptophan metabolites, effectively alleviating inflammation and significantly restoring intestinal barrier function in CAC mice. Molecular biology experiments confirmed that JPJDF suppressed the expression levels of AhR and M2-type tumor-associated macrophages, thereby promoting anti-tumor immunity and exerting inhibitory effects on CAC growth.JPJDF can regulate the tryptophan metabolism-AhR pathway by modulating the gut microbiota, reducing intestinal inflammation, improving intestinal barrier function, enhancing anti-tumor immunity, and effectively inhibiting CAC growth.",International immunopharmacology,2024,Yonglong Chang; Qinling Ou; Xuhui Zhou; Kechao Nie; Piao Zheng; Jinhui Liu; Linzi Chen; Haixia Yan; Duanyang Guo; Sifang Zhang

Ginsenosides are the main active ingredient in ginseng and have been proven to have various pharmacological effects on the nervous system. Herein, we investigated the antidepressant effect of ginsenoside Rk3 and its underlying mechanism in a murine model of depression. Rk3 significantly improved depression-like behavior in mice, ameliorated the disturbance of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, and alleviated neuronal damage in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of mice. Additionally, Rk3 improved the abnormal metabolism of tryptophan in brain tissue by targeting tryptophan hydroxylase, thereby reducing neuronal apoptosis and synaptic structural damage in the mouse hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, Rk3 reshaped the composition of the gut microbiota of mice and regulated intestinal tryptophan metabolism, which alleviated intestinal barrier damage. Thus, this study provides valuable insights into the role of Rk3 in the tryptophan metabolic cycle along the brain-gut axis, suggesting that Rk3 may have the potential for treating depression.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2024,Jingjing Shao; Linlin Qu; Yao Liu; Jingjing Zhang; Yannan Liu; Jianjun Deng; Xiaoxuan Ma; Daidi Fan

However, obesity is complex and multifactorial by nature, and one isolated (bio)marker is unlikely to enable an optimal risk stratification and prognosis for the individual; rather, a combined set is required. Such a multicomponent interpretation would integrate biomarkers from various domains, such as classical markers (eg, anthropometrics, blood lipids), multiomics (eg, genetics, proteomics, metabolomics), lifestyle and behavioural attributes (eg, diet, physical activity, sleep patterns), psychological traits (mental health status such as depression) and additional host factors (eg, gut microbiota diversity), also by means of advanced interpretation tools such as machine learning. In this paper, we will present a protocol that will be employed for a scoping review that attempts to summarise and map the state-of-the-art in the area of multicomponent (bio)markers related to obesity, focusing on the usability and effectiveness of such biomarkers.PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL and Embase databases will be searched using predefined key terms to identify peer-reviewed articles published in English until January 2024. Once downloaded into EndNote for deduplication, CADIMA will be employed to review and select abstracts and full-text articles in a two-step procedure, by two independent reviewers. Data extraction will then be carried out by several independent reviewers. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews and Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies guidelines will be followed. Combinations employing at least two biomarkers from different domains will be mapped and discussed.Ethical approval is not required; data will rely on published articles. Findings will be published open access in an international peer-reviewed journal. This review will allow guiding future directions for research and public health strategies on obesity prevention, paving the way towards multicomponent interventions.",BMJ open,2024,Farhad Vahid; Coralie Dessenne; Josep A Tur; Cristina Bouzas; Yvan Devaux; Laurent Malisoux; Margalida Monserrat-Mesquida; Antoni Sureda; Mahesh S Desai; Jonathan D Turner; Elsa Lamy; Maria Perez-Jimenez; Gitte Ravn-Haren; Rikke Andersen; Sarah Forberger; Rajini Nagrani; Yacine Ouzzahra; Michele Filippo Fontefrancesco; Maria Giovanna Onorati; Gino Gabriel Bonetti; Tiziana de-Magistris; Torsten Bohn
39201866,Contributions of Artificial Intelligence to Analysis of Gut Microbiota in Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Systematic Review.,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder whose etiology is not known today, but everything indicates that it is multifactorial. For example, genetic and epigenetic factors seem to be involved in the etiology of ASD. In recent years, there has been an increase in studies on the implications of gut microbiota (GM) on the behavior of children with ASD given that dysbiosis in GM may trigger the onset, development and progression of ASD through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. At the same time, significant progress has occurred in the development of artificial intelligence (AI).The aim of the present study was to perform a systematic review of articles using AI to analyze GM in individuals with ASD. In line with the PRISMA model, 12 articles using AI to analyze GM in ASD were selected.Outcomes reveal that the majority of relevant studies on this topic have been conducted in China (33.3%) and Italy (25%), followed by the Netherlands (16.6%), Mexico (16.6%) and South Korea (8.3%).The bacteria <i>Bifidobacterium</i> is the most relevant biomarker with regard to ASD. Although AI provides a very promising approach to data analysis, caution is needed to avoid the over-interpretation of preliminary findings. A first step must be taken to analyze GM in a representative general population and ASD samples in order to obtain a GM standard according to age, sex and country. Thus, more work is required to bridge the gap between AI in mental health research and clinical care in ASD.","Children (Basel, Switzerland)",2024,Pau Climent-Pérez; Agustín Ernesto Martínez-González; Pedro Andreo-Martínez
38857554,Dietary sulforaphane glucosinolate mitigates depression-like behaviors in mice with hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury: A role of the gut-liver-brain axis.,"Nutrition has been increasingly recognized for its use in mental health. Depression is commonly observed in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD). Building on our recent findings of depression-like behaviors in mice with hepatic ischemia/reperfusion (HI/R) injury, mediated by the gut-liver-brain axis, this study explored the potential influence of dietary sulforaphane glucosinolate (SGS) on these behaviors. Behavioral assessments for depression-like behaviors were conducted 7 days post either sham or HI/R injury surgery. Dietary intake of SGS significantly prevented splenomegaly, systemic inflammation, depression-like behaviors, and downregulation of synaptic proteins in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of HI/R-injured mice. Through 16S rRNA analysis and untargeted metabolomic analyses, distinct bacterial profiles and metabolites were identified between control + HI/R group and SGS + HI/R group. Correlations were observed between the relative abundance of gut microbiota and both behavioral outcomes and blood metabolites. These findings suggest that SGS intake could mitigate depression-like phenotypes in mice with HI/R injury, potentially through the gut-liver-brain axis. Additionally, SGS, found in crucial vegetables like broccoli, could offer prophylactic nutritional benefits for depression in patients with CLD.",Journal of psychiatric research,2024,Yong Yang; Akifumi Eguchi; Chisato Mori; Kenji Hashimoto
39078446,Exploring the Potential of Probiotics and Prebiotics in Major Depression: From Molecular Function to Clinical Therapy.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) represents a complex and challenging mental health condition with multifaceted etiology. Recent research exploring the gut-brain axis has shed light on the potential influence of gut microbiota on mental health, offering novel avenues for therapeutic intervention. This paper reviews current evidence on the role of prebiotics and probiotics in the context of MDD treatment. Clinical studies assessing the effects of prebiotic and probiotic interventions have demonstrated promising results, showcasing improvements in depression symptoms and metabolic parameters in certain populations. Notably, prebiotics and probiotics have shown the capacity to modulate inflammatory markers, cortisol levels, and neurotransmitter pathways linked to MDD. However, existing research presents varied outcomes, underscoring the need for further investigation into specific microbial strains, dosage optimization, and long-term effects. Future research should aim at refining personalized interventions, elucidating mechanisms of action, and establishing standardized protocols to integrate these interventions into clinical practice. While prebiotics and probiotics offer potential adjunctive therapies for MDD, continued interdisciplinary efforts are vital to harnessing their full therapeutic potential and reshaping the landscape of depression treatment paradigms.",Probiotics and antimicrobial proteins,2024,Xin Yuan; Jianbo Chai; Wenqiang Xu; Yonghou Zhao
38409102,"Microbial composition, functionality, and stress resilience or susceptibility: unraveling sex-specific patterns.","Following exposure to traumatic stress, women are twice as likely as men to develop mood disorders. Yet, individual responses to such stress vary, with some people developing stress-induced psychopathologies while others exhibit resilience. The factors influencing sex-related disparities in affective disorders as well as variations in resilience remain unclear; however, emerging evidence suggests differences in the gut microbiota play a role. In this study, using the single prolonged stress (SPS) model of post-traumatic stress disorder, we investigated pre- and post-existing differences in microbial composition, functionality, and metabolites that affect stress susceptibility or resilience in each sex.Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to control or SPS groups. Two weeks following SPS, the animals were exposed to a battery of behavioral tests and decapitated a day later. Based on their anxiety index, they were further categorized as SPS-resilient (SPS-R) or SPS-susceptible (SPS-S). On the day of dissection, cecum, and selected brain tissues were isolated. Stool samples were collected before and after SPS, whereas urine samples were taken before and 30 min into the SPS.Before SPS exposure, the sympathoadrenal axis exhibited alterations within male subgroups only. Expression of tight junction protein claudin-5 was lower in brain of SPS-S males, but higher in SPS-R females following SPS. Across the study, alpha diversity remained consistently lower in males compared to females. Beta diversity revealed distinct separations between male and female susceptible groups before SPS, with this separation becoming evident in the resilient groups following SPS. At the genus level, Lactobacillus, Lachnospiraceae_Incertae_Sedis, and Barnesiella exhibited sex-specific alterations, displaying opposing abundances in each sex. Additionally, sex-specific changes were observed in microbial predictive functionality and targeted functional modules both before and after SPS. Alterations in the microbial short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), were also observed, with major and minor SCFAs being lower in SPS-susceptible males whereas branched-chain SCFAs being higher in SPS-susceptible females.This study highlights distinct pre- and post-trauma differences in microbial composition, functionality, and metabolites, associated with stress resilience in male and female rats. The findings underscore the importance of developing sex-specific therapeutic strategies to effectively address stress-related disorders. Highlights SPS model induces divergent anxiety and social behavioral responses to traumatic stress in both male and female rodents. SPS-resilient females displayed less anxiety-like behavior and initiated more interactions towards a juvenile rat than SPS-resilient males. Sex-specific pre-existing and SPS-induced differences in the gut microbial composition and predictive functionality were observed in susceptible and resilient rats. SPS-resilient males displayed elevated cecal acetate levels, whereas SPS-susceptible females exhibited heightened branched-chain SCFAs.",Biology of sex differences,2024,Arax Tanelian; Bistra Nankova; Mariam Miari; Esther L Sabban
39461950,Microbial biomarker discovery in Parkinson's disease through a network-based approach.,"Associations between the gut microbiota and Parkinson's disease (PD) have been widely investigated. However, the replicable biomarkers for PD diagnosis across multiple populations remain elusive. Herein, we performed a meta-analysis to investigate the pivotal role of the gut microbiome in PD and its potential diagnostic implications. Six 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequence datasets from five independent studies were integrated, encompassing 550 PD and 456 healthy control samples. The analysis revealed significant alterations in microbial composition and alpha and beta diversity, emphasizing altered gut microbiota in PD. Specific microbial taxa, including Faecalibacterium, Roseburia, and Coprococcus_2, known as butyrate producers, were notably diminished in PD, potentially contributing to intestinal inflammation. Conversely, genera such as Akkermansia and Bilophila exhibited increased relative abundances. A network-based algorithm called NetMoss was utilized to identify potential biomarkers of PD. Afterwards, a classification model incorporating 11 optimized genera demonstrated high performance. Further functional analyses indicated enrichment in pathways related to neurodegeneration and metabolic pathways. These findings illuminate the intricate relationship between the gut microbiota and PD, offering insights into potential therapeutic interventions and personalized diagnostic strategies.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2024,Zhe Zhao; Jing Chen; Danhua Zhao; Baoyu Chen; Qi Wang; Yuan Li; Junyi Chen; Chaobo Bai; Xintong Guo; Nan Hu; Bingwei Zhang; Rongsheng Zhao; Junliang Yuan
39200093,Should Pregnant Women Consume Probiotics to Combat Endocrine-Disrupting Chemical-Induced Health Risks to Their Unborn Offspring?,"Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) have become so pervasive in our environment and daily lives that it is impossible to avoid contact with such compounds, including pregnant women seeking to minimize exposures to themselves and their unborn children. Developmental exposure of humans and rodent models to bisphenol A (BPA) and other EDCs is linked to increased anxiogenic behaviors, learning and memory deficits, and decreased socio-sexual behaviors. Prenatal exposure to BPA and other EDCs leads to longstanding and harmful effects on gut microbiota with reductions in beneficial bacteria, i.e., gut dysbiosis, and such microbial changes are linked to host changes in fecal metabolites, including those involved in carbohydrate metabolism and synthesis, and neurobehavioral alterations in adulthood, in particular, social and cognitive deficits. Gut dysbiosis is increasingly being recognized as a key driver of a myriad of diseases, ranging from metabolic, cardiovascular, reproductive, and neurobehavioral disorders via the gut-microbiome-brain axis. Thus, EDCs might induce indirect effects on physical and mental health by acting as microbiome-disrupting chemicals. Findings raise the important question as to whether pregnant women should consume a probiotic supplement to mitigate pernicious effects of EDCs, especially BPA, on themselves and their unborn offspring. Current studies investigating the effects of maternal probiotic supplementation on pregnant women's health and that of their unborn offspring will be reviewed. Data will inform on the potential application of probiotic supplementation to reverse harmful effects of EDCs, especially BPA, in pregnant women unwittingly exposed to these compounds and striving to give their offspring the best start in life.",Biomedicines,2024,Cheryl S Rosenfeld
38959280,Pilot study assessing gut microbial diversity among sexual and gender minority young adults.,"Evidence supports that people identifying as a sexual or gender minority (SGMs) experience minority-related stress resulting from discrimination or expectations of prejudice, and that this is associated with increased mental and physical health problems compared to cisgender heterosexuals. However, the biological mechanisms driving minority-related stress impacts remain unknown, including the role of the gut microbiome. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the relationship between SGM status and gut microbiome health among young adults attending a 4-year university. To this end, a prospective pilot study was completed in the fall and spring semesters of 2021-22. Self-identified SGMs (N = 22) and cisgender-heterosexuals (CIS-HET, N = 43) completed in-person interviews to provide mental health data and demographic information. Nail and saliva samples were collected at the time of interview to quantify chronic and acute cortisol. Stool samples were collected within 48 hours of interview for microbiome analysis. Assessment of the gut microbiota identified a significant reduction in alpha diversity among the SGM group, even when adjusting for mental health outcome. SGM group showed trends for higher abundance of microbes in phylum Bacteroidetes and lower abundance of microbes in phyla Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria compared to the CIS-HET group. These findings support that the gut microbiome could be contributing to negative health effects among the SGM community.",PloS one,2024,Ashley Guy; Shannon McAuliffe; Robbie Cross; Yue Zhang; Richard E Kennedy; Norman R Estes; Samantha Giordano-Mooga; Christine Loyd
38693730,Probiotics for Inflammatory Bowel Disease; A Deep Dive into their Impact on Disease Course and Associated Health Risks.,"To date, the underlying pathology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is undetermined. Disturbance of intestinal gut microbiota was implicated in many health diseases, including IBD. Increasing evidence suggests that probiotics play a beneficial role in restoring the balance of the gut ecosystem. This review searched multiple databases for relevant works that examined probiotics' possible benefits in adults with IBD. Probiotic mode of action in ulcerative colitis patients and Crohn's disease were examined with respect to probiotic strain, their benefits, and their advantages in adult cases. Eligible studies for inclusion were assessed and analyzed. They were effective in reducing IBD disease course, inducing and maintaining remission, particularly for ulcerative colitis patients, with good efficacy and safety profile. However, the evidence for Crohn's disease was lacking. Probiotics positively affect IBD-related risks, reducing the risk of gastrointestinal malignancy and optimizing treating them. Additionally, they improved reduced fertility odds for both genders. The osteoporosis risk among IBD patients was also reduced, although the duration of use and dose were still not established. There was an encouraging role for them in reducing IBD -cardiovascular risks among cases with acute myocardial infarction and those with chronic heart failure. Finally, they had novel use in reducing IBD-related depression and improved overall mental health. In conclusion, we recommend probiotics as an adjuvant therapeutic option for IBD therapy for ulcerative colitis; however, their role in Crohn's disease needs further research.",Current medicinal chemistry,2024,Wassan Nori Mohammed Hassan; Methaq Mueen Al-Kaabi; Nabeeha Najatee Akram; Mustafa Ali Kassim Kassim; Alexandru Cosmin Pantazi
39293692,Depletion of the paternal gut microbiome alters sperm small RNAs and impacts offspring physiology and behavior in mice.,"The paternal environment prior to conception has been demonstrated to influence offspring physiology and behavior, with the sperm epigenome (including noncoding RNAs) proposed as a potential facilitator of non-genetic inheritance. Whilst the maternal gut microbiome has been established as an important influence on offspring development, the impact of the paternal gut microbiome on offspring development, health and behavior is largely unknown. Gut microbiota have major influences on immunity, and thus we hypothesized that they may be relevant to paternal immune activation (PIA) modulating epigenetic inheritance in mice. Therefore, male C57BL/6J mice (F0) were orally administered non-absorbable antibiotics via drinking water in order to substantially deplete their gut microbiome. Four weeks after administration of the antibiotics (gut microbiome depletion), F0 male mice were then mated with naïve female mice. The F1 offspring of the microbiome-depleted males had reduced body weight as well as altered gut morphology (shortened colon length). F1 females showed significant alterations in affective behaviors, including measures of anxiety and depressive-like behaviors, indicating altered development. Analysis of small noncoding RNAs in the sperm of F0 mice revealed that gut microbiome depletion is associated with differential expression of 8 different PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), each of which has the potential to modulate the expression of multiple downstream gene targets, and thus influence epigenetic inheritance and offspring development. This study demonstrates that the gut-germline axis influences sperm small RNA profiles and offspring physiology, with specific impacts on offspring affective and/or coping behaviors. These findings may have broader implications for other animal species with comparable gut microbiota, intergenerational epigenetics and developmental biology, including humans.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2024,Bethany A Masson; Pamudika Kiridena; Da Lu; Elizabeth A Kleeman; Sonali N Reisinger; Wendy Qin; William J Davies; Rikeish R Muralitharan; Hamdi A Jama; Simona Antonacci; Francine Z Marques; Carolina Gubert; Anthony J Hannan
39134294,Agmatine modulation of gut-brain axis alleviates dysbiosis-induced depression-like behavior in rats.,"Depression is a global health concern affecting nearly 280 million individuals. It not only imposes a significant burden on economies and healthcare systems but also manifests complex physiological connections and consequences. Agmatine, a putative neuromodulator derived primarily from beneficial gut microbes specially Lactobacillus, has emerged as a potential therapeutic agent for mental health. The microbiota-gut-brain axis is involved in the development of depression through the peripheral nervous system, endocrine system, and immune system and may be a key factor in the effect of agmatine. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the potential mechanism of agmatine in antibiotic-induced dysbiosis and depression-like behavior in rats, focusing on its modulation of the gut-brain axis. Depression-like behavior associated with dysbiosis was induced through a seven-day regimen of the broad-spectrum antibiotic, comprising ampicillin and metronidazole and validated through microbial, biochemical, and behavioral alterations. On day 8, antibiotic-treated rats exhibited loose fecal consistency, altered fecal microbiota, and depression-like behavior in forced swim test. Pro-inflammatory cytokines were elevated, while agmatine and monoamine levels decreased in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Antibiotic administration disrupted tight junction proteins in the ileum, affecting gut architecture. Oral administration of agmatine alone or combined with probiotics significantly reversed antibiotic-induced dysbiosis, restoring gut microbiota and mitigating depression-like behaviors. This intervention also restored neuro-inflammatory markers, increased agmatine and monoamine levels, and preserved gut integrity. The study highlights the regulatory role of endogenous agmatine in the gut-brain axis in broad-spectrum antibiotic induced dysbiosis and associated depression-like behavior.",European journal of pharmacology,2024,Sandip Rahangdale; Pankaj Deshmukh; Shivkumar Sammeta; Manish Aglawe; Mayur Kale; Milind Umekar; Nandkishor Kotagale; Brijesh Taksande
38968876,"A further examination of growth factors, T helper 1 polarization, and the gut microbiome in major depression: Associations with reoccurrence of illness, cognitive functions, suicidal behaviors, and quality of life.","Growth factors, T helper (Th)1 polarization, and the microbiome are involved in the pathophysiology of major depression (MDD). It remains unclear whether the combination of these three pathways could enhance the accuracy of predicting the features of MDD, including recurrence of illness (ROI), suicidal behaviors and the phenome. We measured serum stem cell factor (SCF), stem cell growth factor (SCGF), stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the ratio of serum Th1/Th2 cytokines (zTh1-zTh2), and the abundances of gut microbiome taxa by analyzing stool samples using 16S rDNA sequencing from 32 MDD patients and 37 healthy controls. The results show that serum SCF is significantly lower and VEGF increased in MDD. Adverse childhood experiences (ACE) and ROI are significantly associated with lowered SCF and increasing VEGF. Lifetime and current suicidal behaviors are strongly predicted (63.5%) by an increased VEGF/SCF ratio, Th1 polarization, a gut microbiome enterotype indicating gut dysbiosis, and lowered abundance of Dorea and Faecalobacterium. Around 80.5% of the variance in the phenome's severity is explained by ROI, ACEs, and lowered Parabacteroides distasonis and Clostridium IV abundances. A large part of the variance in health-related quality of life (54.1%) is explained by the VEGF/SCF ratio, Th1 polarization, ACE, and male sex. In conclusion, key features of MDD are largely predicted by the cumulative effects of ACE, Th1 polarization, aberrations in growth factors and the gut microbiome with increased pathobionts but lowered beneficial symbionts.",Journal of psychiatric research,2024,Michael Maes; Bo Zhou; Asara Vasupanrajit; Ketsupar Jirakran; Pavit Klomkliew; Prangwalai Chanchaem; Chavit Tunvirachaisakul; Kitiporn Plaimas; Apichat Suratanee; Jing Li; Abbas F Almulla; Sunchai Payungporn
39316970,Christensenella minuta mitigates behavioral and cardiometabolic hallmarks of social defeat stress.,"Psychological stress during early development and adolescence may increase the risk of psychiatric and cardiometabolic comorbidities in adulthood. The gut microbiota has been associated with mental health problems such as depression and anxiety and with cardiometabolic disease, but the potential role of the gut microbiota in their comorbidity is not well understood. We investigated the effects and mode of action of the intestinal bacterium Christensenella minuta DSM 32891 on stress-induced mental health and cardiometabolic disturbances in a mouse model of social defeat stress. We demonstrate that administered C. minuta alleviates chronic stress-induced depressive, anxiogenic and antisocial behavior. These effects are attributed to the bacterium's ability to modulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which mediates the stress response. This included the oversecretion of corticosterone and the overexpression of its receptors, as well as the metabolism of dopamine (DA) and the expression of its receptors (D1, D2L and D2S). Additionally, C. minuta administration reduced chronically induced inflammation in plasma, spleen and some brain areas, which likely contribute to the recovery of physical and behavioral function. Furthermore, C. minuta administration prevented chronic stress-induced cardiovascular damage by regulating key enzymes mediating liver fibrosis and oxidative stress. Finally, C. minuta increased the abundance of bacteria associated with mental health. Overall, our study highlights the potential of microbiota-directed interventions to alleviate both the physical and mental effects of chronic stress.",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2024,A Agusti; G V Molina-Mendoza; M Tamayo; V Rossini; M C Cenit; C Frances-Cuesta; V Tolosa-Enguis; E M Gómez Del Pulgar; A Flor-Duro; Y Sanz
39422256,A gut-focused perinatal dietary intervention is associated with lower alpha diversity of the infant gut microbiota: results from a randomised controlled trial.,"In experimental models, the prenatal diet influences gut microbiota composition in mothers and offspring; however, it is unclear whether this occurs in humans. We investigated the effects of a gut-focused perinatal dietary intervention on maternal and infant gut microbiota composition four weeks after birth.This randomised controlled trial randomised pregnant women to receive dietary advice as part of standard care, or additionally receive a dietary intervention focused on the Australian Dietary Guidelines and increasing prebiotic and probiotic/fermented food intakes (ACTRN12616000936426). Study assessments occurred from gestation week 26 (baseline) to four weeks postpartum (follow-up). Faecal samples, collected at baseline for mothers, and follow-up for mothers and infants, underwent 16SrRNA sequencing. The primary outcome was a between-group mean difference in infant faecal Shannon index. Secondary outcomes included between-group differences in other microbiota measures, including maternal change from baseline CLR-transformed <i>Prevotella</i> abundance.Forty-four women and 45 infants completed the study. The mean Shannon index of infants in the intervention group was -0.35 (95% CI: -0.64, -0.06, SD: 0.52) units lower than control group infants, corresponding to a medium effect size (Cohen's D: -0.74, 95% CI: -1.34, -0.13). The findings were similar using other metrics of α-diversity. There were no between-group differences in β-diversity, nor any differentially abundant taxa in infants. The intervention increased abundances of the genus <i>Prevotella</i> in mothers compared to controls.This gut-focused perinatal dietary intervention was associated with differences in the maternal and infant gut microbiota composition.

To date, there are no effective treatments for age-related cognitive impairment, thus preventative strategies are urgently required. Physical exercise is gaining traction as a non-pharmacological approach to promote brain health. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN), a unique form of brain plasticity which is necessary for certain cognitive functions declines with age and is enhanced in response to exercise. Accumulating evidence from research in rodents suggests that physical exercise has beneficial effects on cognition through its proneurogenic capabilities. Given ethical and technical limitations in human studies, preclinical research in rodents is crucial for a better understanding of such exercise-induced brain and behavioural changes. In this review, exercise paradigms used in preclinical research are compared. We provide an overview of the effects of different exercise paradigms on age-related cognitive decline from middle-age until older-age. We discuss the relationship between the age-related decrease in AHN and the potential impact of exercise on mitigating this decline. We highlight the emerging literature on the impact of exercise on gut microbiota during ageing and consider the role of the gut-brain axis as a future possible strategy to optimize exercise-enhanced cognitive function. Finally, we propose a guideline for designing optimal exercise protocols in rodent studies, which would inform clinical research and contribute to developing preventative strategies for age-related cognitive decline.","Brain plasticity (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2024,Maria Giovanna Caruso; Sarah Nicolas; Paul J Lucassen; Joram D Mul; Olivia F O'Leary; Yvonne M Nolan
39033825,Core antibiotic resistance genes mediate gut microbiota to intervene in the treatment of major depressive disorder.,"The relationship between depression and gut microbiota remains unclear, but an important role of gut microbiota has been verified. The relationship between gut microbiota and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) may be a potential new explanatory pathway.We collected samples from 63 depressed patients and 30 healthy controls for metagenomic sequencing. The two groups' microbiota characteristics, functional characteristics, and ARG differences were analyzed.We obtained 30 differential KEGG orthologs (KOs) and their producers in 5 genera and 7 species by HUMAnN3. We found 6 KOs from Weissella_cibaria and Lactobacillus_plantaru are potentially coring functional mechanism of gut microbiota. Different metabolites including sphingolipids, pyrans, prenol lipids, and isoflavonoids also showed significance between MDD and HC. We detected 48 significantly different ARGs: 5 ARGs up-regulated and 43 ARGs down-regulated in MDD compared to HC. Based on Cox model results, Three ARGs significantly affected drug efficacy (ARG29, ARG105, and ARG111). Eggerthella, Weissella, and Lactobacillus were correlated with different core ARGs, which indicated different mechanisms in affecting MDD.The present study needs to be replicated in different ethnic groups. At the same time, a larger Chinese cohort study and detailed experimental verification are also the key to further discussion.Our findings suggest that ARGs play a role in the interplay between major depressive disorder and gut microbiota.

Limited studies suggest ACEs can have short-term effects on children's gut microbiomes and adult cognitive performance under stress. Nevertheless, the long-term effects of ACEs experienced during adulthood remain unexplored. Thus, this study aimed to assess the long-term effects of ACEs on the gut microbiota of adult nursing students. We employed a multidimensional approach, combining 16S rRNA sequencing, bioinformatics tools, and machine learning to predict functional capabilities. High-ACE individuals had an increased abundance of <i>Butyricimonas</i> spp. and <i>Prevotella</i> spp. and decreased levels of Clostridiales, and <i>Lachnospira</i> spp. <i>Prevotella</i> abundance correlated negatively with L-glutamate and L-glutamine biosynthesis, potentially impacting intestinal tissue integrity. While nursing students with high ACE reported increased depression, evidence for a direct gut microbiota-depression relationship was inconclusive. High-ACE individuals also experienced a higher prevalence of diarrhea. These findings highlight the long-lasting impact of ACEs on the gut microbiota and its functions in adulthood, particularly among nursing students. Further research is warranted to develop targeted interventions and strategies for healthcare professionals, optimizing overall health outcomes.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2024,Negin Kazemian; Tony Zhou; Naveen Chalasani; Apurva Narayan; Jose Guillermo Cedeño Laurent; Hector A Olvera Alvarez; Sepideh Pakpour
39371767,Exploring the Renoprotective Potential of Bioactive Nutraceuticals in Chronic Kidney Disease Progression: A Narrative Review.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a condition that is characterized by progressive loss of kidney function over time. A substantial increase in the burden of CKD is evident globally, attributed to multifactorial conditions like an expanding aging population, rising diabetes and hypertension rates, and more significant exposures to risk factors associated with the environment and lifestyle. Nutraceuticals are substances that are usually considered a food or an active part of a food that provides medical or health benefits, including the prevention and treatment of a disease. The aim is to review the positive role of nutraceuticals in managing CKD. A narrative review is generated, extracting the papers from databases like Web of Science, Scopus, ScienceDirect, ResearchGate, and PubMed. Animal and human trials focusing on the effect of different nutraceuticals on the initial stage of kidney disease, i.e., stages 1, 2, and 3 of CKD, were included. The review's outcome is understanding the effectiveness of nutraceuticals that have shown positive results in CKD conditions. Active compounds include ubiquinone, curcumin, nitrates, nitrites, lycopene, and resveratrol. These bioactive components are also beneficial for other comorbid conditions like diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular conditions that have an eminent adverse effect on CKD. Lycopene, coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), resveratrol, curcumin, and flavonoids have positively impacted CKD complications. Nutraceuticals hold great promise for individuals with CKD in the coming years, offering diverse potential benefits. These include delivering vital antioxidant and anti-inflammatory support to alleviate oxidative stress and inflammation, helping to regulate blood pressure and lipid levels for improved cardiovascular health, promoting optimal renal function to sustain kidney health, assisting in maintaining electrolyte balance, warding off complications, influencing gut microbiota for enhanced digestive well-being, and ultimately elevating the overall quality of life, for those managing CKD.",Cureus,2024,Anindita Ghosh; Arti Muley; Sakshi Bhat; Archana Ainapure
38381349,Adjunctive efficacy of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis XLTG11 for functional constipation in children.,"Functional constipation (FC) can seriously affect the physical and mental health of children. The goal of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis XLTG11 in treating FC in children through a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled approach. Eligible children were randomized into either the intervention group (IG, n = 65, receiving conventional treatment with probiotics) or the control group (CG, n = 66, receiving conventional treatment without probiotics). The primary outcome measure was fecal frequency. Fecal gut microbiota analysis and PICRUSt (Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States) were used to predict gene family abundances based on 16S information. Over the course of treatment, the weekly frequency of feces within each group increased significantly (F = 41.97, p < 0.001). The frequency of feces (times/week (t/w)) in the IG was significantly higher than that in the CG (3.69 ± 2.62 t/w vs.3.18 ± 1.43 t/w, 4.03 ± 2.54 t/w vs. 2.89 ± 1.39 t/w and 3.74 ± 2.36 t/w vs. 2.94 ± 1.18 t/w and 3.45 ± 1.98 vs. 3.17 ± 1.41 t/w for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th week after intervention, respectively) (F = 7.60, p = 0.0067). After the intervention, dominate species shifted to Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium breve, and Escherichia coli in the IG. Additionally, genes related to short-chain fatty acid (SCF) metabolism were upregulated, while methane metabolism was downregulated. Administration of XLTG11 at a dose of 1 × 10<sup>10</sup> CFU/day to children increased fecal frequency, induced beneficial changes in gut microbiota, and regulated SCFs and methane metabolism-related genes.",Brazilian journal of microbiology : [publication of the Brazilian Society for Microbiology],2024,Ke Chen; Zengyuan Zhou; Yang Nie; Yanmei Cao; Ping Yang; Ying Zhang; Ping Xu; Qinghua Yu; Yang Shen; Weiwei Ma; Shanshan Jin; Changqi Liu
38863592,The effect of prebiotic and probiotic food consumption on anxiety severity: a nationwide study in Korea.,"Over the past decade, research has reported that diet and gut health affect anxiety symptoms through changes in the gut microbiota. Therefore, the introduction of prebiotic and probiotic food favorable for the intestinal microbiota is necessary to improve the mental health of the host. The purpose of this study was to examine the contribution of prebiotic and probiotic foods to lowering anxiety symptoms using a large, nationwide population-based database.The study population included 4,317 individuals 19 to 64 years of age who participated in the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES VII-3, 2019-2021). A food frequency questionnaire was used to evaluate prebiotic and probiotic food consumption. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment 7-item scale (GAD-7) assessed the severity of anxiety symptoms. The effect of prebiotic and probiotic food consumption on anxiety severity was analyzed using multiple logistic regression.Anxiety symptom severity was significantly lower in the highest prebiotic and/or probiotic food consumption tertiles compared to the lowest food consumption tertile. We also found a sex difference in the odds ratio for anxiety symptoms. The consumption of prebiotic food was significantly associated with the highest odds of anxiety among both men and women. However, probiotic food had a significant beneficial effect on lowering anxiety symptoms in men but not in women.Our finding suggests that prebiotic and probiotic food consumption might confer a beneficial influence on anxiety symptoms. Further research is required for a deeper understanding into the mechanisms of the positive effects of prebiotics and probiotics on anxiety.",Frontiers in nutrition,2024,Hyejin Tae; Tae-Suk Kim
38979127,Washed microbiota transplantation improves sleep quality in patients with sleep disorder by the gut-brain axis.,"The clinical impact of washed microbiota transplantation (WMT) from healthy donors in sleep disorder (SD) patients is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effect of WMT in SD patients.The clinical data were collected from patients with different indications receiving 1-3 courses of WMT, divided into two groups by 7 points of PSQI scale. The score of PQSI and SF-36 scale was used to assess the improvement in sleep quality and life quality among patients with sleep disorders following WMT. Finally, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was performed on fecal samples of patients with sleep disorders before and after WMT.WMT significantly improved sleep quality in patients with sleep disorder in the short and medium term. WMT significantly improved sleep latency, sleep time and total score in the short term. WMT significantly improved sleep quality and total score in the medium term. In terms of sleep quality and sleep latency, the improvement value also increased with the increase of treatment course, and the improvement effect of multiple treatment course was better than that of single and double treatment course. In the total score, the improvement effect of double and multiple treatment was better than that of single treatment. WMT also improved quality of life in the sleep disorder group. WMT significantly improved general health, vitality, social function and mental health in the short term. WMT significantly improved role-physical, general health, vitality, and mental health in the medium term. WMT regulated the disturbed gut microbiota in patients with sleep disorders. In the normal sleep group, WMT had no effect on the decline of sleep quality in the short, medium and long term, and had an improving effect on the quality of life.WMT could significantly improve sleep quality and life quality in patients with sleep disorders with no adverse events. The improvement in sleep quality resulting from WMT could lead to an overall enhancement in life quality. WMT could be a potentially effective treatment for patients with sleep disorders by regulating the gut microbiota.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2024,Hongxin He; Manqing Li; Yifan Qiu; Zhiqing Wu; Lei Wu
39360531,The Mechanisms and Quality Markers of Anti-rheumatoid Arthritis of Traditional Chinese Medicine.,"RA is a recurrent autoimmune disease that has significant adverse effects on the physical and mental health of patients. Traditional Chinese medicine has shown significant advantages in the prevention and treatment of RA. Numerous clinical and experimental studies have confirmed that traditional Chinese medicine components have clear therapeutic effects and minimal adverse reactions in treating RA. The research on traditional Chinese medicine for the prevention and treatment of RA has become a hot topic in the field of autoimmune diseases.The related references about the mechanisms and Q-markers of anti-RA of traditional Chinese medicine in this review were collected from Willy, SpringLink, Web of Science, Elsevier, PubMed, SciFinder, Scopus, ACS publications, Baidu Scholar, Google Scholar, and CNKI.The traditional Chinese medicine components such as terpenoids, flavonoids, and alkaloids have significant anti-RA effects, and their mechanisms are mainly to inhibit NF-κB signaling pathway, inhibit the proliferation of RA fibroblasts like synovial cells, and regulate Th1/Th2 cell balance, and so on. Predicting and studying the Q-markers of traditional Chinese medicine anti-RA by plant phylogeny and chemical componentss, traditional medicinal properties, pharmacokinetics, component measurability, correlation between composition and efficacy, and gut microbiota will provide scientific foundations for the research and further development of anti-RA traditional Chinese medicine.The active components of traditional Chinese medicine exhibited the characteristic of multiple mechanisms in the treatment of RA, such as terpenoids had anti-angiogenesis effects, flavonoids had anti-inflammatory and cartilage protective effects, and alkaloids had antiinflammatory and analgesic effects. The proposal of Q-markers for anti-RA provided new research ideas for promoting the development of new drugs for anti-RA and ensuring the safety and effectiveness of clinical medications.",Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening,2024,Mozili Adu; Yongwei Qiu; Qinge Ma; Guoyue Zhong; Jia-Zeng Guo; Rongrui Wei

39126817,"Interplay of yoga, physical activity, and probiotics in irritable bowel syndrome management: A double-blind randomized study.","This study aimed to explore the synergistic impact of online yoga, mindfulness practices, and probiotics on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) by evaluating changes in physical fitness, mental health, and gut microbiota composition.The six-week randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial included 31 IBS patients categorized into three groups: online yoga with probiotics (EP), online yoga with a placebo (EC), and probiotics only (P). Assessments involved physical fitness tests, subjective questionnaires (IBS-QOL, BSRS-5), and gut microbiome analysis.Participants self-collected stool samples and were given a set of questionnaires at baseline and after six weeks of intervention. Their symptoms were measured by changes in the gut microbiota, physical fitness and quality of life, and psychological well-being.The EP group demonstrated improved cardiovascular endurance (P < 0.001) and a significant reduction in Klebsiella bacterial strains (P < 0.05). Both the EP and EC groups exhibited significantly decreased IBS-QOL scores (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively), indicating enhanced quality of life. While BSRS-5 scores decreased in both groups, the reduction was statistically insignificant.Integrating online yoga, mindfulness practices, and probiotics demonstrated comprehensive benefits for IBS patients. This intervention improved physical fitness and mental well-being and positively influenced gut microbiota composition.

38806681,Temperature-dependent differences in mouse gut motility are mediated by stress.,"Researchers have advocated elevating mouse housing temperatures from the conventional ~22 °C to the mouse thermoneutral point of 30 °C to enhance translational research. However, the impact of environmental temperature on mouse gastrointestinal physiology remains largely unexplored. Here we show that mice raised at 22 °C exhibit whole gut transit speed nearly twice as fast as those raised at 30 °C, primarily driven by a threefold increase in colon transit speed. Furthermore, gut microbiota composition differs between the two temperatures but does not dictate temperature-dependent differences in gut motility. Notably, increased stress signals from the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis at 22 °C have a pivotal role in mediating temperature-dependent differences in gut motility. Pharmacological and genetic depletion of the stress hormone corticotropin-releasing hormone slows gut motility in stressed 22 °C mice but has no comparable effect in relatively unstressed 30 °C mice. In conclusion, our findings highlight that colder mouse facility temperatures significantly increase gut motility through hormonal stress pathways.",Lab animal,2024,Alvin Han; Courtney Hudson-Paz; Beatriz G Robinson; Laren Becker; Amanda Jacobson; Julia A Kaltschmidt; Jennifer L Garrison; Ami S Bhatt; Denise M Monack
38931307,Microbiome and Metabolite Analysis Insight into the Potential of Shrimp Head Hydrolysate to Alleviate Depression-like Behaviour in Growth-Period Mice Exposed to Chronic Stress.,"Chronic stress (CS) endangers the physical and mental health of adolescents. Therefore, alleviating and preventing such negative health impacts are a top priority. This study explores the effect of feeding shrimp head hydrolysate (SHH) on gut microbiota, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and neurotransmitters in growing C57BL/6 mice subjected to chronic unpredictable mild stress. Mice in the model group and three SHH groups were exposed to CS for 44 days, distilled water and SHH doses of 0.18, 0.45, 0.90 g/kg·BW were given respectively by gavage daily for 30 days from the 15th day. The results showed that SHH can significantly reverse depression-like behaviour, amino acids degradation, α diversity and β diversity, proportion of Firmicutes and Bacteroidota, abundance of genera such as <i>Muribaculaceae</i>, <i>Bacteroides</i>, <i>Prevotellaceae_UCG-001</i>, <i>Parabacteroides</i> and <i>Alistipes</i>, concentration of five short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), 5-HT and glutamate induced by CS. <i>Muribaculaceae</i> and butyric acid may be a controlled target.

39360283,From gut to brain: unveiling probiotic effects through a neuroimaging perspective-A systematic review of randomized controlled trials.,"The gut-brain axis, a bidirectional communication network between the gastrointestinal system and the brain, significantly influences mental health and behavior. Probiotics, live microorganisms conferring health benefits, have garnered attention for their potential to modulate this axis. However, their effects on brain function through gut microbiota modulation remain controversial. This systematic review examines the effects of probiotics on brain activity and functioning, focusing on randomized controlled trials using both resting-state and task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) methodologies. Studies investigating probiotic effects on brain activity in healthy individuals and clinical populations (i.e., major depressive disorder and irritable bowel syndrome) were identified. In healthy individuals, task-based fMRI studies indicated that probiotics modulate brain activity related to emotional regulation and cognitive processing, particularly in high-order areas such as the amygdala, precuneus, and orbitofrontal cortex. Resting-state fMRI studies revealed changes in connectivity patterns, such as increased activation in the Salience Network and reduced activity in the Default Mode Network. In clinical populations, task-based fMRI studies showed that probiotics could normalize brain function in patients with major depressive disorder and irritable bowel syndrome. Resting-state fMRI studies further suggested improved connectivity in mood-regulating networks, specifically in the subcallosal cortex, amygdala and hippocampus. Despite promising findings, methodological variability and limited sample sizes emphasize the need for rigorous, longitudinal research to clarify the beneficial effects of probiotics on the gut-brain axis and mental health.",Frontiers in nutrition,2024,Annachiara Crocetta; Donato Liloia; Tommaso Costa; Sergio Duca; Franco Cauda; Jordi Manuello
38866914,"Elevated fecal calprotectin is associated with gut microbial dysbiosis, altered serum markers and clinical outcomes in older individuals.","Fecal calprotectin is an established marker of gut inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Elevated levels of fecal calprotectin as well as gut microbial dysbiosis have also been observed in other clinical conditions. However, systemic and multi-omics alterations linked to elevated fecal calprotectin in older individuals remain unclear. This study comprehensively investigated the relationship between fecal calprotectin levels, gut microbiome composition, serum inflammation and targeted metabolomics markers, and relevant lifestyle and medical data in a large sample of older individuals (n = 735; mean age ± SD: 68.7 ± 6.3) from the TREND cohort study. Low (0-50 μg/g; n = 602), moderate (> 50-100 μg/g; n = 64) and high (> 100 μg/g; n = 62) fecal calprotectin groups were stratified. Several pro-inflammatory gut microbial genera were significantly increased and short-chain fatty acid producing genera were decreased in high vs. low calprotectin groups. In serum, IL-17C, CCL19 and the toxic metabolite indoxyl sulfate were increased in high vs. low fecal calprotectin groups. These changes were partially mediated by the gut microbiota. Moreover, the high fecal calprotectin group showed increased BMI and a higher disease prevalence of heart attack and obesity. Our findings contribute to the understanding of fecal calprotectin as a marker of gut dysbiosis and its broader systemic and clinical implications in older individuals.",Scientific reports,2024,Sebastian Heinzel; Jenna Jureczek; Veera Kainulainen; Anni I Nieminen; Ulrike Suenkel; Anna-Katharina von Thaler; Christoph Kaleta; Gerhard W Eschweiler; Kathrin Brockmann; Velma T E Aho; Petri Auvinen; Walter Maetzler; Daniela Berg; Filip Scheperjans
39392025,"Microbiological bases of obsessive‑compulsive disorder - the role of viruses, bacteria, and parasites in the onset and progression of OCD.","Obsessive‑compulsive disorder (OCD) is a current topic of discussion nowadays. OCD presents a variety of different etiologies including environmental, viral, cognitive, or genetic aspects. In this article, we focused on the possible correlation between various infectious diseases as well as generally the relationship between viruses, bacteria, and parasites, and an increased OCD risk. In this narrative review, we analyzed different types of articles found on PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus, as well as the articles of the National Institute of Mental Health. Searching criteria included articles from 1991 till the end of November, research involving human and animal patients (including monkeys and rats), and research published in English. Research showed a relationship between Herpes simplex virus, Rubella virus, Human immunodeficiency virus, Borna disease virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Toxoplasma gondii, streptococcal infections, as well as gut microbiota and increased OCD risk. The possible mechanisms of this relation include neuroinflammation, brain tissue damage, autoimmune processes, and impairments in neurotransmitter levels. Infections caused by Varicella zoster virus, Measles virus, Mumps virus, Epstein‑Barr virus, Cytomegalovirus, or Borrelia Burgdorferi may also contribute to the increased risk of OCD. Reports showed an increased frequency of OCD occurrence in a group of infected people compared to a healthy group. However, there is no evidence of the influence of Influenza virus, Coxsackie virus, Poliovirus, Parvovirus B19, Enterovirus 71, West Nile virus, Treponema Pallidum, or Toxocara infections on the OCD risk. There is a significant relationship between various infectious diseases and an increased OCD risk.

39346901,"Supplementation with <i>Lactobacillus helveticus</i> NS8 alleviated behavioral, neural, endocrine, and microbiota abnormalities in an endogenous rat model of depression.","Major depressive disorder is a condition involving microbiota-gut-brain axis dysfunction. Increasing research aims to improve depression through gut microbiota regulation, including interventions such as probiotics, prebiotics, and fecal microbiota transplants. However, most research focuses on exogenous depression induced by chronic stress or drugs, with less attention given to endogenous depression. Additionally, research on gut mycobiota in depression is significantly less than that on gut bacteria.In the present study, Wistar-Kyoto rats were used as an endogenous depression and treatment-resistant depression model, while Wistar rats served as controls. Differences between the two rat strains in behavior, gut bacteria, gut mycobiota, nervous system, endocrine system, immune system, and gut barrier were evaluated. Additionally, the effects of <i>Lactobacillus helveticus</i> NS8 supplementation were investigated.Wistar-Kyoto rats demonstrated increased depressive-like behaviors in the forced swimming test, reduced sucrose preference in the sucrose preference test, and decreased locomotor activity in the open field test. They also exhibited abnormal gut bacteria and mycobiota, characterized by higher bacterial α-diversity but lower fungal α-diversity, along with increased butyrate, L-tyrosine, and L-phenylalanine biosynthesis from bacteria. Furthermore, these rats showed dysfunction in the microbiota-gut-brain axis, evidenced by a hypo-serotonergic system, hyper-noradrenergic system, defective hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, compromised gut barrier integrity, heightened serum inflammation, and diminished gut immunity. A 1-month <i>L. helveticus</i> NS8 intervention increased the fecal abundance of <i>L. helveticus</i>; reduced the abundance of <i>Bilophila</i> and Debaryomycetaceae; decreased immobility time but increased climbing time in the forced swimming test; reduced hippocampal corticotropin-releasing hormone levels; decreased hypothalamic norepinephrine levels; increased hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor dopamine, and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid content; and improved the gut microbiota, serotonergic, and noradrenergic system.The depressive phenotype of Wistar-Kyoto rats is not only attributed to their genetic context but also closely related to their gut microbiota. Abnormal gut microbiota and a dysfunctional microbiota-gut-brain axis play important roles in endogenous depression, just as they do in exogenous depression. Supplementing with probiotics such as <i>L. helveticus</i> NS8 is likely a promising approach to improve endogenous depression and treatment-resistant depression.",Frontiers in immunology,2024,Husile Alatan; Shan Liang; Yosuke Shimodaira; Xiaoli Wu; Xu Hu; Tao Wang; Jia Luo; Katsunori Iijima; Feng Jin

38896988,Hyperglycemia and cognitive impairments anticipate the onset of an overt type 2 diabetes-like phenotype in TALLYHO/JngJ mice.,"Type 2 Diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disorder characterized by chronic hyperglycemia, resulting from deficits in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. Whilst the role of insulin in the peripheral nervous system has been ascertained in countless studies, its role in the central nervous system (CNS) is emerging only recently. Brain insulin has been lately associated with brain disorders like Alzheimer's disease, obsessive compulsive disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Thus, understanding the role of insulin as a common risk factor for mental and somatic comorbidities may disclose novel preventative and therapeutic approaches. We evaluated general metabolism (glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, energy expenditure, lipid metabolism, and polydipsia) and cognitive capabilities (attention, cognitive flexibility, and memory), in adolescent, young adult, and adult male and female TALLYHO/JngJ mice (TH, previously reported to constitute a valid experimental model of T2DM due to impaired insulin signaling). Adult TH mice have also been studied for alterations in gut microbiota diversity and composition. While TH mice exhibited profound deficits in cognitive flexibility and altered glucose metabolism, we observed that these alterations emerged either much earlier (males) or independent of (females) a comprehensive constellation of symptoms, isomorphic to an overt T2DM-like phenotype (insulin resistance, polydipsia, higher energy expenditure, and altered lipid metabolism). We also observed significant sex-dependent alterations in gut microbiota alpha diversity and taxonomy in adult TH mice. Deficits in insulin signaling may represent a common risk factor for both T2DM and CNS-related deficits, which may stem from (partly) independent mechanisms.",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2024,Martina Presta; Francesca Zoratto; Danique Mulder; Angela Maria Ottomana; Edoardo Pisa; Alejandro Arias Vásquez; David A Slattery; Jeffrey C Glennon; Simone Macrì
39089603,"Enhanced cerebral blood flow similarity of the somatomotor network in chronic insomnia: Transcriptomic decoding, gut microbial signatures and phenotypic roles.","Chronic insomnia (CI) is a complex disease involving multiple factors including genetics, gut microbiota, and brain structure and function. However, there lacks a unified framework to elucidate how these factors interact in CI. By combining data of clinical assessment, sleep behavior recording, cognitive test, multimodal MRI (structural, functional, and perfusion), gene, and gut microbiota, this study demonstrated that enhanced cerebral blood flow (CBF) similarities of the somatomotor network (SMN) acted as a key mediator to link multiple factors in CI. Specifically, we first demonstrated that only CBF but not morphological or functional networks exhibited alterations in patients with CI, characterized by increases within the SMN and between the SMN and higher-order associative networks. Moreover, these findings were highly reproducible and the CBF similarity method was test-retest reliable. Further, we showed that transcriptional profiles explained 60.4 % variance of the pattern of the increased CBF similarities with the most correlated genes enriched in regulation of cellular and protein localization and material transport, and gut microbiota explained 69.7 % inter-individual variance in the increased CBF similarities with the most contributions from Negativicutes and Lactobacillales. Finally, we found that the increased CBF similarities were correlated with clinical variables, accounted for sleep behaviors and cognitive deficits, and contributed the most to the patient-control classification (accuracy = 84.4 %). Altogether, our findings have important implications for understanding the neuropathology of CI and may inform ways of developing new therapeutic strategies for the disease.",NeuroImage,2024,Xiaofen Ma; Junle Li; Yuping Yang; Xiaofan Qiu; Jintao Sheng; Ningke Han; Changwen Wu; Guang Xu; Guihua Jiang; Junzhang Tian; Xuchu Weng; Jinhui Wang
39456245,Altered Gut Microbiota Patterns in Young Children with Recent Maltreatment Exposure.,"The brain and the intestinal microbiota are highly interconnected and especially vulnerable to disruptions in early life. Emerging evidence indicates that psychosocial adversity detrimentally impacts the intestinal microbiota, affecting both physical and mental health. This study aims to investigate the gut microbiome in young children in the immediate aftermath of maltreatment exposure.Maltreatment exposure was assessed in 88 children (ages 3-7) using the Maternal Interview for the Classification of Maltreatment [MICM]. Children were allocated to three groups according to the number of experienced maltreatment categories: no maltreatment, low maltreatment, and high maltreatment exposures. Stool samples were collected and analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing.Children subjected to high maltreatment exposure exhibited lower alpha diversity in comparison to those with both no and low maltreatment exposure (Simpson Index, Tukey post hoc, <i>p</i> = 0.059 and <i>p</i> = 0.007, respectively). No significant distinctions in beta diversity were identified. High maltreatment exposure was associated with the enrichment of several genera from the class Clostridia (<i>Clostridium, Intestinibacter, Howardella</i> and <i>Butyrivibrio</i>) and the depletion of the genus <i>Phocaeicola</i> (class Bacteriodia).Severe maltreatment exposure is associated with alterations in the gut microbiota of young children.

39452233,"Pharmacists' Knowledge, Perception, and Prescribing Practice of Probiotics in the UAE: A Cross-Sectional Study.","The human body is a complex and interconnected system where trillions of microorganisms, collectively known as the gut microbiota, coexist with these cells. Besides maintaining digestive health, this relationship also impacts well-being, including immune function, metabolism, and mental health. As frontline healthcare providers, pharmacists are pivotal in promoting the benefits of probiotics for immune support. This study explored pharmacists' knowledge, perception, and practice behavior in the UAE towards the implication of probiotic application beyond digestive health, such as cardiovascular and mental health impacts and their diverse dosage forms.An online self-administered survey was distributed among pharmacists in the UAE. Data were collected through personal visits to pharmacies, where pharmacists were approached and asked to complete the questionnaire. The sample size included 407 pharmacists, determined using the formula for proportions with a 95% confidence level and a 5% margin of error. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 29. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize demographic characteristics and survey responses. The knowledge levels were categorized into poor, moderate, and good. Chi-square analysis was employed to investigate associations between demographic factors and knowledge levels, with a significance level set at <i>p</i> < 0.05, enhancing the robustness of the study's findings.This study included 407 completed eligible responses. About 63.56% of participants were female, with 52.1% employed in pharmacy chains. While 91.2% of pharmacists recognized probiotics' role in immune support, only 30% were aware of their cardiovascular benefits. Moreover, chewing gum was the least known dosage form of probiotics, recognized by only 16.7% of respondents. Additionally, only 57% of the participants recognized liposomes as a dosage form. In practice, most pharmacists recommended storing probiotics at room temperature, accounting for 66.6%. The most prevalent misconception encountered in the pharmacy setting was the belief that probiotics are primarily intended for gastrointestinal tract problems, at 79.1% of the respondents. Regarding perception, the agreement was observed regarding the safety of probiotics for all ages. Perceived barriers included the high cost of probiotics, with the majority (86.5%) indicating this as a significant obstacle, while lack of demand was identified as the minor barrier by 64.6%. Additionally, an association was found at a significance level of <i>p</i> < 0.05 with knowledge, gender, educational level, type and location of pharmacy, and source of information.The study highlights knowledge gaps in pharmacists' understanding of probiotic applications beyond digestive health, particularly cardiovascular health and depression. Targeted educational interventions are necessary to address these gaps. The findings underscore the importance of ongoing professional development for pharmacists, enhancing their role in patient education and the promotion of probiotics for overall health.","Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)",2024,Maram O Abbas; Hanan Ahmed; Eisha Hamid; Dyshania Padayachee; Menah Talla Abdulbadia; Sohila Khalid; Ahmed Abuelhana; Bazigha K Abdul Rasool
39217732,"Investigating the bacterial profiles of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Actinobacteria, Fusobacterium, Firmicutes, and Bacteroides in stool samples from patients with severe depression and healthy individuals.","Depression is a multifaceted mental health disorder with complex etiology and significant global burden. Recent research indicates that the gut microbiota plays a role in the pathophysiology of depression, highlighting the potential role of specific bacterial species in influencing mood and cognitive function. In this study, we aimed to investigate the presence, copy numbers, and Ct values of selected bacterial species in stool samples from depressed patients (n=50) compared to control subjects (n=50). Our findings revealed significant differences in the abundance of Fusobacterium spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Lactobacillus spp., Bacteroidetes phylum, Firmicutes phylum, and Actinobacteria spp. between the two groups. Dysregulation of the gut microbiota, characterized by decreased presence of beneficial bacteria (e.g., Bifidobacterium spp., Lactobacillus spp.) and altered abundance of potentially pathogenic bacteria (e.g., Fusobacterium spp.), may contribute to the development or exacerbation of depression. These findings support the emerging concept of the gut-brain axis and its role in mental health. However, further research is needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms and explore the therapeutic potential of microbiota-targeted interventions for depression. Understanding the intricate interplay between the gut microbiota and depression could pave the way for novel treatment strategies and personalized approaches in mental health care.",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2024,Fatemeh Arbabi; Reza Shapoury; Fakhri Haghi; Habib Zeighami; Reza Pirzeh
39360304,Low-frequency Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Ameliorates Anhedonic Behaviors and Regulates the Gut Microbiome in Mice Exposed to Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress.,"This paper presents a preliminary study on whether low-frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation (LF-TMS) can modulate the gut microbiota in mice with chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS).Mice received LF-TMS (1 Hz, 20 mT) for 28 consecutive days under chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). The composition of gut microbiota of stool samples were tested.CUMS caused significant changes in gut microbiotas, specifically in community diversity of gut microbiotas (<i>P</i> < .05). Compared with the stressed group mice, the Chao1 index (<i>P</i> < .05), Observed species index (<i>P</i> < .05), Faith's PD index (<i>P</i> < .05) and Shannon index (<i>P</i> < .05) of the LF-TMS treatment group were significantly increased. Furthermore, 1 Hz LF-TMS-treatment partially recovered chronic stress induced changes of microbiotas, such as the abundance of <i>Chloroflexi</i>, <i>Actinobacteria</i>.These results manifested that LF-TMS treatment can improve the anhedonic behaviors caused by CUMS in mice, which are connected with regulating the related intestinal microbial community disturbance, including species diversity, structure of gut microbiota, and species composition.",Alpha psychiatry,2024,Linyin Gao; Xiangwei Zhao; Lei Wu; Chuan Liu; Ran Ding; Haitao Wang; Xueliang Shang
38432179,Combination of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> and fructooligosaccharides upregulates colonic vitamin D receptor in C57BL/6J mice and affects anxiety-related behavior in a sex-specific manner.,"Depression and anxiety disorders are among the most common mental health disorders that affect US adults today, frequently related to vitamin D (VD) insufficiency. Along with VD, growing evidence suggests gut microbiota likely play a role in neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we investigated if modulation of gut microbiota would disrupt host VD status and promote behaviors related to depression and anxiety in adult mice. Six-week-old male and female C57BL/6J mice (n = 10/mice/group) were randomly assigned to receive (1) control diet (CTR), control diet treated with antibiotics (AB), control diet with total 5000 IU of VD (VD), VD treated with antibiotics (VD + AB), VD supplemented with 5% w/w fructooligosaccharides (FOS; VF), and VF diet treated with antibiotics (VF + AB), respectively, for 8 weeks. Our study demonstrated that VD status was not affected by antibiotic regimen. VD alone ameliorates anxiety-related behavior in female mice, and that combination with FOS (i.e., VF) did not further improve the outcome. Male mice, in contrast, exhibit greater anxiety with VF, but not VD, when compared with CTR mice. Colonic VD receptor was elevated in VF-treated mice in both sexes, compared with CTR, which was positively correlated to colonic TPH1, a rate-limiting enzyme for serotonin synthesis. Taken together, our data indicate that the effect of VF on anxiety-related behavior is sex-specific, which may partially be attributed to the activation of colonic VD signaling and subsequent serotonin synthesis. The synergistic or additive effect of VD and FOS on mood disorders remained to be investigated.","Nutrition research (New York, N.Y.)",2024,Karisa M Renteria; Ethan Constantine; Chin May Teoh; Analynn Cooper; Nissi Lozano; Spenser Bauer; Gar Yee Koh
38960388,Beneficial effect of GABA-producing Lactiplantibacillus strain LPB145 isolated from cheese starters evaluated in anxiety- and depression-like behaviours in rats.,"In a previous study, we reported the in vitro potential probiotic and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) production, of several strains from a collection of Lactiplantibacillus (Lpb) strains within the community of natural whey starters from the artisanal cheese industry. GABA is a non-protein amino acid widely distributed in nature and produced in animals, plants, and microorganisms. However, the best known role of GABA is its function as the major inhibitory neurotransmitter of the central nervous system. Preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that the GABAergic system has a relevant role in mental health disorders, such as anxiety and major depression. The modulation of the GABAergic system has been suggested as a potential strategy for treatment, one such mechanism of modulation is the influence of the microbiota-gut-brain axis through probiotic treatments. The present study was designed to investigate the in vivo probiotic potential of LPB145, a Lactiplantibacillus strain previously characterised as a GABA-producing potentially probiotic strain. Therefore, we evaluated the behavioural effects of chronic oral administration of LPB145 on rats' anxiety- and depression-like behaviours, using the elevated plus maze, open field, and the forced swimming test. The impact of LPB145 strain treatment on the gut microbiota structure and diversity was assessed to discern a possible mechanism of action of the LPB145 treatment through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Our results showed that LPB145 administration induced an antidepressive-like behaviour without changes in locomotor activity. In contrast, the treatment did not modify the experimental anxiety. The structure and diversity of the intestinal microbiota remained unaffected by the treatment when compared to the control. However, specific clades that could be implicated in the behavioural changes did show differences in their relative abundance. These findings provide evidence regarding the potential of probiotic strains isolated from alimentary sources, to modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis and positively impact mental health.",Beneficial microbes,2024,J Lozano; S Fabius; S Fernández-Ciganda; J Urbanavicius; C Piccini; C Scorza; P Zunino

39313515,Oral administration of astilbin mitigates acetaminophen-induced acute liver injury in mice by modulating the gut microbiota.,"Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose-induced acute liver injury (ALI) is characterized by extensive oxidative stress, and the clinical interventions for this adverse effect remain limited. Astilbin is an active compound found in the rhizome of Smilax glabra Roxb. with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. Due to its low oral bioavailability, astilbin can accumulate in the intestine, which provides a basis for the interaction between astilbin and gut microbiota (GM). In the present study we investigated the protective effects of astilbin against APAP-induced ALI by focusing on the interaction between astilbin and GM. Mice were treated with astilbin (50 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>·d<sup>-1</sup>, i.g.) for 7 days. After the last administration of astilbin for 2 h, the mice received APAP (300 mg/kg, i.g.) to induce ALI. We showed that oral administration of astilbin significantly alleviated APAP-induced ALI by altering the composition of GM and enriching beneficial metabolites including hydroxytyrosol (HT). GM depletion using an ""antibiotics cocktail"" or paraoral administration of astilbin abolished the hepatoprotective effects of astilbin. On the other hand, administration of HT (10 mg/kg, i.g.) caused similar protective effects in APAP-induced ALI mice. Transcriptomic analysis of the liver tissue revealed that HT inhibited reactive oxygen species and inflammation-related signaling in APAP-induced ALI; HT promoted activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway to combat oxidative stress following APAP challenge in a sirtuin-6-dependent manner. These results highlight that oral astilbin ameliorates APAP-induced ALI by manipulating the GM and metabolites towards a more favorable profile, and provide an alternative therapeutic strategy for alleviating APAP-induced ALI.",Acta pharmacologica Sinica,2024,Qin Yang; Wen-Hao He; Li Xie; Tao Chen; Ruo-Fan Liu; Jia-Jia Hu; Jia-Yin Guo; Guo-Zhu Tan; Fu-Ling Wu; Peng Gu; Peng Chen; Yu Chen
38166669,"Effectiveness of a socioecological model-guided, smart device-based, self-management-oriented lifestyle intervention in community residents: protocol for a cluster-randomized controlled trial.","Healthy lifestyles are crucial for preventing chronic diseases. Nonetheless, approximately 90% of Chinese community residents regularly engage in at least one unhealthy lifestyle. Mobile smart devices-based health interventions (mHealth) that incorporate theoretical frameworks regarding behavioral change in interaction with the environment may provide an appealing and cost-effective approach for promoting sustainable adaptations of healthier lifestyles. We designed a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effectiveness of a socioecological model-guided, smart device-based, and self-management-oriented lifestyles (3SLIFE) intervention, to promote healthy lifestyles among Chinese community residents.This two-arm, parallel, cluster-RCT with a 6-month intervention and 6-month follow-up period foresees to randomize a total of 20 communities/villages from 4 townships in a 1:1 ratio to either intervention or control. Within these communities, a total of at least 256 community residents will be enrolled. The experimental group will receive a multi-level intervention based on the socioecological model supplemented with a multi-dimensional empowerment approach. The control group will receive information only. The primary outcome is the reduction of modifiable unhealthy lifestyles at six months, including smoking, excess alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, unbalanced diet, and overweight/obesity. A reduction by one unhealthy behavior measured with the Healthy Lifestyle Index Score (HLIS) will be considered favorable. Secondary outcomes include reduction of specific unhealthy lifestyles at 3 months, 9 months, and 12 months, and mental health outcomes such as depression measured with PHQ-9, social outcomes such as social support measured with the modified Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, clinical outcomes such as obesity, and biomedical outcomes such as the development of gut microbiota. Data will be analyzed with mixed effects generalized linear models with family and link function determined by outcome distribution and accounting for clustering of participants in communities.This study will provide evidence concerning the effect of a mHealth intervention that incorporates a behavioral change theoretical framework on cultivating and maintaining healthy lifestyles in community residents. The study will provide insights into research on and application of similar mHealth intervention strategies to promote healthy lifestyles in community populations and settings.ChiCTR2300070575.

38737108,Cucurbitacin E Alleviates Colonic Barrier Function Impairment and Inflammation Response and Improves Microbial Composition on Experimental Colitis Models.,"Cucurbitacins, which are found in a variety of medicinal plants, vegetables and fruits, were known for their diverse pharmacological and biological activities, including anticancer, anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. Cucurbitacin E, one of the major cucurbitacins, was recently proved to inhibit inflammatory response.To explore the therapeutic effects of cucurbitacin E on colitis and the underlying mechanisms, male mice drunk water containing 2.5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) to establish colitis model and administrated with cucurbitacin E during and after DSS treatment. The disease activity index was scored and colonic histological damage was observed. Intestinal tight junction and inflammatory response were determined. 16S rRNA and transcriptome sequencing were performed to analyze gut microbiota composition and gene expression, respectively.We found that cucurbitacin E alleviated DSS-induced body weight loss and impaired colonic morphology. Cucurbitacin E decreased the expression of inflammatory cytokines and cell apoptosis, and maintained barrier function. Additionally, cucurbitacin E retrieved DSS-induced alterations in the bacterial community composition. Furthermore, a variety of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) caused by cucurbitacin E were enriched in several pathways including the NFκB and TNF signaling pathways as well as in Th17 cell differentiation. There was a close relationship between DEGs and bacteria such as <i>Escherichia-Shigella</i> and Muribaculaceae.Our results revealed that cucurbitacin E may exert protective effects on colitis via modulating inflammatory response, microbiota composition and host gene expression. Our study supports the therapeutic potential of cucurbitacin E in colitis and indicates that gut microbes are potentially therapeutic targets.",Journal of inflammation research,2024,Fengxia Zhan; Wei Song; Yong Fan; Fangjian Wang; Qian Wang
39271063,"Probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum 299v supplementation in patients with major depression in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial: A metabolomics study.","Understanding the multifactorial nature of major depressive disorder (MDD) is crucial for tailoring treatments. However, the complex interplay of various factors underlying the development and progression of MDD poses significant challenges. Our previous study demonstrated improvements in cognitive functions in MDD patients undergoing treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) supplemented with Lactobacillus plantarum 299v (LP299v).To elucidate the biochemical mechanisms underlying cognitive functions improvements, we explored underlying metabolic changes. We employed multi-platform metabolomics, including LC-QTOF-MS and CE-TOF-MS profiling, alongside chiral LC-QqQ-MS analysis for amino acids.Supplementation of SSRI treatment with LP299v intensified the reduction of long-chain acylcarnitines, potentially indicating improved mitochondrial function. LP299v supplementation reduced N-acyl taurines more than four times compared to the placebo, suggesting a substantial impact on restoring biochemical balance. The LP299v-supplemented group showed increased levels of oxidized glycerophosphocholine (oxPC). Additionally, LP299v supplementation led to higher levels of sphingomyelins, L-histidine, D-valine, and p-cresol.This exploratory study suggests potential metabolic pathways influenced by LP299v supplementation. However, the need for further research hinders the ability to draw definitive conclusions.Observed metabolic changes were linked to mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, oxidative stress, and gut microbiota disruption. Despite the subtle nature of this alterations, our research successfully detected these differences and connected them to the metabolic disruptions associated with MDD. Our findings emphasise the intricate relationship between metabolism, gut microbiota, and mental health prompting further research into the mechanisms of action of probiotics in MDD treatment.",Journal of affective disorders,2024,Joanna Godzien; Bartlomiej Kalaska; Leszek Rudzki; Cecilia Barbas-Bernardos; Justyna Swieton; Angeles Lopez-Gonzalvez; Lucyna Ostrowska; Agata Szulc; Napoleon Waszkiewicz; Michal Ciborowski; Antonia García; Adam Kretowski; Coral Barbas; Dariusz Pawlak

38278499,Alcohol use-associated alterations in the circulating metabolite profile in the general population and in individuals with major depressive disorder.,"Our aim was to evaluate whether alcohol use is associated with changes in the circulating metabolite profile similar to those present in persons with depression. If so, these findings could partially explain the link between alcohol use and depression. We applied a targeted liquid chromatography mass spectrometry method to evaluate correlates between concentrations of 86 circulating metabolites and self-reported alcohol use in a cohort of the non-depressed general population (GP) (n = 247) and a cohort of individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) (n = 99). Alcohol use was associated with alterations in circulating concentrations of metabolites in both cohorts. Our main finding was that self-reported alcohol use was negatively correlated with serum concentrations of hippuric acid in the GP cohort. In the GP cohort, consumption of six or more doses per week was associated with low hippuric acid concentrations, similar to those observed in the MDD cohort, but in these individuals it was regardless of their level of alcohol use. Reduced serum concentrations of hippuric acid suggest that already-moderate alcohol use is associated with depression-like changes in the serum levels of metabolites associated with gut microbiota and liver function; this may be one possible molecular level link between alcohol use and depression.","Alcohol (Fayetteville, N.Y.)",2024,Olli Kärkkäinen; Tommi Tolmunen; Petri Kivimäki; Karoliina Kurkinen; Toni Ali-Sisto; Pekka Mäntyselkä; Minna Valkonen-Korhonen; Heli Koivumaa-Honkanen; Kirsi Honkalampi; Anu Ruusunen; Vidya Velagapudi; Soili M Lehto
