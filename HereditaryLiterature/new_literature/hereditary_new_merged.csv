32163822,The gut microbiota and mental health in adults.,"A growing body of evidence point toward the bidirectional gut microbiota-brain axis playing a role in mental health. Most of this research is conducted on animals why we in this review summarize and comment upon recent studies evaluating the gut microbiome in mental health in humans. Further support for the relevance of the bidirectional gut microbiota-brain communication in mood disorders has been presented, such as the effect of probiotics on brain connectivity and mental health outcomes and pregnancy related stress on gut microbiota in the newborn child. However, the heterogeneity between studies precludes conclusions regarding differences in microbiota composition in mental disease and health and many of the studies are limited by a cross-sectional design, small sample sizes and multiple comparisons. Thus, well-designed longitudinal studies with larger sample size, accounting for confounders are needed.",Current opinion in neurobiology,2020,Ellionore JÃ¤rbrink-Sehgal; Anna Andreasson
33271426,The gut microbiota in anxiety and depression - A systematic review.,"Growing evidence indicates the community of microorganisms throughout the gastrointestinal tract, (i.e., gut microbiota), is associated with anxiety and depressive disorders. We present the first systematic review of the gut microbiota in anxiety disorders, along with an update in depression. Consideration of shared underlying features is essential due to the high rates of comorbidity. Systematic searches, following PRISMA guidelines, identified 26 studies (two case-control comparisons of the gut microbiota in generalised anxiety disorder, 18 in depression, one incorporating both anxiety/depression, and five including symptom-only measures). Alpha and beta diversity findings were inconsistent; however, differences in bacterial taxa indicated disorders may be characterised by a higher abundance of proinflammatory species (e.g., Enterobacteriaceae and Desulfovibrio), and lower short-chain fatty acid producing-bacteria (e.g., Faecalibacterium). Several taxa, and their mechanisms of action, may relate to anxiety and depression pathophysiology via communication of peripheral inflammation to the brain. Although the gut microbiota remains a promising target for prevention and therapy, future research should assess confounders, particularly diet and psychotropic medications, and should examine microorganism function.",Clinical psychology review,2021,Carra A Simpson; Carmela Diaz-Arteche; Djamila Eliby; Orli S Schwartz; Julian G Simmons; Caitlin S M Cowan
32772900,Gut microbes in neurocognitive and mental health disorders.,"As individuals age, the prevalence of neurocognitive and mental health disorders increases. Current biomedical treatments do not completely address the management of these conditions. Despite new pharmacological therapy the challenges of managing these diseases remain.There is increasing evidence that the Gut Microbiome (GM) and microbial dysbiosis contribute to some of the more prevalent mental health and neurocognitive disorders, such as depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), schizophrenia, bipolar disorder (BP), and dementia as well as the behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. <b>Methodology:</b> Scoping review about the effect of gut microbiota on neurocognitive and mental health disorders.This scoping review found there is an evolving evidence of the involvement of the gut microbiota in the pathophysiology of neurocognitive and mental health disorders. This manuscript also discusses how the psychotropics used to treat these conditions may have an antimicrobial effect on GM, and the potential for new strategies of management with probiotics and faecal transplantation.This understanding can open up the need for a gut related approach in these disorders as well as unlock the door for the role of gut related microbiota management. KEY MESSAGES Challenges of managing mental health conditions remain in spite of new pharmacological therapy. Gut dysbiosis is seen in various mental health conditions. Various psychotropic medications can have an influence on the gut microbiota by their antimicrobial effect.",Annals of medicine,2020,Tyler Halverson; Kannayiram Alagiakrishnan
32899236,"Alcohol Addiction, Gut Microbiota, and Alcoholism Treatment: A Review.","Alcohol addiction is a leading risk factor for personal death and disability. In 2016, alcohol use caused 2.2% of female deaths and 6.8% of male deaths, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were 2.3% in female and 8.9% in male. Individuals with alcohol use disorder are at high risk of anxiety, depression, impaired cognition performance, and illicit drug use and are comorbid with liver disease, such as alcoholic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis, which is a major cause of personal death and disability worldwide. Psychological interventions, such as cognitive behavior therapy and motivational interviewing, as well as medical treatments, such as disulfiram, naltrexone, acamprosate, and nalmefene, are used for the treatment of alcohol addiction in Europe and the United States. However, the effect of current interventions is limited, and the need for additional interventions is substantial. Alcohol use impairs the intestinal barrier and causes changes to the intestinal permeability as well as the gut microbiota composition. Emerging studies have tried to reveal the role of the gut-brain axis among individuals with alcohol use disorder with or without alcohol liver disease. Bacterial products penetrate the impaired intestinal barrier and cause central inflammation; changes to the gut microbiota impair enterohepatic circulation of bile acids; alcohol abuse causes shortage of vital nutrients such as thiamine. Several studies have suggested that probiotics, through either oral administration or fecal microbiota transplantation, increased intestinal levels of potentially beneficial bacteria such as bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, improving the levels of liver-associated enzymes in patients with mild alcoholic hepatitis, and demonstrating beneficial psychotropic effects on anxiety and depression. In addition to medications for alcohol addiction, gene editing therapy such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) may be another potential research target. Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), which are associated with ADH and ALDH genes, are major enzymes involved in alcohol metabolism, and gene editing approaches may have the potential to directly modify specific genes to treat alcoholism caused by genetic defects. Further research is needed to study the effect of the combined treatment for alcohol addiction.",International journal of molecular sciences,2020,Shao-Cheng Wang; Yuan-Chuan Chen; Shaw-Ji Chen; Chun-Hung Lee; Ching-Ming Cheng
32149335,The Role of the Gut Microbiota in Dietary Interventions for Depression and Anxiety.,"There is emerging evidence that an unhealthy dietary pattern may increase the risk of developing depression or anxiety, whereas a healthy dietary pattern may decrease it. This nascent research suggests that dietary interventions could help prevent, or be an alternative or adjunct therapy for, depression and anxiety. The relation, however, is complex, affected by many confounding variables, and is also likely to be bidirectional, with dietary choices being affected by stress and depression. This complexity is reflected in the data, with sometimes conflicting results among studies. As the research evolves, all characteristics of the relation need to be considered to ensure that we obtain a full understanding, which can potentially be translated into clinical practice. A parallel and fast-growing body of research shows that the gut microbiota is linked with the brain in a bidirectional relation, commonly termed the microbiome-gut-brain axis. Preclinical evidence suggests that this axis plays a key role in the regulation of brain function and behavior. In this review we discuss possible reasons for the conflicting results in diet-mood research, and present examples of areas of the diet-mood relation in which the gut microbiota is likely to be involved, potentially explaining some of the conflicting results from diet and depression studies. We argue that because diet is one of the most significant factors that affects human gut microbiota structure and function, nutritional intervention studies need to consider the gut microbiota as an essential piece of the puzzle.","Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2020,Tracey L K Bear; Julie E Dalziel; Jane Coad; Nicole C Roy; Christine A Butts; Pramod K Gopal
31628992,"Exercise, diet and stress as modulators of gut microbiota: Implications for neurodegenerative diseases.","The last decade has witnessed an exponentially growing interest in gut microbiota and the gut-brain axis in health and disease. Accumulating evidence from preclinical and clinical research indicate that gut microbiota, and their associated microbiomes, may influence pathogenic processes and thus the onset and progression of various diseases, including neurological and psychiatric disorders. In fact, gut dysbiosis (microbiota dysregulation) has been associated with a range of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's and motor neuron disease, as well as multiple sclerosis. The gut microbiota constitutes a dynamic microbial system constantly challenged by many biological variables, including environmental factors. Since the gut microbiota constitute a changeable and experience-dependent ecosystem, they provide potential therapeutic targets that can be modulated as new interventions for dysbiosis-related disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases. This article reviews the evidence for environmental modulation of gut microbiota and its relevance to brain disorders, exploring in particular the implications for neurodegenerative diseases. We will focus on three major environmental factors that are known to influence the onset and progression of those diseases, namely exercise, diet and stress. Further exploration of environmental modulation, acting via both peripheral (e.g. gut microbiota and associated metabolic dysfunction or 'metabolopathy') and central (e.g. direct effects on CNS neurons and glia) mechanisms, may lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches, such as enviromimetics, for a wide range of neurological and psychiatric disorders.",Neurobiology of disease,2020,Carolina Gubert; Geraldine Kong; Thibault Renoir; Anthony J Hannan

33087991,Human Gut Microbiota and Mental Health: Advancements and Challenges in Microbe-Based Therapeutic Interventions.,"Gut microbes play prime role in human health and have shown to exert their influence on various physiological responses including neurological functions. Growing evidences in recent years have indicated a key role of gut microbiota in contributing to mental health. The connection between gut and brain is modulated by microbes via neural, neuroendocrinal and metabolic pathways that are mediated through various neurotransmitters and their precursors, hormones, cytokines and bioactive metabolites. Impaired functioning of this connection can lead to manifestation of mental disorders. Around 1 billion of the world population is reported to suffer from emotional, psychological and neurological imbalances, substance use disorders and cognitive, psychosocial and intellectual disabilities. Thus, it becomes imperative to understand the role of gut microbes in mental disorders. Since variations occur in the conditions associated with different mental disorders and some of them have overlapping symptoms, it becomes important to have a holistic understanding of gut dysbiosis in these disorders. In this review, we consolidate the recent data on alterations in the gut microbes and its consequences in various neurological, psychological and neurodegenerative disorders. Further, considering these evidences, several studies have been undertaken to specifically target the gut microbiota through different therapeutic interventions including administration of live microbes (psychobiotics) to treat mental health disorders and/or their symptoms. We review these studies and propose that an integrative and personalized approach, where combinations of microbe-based therapeutic interventions to modulate gut microbes and in-use psychological treatment practices can be integrated and based on patient's gut microbiome can be potentially adopted for effective treatment of the mental disorders.",Indian journal of microbiology,2020,Helianthous Verma; Sonika Phian; Priya Lakra; Jasleen Kaur; Sanjukta Subudhi; Rup Lal; Charu Dogra Rawat
30415609,"Fermented foods, the gut and mental health: a mechanistic overview with implications for depression and anxiety.","Mental disorders including depression and anxiety are often comorbid with gut problems, suggesting a bidirectional relationship between mental health and gut function. Several mechanisms might explain this comorbidity, such as inflammation and immune activation; intestinal permeability; perturbations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis; neurotransmitter/neuropeptide dysregulation; dietary deficiencies; and disturbed gut microbiome composition. The potential of modulating the microbiome-gut-brain axis, and subsequently mental health, through the use of functional foods, is an emerging and novel topic of interest. Fermented foods are considered functional foods due to their putative health benefits. The process of microbial fermentation converts food substrates into more nutritionally and functionally rich products, resulting in functional microorganisms (probiotics), substrates that enhance proliferation of beneficial bacteria in the gut (prebiotics), and bioactive components (biogenics). These functional ingredients act biologically in the gastrointestinal tract and have the ability to modify the gut microbiota, influence translocation of endotoxins and subsequent immune activation, and promote host nutrition. This narrative review explores the theoretical potential of the functional components present in fermented foods to alter gut physiology and to impact the biological mechanisms thought to underpin depression and anxiety. Pre-clinical studies indicate the benefits of fermented foods in relieving perturbed gut function and for animal models of depression and anxiety. However, in humans, the literature relating to the relevance of fermented food for treating or preventing depression and anxiety is sparse, heterogeneous and has significant limitations. This review identifies a critical research gap for further evaluation of fermented foods in the management of depression anxiety in humans.",Nutritional neuroscience,2020,Hajara Aslam; Jessica Green; Felice N Jacka; Fiona Collier; Michael Berk; Julie Pasco; Samantha L Dawson
33144709,Diet and depression: exploring the biological mechanisms of action.,"The field of nutritional psychiatry has generated observational and efficacy data supporting a role for healthy dietary patterns in depression onset and symptom management. To guide future clinical trials and targeted dietary therapies, this review provides an overview of what is currently known regarding underlying mechanisms of action by which diet may influence mental and brain health. The mechanisms of action associating diet with health outcomes are complex, multifaceted, interacting, and not restricted to any one biological pathway. Numerous pathways were identified through which diet could plausibly affect mental health. These include modulation of pathways involved in inflammation, oxidative stress, epigenetics, mitochondrial dysfunction, the gut microbiota, tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism, the HPA axis, neurogenesis and BDNF, epigenetics, and obesity. However, the nascent nature of the nutritional psychiatry field to date means that the existing literature identified in this review is largely comprised of preclinical animal studies. To fully identify and elucidate complex mechanisms of action, intervention studies that assess markers related to these pathways within clinically diagnosed human populations are needed.",Molecular psychiatry,2021,Wolfgang Marx; Melissa Lane; Meghan Hockey; Hajara Aslam; Michael Berk; Ken Walder; Alessandra Borsini; Joseph Firth; Carmine M Pariante; Kirsten Berding; John F Cryan; Gerard Clarke; Jeffrey M Craig; Kuan-Pin Su; David Mischoulon; Fernando Gomez-Pinilla; Jane A Foster; Patrice D Cani; Sandrine Thuret; Heidi M Staudacher; Almudena SÃ¡nchez-Villegas; Husnain Arshad; Tasnime Akbaraly; Adrienne O'Neil; Toby Segasby; Felice N Jacka
32816830,"Does Fibre-fix provided to people with irritable bowel syndrome who are consuming a low FODMAP diet improve their gut health, gut microbiome, sleep and mental health? A double-blinded, randomised controlled trial.","A diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) is an effective way to reduce gut symptoms in people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This diet reduces the intake of fermentable fibres, leading to changes of the gut microbiota and insufficient fermentation in the large bowel, resulting in reduced production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as butyrate, which has unfavourable implications for gut health, sleep and mental health. This study will examine the effect of Fibre-fix, a supplement containing a mix of dietary fibres, on the human gut microbiome composition, fermentative capacity, sleep, quality of life (QOL) and mental health of people with IBS who consume a low FODMAP diet (LFD).A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, study design is proposed to examine whether Fibre-fix added to an existing LFD may help modulate gastrointestinal function, improve markers of sleep, mental health and promote QOL in patients with IBS. Participants will provide stool and blood samples, daily bowel symptoms diaries and 3-day diet records. Additionally, they will complete validated questionnaires relating to FODMAP intake, sleep, mental health and QOL before and after a 3-week intervention. Gut health will be assessed via faecal microbiome composition, faecal pH and SCFA levels. Alteration of sleep will be recorded using an actigraphy device worn by all participants over the whole study. Multivariate analysis will be used to examine the gut microbiome and repeated measures Analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used for dependent variables from questionnaires related to bowel symptoms, stool type, sleep, mental health and QOL to assess the differences between intervention and control groups after adjustment for confounding variables.Ethics approval was obtained from the Human Research Ethics Committee of Edith Cowan University (2019-00619-YAN). Results will be disseminated in peer-review journal publications, and conference presentations. Participants will be provided with a summary of findings once the study is completed. If Fibre-fix is shown to result in favourable changes in gut microbial composition, SCFA production, sleep and mental well-being without exacerbating symptoms, this will provide additional dietary management options for those with IBS following an LFD.ACTRN12620000032954.",BMJ open gastroenterology,2020,Ran Yan; Mandy Murphy; Angela Genoni; Evania Marlow; Ian C Dunican; Johnny Lo; Lesley Andrew; Amanda Devine; Claus T Christophersen
32918633,Early Life Stress and the Development of the Infant Gut Microbiota: Implications for Mental Health and Neurocognitive Development.,"We review the state of the literature examining associations between early life stress (ELS), gut microbiota, and neurocognitive development and mental health in animals and humans. We identify gaps in current models and areas for future research.ELS is associated with changes in gut microbiota, which correspond to changes in affective and cognitive functioning in both animals and humans. Some of these ELS-induced psychological changes can be remedied by supplementation with probiotics in early life, suggesting a potential area for intervention for ELS-exposed children. Prenatal stress exposure is rarely studied in humans in relation to gut microbiota, but animal work has suggested important associations between prenatal stress and fetal programming that should be tested in humans. The gut microbiota plays an important role in the association between ELS, neurocognitive development, and mental health.

32130662,Current Perspectives on Gut Microbiome Dysbiosis and Depression.,"The human gut microbiome partakes in a bidirectional communication pathway with the central nervous system (CNS), named the microbiota-gut-brain axis. The microbiota-gut-brain axis is believed to modulate various central processes through the vagus nerve as well as production of microbial metabolites and immune mediators which trigger changes in neurotransmission, neuroinflammation, and behavior. Little is understood about the utilization of microbiome manipulation to treat disease. Though studies exploring the role of the microbiome in various disease processes have shown promise, mechanisms remain unclear and evidence-based treatments for most illnesses have not yet been developed. The animal studies reviewed here offer an excellent array of basic science research that continues to clarify mechanisms by which the microbiome may affect mental health. More evidence is needed, particularly as it relates to translating this work to human subjects. The studies presented in this paper largely demonstrate encouraging results in the treatment of depression. Limitations include small sample sizes and heterogeneous methodology. The exact mechanism by which the gut microbiota causes or alters neuropsychiatric disease states is not fully understood. In this review, we focus on recent studies investigating the relationship between gut microbiome dysbiosis and the pathogenesis of depression.

33171595,PROVIT: Supplementary Probiotic Treatment and Vitamin B7 in Depression-A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Gut microbiota are suspected to affect brain functions and behavior as well as lowering inflammation status. Therefore, an effect on depression has already been suggested by recent research. The aim of this randomized double-blind controlled trial was to evaluate the effect of probiotic treatment in depressed individuals. Within inpatient care, 82 currently depressed individuals were randomly assigned to either receive a multistrain probiotic plus biotin treatment or biotin plus placebo for 28 days. Clinical symptoms as well as gut microbiome were analyzed at the begin of the study, after one and after four weeks. After 16S rRNA analysis, microbiome samples were bioinformatically explored using QIIME, SPSS, R and Piphillin. Both groups improved significantly regarding psychiatric symptoms. <i>Ruminococcus gauvreauii</i> and <i>Coprococcus 3</i> were more abundant and Î²-diversity was higher in the probiotics group after 28 days. KEGG-analysis showed elevated inflammation-regulatory and metabolic pathways in the intervention group. The elevated abundance of potentially beneficial bacteria after probiotic treatment allows speculations on the functionality of probiotic treatment in depressed individuals. Furthermore, the finding of upregulated vitamin B6 and B7 synthesis underlines the connection between the quality of diet, gut microbiota and mental health through the regulation of metabolic functions, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties. Concluding, four-week probiotic plus biotin supplementation, in inpatient individuals with a major depressive disorder diagnosis, showed an overall beneficial effect of clinical treatment. However, probiotic intervention compared to placebo only differed in microbial diversity profile, not in clinical outcome measures.",Nutrients,2020,Eva Z Reininghaus; Martina Platzer; Alexandra Kohlhammer-Dohr; Carlo Hamm; Sabrina MÃ¶rkl; Susanne A Bengesser; Frederike T Fellendorf; Theressa Lahousen-Luxenberger; Birgitta Leitner-Afschar; Helmut SchÃ¶ggl; Daniela Amberger-Otti; Walter Wurm; Robert Queissner; Armin Birner; Valerie S Falzberger; Annamaria Painold; Werner Fitz; Jolana Wagner-Skacel; Martina Brunnmayr; Alexandra Rieger; Alexander Maget; Renate Unterweger; Karin Schwalsberger; Bernd Reininghaus; Melanie Lenger; Thomaz F S Bastiaanssen; Nina Dalkner
32819434,The gut microbiota regulates autism-like behavior by mediating vitamin B<sub>6</sub> homeostasis in EphB6-deficient mice.,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder, and the effective pharmacological treatments for the core autistic symptoms are currently limited. Increasing evidence, particularly that from clinical studies on ASD patients, suggests a functional link between the gut microbiota and the development of ASD. However, the mechanisms linking the gut microbiota with brain dysfunctions (gut-brain axis) in ASD have not yet been full elucidated. Due to its genetic mutations and downregulated expression in patients with ASD, EPHB6, which also plays important roles in gut homeostasis, is generally considered a candidate gene for ASD. Nonetheless, the role and mechanism of EPHB6 in regulating the gut microbiota and the development of ASD are unclear.Here, we found that the deletion of EphB6 induced autism-like behavior and disturbed the gut microbiota in mice. More importantly, transplantation of the fecal microbiota from EphB6-deficient mice resulted in autism-like behavior in antibiotic-treated C57BL/6J mice, and transplantation of the fecal microbiota from wild-type mice ameliorated the autism-like behavior in EphB6-deficient mice. At the metabolic level, the disturbed gut microbiota in EphB6-deficient mice led to vitamin B<sub>6</sub> and dopamine defects. At the cellular level, the excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance in the medial prefrontal cortex was regulated by gut microbiota-mediated vitamin B<sub>6</sub> in EphB6-deficient mice.Our study uncovers a key role for the gut microbiota in the regulation of autism-like social behavior by vitamin B<sub>6</sub>, dopamine, and the E/I balance in EphB6-deficient mice, and these findings suggest new strategies for understanding and treating ASD.

33301807,Spinal cord injury and gut microbiota: A review.,"After spinal cord injury (SCI), intestinal dysfunction has a serious impact on physical and mental health, quality of life, and social participation. Recent data from rodent and human studies indicated that SCI causes gut dysbiosis. Remodeling gut microbiota could be beneficial for the recovery of intestinal function and motor function after SCI. However, few studies have explored SCI with focus on the gut microbiota and ""microbiota-gut-brain""Â axis. In this review, the complications following SCI, including intestinal dysfunction, anxiety and depression, metabolic disorders, and neuropathic pain, are directly or indirectly related to gut dysbiosis, which may be mediated by ""gut-brain"" interactions. Furthermore, we discuss the research strategies that can be beneficial in this regard, including germ-free animals, fecal microbiota transplantation, probiotics, phages, and brain imaging techniques. The current microbial research has shifted from descriptive to mechanismal perspective, and future research using new technologies may further demonstrate the pathophysiological mechanism of association of SCI with gut microbiota, elucidate the mode of interaction of gut microbiota and hosts, and help develop personalized microbiota-targeted therapies and drugs based on microbiota or corresponding metabolites.",Life sciences,2021,Yingli Jing; Fan Bai; Yan Yu
33287442,The Gut Microbiota: A Potential Gateway to Improved Health Outcomes in Breast Cancer Treatment and Survivorship.,"Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women worldwide. The disease and its treatments exert profound effects on an individual's physical and mental health. There are many factors that impact an individual's risk of developing breast cancer, their response to treatments, and their risk of recurrence. The community of microorganisms inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract, the gut microbiota, affects human health through metabolic, neural, and endocrine signaling, and immune activity. It is through these mechanisms that the gut microbiota appears to influence breast cancer risk, response to treatment, and recurrence. A disrupted gut microbiota or state of 'dysbiosis' can contribute to a biological environment associated with higher risk for cancer development as well as contribute to negative treatment side-effects. Many cancer treatments have been shown to shift the gut microbiota toward dysbiosis; however, the microbiota can also be positively manipulated through diet, prebiotic and probiotic supplementation, and exercise. The objective of this review is to provide an overview of the current understanding of the relationship between the gut microbiota and breast cancer and to highlight potential strategies for modulation of the gut microbiota that could lead to improved clinical outcomes and overall health in this population.",International journal of molecular sciences,2020,Kara Sampsell; DesirÃ©e Hao; Raylene A Reimer
33271210,A systematic review of microbiome changes and impact of probiotic supplementation in children and adolescents with neuropsychiatric disorders.,"In recent decades, the diagnostic and therapeutic implications of the microbiome changes and the impact of probiotic supplementation have increased rapidly. However, the potential for clinical translation of microbiome research for children and adolescents with psychiatric disorders is unclear. This review examined available evidence related to gut microbiota as well as the impact of probiotic supplementation on psychiatric disorders in the pediatric population reported to date.We performed a literature search for the gut microbiota in child and adolescent population (0-18Â years old) with mental health disorders from July 1999 through July 2019 in several databases: ClinicalTrials.gov, Ovid EBM Reviews, Ovid Embase, Ovid Medline, Ovid PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science.A total of 7 studies met inclusion criteria consisting of randomized controlled trials and cohort studies that examined various associations between psychiatric disorders and gut microbiota in youth. Six studies examined the effects of various treatment interventions such as probiotic supplementation on microbiota composition and behaviors. One study showed an increase in prosocial behavior in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and an increase in the Lachnospiraceae family following prebiotic supplementation. Another study suggested that prebiotic supplementation increased bifidobacterial populations for ASD and healthy controls. A study evaluating infant supplementation of prebiotics showed both a decreased likelihood of developing Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or ASD and decreased gut Bifidobacterium. One study did not find significant differences in microbiome composition after micronutrient treatment.The main goal of this systematic review was to comprehensively examine and summarize the current evidence focused on the potential effect of the relationship between microbiota gut composition as well as the effects of probiotic supplementation on psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents. This is a relatively new area of research and the number of included studies is limited. More studies are needed to determine whether gut dysbiosis leads to the development and/or contributes to the severity of mental disorders or whether gut dysbiosis is a result of other processes that accompany mental disorders.A better understanding of the specific bacteria contributions, gut-brain pathways, and role in pathophysiological mechanisms in neuropsychiatric disorders in the child and adolescent populations can possibly provide alternative tools for a clinical psychiatrist. Moreover, it may ultimately aid the clinician with intervention strategies, or detect populations at risk for developing neuropsychiatric disorders.",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,2021,Anna N Ligezka; A Irem Sonmez; Martha P Corral-Frias; Raphael Golebiowski; Brian Lynch; Paul E Croarkin; Magdalena Romanowicz
31255682,Altered gut microbiota and mucosal immunity in patients with schizophrenia.,"Evidence shows that gut microbiota may play important roles in schizophrenia pathogenesis via the ""gut-brain"" axis, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Here, eighty-four patients with schizophrenia and 84 sex- and age-matched healthy controls were enrolled. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing and 16S rRNA sequencing were performed, and the gut microbiota-associated epitopes (MEs) were predicted, which, together with IgA content, were used to determine the gut microbiota composition associated with gut immune status. Patients with schizophrenia had significantly reduced gut microbiota richnesses compared with those of the healthy controls, and the gut microbiota compositions clearly distinguished the patients with schizophrenia from the healthy controls. Based on two-stage metagenomic-wide association studies, nineteen gut microbiota taxonomies were associated with schizophrenia, and the microbial dysbiosis (MD) index was calculated based on the abundance of differential taxonomies. We found that MD index was positively correlated with MEs diversity and gut IgA levels, and negatively correlated with gut microbiota richness. Glutamate synthase (GOGAT) was more active in the guts of patients with schizophrenia than in those of healthy controls, and high GOGAT activity was associated with altered gut microbiota taxonomies associated with gut IgA levels. Our results may imply a role of the microbiome in the etiology of schizophrenia and contribute to the development of microbiome targeted interventions for schizophrenia.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2020,Ruihuan Xu; Bingbing Wu; Jingwen Liang; Fusheng He; Wen Gu; Kang Li; Yi Luo; Jianxia Chen; Yongbo Gao; Ze Wu; Yongqiang Wang; Wenhao Zhou; Mingbang Wang
32062351,Gut microbiota composition during infancy and subsequent behavioural outcomes.,"Despite intense interest in the relationship between gut microbiota and brain development, longitudinal data from human studies are lacking. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the composition of gut microbiota during infancy and subsequent behavioural outcomes.A subcohort of 201 children with behavioural outcome measures was identified within a longitudinal, Australian birth-cohort study. The faecal microbiota were analysed at 1, 6, and 12 months of age. Behavioural outcomes were measured at 2 years of age.In an unselected birth cohort, we found a clear association between decreased normalised abundance of Prevotella in faecal samples collected at 12 months of age and increased behavioural problems at 2 years, in particular Internalizing Problem scores. This association appeared independent of multiple potentially confounding variables, including maternal mental health.

31821833,The connection between microbiome and schizophrenia.,"There has been an accumulation of knowledge about the human microbiome, some detailed investigations of the gastrointestinal microbiota and its functions, and the highlighting of complex interactions between the gut, the gut microbiota, and the central nervous system. That assumes the involvement of the microbiome in the pathogenesis of various CNS diseases, including schizophrenia. Given this information and the fact, that the gut microbiota is sensitive to internal and environmental influences, we have speculated that among the factors that influence the formation and composition of gut microbiota during life, possible key elements in the schizophrenia development chain are hidden where gut microbiota is a linking component. This article aims to describe and understand the developmental relationships between intestinal microbiota and the risk of developing schizophrenia.",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,2020,Bogdana Golofast; Karel Vales
33318317,Mental awareness improved mild cognitive impairment and modulated gut microbiome.,"There is ample scientific and clinical evidence of the effects of gut microbiota on the brain but no definitive evidence that the brain can affect changes in gut microbiota under the bi-directional gut-brain axis concept. As there is no pharmacotherapeutic intervention for the early stages of cognitive decline, research has focused on cognitive stimulation in reversing or slowing the impairment. Elderly patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment underwent a randomized-control trial of mindful awareness practice. Neuropsychological assessments, inflammatory markers, and gut microbiota profiles were tested. Here, we report that their cognitive impairment was improved and associated with changes in gut bacterial profile. A cognition-score-dependent-abundance was observed in <i>Ruminococcus</i> vs Recognition Trials (RT), Digit Span Backward (DSB), Semantic Fluency Span (SFS) and Memory Domain (MD); <i>Coprococcus</i> vs DSB, Color Trails Test 2 (CTT2) and Block Design (BD); <i>Parabacteroides</i> vs DSB and SFS; <i>Fusobacterium</i> vs DSB and CTT2; <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> vs BD and SFS; <i>Ruminococcaceae</i> vs DSB; <i>Phascolarctobacterium</i> vs MD. The study showed for the first-time, alteration in the cognitive capacity leading to the corresponding changes in microbiota profiles. This strongly suggests that signals from the different segments of brain could dictate directly or indirectly the abundances of specific gut microbes.",Aging,2020,Wei Wei Thwe Khine; Miao Lian Voong; Ted Kheng Siang Ng; Lei Feng; Grishma Avinash Rane; Alan Prem Kumar; Ee Heok Kua; Ratha Mahendran; Rathi Mahendran; Yuan-Kun Lee
32056905,Reduced anti-inflammatory gut microbiota are associated with depression and anhedonia.,"Characterise gut microbiota distributions of participants with co-occurring depression and anxiety, in those with only depression or with anxiety, and determine if gut bacteria differentially correlates with distinct clinical presentations.Participants (10 healthy controls [mean age: 33, 60% female] and 60 psychiatric subjects; major depressive disorder (comorbid with anxiety), nÂ =Â 38 [mean age: 39.2, 82% female], anxiety only, nÂ =Â 8 [mean age: 40.0, 100% female], depression only without anxiety, nÂ =Â 14 [mean age: 41.9, 79% female]) were characterized by psychiatric assessments. Quantitative PCR and 16S rRNA sequencing were used to characterize the gut microbiota in stool samples.Altered microbiota correlated with pre-defined clinical presentation, with Bacteroides (pÂ =Â 0.011) and the Clostridium leptum subgroup (pÂ =Â 0.023) significantly different between clinical categories. Cluster analysis of the total sample using weighted UniFrac Î²-diversity of the gut microbiota identified two different clusters defined by differences in bacterial distribution. Cluster 2 had higher Bacteroides (pÂ =Â 0.006), and much reduced presence of Clostridales (p<0.001) compared to Cluster 1. Bifidobacterium (pÂ =Â 0.0173) was also reduced in Cluster 2 compared to Cluster 1. When evaluated for clinical charateristics, anhedonia scores in Cluster 2 were higher than in Cluster 1.The sample is smaller and predominately female.Reduced or absent Clostridia was consistently seen in those with depression, independent of the presence of anxiety. Conversely, reduced Bacteroides may be more associated with the presence of anxiety, independent of the presence of depression. These differences suggest that gut microbiota distribution could help clarify the underlying pathology of comorbid clinical presentation.",Journal of affective disorders,2020,Brittany L Mason; Qiwei Li; Abu Minhajuddin; Andrew H Czysz; Laura A Coughlin; Sarah K Hussain; Andrew Y Koh; Madhukar H Trivedi
33177907,Gut Microbiota Changes and Their Relationship with Inflammation in Patients with Acute and Chronic Insomnia.,"The major purpose of this study was to detect the changes in gut microbiota composition and inflammatory cytokines production associated with acute and chronic insomnia. This study also evaluated the relationship between gut microbiota changes and increased inflammatory cytokines in insomnia patients.Outpatients with acute and chronic insomnia (aged 26-55 years; n=20 and 38, respectively) and age/gender-matched healthy controls (n=38) were recruited from a southern China region. Participants' gut microbiome, plasma cytokines, and self-reported sleep quality and psychopathological symptoms were measured.The gut microbiomes of insomnia patients compared with healthy controls were characterized by lower microbial richness and diversity, depletion of anaerobes, and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria, and an expansion of potential pathobionts. <i>Lachnospira</i> and <i>Bacteroides</i> were signature bacteria for distinguishing acute insomnia patients from healthy controls, while <i>Faecalibacterium</i> and <i>Blautia</i> were signature bacteria for distinguishing chronic insomnia patients from healthy controls. Acute/chronic insomnia-related signature bacteria also showed correlations with these patients' self-reported sleep quality and plasma IL-1Î².These ï¬ndings suggest that insomnia symptomology, gut microbiota, and inflammation may be interrelated in complex ways. Gut microbiota may serve as an important indicator for auxiliary diagnosis of insomnia and provide possible new therapeutic targets in the ï¬eld of sleep disorders.",Nature and science of sleep,2020,Yuanyuan Li; Bin Zhang; Ya Zhou; Daoming Wang; Xianchen Liu; Lin Li; Tong Wang; Yuechu Zhang; Min Jiang; Huilan Tang; Lawrence V Amsel; Fang Fan; Christina W Hoven
32032668,Maternal Obesity as a Risk Factor for Brain Development and Mental Health in the Offspring.,"Maternal obesity plays a key role in the health trajectory of the offspring. Although research on this topic has largely focused on the potential of this condition to increase the risk for child obesity, it is becoming more and more evident that it can also significantly impact cognitive function and mental health. The mechanisms underlying these effects are starting to be elucidated and point to the placenta as a critical organ that may mediate changes in the response to stress, immune function and oxidative stress. Long-term effects of maternal obesity may rely upon epigenetic changes in selected genes that are involved in metabolic and trophic regulations of the brain. More recent evidence also indicates the gut microbiota as a potential mediator of these effects. Overall, understanding cause-effect relationships can allow the development of preventive measures that could rely upon dietary changes in the mother and the offspring. Addressing diets appears more feasible than developing new pharmacological targets and has the potential to affect the multiple interconnected physiological pathways engaged by these complex regulations, allowing prevention of both metabolic and mental disorders.",Neuroscience,2020,Francesca Cirulli; Chiara Musillo; Alessandra Berry
31726457,Gut Microbiota: A Perspective for Psychiatrists.,"There is mounting evidence that the trillions of microbes that inhabit our gut are a substantial contributing factor to mental health and, equally, to the progression of neuropsychiatric disorders. The extraordinary complexity of the gut ecosystem, and how it interacts with the intestinal epithelium to manifest physiological changes in the brain to influence mood and behaviour, has been the subject of intense scientific scrutiny over the last 2 decades. To further complicate matters, we each harbour a unique microbiota community that is subject to change by a number of factors including diet, exercise, stress, health status, genetics, medication, and age, amongst others. The microbiota-gut-brain axis is a dynamic matrix of tissues and organs including the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota, immune cells, gut tissue, glands, the autonomic nervous system (ANS), and the brain that communicate in a complex multidirectional manner through a number of anatomically and physiologically distinct systems. Long-term perturbations to this homeostatic environment may contribute to the progression of a number of disorders by altering physiological processes including hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation, neurotransmitter systems, immune function, and the inflammatory response. While an appropriate, co-ordinated physiological response, such as an immune or stress response, is necessary for survival, a dysfunctional response can be detrimental to the host, contributing to the development of a number of central nervous system disorders.",Neuropsychobiology,2020,Kieran Rea; Timothy G Dinan; John F Cryan
32056910,Feeling down? A systematic review of the gut microbiota in anxiety/depression and irritable bowel syndrome.,"Background Anxiety/depression and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are highly prevalent and burdensome conditions, whose co-occurrence is estimated between 44 and 84%. Shared gut microbiota alterations have been identified in these separate disorders relative to controls; however, studies have not adequately considered their comorbidity. This review set out to identify case-control studies comparing the gut microbiota in anxiety/depression, IBS, and both conditions comorbidly relative to each other and to controls, as well as gut microbiota investigations including measures of both IBS and anxiety/depression. Methods Four databases were systematically searched using comprehensive search terms (OVID Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and PubMed), following PRISMA guidelines. Results Systematic review identified 17 studies (10 human, 7 animal). Most studies investigated the gut microbiota and anxiety/depression symptoms in IBS cohorts. Participants with IBS and high anxiety/depression symptoms had lower alpha diversity compared to controls and IBS-only cohorts. Machine learning and beta diversity distinguished between IBS participants with and without anxiety/depression by their gut microbiota. Comorbid IBS and anxiety/depression also had higher abundance of Proteobacteria, Prevotella/Prevotellaceae, Bacteroides and lower Lachnospiraceae relative to controls. Limitations A large number of gut microbiota estimation methods and statistical techniques were utilized; therefore, meta-analysis was not possible. Conclusions Well-designed case-control and longitudinal studies are required to disentangle whether the gut microbiota is predicted as a continuum of gastrointestinal and anxiety/depression symptom severity, or whether reported dysbiosis is unique to IBS and anxiety/depression comorbidity. These findings may inform the development of targeted treatment through the gut microbiota for individuals with both anxiety/depression and IBS.",Journal of affective disorders,2020,Carra A Simpson; Andre Mu; Nick Haslam; Orli S Schwartz; Julian G Simmons
32469834,"The human gut microbiota and depression: widely reviewed, yet poorly understood.","A large number of existing reviews have discussed the role of the gut microbiota in affective disorders, though syntheses have been overwhelmingly narrative in their focus.In this correspondence, we compliment Sanada etÂ al. (2020) on their recent systematic review of the gut microbiota in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), the first to incorporate a meta-analysis. We also comment on how this synthesis should be extended in future research.Sanada etÂ al. (2020) conducted a meta-analysis of alpha diversity in participants with MDD compared to controls, whereby they unexpectedly observed no significant difference between groups. A meta-analysis was only able to be performed on alpha diversity indices. Future research should consider research quality, other forms of depression, incorporate comprehensive meta-analyses, where possible, as well as investigate associations between anxiety/depression symptom measures and the gut microbiota.Further consideration of papers which incorporate functional analyses (e.g., metabolomics) is required to integrate this body of literature.Research investigating the microbiota-gut-brain axis in affective disorders has been met with great enthusiasm, offering promising direction for novel therapeutics in conditions such as depression.

33206326,Gut-Brain-Skin Axis in Psoriasis: A Review.,"Psoriasis is a common skin disease, with chronic inflammation and a complex etiology. It has long been recognized that chronic skin conditions and mental health disorders are often co-morbid. Thus, the concept of the gut-brain-skin axis emphasized in mental health disorders may also regulate the health of skin.The gut microbiota has been found to be the bridge between the immune system and nervous system. By leveraging clinical cases and animal models of psoriasis, an important communication pathway has been identified along the gut-brain-skin axis that is associated with the modulation of neurotransmitters from the microbiota. Furthermore, mammalian neurotransmitters, including dopamine, serotonin, or Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA), can be produced and/or consumed by several types of bacteria. Other studies suggest that manipulating these neurotransmitters by bacteria may have an effect on host physiology, and the levels of neurotransmitter can be altered by microbiota-based interventions.Nonetheless, it is unknown whether or not the manipulation of neurotransmitter levels by bacteria can affect the occurrence and development of psoriasis. Notably, preliminary experiments found that oral consumption of probiotics improves the clinical symptoms in patients with psoriasis, perhaps correlated with the gut microbiome-mediated crosstalk between the immune system and the nervous system by secreting neurotransmitters in psoriasis. In this review, the communication along the gut-brain-skin axis is discussed.",Dermatology and therapy,2021,Guang Chen; Zai-Ming Chen; Xiao-Yan Fan; Yue-Lei Jin; Xin Li; Shi-Ren Wu; Wei-Wei Ge; Cao-Hua Lv; Yao-Kun Wang; Jin-Guang Chen
32506238,Gut Microbiome Dysbiosis and Depression: a Comprehensive Review.,"The human gut microbiome is involved in a bi-directional communication pathway with the central nervous system (CNS), termed the microbiota-gut-brain axis. The microbiota-gut-brain axis is believed to mediate or modulate various central processes through the vagus nerve. The microbiota-gut-brain axis is involved with the production of microbial metabolites and immune mediators which trigger changes in neurotransmission, neuroinflammation, and behavior. Little is understood about the utilization of microbiome manipulation to treat disease.Though studies exploring the role of the microbiome in various disease processes have shown promise, mechanisms remain unclear and evidence-based treatments for most illnesses have not yet been developed. The animal studies reviewed in the present investigation include an array of basic science studies that clarify mechanisms by which the microbiome may affect mental health. More evidence is needed, particularly as it relates to translating this work to humans. The studies presented in this review demonstrate encouraging results in the treatment of depression. Limitations include small sample sizes and heterogeneous methodology. The exact mechanism by which the gut microbiota causes or alters neuropsychiatric disease states is not fully understood. In this review, we focus on recent studies investigating the relationship between gut microbiome dysbiosis and the pathogenesis of depression.",Current pain and headache reports,2020,Alexander Capuco; Ivan Urits; Jamal Hasoon; Rebecca Chun; Brittany Gerald; Jason K Wang; Anh L Ngo; Thomas Simopoulos; Alan D Kaye; Matthew M Colontonio; Tomasina Q Parker-Actlis; Mitchell C Fuller; Omar Viswanath
33005892,"Gut dysbiosis in Huntington's disease: associations among gut microbiota, cognitive performance and clinical outcomes.","Huntington's disease is characterized by a triad of motor, cognitive and psychiatric impairments, as well as unintended weight loss. Although much of the research has focused on cognitive, motor and psychiatric symptoms, the extent of peripheral pathology and the relationship between these factors, and the core symptoms of Huntington's disease, are relatively unknown. Gut microbiota are key modulators of communication between the brain and gut, and alterations in microbiota composition (dysbiosis) can negatively affect cognition, behaviour and affective function, and may be implicated in disease progression. Furthermore, gut dysbiosis was recently reported in Huntington's disease transgenic mice. Our main objective was to characterize the gut microbiome in people with Huntington's disease and determine whether the composition of gut microbiota are significantly related to clinical indicators of disease progression. We compared 42 Huntington's disease gene expansion carriers, including 19 people who were diagnosed with Huntington's disease (Total Functional Capacity > 6) and 23 in the premanifest stage, with 36 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Participants were characterized clinically using a battery of cognitive tests and using results from 16S V3 to V4 rRNA sequencing of faecal samples to characterize the gut microbiome. For gut microbiome measures, we found significant differences in the microbial communities (beta diversity) based on unweighted UniFrac distance (<i>Pâ</i>=<i>â</i>0.001), as well as significantly lower alpha diversity (species richness and evenness) between our combined Huntington's disease gene expansion carrier group and healthy controls (<i>Pâ</i>=<i>â</i>0.001). We also found major shifts in the microbial community structure at Phylum and Family levels, and identified functional pathways and enzymes affected in our Huntington's disease gene expansion carrier group. Within the Huntington's disease gene expansion carrier group, we also discovered associations among gut bacteria, cognitive performance and clinical outcomes. Overall, our findings suggest an altered gut microbiome in Huntington's disease gene expansion carriers. These results highlight the importance of gut biomarkers and raise interesting questions regarding the role of the gut in Huntington's disease, and whether it may be a potential target for future therapeutic intervention.",Brain communications,2020,Cory I Wasser; Emily-Clare Mercieca; Geraldine Kong; Anthony J Hannan; Sonja J McKeown; Yifat Glikmann-Johnston; Julie C Stout
31722343,The Gut Microbiome in Bipolar Disorder and Pharmacotherapy Management.,"The gut microbiome is a complex and dynamic community of commensal, symbiotic, and pathogenic microorganisms that exist in a bidirectional relationship with the host. Bacterial functions in the gut play a critical role in healthy host functioning, and its disruption can contribute to many medical conditions. The relationship between gut microbiota and the brain has gained attention in mental health due to the mounting evidence supporting the association of gut bacteria with mood and behavior. Patients with bipolar disorder exhibit an increased frequency of gastrointestinal illnesses such as inflammatory bowel disease, which mechanistically has been linked to microbial community function. While the heterogeneity in microbial communities between individuals might be associated with disease risk, it may also moderate the efficacy or adverse effects associated with the use of medication. The following review highlights published evidence linking the function of gut microbiota both to bipolar disorder risk and to the effect of medications that influence microbiota, inflammation, and mood symptoms.",Neuropsychobiology,2020,Stephanie A Flowers; Kristen M Ward; Crystal T Clark
31750916,Dietary fiber and its associations with depression and inflammation.,"Dietary fiber is a crucial component of a healthy diet, with benefits that can be attributed to processes in the gut microbiota and the resulting by-products. Observational studies support associations between dietary fiber intake and depression and inflammation, but the potential mechanisms are poorly understood. This review examines evidence of the effects of dietary fiber on depression and inflammation and considers plausible mechanisms linking dietary fiber and depression, including microbiota-driven modification of gene expression and increased production of neurotransmitters. Additionally, inflammation may mediate the relationship between dietary fiber intake and depression. A high-fiber diet potentially lowers inflammation by modifying both the pH and the permeability of the gut. The resultant reduction in inflammatory compounds may alter neurotransmitter concentrations to reduce symptoms of depression. Further research into the link between dietary fiber intake and inflammation and depression is essential, as findings could potentially provide guidance for improvement in or prevention of inflammatory and depressive disorders.",Nutrition reviews,2020,Olivia G Swann; Michelle Kilpatrick; Monique Breslin; Wendy H Oddy

The gutâbrain axis is an established axis demonstrating the effect of the gut microbiota on the biochemical processes in the brain. With the existence of mindfulness initiatives such as adoption of a âyogic lifestyleâÂ aimed at creating a sense of harmony and balance within the individual, this special report considers the available evidence base, asking whether the harmony created by adopting this lifestyle can be related to establishing harmony in the gutâbrain axis.",Future science OA,2020,Kavita Beri
33287416,Bacterial Metabolites of Human Gut Microbiota Correlating with Depression.,"Depression is a global threat to mental health that affects around 264 million people worldwide. Despite the considerable evolution in our understanding of the pathophysiology of depression, no reliable biomarkers that have contributed to objective diagnoses and clinical therapy currently exist. The discovery of the microbiota-gut-brain axis induced scientists to study the role of gut microbiota (GM) in the pathogenesis of depression. Over the last decade, many of studies were conducted in this field. The productions of metabolites and compounds with neuroactive and immunomodulatory properties among mechanisms such as the mediating effects of the GM on the brain, have been identified. This comprehensive review was focused on low molecular weight compounds implicated in depression as potential products of the GM. The other possible mechanisms of GM involvement in depression were presented, as well as changes in the composition of the microbiota of patients with depression. In conclusion, the therapeutic potential of functional foods and psychobiotics in relieving depression were considered. The described biomarkers associated with GM could potentially enhance the diagnostic criteria for depressive disorders in clinical practice and represent a potential future diagnostic tool based on metagenomic technologies for assessing the development of depressive disorders.",International journal of molecular sciences,2020,Olga V Averina; Yana A Zorkina; Roman A Yunes; Alexey S Kovtun; Valeriya M Ushakova; Anna Y Morozova; George P Kostyuk; Valery N Danilenko; Vladimir P Chekhonin
32389857,Targeting the microbiota in pharmacology of psychiatric disorders.,"There is increasing interest in the role of the gut microbiota in health and disease. In particular, gut microbiota influences the Central Nervous System (CNS) development and homeostasis through neural pathways or routes involving the immune and circulatory systems. The CNS, in turn, shapes the intestinal flora through endocrine or stress-mediated responses. These overall bidirectional interactions, known as gut microbiota-brain axis, profoundly affect some brain functions, such as neurogenesis and the production of neurotransmitters, up to influence behavioral aspects of healthy subjects. Consequently, a dysfunction within this axis, as observed in case of dysbiosis, can have an impact on the behavior of a given individual (e.g. anxiety and depression) or on the development of pathologies affecting the CNS, such as autism spectrum disorders and neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease). It should be considered that the whole microbiota has a significant role not only on aspects concerning human physiology, such as harvesting of nutrients and energy from the ingested food or production of a wide range of bioactive compounds, but also has positive effects on the gastrointestinal barrier function and actively contributes to the pharmacokinetics of several compounds including neuropsychiatric drugs. Indeed, the microbiota is able to affect drug absorption and metabolism up to have an impact on drug activity and/or toxicity. On the other hand, drugs are able to shape the human gut microbiota itself, where these changes may contribute to their pharmacologic profile. Therefore, the emerging picture on the complex drug-microbiota bidirectional interplay will have considerable implications in the future not only in terms of clinical practice but also, upstream, on drug development.",Pharmacological research,2020,Alessia Pascale; Nicoletta Marchesi; Stefano Govoni; Annalisa Barbieri

30466372,"An intermittent hypercaloric diet alters gut microbiota, prefrontal cortical gene expression and social behaviours in rats.","<b>Objectives:</b> Excessive consumption of high fat and high sugar (HFHS) diets alters reward processing, behaviour, and changes gut microbiota profiles. Previous studies in gnotobiotic mice also provide evidence that these gut microorganisms may influence social behaviour. To further investigate these interactions, we examined the impact of the intermittent access to a HFHS diet on social behaviour, gene expression and microbiota composition in adolescent rats. <b>Methods:</b> Male rats were permitted intermittent daily access (2âh / day) to a palatable HFHS chow diet for 28 days across adolescence. Social interaction, social memory and novel object recognition were assessed during this period. Following testing, RT-PCR was conducted on hippocampal and prefrontal cortex (PFC) samples. 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing was used for identification and relative quantification of bacterial taxa in faecal samples. <b>Results:</b> We observed reduced social interaction behaviours, impaired social memory and novel object recognition in HFHS diet rats compared to chow controls. RT-PCR revealed reduced levels of monoamine oxidase A (<i>Maoa</i>), catechol-O-methyltransferase (<i>Comt</i>) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (<i>Bdnf</i>) mRNA in the PFC of HFHS diet rats. Faecal microbiota analysis demonstrated that the relative abundance of a number of specific bacterial taxa differed significantly between the two diet groups, in particular, <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> and <i>Ruminoccoceae</i> bacteria. <b>Discussion:</b> Intermittent HFHS diet consumption evoked physiological changes to the brain, particularly expression of mRNA associated with reward and neuroplasticity, and gut microbiome. These changes may underpin the observed alterations to social behaviours.",Nutritional neuroscience,2020,Amy C Reichelt; Amy Loughman; Ashton Bernard; Mukesh Raipuria; Kirsten N Abbott; James Dachtler; Thi Thu Hao Van; Robert J Moore
32979562,Shotgun metagenomics reveals both taxonomic and tryptophan pathway differences of gut microbiota in bipolar disorder with current major depressive episode patients.,"The microbiome-gut-brain axis, especially the microbial tryptophan biosynthesis and metabolism pathway (MiTBamp), is closely connected to bipolar disorder with current major depressive episode (BPD).We performed shotgun metagenomics sequencing (SMS) of faecal samples from 25 BPD patients and 28 healthy controls (HCs). Except for the microbiota taxa and MiTBamp analyses, we also built a classification model using the Random Forests (RF) and Boruta algorithm to find the microbial biomarkers for BPD.Compared to HCs, the phylum Bacteroidetes abundance was significantly reduced, whereas that of the Actinobacteria and Firmicutes were significantly increased in BPD patients. We also identified 38 species increased and 6 species decreased significantly in the BPD group. In the MiTBamp, we identified that two Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) orthologies (KOs) (K00658 and K00837) were significantly lower in the BPD, and five KOs (K01696, K00382, K00626, K01667, and K03781) were significantly higher in the BPD group. We also identified significant genera and species which were closely related to these KOs. Finally, RF classification based on gut microbiota at the genus level can achieve an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.997.The features of cross-sectional design, limited sample size, the heterogeneity of bipolar disorders, and a lack of serum/plasma tryptophan concentration measurements.The present findings enable a better understanding of changes in gastrointestinal microbiome and MiTBamp in BPD.

31955786,"Neuroactive compounds in foods: Occurrence, mechanism and potential health effects.","Neuroactive compounds are synthesized by certain plants and microorganisms by undertaking different tasks, especially as a stress response. Most common neuroactive compounds in foods are gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), serotonin, melatonin, kynurenine, kynurenic acid, dopamine, norepinephrine, histamine, tryptamine, tyramine and Î²-phenylethylamine. Fermented foods contain some of these compounds, which can affect human health and mood. Moreover, food processing such as roasting and malting alter amount and profile of neuroactive compounds in foods. In addition to plant-origin and microbially-formed neuroactive compounds in foods, these substances are also formed by gut microbiota, which is the most attractive subject to assess the interaction between gut microbiota and mental health. The discovery of microbiota-gut-brain axis calls for the investigation of the effects of diet on the formation of neuroactive compounds in the gut. Furthermore, probiotics and prebiotics are indispensable elements for the understanding of the food-mood relationship. The focus of this comprehensive review is to investigate the neuroactive compounds found naturally in foods or formed during fermentation. Their formation pathways in humans, plants and microorganisms, potential health effects, effects of diet on the formation of microbial metabolites including neuroactive compounds in the gut are discussed throughout this review.

30818031,Impact of chemotherapy on the association between fear of cancer recurrence and the gut microbiota in breast cancer survivors.,"Dysfunctional processing of fear memory may be involved in the pathophysiology of fear of cancer recurrence (FCR), which is cited as the major unmet psychological need of cancer survivors. Emerging evidence has shown that the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis affects depressive and anxiety disorders, and chemotherapy-associated psychological distress. We therefore hypothesized that the gut microbiota is associated with FCR in cancer survivors.This cross-sectional study enrolled women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer who were not currently undergoing chemotherapy. Fecal samples were obtained to assess the gut microbiota. FCR grade was assessed using the Concerns About Recurrence Scale (CARS).Mean age of the participants (nâ¯=â¯126) was 58â¯years; 47% had stage I disease. Multiple regression analysis with adjustment for possible confounders showed that the relative abundance of the Bacteroides genus (betaâ¯=â¯0.180, pâ¯=â¯0.03) was significantly and directly associated with FCR. In the 57 participants with a history of chemotherapy, higher FCR was associated with lower microbial diversity (pâ¯=â¯0.04), lower relative abundance of Firmicutes (pâ¯=â¯0.03) and higher relative abundance of Bacteroidetes (pâ¯=â¯0.04) at the phylum level, and higher relative abundance of Bacteroides (pâ¯<â¯0.01) and lower relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae.g (pâ¯=â¯0.03) and Ruminococcus (pâ¯=â¯0.02) at the genus level.Our findings provide the first evidence of an association between the gut microbiota and FCR and suggest that chemotherapy-induced changes in gut microbiota can influence FCR.

32518376,A key role of the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve in the depression-like phenotype and abnormal composition of gut microbiota in mice after lipopolysaccharide administration.,"The vagus nerve plays a role in the cross talk between the brain and gut microbiota, which could be involved in depression. The subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve serves as a major modulatory pathway between the brain and gut microbiota. Here, we investigated the effects of subdiaphragmatic vagotomy (SDV) on the depression-like phenotype and the abnormal composition of gut microbiota in mice after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration. LPS caused a depression-like phenotype, inflammation, increase in spleen weight, and downregulation of synaptic proteins in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in the sham-operated mice. In contrast, LPS did not produce a depression-like phenotype and downregulated synaptic proteins in the mPFC after SDV. The spleen weight and plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the SDVâ+âLPS group were lower than those of the shamâ+âLPS group. Interestingly, there were positive correlations between the plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and spleen weight, suggesting a relationship between inflammatory events and spleen weight. Furthermore, LPS led to significant alterations in gut microbiota diversity in sham-operated mice, but not SDV-operated mice. In an unweighted UniFrac PCoA, the dots representing the shamâ+âLPS group were located far away from the dots representing the other three groups. Our results suggest that LPS produces a depression-like phenotype, increases spleen weight, triggers inflammation, downregulates synaptic proteins in the mPFC, and leads to abnormal composition of gut microbiota via the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve. It is likely that the vagus nerve plays a crucial role in the brain-gut-microbiota axis.",Translational psychiatry,2020,Jiancheng Zhang; Li Ma; Lijia Chang; Yaoyu Pu; Youge Qu; Kenji Hashimoto
33105830,Probiotics in Treatment of Viral Respiratory Infections and Neuroinflammatory Disorders.,"Inflammation is a biological response to the activation of the immune system by various infectious or non-infectious agents, which may lead to tissue damage and various diseases. Gut commensal bacteria maintain a symbiotic relationship with the host and display a critical function in the homeostasis of the host immune system. Disturbance to the gut microbiota leads to immune dysfunction both locally and at distant sites, which causes inflammatory conditions not only in the intestine but also in the other organs such as lungs and brain, and may induce a disease state. Probiotics are well known to reinforce immunity and counteract inflammation by restoring symbiosis within the gut microbiota. As a result, probiotics protect against various diseases, including respiratory infections and neuroinflammatory disorders. A growing body of research supports the beneficial role of probiotics in lung and mental health through modulating the gut-lung and gut-brain axes. In the current paper, we discuss the potential role of probiotics in the treatment of viral respiratory infections, including the COVID-19 disease, as major public health crisis in 2020, and influenza virus infection, as well as treatment of neurological disorders like multiple sclerosis and other mental illnesses.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2020,Roghayeh Shahbazi; Hamed Yasavoli-Sharahi; Nawal Alsadi; Nafissa Ismail; Chantal Matar
33389842,The emerging role of mood disorders in inflammatory bowel diseases.,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic, devastating conditions of the gastrointestinal tract characterized by a complex pathogenesis, increasing worldwide prevalence, a wide spectrum of extraintestinal manifestations, and a reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Furthermore, mood disorders, specifically anxiety and depression, are more prevalent among IBD patients compared to the general population. The connection between mental disorders and IBD is compound, bidirectional and still not fully understood. The IBD may impact psychological health, whereas anxiety and depression are associated with a more aggressive course of IBD. The inflammation process, gut microbiota alterations and drug side effects are factors that influence the mental state of patients with IBD. Importantly, despite the high prevalence of depression and anxiety in IBD, many of the current guidelines do not include clear recommendation for assessment of mental problems in patients and further management. Therefore, monitoring for mood disorders should become a part of the multi-disciplinary and holistic approach to patients with IBD. This review is based on current literature searched in PubMed, mainly considering publications from the last 10 years.",Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical University,2020,PaweÅ KuÅºnicki; RadosÅaw KempiÅski; Katarzyna Neubauer

33244049,Emotional well-being and gut microbiome profiles by enterotype.,"With increasing attention being paid to improving emotional well-being, recent evidence points to gut microbiota as a key player in regulating mental and physical health via bidirectional communication between the brain and gut. Here, we examine the association between emotional well-being and gut microbiome profiles (i.e., gut microbiome composition, diversity, and the moderating role of the enterotypes) among healthy Korean adults (nâ=â83, mean ageâ=â48.9, SDâ=â13.2). The research was performed using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing to obtain gut microbiome profiles, as well as a self-report survey that included the Positive Affect Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). The cluster-based analysis identified two enterotypes dominated by the genera Bacteroides (nâ=â49) and Prevotella (nâ=â34). Generalized linear regression analysis reveals significant associations between positive emotion and gut microbiome diversity (Shannon Index) among participants in the Prevotella dominant group, whereas no such relationship emerged among participants in the Bacteroides group. Moreover, a novel genus from the family Lachnospiraceae is associated with emotional well-being scores, both positive and negative. Together, the current findings highlight the enterotype-specific links between the gut microbiota community and emotion in healthy adults and suggestÂ the possible roles of the gut microbiome in promoting mental health.",Scientific reports,2020,Sung-Ha Lee; Seok-Hwan Yoon; Yeonjae Jung; Namil Kim; Uigi Min; Jongsik Chun; Incheol Choi

Within the array of biopsychosocial treatment modalities-including monoaminergic antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and CBT-there is an unmet need for the effective treatment of anxiety disorders resulting in full remission and recovery.

Low-carbohydrate high-fat diets (LCHF) may provide a rewarding outcome for some anxiety disorders; more research is needed before this regimen can be recommended to patients on a daily basis, but the evidence mentioned in this paper should encourage researchers and clinicians to consider LCHF as a piece of advice somewhere between psychotherapy and pharmacology, or as an add-on to those two.",Nutrients,2020,Adam WÅodarczyk; WiesÅaw Jerzy CubaÅa; Aleksandra Wielewicka
32188376,Diet and Neurocognition in Mood Disorders - An Overview of the Overlooked.,"Bipolar disorder and major depression are associated with significant disability, morbidity, and reduced life expectancy. People with mood disorders have shown higher ratios of unhealthy lifestyle choices, including poor diet quality and suboptimal nutrition. Diet and nutrition impact on brain /mental health, but cognitive outcomes have been less researched in psychiatric disorders. Neurocognitive dysfunction is a major driver of social dysfunction and a therapeutic target in mood disorders, although effective cognitive-enhancers are currently lacking. This narrative review aimed to assess the potential cognitive benefits of dietary and nutritional interventions in subjects diagnosed with mood disorders. Eight clinical trials with nutrients were identified, whereas none involved dietary interventions. Efficacy to improve select cognitive deficits has been reported, but results are either preliminary or inconsistent. Methodological recommendations for future cognition trials in the field are advanced. Current evidence and future views are discussed from the perspectives of precision medicine, clinical staging, nutritional psychiatry, and the brain-gut-microbiota axis.",Current pharmaceutical design,2020,Vicent BalanzÃ¡-MartÃ­nez; Flavio M Shansis; Amparo Tatay-Manteiga; Pilar LÃ³pez-GarcÃ­a

We searched on Pubmed, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES and Sciencedirect articles with the keywords psychiatric disorders, epigenome, microbiome and family relationships.Some gene polymorphisms interact with negative environment and lead to psychiatric disorders. Negative environment is correlated with different epigenetic modifications in genes implicated in mental health. Gut microbiota diversity affect host epigenetic. Animal studies showed evidences for a transgenerational transmission of epigenetic characteristics.Our findings support the hypothesis that epigenetic mediate gene-environment interactions and psychiatric disorders. Several environmental characteristics such as traumatic life events, family adversity, psychological stress or internal environment such as gut microbiota diversity and diet showed an impact on epigenetic.

33045322,Targeting the microbiome-gut-brain axis for improving cognition in schizophrenia and major mood disorders: A narrative review.,"Cognitive impairment has been consistently found to be a core feature of serious mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and major mood disorders (major depression and bipolar disorder). In recent years, a great effort has been made in elucidating the biological causes of cognitive deficits and the search for new biomarkers of cognition. Microbiome and gut-brain axis (MGB) hormones have been postulated to be potential biomarkers of cognition in serious mental illnesses. The main aim of this review was to synthesize current evidence on the association of microbiome and gut-brain hormones on cognitive processes in schizophrenia and major mood disorders and the association of MGB hormones with stress and the immune system. Our review underscores the role of the MGB axis on cognitive aspects of serious mental illnesses with the potential use of agents targeting the gut microbiota as cognitive enhancers. However, the current evidence for clinical trials focused on the MGB axis as cognitive enhancers in these clinical populations is scarce. Future clinical trials using probiotics, prebiotics, antibiotics, or faecal microbiota transplantation need to consider potential mechanistic pathways such as the HPA axis, the immune system, or gut-brain axis hormones involved in appetite control and energy homeostasis.",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,2021,Miquel Bioque; Alexandre GonzÃ¡lez-RodrÃ­guez; Clemente Garcia-Rizo; JesÃºs Cobo; JosÃ© Antonio Monreal; Judith Usall; Virginia Soria; ; Javier Labad
31610228,Plasma cytokine levels in patients with chronic alcohol overconsumption: Relations to gut microbiota markers and clinical correlates.,"Alcohol-related morbidity may involve changes in the gut microbiota and immune dysregulation. We have previously demonstrated alterations in gut microbiota composition and functions in patients with alcohol overconsumption, and now aimed to investigate possible associations between cytokine levels, gut microbiota, and clinical symptoms.We included hospital inpatients with a history of chronic alcohol overconsumption. For comparison, we included control patients with a low alcohol intake. Cytokine levels (TGF-Î²1, TNF-Î±, IL-10, IL-8, IL-6, IFN-Î³, MCP-1, IL-1RA, IL-1Î², and IL-17) were determined using a customized V-plex assay. We then examined associations of cytokine levels with the abundance of Proteobacteria and Faecalibacterium, percentage of the short-chain fatty acid butyrate, psychiatric symptoms (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), and biochemical liver variables.We included 28 patients with alcohol overconsumption (79% men), and 25 control patients (72% men). Patients with alcohol overconsumption had higher levels of IL-6 (pÂ =Â 0.002), IFN-Î³ (pÂ =Â 0.018), and MCP-1 (pÂ =Â 0.006), and lower levels of TGF-Î²1 (pÂ =Â 0.017) compared with control patients. Inverse correlations were found between Proteobacteria abundance and TNF-Î± (R<sub>s</sub>Â =Â -0.55, pÂ =Â 0.02) and IL-8 (R<sub>s</sub>Â =Â -0.58, pÂ =Â 0.014), and between Faecalibacterium and MCP-1 levels (R<sub>s</sub>Â =Â -0.56, pÂ =Â 0.02) in the control patients, but not in patients with alcohol overconsumption. Patients with alcohol overconsumption reported more psychiatric symptoms, and these symptoms were inversely correlated with IL-10 levels. There were positive correlations between several of the assessed cytokines and biochemical liver variables, and negative correlations between cytokine levels and albumin.Patients with alcohol overconsumption had a cytokine profile suggestive of increased systemic inflammatory activity, with higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IFN-Î³, and MCP-1) and lower levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines (TGF-Î²1). The findings may represent a link between alcohol use and alcohol-related morbidity.","Alcohol (Fayetteville, N.Y.)",2020,Steinar Traae BjÃ¸rkhaug; Sudan Prasad Neupane; JÃ¸rgen G Bramness; HÃ¥vard Aanes; Viggo Skar; Asle W Medhus; JÃ¸rgen Valeur
33035575,Psychedelics as a novel approach to treating autoimmune conditions.,"With a rise in the incidence of autoimmune diseases (AiD), health care providers continue to seek out more efficacious treatment approaches for the AiD patient population. Classic serotonergic psychedelics have recently been gaining public and professional interest as novel interventions to a number of mental health afflictions. Psychedelics have also been shown to be able to modulate immune functions, however, while there has been great interest to researching into their psychotherapeutic applications, there has so far been very little exploration into the potential to treat inflammatory and immune-related diseases with these compounds. A handful of studies from a variety of fields suggest that psychedelics do indeed have effects in the body that may attenuate the outcome of AiD. This literature review explores existing evidence that psychedelic compounds may offer a potential novel application in the treatment of pathologies related to autoimmunity. We propose that psychedelics hold the potential to attenuate or even resolve autoimmunity by targeting psychosomatic origins, maladaptive chronic stress responses, inflammatory pathways, immune modulation and enteric microbiome populations.",Immunology letters,2020,Caitlin Thompson; Attila Szabo
31952911,Gut microbial changes of patients with psychotic and affective disorders: A systematic review.,"Many diverse inflammatory pathophysiologic mechanisms have been linked to mental disorders, and through the past decade an increasing interest in the gut microbiota and its relation to mental health has been arising. We aimed to systematically review studies of alterations in gut microbiota of patients suffering from psychotic disorders, bipolar disorder or depression compared to healthy controls.We systematically searched the databases CENTRAL, PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO and LILACS. Primary outcome was to compare the gut microbiota of patients suffering from psychotic disorders, bipolar disorder or depression with healthy controls.We identified 17 studies, covering 744 patients and 620 healthy controls. The most consistent microbiota changes were a tendency towards higher abundance of Actinobacteria and lower abundance of Firmicutes at the phylum level, lower abundance of Lachnospiraceae at family level and lower abundance of Faecalibacterium at genus level for the mental disorders overall. However, we found that all studies had risk of bias and that the included studies displayed great variability in methods of storage, analysis of the fecal samples, reporting of results and statistics used.Due to the many limitations of the included studies the findings should be interpreted with caution. Larger studies (especially of schizophrenia and major depressive disorder) are needed, but it is also of great importance to gather information of and control for factors that influence the result of a microbiota analysis including body mass index (BMI), smoking, alcohol consumption, diet habits, antibiotics, sample handling, wet laboratory methods and statistics.",Schizophrenia research,2021,Nina Vindegaard; Helene Speyer; Merete Nordentoft; Simon Rasmussen; Michael Eriksen Benros
32224141,Molecular mechanisms of the rapid-acting and long-lasting antidepressant actions of (R)-ketamine.,"Ketamine, an anesthetic developed in the early 1960s, is also a popular abused drug among young people at dance parties and raves and among spiritual seekers, because it produces schizophrenia-like symptoms and dissociation (i.e., out-of-body experience). Regarding mood disorders, ketamine exerts robust antidepressant actions in treatment-resistant patients with depression. Ketamine is a racemic mixture comprising equal parts of (R)-ketamine (or arketamine) and (S)-ketamine (or esketamine). The United States (US) Food and Drug Administration approved the J&J (S)-ketamine nasal spray for treatment-resistant depression on March 5, 2019; the spray was then approved in Europe (December 19, 2019). Although (R)-ketamine has lower affinity for the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) vs. (S)-ketamine, (R)-ketamine has greater potency and longer-lasting antidepressant-like actions in animal models of depression. Importantly, (R)-ketamine has less detrimental side effects than does (R,S)-ketamine or (S)-ketamine in rodents, monkeys, and humans. A role for the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) receptor in the antidepressant effects of ketamine and its two enantiomers has been suggested. A recent RNA-sequencing analysis suggested that the transforming growth factor Î²1 (TGF-Î²1) plays a role in the antidepressant effects of (R)-ketamine. A recent pilot study demonstrated that (R)-ketamine had rapid-acting and sustained antidepressant effects in treatment-resistant patients with depression. In this article, the author reviews the mechanisms of the antidepressant actions of the enantiomers of ketamine and its metabolites, (S)-norketamine and (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine (HNK) and discusses the role of the brain-gut-microbiota axis and brain-spleen axis in stress-related psychiatric disorders, such as depression.",Biochemical pharmacology,2020,Kenji Hashimoto
33307114,Possible use of fermented foods in rehabilitation of anorexia nervosa: the gut microbiota as a modulator.,"Anorexia nervosa is a serious psychiatric disorder with high morbidity and mortality rate. Evidence for the optimal psychopharmacological approach to managing the disorder remains limited, with nutritional treatment, focused on weight restoration through the consumption of high energy diet, regarded as one of the fundamental steps in treatment. The human gut microbiome is increasingly recognised for its proposed role in gastrointestinal, metabolic, immune and mental health, all of which may be compromised in individuals with anorexia nervosa. Dietary intake plays an important role in shaping gut microbiota composition, whilst the use of fermented foods, foods with potential psychobiotic properties that deliver live bacteria, bacterial metabolites, prebiotics and energy, have been discussed to a lesser extent. However, fermented foods are of increasing interest due to their potential capacity to affect gut microbiota composition, provide beneficial bacterial metabolites, and confer beneficial outcomes to host health. This review provides an overview of the role of the gut microbiota in relation to the disease pathology in anorexia nervosa and especially focuses on the therapeutic potential of fermented foods, proposed here as a recommended addition to the current nutritional treatment protocols warranting further investigation.",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,2021,Tetyana Rocks; Madeline West; Meghan Hockey; Hajara Aslam; Melissa Lane; Amy Loughman; Felice N Jacka; Anu Ruusunen
33194817,Multiomics Study of Gut Bacteria and Host Metabolism in Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Depression Patients.,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and depression have high tendencies of comorbidity. In particular, diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) and depression exhibit similar fecal microbiota signatures, yet little is known about their pathogenic mechanism. Here, we propose that the differences in structure and composition of IBS-D and depression gut microbiota give rise to different downstream functions, which lead to distinct clinical phenotypes <i>via</i> host metabolism and further influence the interaction of brain-gut axis.We performed multiomics study, including fecal metagenome-wide sequencing and serum metabolomics profiling in 65 individuals with IBS-D (n=22), depression (n=15), comorbid patients (n=13), and healthy controls (n=15). We analyzed functional genes contributed by the primary genus and evaluated their correlations with clinical indices and host metabolites.Metagenomic analysis revealed 26 clusters of orthologous groups of protein (COG) categories consisting of a total of 4,631 functional genes. Trehalose and maltose hydrolase (COG1554) and fucose permease (COG0738) were the most relevant and enriched functional genes in the IBS-D patients; urease accessory proteins UreE (COG2371) was that in the depression patients. Context based genome annotation suggest that an alteration of <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Enterobacter cloacae</i> in IBS-D and depression respectively may be responsible for the enrichment described above. Correlation with host metabolites, such as maltotriose and isomaltose in carbohydrate metabolism and anandamide in neuroactive metabolism, drew further connections between these findings.These changes led us to propose a connection between genomic signatures and clinical differences observed in IBS-D and depression. Our findings provide further insights into the involvement of gut microbiota in diseases related to brain-gut disorder.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2020,Congmin Xu; Qiong Jia; Lu Zhang; Zhe Wang; Shiwei Zhu; Xiaoqi Wang; Yixuan Liu; Mo Li; Jingjing Zhang; Xiangqun Wang; Jindong Zhang; Qinghua Sun; Kun Wang; Huaiqiu Zhu; Liping Duan
31154909,"Unravelled facets of milk derived opioid peptides: a focus on gut physiology, fractures and obesity.","Beyond being a source of key nutrients, bovine milk influences physiological functions by synthesising bioactive peptides during the process of digestion. Some of the claimed negative health outcomes associated with milk consumption, such as cardiovascular diseases and type 1 diabetes may be attributed to an opioid peptide, beta-casomorphin-7 (BCM-7), derived from A1 beta-casein. BCM-7 exerts its function by binding to the Î¼-opioid receptors in the body. It is hypothesised that activation of the Î¼-opioid receptors in the gut can alter gut microbial composition, impair gut barrier integrity and bile acid metabolism, in addition to increasing gastrointestinal transit time and gut inflammation. Further, it is hypothesised that BCM-7 may influence fractures and obesity via Î¼-opioid receptor pathways. In conclusion, it appears that BCM-7 might have multiple functions pertinent to human health; however, the evidence is limited and warrants further pre-clinical and clinical studies for hypothesis confirmation.",International journal of food sciences and nutrition,2020,Hajara Aslam; Anu Ruusunen; Michael Berk; Amy Loughman; Leni Rivera; Julie A Pasco; Felice N Jacka
32279681,Infant microbiota in colic: predictive associations with problem crying and subsequent child behavior.,"Infant colic is a condition of unknown cause which can result in carer distress and attachment difficulties. Recent studies have implicated the gut microbiota in infant colic, and certain probiotics have demonstrated possible efficacy. We aim to investigate whether the intestinal microbiota composition in infants with colic is associated with cry/fuss time at baseline, persistence of cry/fuss at 4-week follow-up, or child behavior at 2 years of age. Fecal samples from infants with colic (n = 118, 53% male) were analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing. After examining the alpha and beta diversity of the clinical samples, we performed a differential abundance analysis of the 16S data to look for taxa that associate with baseline and future behavior, while adjusting for potential confounding variables. In addition, we used random forest classifiers to evaluate how well baseline gut microbiota can predict future crying time. Alpha diversity of the fecal microbiota was strongly influenced by birth mode, feed type, and child gender, but did not significantly associate with crying or behavioral outcomes. Several taxa within the microbiota (including Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, Lactobacillus, and Klebsiella) associate with colic severity, and the baseline microbiota composition can predict further crying at 4 weeks with up to 65% accuracy. The combination of machine learning findings with associative relationships demonstrates the potential prognostic utility of the infant fecal microbiota in predicting subsequent infant crying problems.",Journal of developmental origins of health and disease,2021,Amy Loughman; Thomas Quinn; Monica L Nation; Amy Reichelt; Robert J Moore; Thi Thu Hao Van; Valerie Sung; Mimi L K Tang

Given that both unhealthy diets and smoking are leading risk factors for disability and death, a greater understanding of how food addiction and tobacco use disorder overlap with one another is necessary. This narrative review aimed to highlight literature that investigated prevalence, biology, psychology, and treatment options of food addiction and tobacco use disorder. Published studies up to August 2020 and written in English were included. Using a biopsychosocial lens, each disorder was assessed together and separately, as there is emerging evidence that the two disorders can develop concurrently or sequentially within individuals. Commonalities include but are not limited to the dopaminergic neurocircuitry, gut microbiota, childhood adversity, and attachment insecurity. In addition, the authors conducted a feasibility study with the purpose of examining the association between food addiction symptoms and tobacco use disorder among individuals seeking tobacco use disorder treatment.

33094505,Gut dysbiosis associated with the rats' responses in methamphetamine-induced conditioned place preference.,"Methamphetamine (MA) is a potent stimulant and notoriously addictive. Individuals respond to MA effects differently and thus have a varying susceptible risk of developing MA use disorder. Cumulative evidence has indicated that gut dysbiosis contributes to behavioral response to drug effects. However, the role of gut microbiota in the susceptible risk of developing MA use disorder has remained elusive. Using an MA-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) rat model, we administrated the same dose of MA to rats, which then showed distinct preferences in drug-related place, indicating their different responses to MA. From all of the MA-exposed rats, the eight with the highest CPP scores were labeled as group high CPP (H-CPP), and the eight with the lowest were labeled as group low CPP (L-CPP). By 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequencing, we found that the gut microbiota compositions differed between H-CPP and L-CPP. Specifically, Akkermansia was significantly higher in H-CPP and positively correlated with the CPP scores. Notably, H-CPP and L-CPP differed in the gut microbiota composition prior to the CPP training; Ruminococcus was the dominant phylotype in H-CPP at baseline. More importantly, rats pretreated by antibiotics showed a significantly stronger MA-induced CPP than did the controls. Our study demonstrates that the gut dysbiosis was associated with the MA-induced CPP, indicating that the gut microbiota might be important modulators for MA-induced behavior and vulnerability to MA use disorder.",Addiction biology,2021,Cheng Yang; Xiaoya Fu; Wei Hao; Xiaojun Xiang; Tieqiao Liu; Bao-Zhu Yang; Xiaojie Zhang
33087994,Human Gut Microbiome Response to Short-Term <i>Bifidobacterium</i>-Based Probiotic Treatment.,"Gut microbiota is believed to play a crucial role in modulating obesity in humans, and probiotics affecting gut microbiota can alleviate some of the obesity-related health complications. The study was aimed to investigate changes in the composition of the gut microbiome in obese humans due to short-term (2Â weeks) treatment of obese patients with a probiotic preparation containing <i>Bifidobacterium longum</i>. Faecal microbiome diversity was studied using the 16S amplicon sequencing by Illumina MiSeq. Bioinformatic analysis showed distribution across 14 phyla (with <i>Firmicutes</i> and <i>Bacteroidetes</i> dominating), 21 class, 125 genera and 973 OTUs. The probiotic treatment decreased relative abundance of <i>Bacteroidetes</i> (<i>Prevotellaceae</i> and <i>Bacteroidaceae</i>), while increasing that of <i>Actinobacteria</i> (<i>Bifidobacteriaceae</i> and <i>Coriobacteriaceae</i>), and <i>Firmicutes</i> (<i>Negativicutes</i>: <i>Veillonellaceae</i> and <i>Clostridia</i>: <i>Peptostreptococcaceae</i>). The probiotic treatment decreased total blood sugar and increased patients' assessment of their physical and mental health. Thus even the short-term <i>Bifidobacterium</i>-based probiotic treatment brought significant compositional changes in the 16S rRNA gene diversity in faecal bacterial assemblages by increasing beneficial and decreasing pathogenic or opportunistic bacteria; the related shifts in life quality assessment necessitate further research into the causal relationships involved.",Indian journal of microbiology,2020,Natalia Naumova; Tatiana Alikina; Alexey Tupikin; Anna Kalmykova; Galina Soldatova; Valentin Vlassov; Marsel Kabilov
33181474,Gut microbiota composition in children with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome: a pilot study.,"Obstructive Sleep Apnoea syndrome (OSAS) is considered a systemic inflammatory disease and is characterized by intermittent hypoxia that can damage the integrity of intestinal barrier and alter gut microbiota composition in adults and animal models. To date there is only one study on snoring children and microbiota but no studies are present on paediatric OSAS related dysbiosis.To evaluate gut microbiota composition in OSAS children in respect to healthy subjects and investigate the role of sleep parameters in changing gut microbiome.Sixteen children divided in OSAS and healthy groups. Stool samples were collected from both the two groups to assess gut microbiota composition using 16S rRNA sequencing and a nocturnal pulsossimetry and polysomnography were performed in OSAS children.OSAS children showed a decreased microbial diversity in respect to healthy subjects in terms of number of observed species and Chao1 index (pÂ =Â 0,01). Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was directly correlated to Sleep Clinical Record (pÂ =Â 0,03). The abundance of several inflammation-related strains (Proteobacteria, Clostridiaceae, Oscillospiraceae, Klebsiella) were found significantly modified in relation to sleep parameters. Bacteria implied in the gut barrier integrity (Desulfovibrionaceae, Bacteroides fragilis and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii) were found significantly different in the two study groups and correlated with sleep parameters.OSAS children showed a lower microbiota diversity in respect to heathy subjects and an increase of inflammation and gut barrier disruptors-related strains probably induced by intermittent hypoxia. Further studies should be conducted to understand the role of gut microbiota in OSAS physiopathology and comorbidities in children.",Sleep medicine,2020,Francesco Valentini; Melania Evangelisti; Marta Arpinelli; Giovanni Di Nardo; Marina Borro; Maurizio Simmaco; Maria Pia Villa
33249563,Microbiota-immune alterations in adolescents following early life adversity: A proof of concept study.,"Early adverse care has long-term impacts on physical and mental health. The influence of rearing conditions on the infant's gut microbiota and its relationship with developmental health has become more evident. The microbiome is essential for normal growth and metabolism, and the signaling from the gut to the brain may underlie individual differences in resilience later in life. Microbial diversity and composition were determined using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing in fecal samples from 17 adolescents adopted internationally from orphanages into the United States and 18 adolescents reared in birth families who had similar educational and income levels. Analyses focused on diversity of the microbial community structure and differences in the abundance of specific bacterial taxa. Blood samples were used to immunophenotype the numbers of several T-cell subsets and cytomegalovirus (CMV) seropositivity. Negative binomial regression analysis revealed several operational taxonomic units that were significantly different based on early rearing conditions and CMV seropositivity. There were significant associations between the relative abundance of certain taxa, the percentages of T-cell subsets in circulation, and CMV seropositivity. These findings demonstrate a possible link between the gut microbiota and associations with immune alterations initiated by early life adversity.",Developmental psychobiology,2021,Brie M Reid; Rachael Horne; Bonny Donzella; Jake C Szamosi; Christopher L Coe; Jane A Foster; Megan R Gunnar
30794085,"Associations among diet, the gastrointestinal microbiota, and negative emotional states in adults.","<b>Objective:</b> Habitual diet impacts mood and the human gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota. Yet, studies infrequently control for diet when evaluating associations between mood and GI microbiota. Accordingly, we aimed to investigate relationships among diet, GI microbiota, and mood in adults without mood disorders by conducting a cross-sectional examination of dietary intake, subjective emotional state, and fecal microbial taxa abundances. <b>Methods:</b> Adults (<i>N</i>â=â133; 25-45 years of age) without physician-diagnosed mood disorders were studied. Fecal DNA was extracted, and the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced. Sequences were analyzed using QIIME2. Subjective mood state was assessed using the 42-item Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-42). Habitual dietary intake was measured with the National Cancer Institute's Diet History Questionnaire II, and diet quality was evaluated with the 2010 Healthy Eating Index (HEI). <b>Results:</b> Relationships were observed between 28 bacterial taxa and DASS-42 scores. Sex-dependent associations were observed among 21 bacterial taxa and DASS-42 scores, including an inverse relationship between Anxiety scale scores and <i>Bifidobacterium</i> in females and an inverse relationship between Depression scale scores and <i>Lactobacillus</i> in males. HEI total fruit and dairy components were inversely associated with Depression and Stress scales, respectively. <b>Conclusions:</b> These results suggest GI microbes are related to mood in adults without diagnosed mood disorders and that these relationships differ by sex and are influenced by dietary fiber intake. Incorporating dietary intake data in gut-microbiota-brain studies may help clarify the roles of specific microbes and dietary components in mental health symptoms.",Nutritional neuroscience,2020,Andrew M Taylor; Sharon V Thompson; Caitlyn G Edwards; Salma M A Musaad; Naiman A Khan; Hannah D Holscher
32605552,The study protocol for a pseudo-randomised pre-post designed controlled intervention trial to study the effects of a 7-week cooking program on self-efficacy and biomarkers of health: the ECU lifestyle and biomarkers get connected study (ECULABJMOF) including the Jamie's Ministry of Food WA participant experience.,"Australia, like other nations, has experienced a shift in dietary patterns away from home cooking of nutritious foods, towards a reliance on pre-prepared convenience meals. These are typically energy-dense, nutrient-poor and contribute to the rising prevalence of obesity and chronic disease burden. The aims of this study were to evaluate whether a community-based cooking program instigated a change to participants' skills, attitudes, knowledge, enjoyment and satisfaction of cooking and cooking confidence (self-efficacy).The pseudo-random, pre-post study design consisted of an intervention and a control group. Participant recruitment and group allocation was based on their program start dates. Intervention participants were surveyed three times (baseline, 7âweeks and 6âmonths) and the control group were surveyed at baseline and 5âweeks. All participants were registered via an online website and were 18âyears or over. Upon consent, participants were offered four levels of commitment, defined by different assessments. The minimum participation level included an online survey and levels 2, 3 and 4 involved attendance at a clinic with increasing functional, anthropometric and biomarker measurements. Primary endpoints were participants' cooking confidence as a proxy for self-efficacy. Secondary endpoints were dietary intake, physical activity levels, body composition, anthropometry, blood, urine and faecal biomarkers of systemic, physical and mental health.The community cooking program provided participants with information and advice on food sourcing, preparation and nutrition to improve home cooking skills. The study was designed to explore whether food literacy programs are efficacious in improving participant physical health and well-being in order to combat the rise in obesity and diet-related disease. It will support future use of public health cooking program initiatives aimed at improving food literacy, self-efficacy and physical and mental health. The extensive data collected will inform future research into the relationship between diet, the gut-microbiota and human health.Retrospectively registered on 16.08.2019 with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR).

33067643,Profiling the differences of gut microbial structure between schizophrenia patients with and without violent behaviors based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing.,"Understanding the violence behaviors in schizophrenia patients has always been the focus of forensic psychiatry. Although many studies show gut microbiota could regulate behavior, to our knowledge, no studies have profiled the gut microbiota structure in schizophrenia patients with violence. We profiled the characteristics of gut microbiota structure in 26 schizophrenia patients with violence (V.SCZ) by comparing with that of 16 schizophrenia patients without violence (NV.SCZ) under the control of confounders, and found the differences of gut microbiota structure between the two groups. Violence was assessed by the MacArthur Community Violence Instrument. Psychiatric symptoms were assessed by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to identify and relatively quantify gut microbial composition. Bioinformatics analysis was used to find differential gut microbial composition between the V.SCZ and NV.SCZ groups. Fifty-nine differential microbial taxonomic compositions were found between the two groups. Fifteen gut microbial compositions were the key microbial taxonomic compositions responsible for the differences between the V.SCZ and NV.SCZ groups, including five enriched microbial taxonomic compositions (p_Bacteroidetes, c_Bacteroidia, o_Bacteroidales, f_Prevotellaceae, s_Bacteroides_uniformis), and ten impoverished microbial taxonomic compositions (p_Actinobacteria, c_unidentified_Actinobacteria, o_Bifidobacteriales, f_ Enterococcaceae, f_Veillonellaceae, f_Bifidobacteriaceae, g_Enterococcus, g_Candidatus_Saccharimonas, g_Bifidobacterium, and s_Bifidobacterium_pseudocatenulatum). This study profiled the differences of gut microbiota between schizophrenia patients with violence and without violence.

33005148,Sensitivity to Morphine Reward Associates With Gut Dysbiosis in Rats With Morphine-Induced Conditioned Place Preference.,"Gut microbiota has been found to establish a bidirectional relationship with the central nervous system. Variations of the gut microbiota has been implicated in various mental disorders, including opioid use disorders. Morphine exposure has been repeatedly found to disrupt the gut microbiota, but association between the gut microbiota and the sensitivity to morphine reward remains unknown. In this study the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm was used for morphine-treated rats and saline-treated rats. After the CPP procedure, the morphine-treated rats were divided equally into the low and high CPP (L- and H-CPP) groups according to the CPP scores. We adopted 16S rRNA sequencing for the fecal bacterial communities at baseline and post-conditioning. By comparing the morphine-treated group with saline-treated group, we found alterations of microbial composition in the morphine-treated group, but no significant differences in alpha diversity. The L-CPP group and H-CPP group differed in microbial composition both before and after morphine treatment. The relative abundance of certain taxa was correlated to the CPP scores, such as <i>Alloprevotella</i> and <i>Romboutsia</i>. This study provides direct evidence that morphine exposure alters the composition of the gut microbiota in rats and that microbial alterations are correlated to the sensitivity to morphine reward. These findings may help develop novel therapeutic and preventive strategies for opioid use disorder.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2020,Jingyuan Zhang; Jun Yang; Cheng Yang; Ti Chen; Ziwei Wang; Junyi Li; Fanglin Qin; Qijian Deng; Xiaojie Zhang

A total of 87 fecal samplesÂ were collected, including a total of 58 samples from 29 SCZ patients over two different periods (remission and onset period) and 29 samples from the control group for 16S rRNAÂ Miseq.The changes of intestinal microbiota in SCZ patients from remission to onset were analyzed, and a random forest model was constructed to recognize biomarkers. The optimal three genus-level diagnosis biomarkers were identified through an AUC validation on a random forest model, furthermore, an AUC of 0.76 (95% CI (0.63, 0.89)) was achieved between 29 aSCZ and 29 HCs. Compared with the control group, the first 11 OUT-level' biomarkers were identified in rSCZ group. As a status marker of the disease, the AUC of 0.7 (95% CI (0.56, 0.84)) was achieved between 29 rSCZ and 29 HCs. There were differences between SCZ patients and HCs, acute and remission patients as well, suggesting that the potential of the gut microbiota as a non-invasive diagnostic tool.

31704402,Naturally-diverse airborne environmental microbial exposures modulate the gut microbiome and may provide anxiolytic benefits in mice.,"Growing epidemiological evidence links natural green space exposure with a range of health benefits, including for mental health. Conversely, greater urbanisation associates with increased risk of mental health disorders. Microbiomes are proposed as an important but understudied link that may help explain many green space-human health associations. However, there remains a lack of controlled experimental evidence testing possible beneficial effects from passive exposure to natural biodiversity via airborne microbiota. Previous mouse model studies have used unrealistic environmental microbial exposures-including excessive soil and organic matter contact, feed supplements and injections-to demonstrate host microbiota, immune biomarker, and behavioural changes. Here, in a randomised controlled experiment, we demonstrate that realistic exposures to trace-level dust from a high biodiversity soil can change mouse gut microbiota, in comparison to dust from low biodiversity soil or no soil (control) (nâ¯=â¯54 total mice, comprising 3 treatmentsâ¯Ãâ¯18 mice, with 9 femalesâ¯+â¯9 males per group). Furthermore, we found a nominal soil-derived anaerobic spore-forming butyrate-producer, Kineothrix alysoides, was supplemented to a greater extent in the gut microbiomes of high biodiversity treatment mice. Also, increasing relative abundance of this rare organism correlated with reduced anxiety-like behaviour in the most anxious mice. Our results point to an intriguing new hypothesis: that biodiverse soils may represent an important supplementary source of butyrate-producing bacteria capable of resupplying the mammalian gut microbiome, with potential for gut health and mental health benefits. Our findings have potential to inform cost-effective population health interventions through microbiome-conscious green space design and, ultimately, the mainstreaming of biodiversity into health care.",The Science of the total environment,2020,Craig Liddicoat; Harrison Sydnor; Christian Cando-Dumancela; Romy Dresken; Jiajun Liu; Nicholas J C Gellie; Jacob G Mills; Jennifer M Young; Laura S Weyrich; Mark R Hutchinson; Philip Weinstein; Martin F Breed
34589852,Nutritional psychiatry in the treatment of psychotic disorders: Current hypotheses and research challenges.,"Current treatment for schizophrenia-spectrum disorders focusses primarily on psychotropic medication to treat symptoms, though their efficacy varies between patients and psychotropic medication is often accompanied by severe side effects. Nutritional interventions to prevent and treat mental illness have received considerable attention over recent years. However, evidence for nutritional interventions in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders remains limited in quantity and quality. Pathways currently in focus include: i) nutritional deficits and impairments in glucose metabolism, ii) inflammation and immune dysregulation (also known from the mild encephalitis hypothesis), and iii) altered gut microbiota. All of which appear to be interconnected. Key limiting factors for advancing research in this field are research challenges associated with assessing and interpreting inflammatory profiles, microbiota and subjective nutritional assessments, which is further complicated by illness characteristics. This review describes the state of evidence for key hypotheses, including underlying mechanisms, implicated in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, the challenges in nutritional psychiatry research and the current state of nutrition interventions in mental healthcare.","Brain, behavior, & immunity - health",2020,Scott Teasdale; Sabrina MÃ¶rkl; Annabel Sandra MÃ¼ller-Stierlin
32046750,"Treating impulsivity with probiotics in adults (PROBIA): study protocol of a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.","Impulsivity and compulsivity are related to emotional and social maladjustment and often underlie psychiatric disorders. Recently, alterations in microbiota composition have been shown to have implications for brain development and social behavior via the microbiota-gut-brain axis. However, the exact mechanisms are not fully identified. Recent evidence suggests the modulatory effect of synbiotics on gut microbiota and the contribution of these agents in ameliorating symptoms of many psychiatric diseases. To date, no randomized controlled trial has been performed to establish the feasibility and efficacy of this intervention targeting the reduction of impulsivity and compulsivity. We hypothesize that supplementation with synbiotics may be an effective treatment in adults with high levels of impulsivity and/or compulsivity.This is a prospective, multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial with two arms: treatment with a synbiotic formula versus placebo treatment. The primary outcome is the response rate at the end of the placebo-controlled phase (response defined as a Clinical Global Impression-Improvement Scale score of 1 or 2â=âvery much improved or much improved, plus a reduction in the Affective Reactivity Index total score of at least 30% compared with baseline). A total ofÂ 180 participants with highly impulsive behavior and a diagnosis of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and/or borderline personality disorder, aged 18-65âyears old, will be screened at three study centers. Secondary outcome measures, including changes in general psychopathology, ADHD symptoms, neurocognitive function, somatic parameters, physical activity, nutritional intake, and health-related quality of life, will be explored at assessments before, during, and at the end of the intervention. The effect of the intervention on genetics, microbiota, and several blood biomarkers will also be assessed. Gastrointestinal symptoms and somatic complaints will additionally be explored at 1-week follow-up.This is the first randomized controlled trial to determine the effects of supplementation with synbiotics on reducing impulsive and compulsive behavior. This clinical trial can contribute to explaining the mechanisms involved in the crosstalk between the intestinal microbiome and the brain. If effects can be established by reducing impulsive and compulsive behavior, new cost-effective treatments might become available to these patients.ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03495375.

31539679,Antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion is associated with resilience in mice after chronic social defeat stress.,"The brain-gut axis plays a role in the pathogenesis of stress-related disorders such as depression. However, the role of brain-gut axis in the resilience versus susceptibility after stress remains unclear. Here, we examined the effects of antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion on an anhedonia-like phenotype in adult mice subjected to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS).Using CSDS paradigm, we investigated the effects of antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion on the resilience versus susceptibility in mice.Treatment with an antibiotic cocktail for 14 days significantly decreased the diversity and composition of the microbiota in the host gut. Proteobacteria were markedly increased after treatment with the antibiotic cocktail. At the genus and species levels, the antibiotic-treated group exhibited marked alterations in the microbiota compared with a control group. CSDS was shown to significantly improve the abnormal composition of gut microbiota in the antibiotic-treated group. CSDS did not produce an anhedonia-like phenotype in the antibiotic-treated mice, but did induce an anhedonia-like phenotype in control mice, suggesting that gut bacteria are essential for the development of CSDS-induced anhedonia. CSDS treatment did not alter the plasma levels of interleukin-6 or the expression of synaptic proteins, such as PSD-95 and GluA1, in the prefrontal cortex of antibiotic-treated mice.Specific microbiome were not determined.These findings suggest that antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion contributed to resilience to anhedonia in mice subjected to CSDS. Therefore, it is likely that the brain-gut axis plays a role in resilience versus susceptibility to stress.",Journal of affective disorders,2020,Siming Wang; Youge Qu; Lijia Chang; Yaoyu Pu; Kai Zhang; Kenji Hashimoto
33195226,Microbiome Profiling Reveals Gut Dysbiosis in the Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 5 Knockout Mouse Model of Schizophrenia.,"Schizophrenia (SZ) is a psychiatric disorder that constitutes one of the top 10 global causes of disability. More recently, a potential pathogenic role for the gut microbial community (microbiota) has been highlighted, with numerous studies describing dysregulated microbial profiles in SZ patients when compared to healthy controls. However, no animal model of SZ has previously recapitulated the gut dysbiosis observed clinically. Since the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu5) knockout mice provide a preclinical model of SZ with strong face and predictive validity, in the present study we performed gut microbiome profiling of mGlu5 knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice by 16S rRNA sequencing of bacterial genomic DNA from fecal samples, analyzing bacterial diversity and taxonomic composition, as well as gastrointestinal parameters as indicators of gut function. We found a significant genotype difference in microbial beta diversity. Analysis of composition of microbiomes (ANCOM) models were performed to evaluate microbiota compositions, which identified a decreased relative abundance of the <i>Erysipelotrichaceae</i> family and <i>Allobaculum</i> genus in this mouse model of SZ. We also identified a signature of bacteria discriminating between the genotypes (KO and WT), consisting of the Erysipelotrichales, Bacteroidales, and Clostridiales orders and macroscopic gut differences. We thus uncovered global differential community composition in the gut microbiota profile between mGlu5 KO and WT mice, outlining the first evidence for gut dysbiosis in a genetic animal model of SZ. Our findings suggest that this widely used preclinical model of SZ also has substantial utility for investigations of gut dysbiosis and associated signaling via the microbiota-gut-brain axis, as potential modulators of SZ pathogenesis. Our discovery opens up new avenues to explore gut dysbiosis and its proposed links to brain dysfunction in SZ, as well as novel therapeutic approaches to this devastating disorder.",Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,2020,Carolina Gubert; Geraldine Kong; Volkan Uzungil; Ariel M Zeleznikow-Johnston; Emma L Burrows; Thibault Renoir; Anthony J Hannan
32799901,Ingestion of Lactobacillus intestinalis and Lactobacillus reuteri causes depression- and anhedonia-like phenotypes in antibiotic-treated mice via the vagus nerve.,"The brain-gut-microbiota axis plays a role in the pathogenesis of stress-related disorders such as depression. In this study, we examined the effects of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in mice with antibiotic-treated microbiota depletion.The fecal microbiota was obtained from mice subjected to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) and control (no CSDS) mice. FMT from these two groups was performed to antibiotic-treated mice. 16S rRNA analysis was performed to examine the composition of gut microbiota. Furthermore, the effects of subdiaphragmatic vagotomy in depression-like phenotypes after ingestion of microbes were examined.The ingestion of fecal microbiota from CSDS-susceptible mice resulted in an anhedonia-like phenotype, higher plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), and decreased expression of synaptic proteins in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in antibiotic-treated mice but not in water-treated mice. 16S rRNA analysis suggested that two microbes (Lactobacillus intestinalis and Lactobacillus reuteri) may be responsible for the anhedonia-like phenotype in antibiotic-treated mice after FMT. Ingestion of these two microbes for 14âdays led to depression- and anhedonia-like phenotypes, higher plasma IL-6 levels, and decreased expression of synaptic proteins in the PFC of antibiotic-treated mice. Interestingly, subdiaphragmatic vagotomy significantly blocked the development of behavioral abnormalities, elevation of plasma IL-6 levels, and downregulation of synaptic proteins in the PFC after ingestion of these two microbes.These findings suggest that microbiota depletion using an antibiotic cocktail is essential for the development of FMT-induced behavioral changes and that the vagus nerve plays a key role in behavioral abnormalities in antibiotic-treated mice after the ingestion of L. intestinalis and L. reuteri. Therefore, it is likely that the brain-gut-microbiota axis participates in the pathogenesis of depression via the vagus nerve.",Journal of neuroinflammation,2020,Siming Wang; Tamaki Ishima; Jiancheng Zhang; Youge Qu; Lijia Chang; Yaoyu Pu; Yuko Fujita; Yunfei Tan; Xingming Wang; Kenji Hashimoto
32398374,Maternal glyphosate exposure causes autism-like behaviors in offspring through increased expression of soluble epoxide hydrolase.,"Epidemiological studies suggest that exposure to herbicides during pregnancy might increase risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in offspring. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the risk of ASD by herbicides such as glyphosate remain unclear. Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) in the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids is shown to play a key role in the development of ASD in offspring after maternal immune activation. Here, we found ASD-like behavioral abnormalities in juvenile offspring after maternal exposure to high levels of formulated glyphosate. Furthermore, we found higher levels of sEH in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus, and striatum of juvenile offspring, and oxylipin analysis showed decreased levels of epoxy-fatty acids such as 8 (9)-EpETrE in the blood, PFC, hippocampus, and striatum of juvenile offspring after maternal glyphosate exposure, supporting increased activity of sEH in the offspring. Moreover, we found abnormal composition of gut microbiota and short-chain fatty acids in fecal samples of juvenile offspring after maternal glyphosate exposure. Interestingly, oral administration of TPPU (an sEH inhibitor) to pregnant mothers from E5 to P21 prevented ASD-like behaviors such as social interaction deficits and increased grooming time in the juvenile offspring after maternal glyphosate exposure. These findings suggest that maternal exposure to high levels of glyphosate causes ASD-like behavioral abnormalities and abnormal composition of gut microbiota in juvenile offspring, and that increased activity of sEH might play a role in ASD-like behaviors in offspring after maternal glyphosate exposure. Therefore, sEH may represent a target for ASD in offspring after maternal stress from occupational exposure to contaminants.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2020,Yaoyu Pu; Jun Yang; Lijia Chang; Youge Qu; Siming Wang; Kai Zhang; Zhongwei Xiong; Jiancheng Zhang; Yunfei Tan; Xingming Wang; Yuko Fujita; Tamaki Ishima; Debin Wang; Sung Hee Hwang; Bruce D Hammock; Kenji Hashimoto
31931033,Heat-killed Enterococcus fecalis (EC-12) supplement alters the expression of neurotransmitter receptor genes in the prefrontal cortex and alleviates anxiety-like behavior in mice.,"Gut microbiota plays a crucial role in the maintenance of mental health and influences mental disorders such as depression and anxiety. Several studies have reported the beneficial affects of probiotics in mental health. Heat-killed Enterococcus faecalis strain EC-12 (EC-12), a lactic acid bacterium induces activation of the immune system. However, little is known about the effect of EC-12 on mental health. In the present study, the anti-anxiety effect of EC-12 was elucidated in vivo. Male mice fed on diet supplemented with EC-12 showed decreased anxiety-like behavior in open-field and elevated plus-mazetest. In addition, EC-12 supplementation exhibited an anti-depressive trend in mice subjected to forced swim test. The expression of neurotransmitter receptor genes: Adrb3 and Avpr1a were significantly enhanced in EC-12 supplemented mice compared to that of the control mice. In mice, analyses of gut microbiota composition by next generation sequencing revealed significant increase in Butyricicoccus and Enterococcus with EC-12 supplementation. Significant difference was not detected in the expression of neurotransmitter receptor genes in the prefrontal cortex with the administration of sodium butyrate compared to that of the control group. The mechanism associated with EC-12 mediated reduced anxiety-like behavior and altered gene expression in the brain needs to be further elucidated. Taken together, the present study is the first to report the possibility of exploiting the anti-anxiety effect of heat-killed EC-12 as a novel probiotic to promote mental health.",Neuroscience letters,2020,Jun Kambe; Sovijit Watcharin; Yuko Makioka-Itaya; Ryo Inoue; Gen Watanabe; Hirohito Yamaguchi; Kentaro Nagaoka
32485204,Probiotic treatment (Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum 35624â¢) affects stress responsivity in male rats after chronic corticosterone exposure.,"Mounting evidence suggests that gut microbiota do not only regulate intestinal function and health, but that they also play a role in mental health via the gut-brain axis. Previous research further suggests that probiotics may have beneficial health effects, but more research is needed to confirm these beneficial effects and better understand the underlying mechanisms and potential sex differences in the response to probiotics. Therefore, the current study investigates the effects of chronic administration of the commercially available probiotic Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum 35624â¢(B. 35624) to male and female rats under control or ""stressed"" conditions. For this, 24 male and 24 female Sprague-Dawley rats were either given daily corticosterone injections (40 mg/kg; to induce depressive-like behavior and a ""stressed"" condition) or oil injections (controls) together with oral administration of B.35624 or vehicle for 21 days (n = 5-7/group). Animals performed the Open Field Test (OFT) and Forced Swim Test (FST) and several blood samples were collected to investigate basal as well as stress-induced corticosterone levels. Rats were sacrificed on day 22 and their brains sliced and stained with doublecortin, a marker of immature neurons. Results showed that B.35624 was not able to rescue depressive-like behavior or induce changes in neurogenesis in males or females, but the probiotic impacted hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis functioning in male animals and tended to reduce anxiolytic behavior in the OFT. More research is needed to further elucidate the potential health effects of probiotics especially in regard to possible sex differences.",Behavioural brain research,2020,Gabriel S Haas; Wan Wang; Malak Saffar; Sean M Mooney-Leber; Susanne Brummelte
32739746,Colonization with the commensal fungus Candida albicans perturbs the gut-brain axis through dysregulation of endocannabinoid signaling.,"Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent mental health disorder worldwide, with a lifetime prevalence of 5-7 % of the human population. Although the etiology of anxiety disorders is incompletely understood, one aspect of host health that affects anxiety disorders is the gut-brain axis. Adolescence is a key developmental window in which stress and anxiety disorders are a major health concern. We used adolescent female mice in a gastrointestinal (GI) colonization model to demonstrate that the commensal fungus Candida albicans affects host health via the gut-brain axis. In mice, bacterial members of the gut microbiota can influence the host gut-brain axis, affecting anxiety-like behavior and the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis which produces the stress hormone corticosterone (CORT). Here we showed that mice colonized with C. albicans demonstrated increased anxiety-like behavior and increased basal production of CORT as well as dysregulation of CORT production following acute stress. The HPA axis and anxiety-like behavior are negatively regulated by the endocannabinoid N-arachidonoylethanolamide (AEA). We demonstrated that C. albicans-colonized mice exhibited changes in the endocannabinoidome. Further, increasing AEA levels using the well-characterized fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitor URB597 was sufficient to reverse both neuroendocrine phenotypes in C. albicans-colonized mice. Thus, a commensal fungus that is a common colonizer of humans had widespread effects on the physiology of its host. To our knowledge, this is the first report of microbial manipulation of the endocannabinoid (eCB) system that resulted in neuroendocrine changes contributing to anxiety-like behavior.",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2020,Laura Markey; Andrew Hooper; Laverne C Melon; Samantha Baglot; Matthew N Hill; Jamie Maguire; Carol A Kumamoto
31769847,Probiotics and prebiotics: focus on psychiatric disorders - a systematic review.,"The gut-brain axis and microbial dysbiosis may play a role in psychiatric diseases. In this view, the gut microbiota has been considered a potential therapeutic target using probiotics and prebiotics.This systematic review aims to find the existing clinical evidence that may justify the use of probiotics or prebiotics in psychiatric patients.PRISMA guidelines were followed for a systematic literature review of randomized controlled trials that assessed the effect of prebiotics or probiotics in patients diagnosed with a classified psychiatric disorder.From a total of 212 studies screened, 11 were included in the final systematic review. Quality assessment of the included trials was assessed by the Jadad scale.Probiotics seem to offer some benefit in major depressive disorder and Alzheimer's disease. One study showed that probiotics reduced rehospitalization in patients with acute mania. In autism spectrum disorders, the results were controversial; however a single study found that early administration of probiotics showed a preventive role. No benefits were found for patients with schizophrenia. In most studies, no major adverse effects were reported.Although recent findings in specific psychiatric disorders are encouraging, the use of prebiotics and probiotics in clinical practice stills lacks sufficiently robust evidence.",Nutrition reviews,2020,Renata S D Barbosa; Maria A Vieira-Coelho
33067279,Effects of sulforaphane on cognitive function in patients with frontal brain damage: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.,"Many patients with frontal brain damage show serious cognitive function deficits, which hamper their quality of life and result in poor clinical outcomes. Preclinical research has shown that sulforaphane can significantly improve spatial localisation and working memory impairment after brain injury. The primary aim of this double-blind randomised controlled clinical trial is to assess the efficacy of sulforaphane for improving cognitive function in patients with frontal brain damage.Ninety eligible patients will be randomly allocated to an active treatment or a placebo group in a 2:1 ratio. Participants will undergo a series of cognitive and neuropsychiatric tests at baseline (week 0) and after 12 weeks to determine the effect of sulforaphane on cognition. Magnetic resonance spectrum of the brain will be studied using the 3T MRIs of the brain to detect brain metabolites markers, including N-acetyl aspartate, glutamate (Glu), glutathione (GSH) and Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Blood brain-derived neurotrophic factor, Glu, GSH and GABA levels and gut microbiota will also be assessed over this period. This study will also evaluate long-term outcomes of brain trauma, brain tumours and cerebrovascular disease via exploratory analyses. The primary outcome will be the difference in scores of a battery of cognitive tests after 12 weeks of sulforaphane treatment. The secondary outcomes will be changes in the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, the changes in T1-weighted MRI and resting-state functional MRI findings, and changes in brain and blood metabolic markers and gut microbiota at weeks 0 and 12. We expect that sulforaphane will yield favourable results in treating memory and learning deficits for patients with frontal brain damage.

32438623,Recipe for a Healthy Gut: Intake of Unpasteurised Milk Is Associated with Increased <i>Lactobacillus</i> Abundance in the Human Gut Microbiome.,"The gut microbiota plays a role in gut-brain communication and can influence psychological functioning. Diet is one of the major determinants of gut microbiota composition. The impact of unpasteurised dairy products on the microbiota is unknown. In this observational study, we investigated the effect of a dietary change involving intake of unpasteurised dairy on gut microbiome composition and psychological status in participants undertaking a residential 12-week cookery course on an organic farm.Twenty-four participants completed the study. The majority of food consumed during their stay originated from the organic farm itself and included unpasteurised milk and dairy products. At the beginning and end of the course, participants provided faecal samples and completed self-report questionnaires on a variety of parameters including mood, anxiety and sleep. Nutrient intake was monitored with a food frequency questionnaire. Gut microbiota analysis was performed with 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Additionally, faecal short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were measured.Relative abundance of the genus <i>Lactobacillus</i> increased significantly between pre- and post-course time points. This increase was associated with participants intake of unpasteurised milk and dairy products. An increase in the faecal SCFA, valerate, was observed along with an increase in the functional richness of the microbiome profile, as determined by measuring the predictive neuroactive potential using a gut-brain module approach.While concerns in relation to safety need to be considered, intake of unpasteurised milk and dairy products appear to be associated with the growth of the probiotic bacterial genus, <i>Lactobacillus</i>, in the human gut. More research is needed on the effect of dietary changes on gut microbiome composition, in particular in relation to the promotion of bacterial genera, such as <i>Lactobacillus</i>, which are recognised as being beneficial for a range of physical and mental health outcomes.",Nutrients,2020,Mary I Butler; Thomaz F S Bastiaanssen; Caitriona Long-Smith; Kirsten Berding; Sabrina Morkl; Anne-Marie Cusack; Conall Strain; Kizkitza Busca; Penny Porteous-Allen; Marcus J Claesson; Catherine Stanton; John F Cryan; Darina Allen; Timothy G Dinan
32379622,Betaine supplementation is associated with the resilience in mice after chronic social defeat stress: a role of brain-gut-microbiota axis.,"The brain-gut-microbiota axis plays a role in the pathogenesis of stress-related psychiatric disorders; however, its role in the resilience versus susceptibility after stress remains unclear. Dietary nutrient betaine is suggested to affect the gut microbiome. Here, we examined whether betaine supplementation can affect anhedonia-like phenotype in mice subjected to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS).CSDS was performed during betaine supplementation. Sucrose preference test and 16S rRNA analysis of fecal samples were performed.CSDS did not produce an anhedonia-like phenotype in the betaine-treated mice, but did induce an anhedonia-like phenotype in water-treated mice. Furthermore, CSDS treatment did not alter the plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) of betaine-treated mice whereas CSDS caused higher plasma levels of IL-6 in water-treated mice. Betaine supplementation ameliorated the abnormal diversity and composition of the microbiota in the host gut after CSDS. At the genus level, CSDS caused marked increases in the several bacteria of water-treated mice, but not betaine-treated mice. CSDS increased levels of short-chain fatty acids (i.e., succinic acid and acetic acid) in feces from water-treated mice, but not betaine-treated mice. Interestingly, there are positive correlations between short-chain fatty acids (i.e., succinic acid, acetic acid, butyric acid) and several bacteria among the groups.Specific microbiome were not determined.These findings suggest that betaine supplementation contributed to resilience to anhedonia in mice subjected to CSDS through anti-inflammation action. Therefore, it is likely that betaine could be a prophylactic nutrient to prevent stress-related psychiatric disorders.",Journal of affective disorders,2020,Youge Qu; Kai Zhang; Yaoyu Pu; Lijia Chang; Siming Wang; Yunfei Tan; Xingming Wang; Jiancheng Zhang; Tetsuo Ohnishi; Takeo Yoshikawa; Kenji Hashimoto
32495743,"The Safety, Efficacy, and Tolerability of Microbial Ecosystem Therapeutic-2 in People With Major Depression and/or Generalized Anxiety Disorder: Protocol for a Phase 1, Open-Label Study.","The bidirectional signaling between the gut microbiota and the brain, known as the gut-brain axis, is being heavily explored in current neuropsychiatric research. Analyses of the human gut microbiota have shown considerable individual variability in bacterial content, which is hypothesized to influence brain function, and potentially mood and anxiety symptoms, through gut-brain axis communication. Preclinical and clinical research examining these effects suggests that fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) may aid in improving the severity of depression and anxiety symptoms by recolonizing the gastrointestinal (GI) tract with healthy bacteria. The microbial ecosystem therapeutic (ie, microbial ecosystem therapeutic-2 [MET-2]) used in this study is an alternative treatment to FMT, which comprises 40 different strains of gut bacteria from a healthy donor.The primary objective of this study is to assess subjective changes in mood and anxiety symptoms before, during, and after administration of MET-2. The secondary objectives of this study are to assess the changes in metabolic functioning and the level of repopulation of healthy gut bacteria, the safety and tolerability of MET-2, and the effects of early stress on biomarkers of depression/anxiety and the response to treatment.Adults experiencing depressive or anxiety symptoms will be recruited from the Kingston area. These participants will orally consume an encapsulated MET-2 once daily-containing 40 strains of purified and laboratory-grown bacteria from a single healthy donor-for 8 weeks, followed by a 2-week treatment-free follow-up period. Participants will undergo a series of clinical assessments measuring mood, anxiety, and GI symptoms using validated clinical scales and questionnaires. Molecular data will be collected from blood and fecal samples to assess metabolic changes, neurotransmitter levels, inflammatory markers, and the level of engraftment of the fecal samples that may predict outcomes in depression or anxiety.Given the association between the gut bacteria and the risk factors of depression, we expect to observe an improvement in the severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms following treatment, and we expect that this improvement is mediated by the recolonization of the GI tract with healthy bacteria. The recruitment for this study has been completed, and the data obtained are currently being analyzed.This is the first time MET-2 is being tested in psychiatric indications, specifically depression and anxiety. As such, this may be the first study to show the potential effects of microbial therapy in alleviating psychiatric symptoms as well as its safety and tolerability.DERR1-10.2196/17223.",JMIR research protocols,2020,Arthi Chinna Meyyappan; Roumen Milev
33066107,Effects of <i>Bifidobacterium animalis</i> Subsp. <i>lactis</i> (BPL1) Supplementation in Children and Adolescents with Prader-Willi Syndrome: A Randomized Crossover Trial.,"Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a wide range of clinical manifestations, including obesity, hyperphagia, and behavioral problems. <i>Bifidobacterium animalis</i> subsp. <i>lactis</i> strain BPL1 has been shown to improve central adiposity in adults with simple obesity. To evaluate BPL1's effects in children with PWS, we performed a randomized crossover trial among 39 patients (mean age 10.4 years). Participants were randomized to placebo-BPL1 (<i>n</i> = 19) or BPL1-placebo (<i>n</i> = 20) sequences and underwent a 12-week period with placebo/BPL1 treatments, a 12-week washout period, and a 12-week period with the crossover treatment. Thirty-five subjects completed the study. The main outcome was changes in adiposity, measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Secondary outcomes included lipid and glucose metabolism, hyperphagia, and mental health symptoms. Generalized linear modeling was applied to assess differences between treatments. While BPL1 did not modify total fat mass compared to placebo, BPL1 decreased abdominal adiposity in a subgroup of patients older than 4.5 years (<i>n</i> = 28). BPL1 improved fasting insulin concentration and insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, we observed modest improvements in some mental health symptoms. A follow-up trial with a longer treatment period is warranted to determine whether BPL1 supplementation can provide a long-term therapeutic approach for children with PWS (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03548480).",Nutrients,2020,Montse Amat-Bou; Sonika Garcia-Ribera; Eric Climent; Irene Piquer-Garcia; Raquel Corripio; David Sanchez-Infantes; Laia Villalta; Maria Elias; Josep C JimÃ©nez-ChillarÃ³n; Empar Chenoll; Daniel RamÃ³n; Lourdes IbaÃ±ez; Marta Ramon-Krauel; Carles Lerin
32989186,Effects of a Psychobiotic Supplement on Serum Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor Levels in Depressive Patients: A <i>Post Hoc</i> Analysis of a Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Psychobiotics are probiotics or prebiotics that, upon ingestion in adequate amounts, yield positive influence on mental health via microbiota-gut-brain axis regulation to modulate the circulating cytokines, chemokines, neurotransmitters, or neurotrophins levels. We have recently shown that a psychobiotic combination (<i>Lactobacillus helveticus</i> R0052 and <i>Bifidobacterium longum</i> R0175; CEREBIOME) significantly improved depression symptoms in patients with depression. Recent animal data suggest the influence of the gut microbiota on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which was shown to correlate with antidepressant response in depressive patients. Therefore, we conducted this exploratory <i>post hoc</i> analysis of BDNF levels to clarify the mechanism of action of this psychobiotic in our cohort.Our study was a double-blind, randomized controlled trial of patients with low-to-moderate depression receiving either a probiotic combination, prebiotic or placebo. From the 110 patients randomized in the trial, 78 were included in this <i>post hoc</i> analysis (probiotic, n = 28; prebiotic and placebo, n = 25). We compared serum BDNF levels from participants at baseline and endpoint, and assessed the Pearson correlation between depression severity and BDNF levels for each intervention.We found that post-intervention BDNF levels were significantly different between groups (<i>P</i> < 0.001). Furthermore, BDNF levels increased significantly in the probiotic group compared to both the prebiotic (<i>P</i> < 0.001) and placebo groups (<i>P</i> = 0.021), which inversely correlated with depression severity compared to placebo (ANOVA/ANCOVA, <i>P</i> = 0.012; Pearson, <i>r</i> = -0.79, <i>P</i> < 0.001). In the prebiotic group, BDNF levels reduced but not significantly compared with placebo group (<i>P</i> > 0.05).Eight-week supplementation with B. longum and L. helveticus in depressive patients improved depression symptoms, possibly by increasing BDNF levels.",Journal of neurogastroenterology and motility,2020,Nazanin Heidarzadeh-Rad; HÃ¼lya GÃ¶kmen-Ãzel; Asma Kazemi; Negin Almasi; Kurosh Djafarian

In this randomized, double-blinded, two-arm feasibility study, we investigated whether intermittent fasting, supplemented with <i>Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus</i> HN001 probiotic, reduces HbA1c in individuals with prediabetes. All participants with HbA1c 40-50 mmol/mol commenced intermittent fasting (2 days per week of calorie restriction to 600-650 kcal/day) and were randomized 1:1 to either daily probiotic (<i>Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus</i> HN001) or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was a change in HbA1c. Secondary outcomes included changes in anthropometry, body composition, glucoregulatory markers, lipids, hunger hormones, liver enzymes, inflammatory markers, gut hormones, calorie and macronutrient intake, quality of life, hunger, mood and eating behavior. Of 33 participants who commenced the trial, 26 participants (mean age 52 years, body mass index (BMI) 34.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) completed the intervention (<i>n</i> = 11 placebo, <i>n</i> = 15 probiotic). HbA1c decreased from 43 Â± 2.7 mmol/mol to 41 Â± 2.3 mmol/mol, <i>p</i> < 0.001, with average of 5% weight loss. No significant between-group differences were seen in primary or secondary outcomes except for social functioning (<i>p</i> = 0.050) and mental health (<i>p</i> = 0.007) scores as improvements were seen in the probiotic group, but not in the placebo group.

33067915,Interaction between Maternal Immune Activation and Antibiotic Use during Pregnancy and Child Risk of Autism Spectrum Disorder.,"Prenatal exposure to maternal immune activation (MIA) has been implicated as a risk factor for the development of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), though the conditions under which this elevated risk occurs are unclear. Animal literature demonstrates that antibiotic use, which affects the composition of the maternal gut microbiota, modifies the effect of MIA on neurodevelopmental outcomes in the offspring. The aim of this study was to assess whether antibiotic use during pregnancy modifies the association between MIA and subsequent risk of ASD, in a prospective birth cohort with 116 ASD cases and 860 typically developing (TD) child controls. There was no evidence of interaction between fever or genitourinary infection and antibiotic use on the odds of ASD in unadjusted or adjusted analyzes. However, we found evidence of an interaction between flu, specifically in second trimester, and antibiotic use at any point during pregnancy on the odds of ASD in the child. Among women who received an antibiotic during pregnancy, flu in trimester two was not associated with ASD (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.99 [0.43-2.28]). Among women who were not exposed to an antibiotic at any point during pregnancy, flu in second trimester was significantly associated with increased odds of ASD (aOR = 4.05 [1.14-14.38], P = .03), after adjustment for child sex, child birth year, maternal age, gestational age, C-section delivery, and low birthweight. These findings should be treated as hypothesis-generating and suggest that antibiotic use may modify the influence that MIA has on autism risk in the child. LAY SUMMARY: We looked at whether the association between activation of the immune system during pregnancy and risk of the child developing autism spectrum disorder (ASD) differed among women who did or did not take an antibiotic at any point during pregnancy. We examined 116 children with ASD and 860 without ASD and found that flu in second trimester was associated with increased ASD, but only among women who did not take an antibiotic during pregnancy. No other immune activation exposures seemed to interact with antibiotic use.",Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research,2020,Calliope Holingue; Martha Brucato; Christine Ladd-Acosta; Xiumei Hong; Heather Volk; Noel T Mueller; Xiaobin Wang; M Daniele Fallin
33693453,Diet and the Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis: Sowing the Seeds of Good Mental Health.,"Over the past decade, the gut microbiota has emerged as a key component in regulating brain processes and behavior. Diet is one of the major factors involved in shaping the gut microbiota composition across the lifespan. However, whether and how diet can affect the brain via its effects on the microbiota is only now beginning to receive attention. Several mechanisms for gut-to-brain communication have been identified, including microbial metabolites, immune, neuronal, and metabolic pathways, some of which could be prone to dietary modulation. Animal studies investigating the potential of nutritional interventions on the microbiota-gut-brain axis have led to advancements in our understanding of the role of diet in this bidirectional communication. In this review, we summarize the current state of the literature triangulating diet, microbiota, and host behavior/brain processes and discuss potential underlying mechanisms. Additionally, determinants of the responsiveness to a dietary intervention and evidence for the microbiota as an underlying modulator of the effect of diet on brain health are outlined. In particular, we emphasize the understudied use of whole-dietary approaches in this endeavor and the need for greater evidence from clinical populations. While promising results are reported, additional data, specifically from clinical cohorts, are required to provide evidence-based recommendations for the development of microbiota-targeted, whole-dietary strategies to improve brain and mental health.","Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2021,Kirsten Berding; Klara Vlckova; Wolfgang Marx; Harriet Schellekens; Catherine Stanton; Gerard Clarke; Felice Jacka; Timothy G Dinan; John F Cryan
33671569,Nutritional Components in Western Diet Versus Mediterranean Diet at the Gut Microbiota-Immune System Interplay. Implications for Health and Disease.,"The most prevalent diseases of our time, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) (including obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and some types of cancer) are rising worldwide. All of them share the condition of an ""inflammatory disorder"", with impaired immune functions frequently caused or accompanied by alterations in gut microbiota. These multifactorial maladies also have in common malnutrition related to physiopathology. In this context, diet is the greatest modulator of immune system-microbiota crosstalk, and much interest, and new challenges, are arising in the area of precision nutrition as a way towards treatment and prevention. It is a fact that the westernized diet (WD) is partly responsible for the increased prevalence of NCDs, negatively affecting both gut microbiota and the immune system. Conversely, other nutritional approaches, such as Mediterranean diet (MD), positively influence immune system and gut microbiota, and is proposed not only as a potential tool in the clinical management of different disease conditions, but also for prevention and health promotion globally. Thus, the purpose of this review is to determine the regulatory role of nutritional components of WD and MD in the gut microbiota and immune system interplay, in order to understand, and create awareness of, the influence of diet over both key components.",Nutrients,2021,Cielo GarcÃ­a-Montero; Oscar Fraile-MartÃ­nez; Ana M GÃ³mez-Lahoz; Leonel Pekarek; Alejandro J Castellanos; Fernando Noguerales-Fraguas; Santiago Coca; Luis G Guijarro; Natalio GarcÃ­a-Honduvilla; Angel AsÃºnsolo; Lara Sanchez-Trujillo; Guillermo Lahera; Julia Bujan; Jorge Monserrat; Melchor Ãlvarez-Mon; Miguel A Ãlvarez-Mon; Miguel A Ortega

Research is bolstering the concept that gut bacteria are involved in the transmission of information between the gut and the brain, engaging neural, immune, and endocrine pathways. Factors such as diet, stress and aging can shape the microbiota composition in a process that may also influence the onset and development of mental diseases. This review aims to provide an outline of the link between the microbiota and brain function focusing on preclinical and clinical evidence of the potential application of psychobiotics in the context of the cognitive process and performance. The occurrence of metabolic precursors of neurotransmitters in foods that can be converted by the gut microbiota and play a role in the gut-brain axis is discussed. The understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which communication occurs is still at its infancy; however clinical studies have shown that dietary interventions based on psychobiotics might be a novel nutritional approach targeting gut microbiota for managing cognitive performance and preventing memory decline across the lifespan.","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2022,Melania Casertano; Vincenzo Fogliano; Danilo Ercolini
33955443,Gut microbiota in mental health and depression: role of pre/pro/synbiotics in their modulation.,"The microbiome residing in the human gut performs a wide range of biological functions. Recently, it has been elucidated that a change in dietary habits is associated with alteration in the gut microflora which results in increased health risks and vulnerability towards various diseases. Falling in line with the same concept, depression has also been shown to increase its prevalence around the globe, especially in the western world. Various research studies have suggested that changes in the gut microbiome profile further result in decreased tolerance of stress. Although currently available medications help in relieving the symptoms of depressive disorders briefly, these drugs are not able to completely reverse the multifactorial pathology of depression. The discovery of the communication pathway between gut microbes and the brain, i.e. the Gut-Brain Axis, has led to new areas of research to find more effective and safer alternatives to current antidepressants. The use of probiotics and prebiotics has been suggested as being effective in various preclinical studies and clinical trials for depression. Therefore, in the present review, we address the new antidepressant mechanisms via gut microbe alterations and provide insight into how these can provide an alternative to antidepressant therapy without the side effects and risk of adverse drug reactions.",Food & function,2021,Hasnain N Methiwala; Bhupesh Vaidya; Vamsi Krishna Addanki; Mahendra Bishnoi; Shyam Sunder Sharma; Kanthi Kiran Kondepudi

The NVP-1704 group had a more significant reduction in depressive symptoms at four and eight weeks of treatment, and anxiety symptoms at four weeks compared to the placebo group. Those receiving NVP-1704 also experienced an improvement in sleep quality. NVP-1704 treatment led to a decrease in serum interleukin-6 levels. Furthermore, NVP-1704 increased <i>Bifidobacteriaceae</i> and <i>Lactobacillacea</i>, whereas it decreased <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> in the gut microbiota composition.

33963281,Gut microbiota modulates the inflammatory response and cognitive impairment induced by sleep deprivation.,"Sleep deprivation (SD) is increasingly common in modern society, which can lead to the dysregulation of inflammatory responses and cognitive impairment, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Emerging evidence suggests that gut microbiota plays a critical role in the pathogenesis and development of inflammatory and psychiatric diseases, possibly via gut microbiota-brain interactions and neuroinflammation. The present study investigated the impact of SD on gut microbiota composition and explored whether alterations of the gut microbiota play a causal role in chronic inflammatory states and cognitive impairment that are induced by SD. We found that SD-induced gut dysbiosis, inflammatory responses, and cognitive impairment in humans. Moreover, the absence of the gut microbiota suppressed inflammatory response and cognitive impairment induced by SD in germ-free (GF) mice. Transplantation of the ""SD microbiota"" into GF mice activated the Toll-like receptor 4/nuclear factor-ÎºB signaling pathway and impaired cognitive function in the recipient mice. Mice that harbored ""SD microbiota"" also exhibited increases in neuroinflammation and microglial activity in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex. These findings indicate that gut dysbiosis contributes to both peripheral and central inflammatory processes and cognitive deficits that are induced by SD, which may open avenues for potential interventions that can relieve the detrimental consequences of sleep loss.",Molecular psychiatry,2021,Zhong Wang; Wen-Hao Chen; Su-Xia Li; Zhong-Ming He; Wei-Li Zhu; Yan-Bin Ji; Zhe Wang; Xi-Mei Zhu; Kai Yuan; Yan-Ping Bao; Le Shi; Shi-Qiu Meng; Yan-Xue Xue; Wen Xie; Jie Shi; Wei Yan; Hong Wei; Lin Lu; Ying Han

34758889,A fiber-deprived diet causes cognitive impairment and hippocampal microglia-mediated synaptic loss through the gut microbiota and metabolites.,"Cognitive impairment, an increasing mental health issue, is a core feature of the aging brain and neurodegenerative diseases. Industrialized nations especially, have experienced a marked decrease in dietary fiber intake, but the potential mechanism linking low fiber intake and cognitive impairment is poorly understood. Emerging research reported that the diversity of gut microbiota in Western populations is significantly reduced. However, it is unknown whether a fiber-deficient diet (which alters gut microbiota) could impair cognition and brain functional elements through the gut-brain axis.In this study, a mouse model of long-term (15 weeks) dietary fiber deficiency (FD) was used to mimic a sustained low fiber intake in humans. We found that FD mice showed impaired cognition, including deficits in object location memory, temporal order memory, and the ability to perform daily living activities. The hippocampal synaptic ultrastructure was damaged in FD mice, characterized by widened synaptic clefts and thinned postsynaptic densities. A hippocampal proteomic analysis further identified a deficit of CaMKIId and its associated synaptic proteins (including GAP43 and SV2C) in the FD mice, along with neuroinflammation and microglial engulfment of synapses. The FD mice also exhibited gut microbiota dysbiosis (decreased Bacteroidetes and increased Proteobacteria), which was significantly associated with the cognitive deficits. Of note, a rapid differentiating microbiota change was observed in the mice with a short-term FD diet (7 days) before cognitive impairment, highlighting a possible causal impact of the gut microbiota profile on cognitive outcomes. Moreover, the FD diet compromised the intestinal barrier and reduced short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production. We exploit these findings for SCFA receptor knockout mice and oral SCFA supplementation that verified SCFA playing a critical role linking the altered gut microbiota and cognitive impairment.This study, for the first time, reports that a fiber-deprived diet leads to cognitive impairment through altering the gut microbiota-hippocampal axis, which is pathologically distinct from normal brain aging. These findings alert the adverse impact of dietary fiber deficiency on brain function, and highlight an increase in fiber intake as a nutritional strategy to reduce the risk of developing diet-associated cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases.

Further, impaired sleep and circadian patterns are common symptoms of AD, while sleep and circadian rhythm disruption (SCRD) is associated with greater Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) burden and AD risk, sometimes years before the clinical onset of AD. Moreover, reports have demonstrated that GM and its metabolites exhibit diurnal rhythmicity and the role of SCRD in dampening the GM rhythmicity and eubiosis. This review will provide an evaluation of clinical and animal studies describing GM alterations in distinct conditions, including AD, sleep and circadian disruption. It aims to identify the overlapping and distinctive GM alterations in these conditions and their contributions to pathophysiology.

34204057,Mediterranean Diet as an Antioxidant: The Impact on Metabolic Health and Overall Wellbeing.,"It has been established, worldwide, that non-communicable diseases such as obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular events account for a high percentage of morbidity and mortality in contemporary societies. Several modifiable risk factors, such as sedentary activities, sleep deprivation, smoking, and unhealthy dietary habits have contributed to this increase. Healthy nutrition in terms of adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MD), rich in fruits, legumes, vegetables, olive oil, herbs, spices, and high fiber intake may contribute to the decrease in this pandemic. The beneficial effects of the MD can be mainly attributed to its numerous components rich in anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Moreover, the MD may further contribute to the improvement of reproductive health, modify the risk for neurodegenerative diseases, and protect against depression and psychosocial maladjustment. There is also evidence highlighting the impact of healthy nutrition in female people on the composition of the gut microbiota and future metabolic and overall health of their offspring. It is therefore important to highlight the beneficial effects of the MD on metabolic, reproductive, and mental health, while shaping the overall health of future generations. The beneficial effects of MD can be further enhanced by increased physical activity in the context of a well-balanced healthy lifestyle.",Nutrients,2021,Katherina V Gantenbein; Christina Kanaka-Gantenbein
33421542,Bipolar disorder: An evolutionary psychoneuroimmunological approach.,"Bipolar disorder is a mental health disorder characterized by extreme shifts in mood, high suicide rate, sleep problems, and dysfunction of psychological traits like self-esteem (feeling inferior when depressed and superior when manic). Bipolar disorder is rare among populations that have not adopted contemporary Western lifestyles, which supports the hypothesis that bipolar disorder results from a mismatch between Homo sapiens's evolutionary and current environments. Recent studies have connected bipolar disorder with low-grade inflammation, the malfunctioning of the internal clock, and the resulting sleep disturbances. Stress is often a triggering factor for mania and sleep problems, but stress also causes low-grade inflammation. Since inflammation desynchronizes the internal clock, chronic stress and inflammation are the primary biological mechanisms behind bipolar disorder. Chronic stress and inflammation are driven by contemporary Western lifestyles, including stressful social environments, unhealthy dietary patterns, limited physical activity, and obesity. The treatment of bipolar disorder should focus on reducing stress, stress sensitivity, and inflammation by lifestyle changes rather than just temporarily alleviating symptoms with psychopharmacological interventions.",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,2021,Markus J Rantala; Severi Luoto; Javier I BorrÃ¡z-LeÃ³n; Indrikis Krams
34617139,A next-generation probiotic: Akkermansia muciniphila ameliorates chronic stress-induced depressive-like behavior in mice by regulating gut microbiota and metabolites.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a neurasthenic disease, which is the second-largest burden of disease globally. Increasing studies have revealed that depression is associated with abnormalities in gut microbiota and metabolites. Several species of bacteria have been classified as psychobiotics, which confer mental health benefits through interactions with commensal gut microbiota. Therefore, it is essential to identify new psychobiotics and elucidate their mechanisms in the treatment of depression. This study aims to evaluate the antidepressant effect of Akkermansia muciniphila (AKK) in a mouse model of depression induced by chronic restraint stress (CRS). C57BL/6 male mice were divided into three groups: mice subjected to CRS, mice not subjected to CRS, and mice treated with AKK for 3Â weeks. Behavioral tests were performed, and hormone, neurotransmitter, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels were measured. Cecal microbiota was analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and serum metabolites were detected using untargeted metabolomics. In addition, correlations between altered gut microbiota and metabolites with significant variations in serum associated with AKK ameliorating depression were analyzed using Pearson's correlation coefficient. The results revealed that AKK significantly ameliorated depressive-like behavior and restored abnormal variations in depression-related molecular (corticosterone, dopamine, and BDNF). Moreover, AKK altered chronic stress-induced gut microbial abnormalities. Untargeted metabolomics analysis revealed 23 potential biomarkers in serum that could be associated with the mechanisms underlying CRS-induced depression and the therapeutic effects of AKK. Pearson's correlation coefficient analysis revealed that AKK predominantly upregulated Î²-alanyl-3-methyl-L-histidine and edaravone to relieve depression. Furthermore, Î²-alanyl-3-methyl-L-histidine and edaravone exhibited the antidepressant phenotype in mice subjected to CRS. In conclusion, the study demonstrated that AKK ameliorates chronic stress-induced depressive symptoms in mice by regulating gut microbiota and metabolites. KEY POINTS: â¢ AKK reduces depressive-like behaviors induced by chronic stress. â¢ AKK regulates the gut microbial structure and metabolomics of serum under the chronic stress. â¢ Antidepressant effect of AKK correlates with the increase of Î²-alanyl-3-methyl-l-histidine and edaravone.",Applied microbiology and biotechnology,2021,Yang Ding; Fan Bu; Tuo Chen; Guoping Shi; Xiaomin Yuan; Zeyu Feng; Zhenglan Duan; Rong Wang; Sumin Zhang; Qiong Wang; Jinyong Zhou; Yugen Chen
33511258,Probiotic consumption relieved human stress and anxiety symptoms possibly via modulating the neuroactive potential of the gut microbiota.,"Stress has been shown to disturb the balance of human intestinal microbiota and subsequently causes mental health problems like anxiety and depression. Our previous study showed that ingesting the probiotic strain, <i>Lactobacillus</i> (<i>L</i>.) <i>plantarum</i> P-8, for 12 weeks could alleviate stress and anxiety of stressed adults. The current study was a follow-up work aiming to investigate the functional role of the gut metagenomes in the observed beneficial effects. The fecal metagenomes of the probiotic (nÂ =Â 43) and placebo (nÂ =Â 36) receivers were analyzed in depth. The gut microbiomes of the placebo group at weeks 0 and 12 showed a significantly greater Aitchison distance (<i>P</i>Â <Â 0.001) compared with the probiotic group. Meanwhile, the Shannon diversity index of the placebo group (<i>P</i>Â <Â 0.05) but not the probiotic group decreased significantly at week 12. Additionally, significantly more species-level genome bins (SGBs) of <i>Bifidobacterium adolescentis</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium longum</i>, and <i>Fecalibacterium prausnitzii</i> (<i>P</i>Â <Â 0.01) were identified in the fecal metagenomes of the probiotic group, while the abundances of SGBs representing the species <i>Roseburia faecis</i> and <i>Fusicatenibacter saccharivorans</i> decreased significantly (<i>P</i>Â <Â 0.05). Furthermore, the 12-week probiotic supplementation enhanced the diversity of neurotransmitter-synthesizing/consuming SGBs and the levels of some predicted microbial neuroactive metabolites (e.g., short-chain fatty acids, gamma-aminobutyric acid, arachidonic acid, and sphingomyelin). Our results showed a potential link between probiotic-induced gut microbiota modulation and stress/anxiety alleviation in stressed adults, supporting that the gut-brain axis was involved in relieving stress-related symptoms. The beneficial effect relied not only on microbial diversity changes but more importantly gut metagenome modulations at the SGB and functional gene levels.",Neurobiology of stress,2021,Teng Ma; Hao Jin; Lai-Yu Kwok; Zhihong Sun; Min-Tze Liong; Heping Zhang
34692176,"A Review of Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Model of Microbial, Immune and Neuropsychological Integration.","<b>Objective:</b> Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are complex chronic inflammatory disorders of the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract with uncertain etiology. IBDs comprise two idiopathic disorders: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). The aetiology, severity and progression of such disorders are still poorly understood but thought to be influenced by multiple factors (including genetic, environmental, immunological, physiological, psychological factors and gut microbiome) and their interactions. The overarching aim of this review is to evaluate the extent and nature of the interrelationship between these factors with the disease course. A broader conceptual and longitudinal framework of possible neuro-visceral integration, core microbiome analysis and immune modulation assessment may be useful in accurately documenting and characterizing the nature and temporal continuity of crosstalk between these factors and the role of their interaction (s) in IBD disease activity. Characterization of these interactions holds the promise of identifying novel diagnostic, interventions, and therapeutic strategies. <b>Material and Methods:</b> A search of published literature was conducted by exploring PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Medline Plus, CDSR library databases. Following search terms relating to key question were set for the search included: ""Inflammatory bowel diseases,"" ""gut microbiota,"" ""psychological distress and IBD,"" ""autonomic reactivity and IBD,"" ""immune modulation,"" ""chronic inflammation,"" ""gut inflammation,"" ""enteric nervous system,"" ""gut nervous system,"" ""Crohn's disease,"" ""Ulcerative colitis"", ""depression and IBD"", ""anxiety and IBD"", ""quality of life in IBD patients,"" ""relapse in IBDs,"" ""remission in IBDs,"" ""IBD disease activity,"" ""brain-gut-axis,"" ""microbial signature in IBD,"" ""validated questionnaires in IBD,"" ""IBD activity indices,"" ""IBD aetiology,"" ""IBDs and stress,"" ""epidemiology of IBDs"", ""autonomic nervous system and gut inflammation"", ""IBD and environment,"" ""genetics of IBDs,"" ""pathways of immune response in IBDs,"" ""sleep disturbances in IBD,"" ""hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA),"" ""sympatho-adrenal axis,"" ""CNS and its control of gut function"" ""mucosal immune response,"" ""commensal and pathogenic bacteria in the gut,"" ""innate and adaptive immunity."" Studies evaluating any possible associations between gut microbiome, psychological state, immune modulation, and autonomic function with IBDs were identified. Commonly cited published literatures with high quality research methodology/results and additional articles from bibliographies of recovered papers were examined and included where relevant. <b>Results:</b> Although there is a substantial literature identifying major contributing factors with IBD, there has been little attempt to integrate some factors over time and assess their interplay and relationship with IBD disease activity. Such contributing factors include genetic and environmental factors, gut microbiota composition and function, physiological factors, psychological state and gut immune response. Interdependences are evident across psychological and biological factors and IBD disease activity. Although from the available evidence, it is implausible that a single explanatory model could elucidate the interplay between such factors and the disease course as well as the sequence of the effect during the pathophysiology of IBD. <b>Conclusion:</b> Longitudinal monitoring of IBD patients and integrating data related to the contributing/risk factors including psychological state, physiological conditions, inflammatory/immune modulations, and microbiome composition/function, could help to explain how major factors associate and interrelate leading to exacerbation of symptoms and disease activity. Identifying the temporal trajectory of biological and psychosocial disturbances may also help to assess their effects and interdependence on individuals' disease status. Moreover, this allows greater insight into understanding the temporal progressions of subclinical events as potential ground for disease severity in IBD. Furthermore, understanding the interaction between these risk factors may help better interventions in controlling the disease, reducing the costs related to disease management, further implications for clinical practice and research approaches in addition to improving patients' mental health and quality of life.",Public health reviews,2021,P Tavakoli; U Vollmer-Conna; D Hadzi-Pavlovic; M C Grimm
33428888,Gut microbiota-derived vitamins - underrated powers of a multipotent ally in psychiatric health and disease.,"Despite the well-established roles of B-vitamins and their deficiencies in health and disease, there is growing evidence indicating a key role of those nutrients in functions of the central nervous system and in psychopathology. Clinical data indicate the substantial role of B-vitamins in various psychiatric disorders, including major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, autism, and dementia, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. As enzymatic cofactors, B-vitamins are involved in many physiological processes such as the metabolism of glucose, fatty acids and amino acids, metabolism of tryptophan in the kynurenine pathway, homocysteine metabolism, synthesis and metabolism of various neurotransmitters and neurohormones including serotonin, dopamine, adrenaline, acetylcholine, GABA, glutamate, D-serine, glycine, histamine and melatonin. Those vitamins are highly involved in brain energetic metabolism and respiration at the cellular level. They have a broad range of anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antioxidant and neuroprotective properties. Furthermore, some of those vitamins are involved in the regulation of permeability of the intestinal and blood-brain barriers. Despite the fact that a substantial amount of the above vitamins is acquired from various dietary sources, deficiencies are not uncommon, and it is estimated that micronutrient deficiencies affect about two billion people worldwide. The majority of gut-resident microbes and the broad range of bacteria available in fermented food, express genetic machinery enabling the synthesis and metabolism of B-vitamins and, consequently, intestinal microbiota and fermented food rich in probiotic bacteria are essential sources of B-vitamins for humans.

35153869,"The Role of the Oral Microbiota Related to Periodontal Diseases in Anxiety, Mood and Trauma- and Stress-Related Disorders.","The prevalence of anxiety, mood and trauma- and stress-related disorders are on the rise; however, efforts to develop new and effective treatment strategies have had limited success. To identify novel therapeutic targets, a comprehensive understanding of the disease etiology is needed, especially in the context of the holobiont, i.e., the superorganism consisting of a human and its microbiotas. Much emphasis has been placed on the role of the gut microbiota in the development, exacerbation, and persistence of psychiatric disorders; however, data for the oral microbiota are limited. The oral cavity houses the second most diverse microbial community in the body, with over 700 bacterial species that colonize the soft and hard tissues. Periodontal diseases encompass a group of infectious and inflammatory diseases that affect the periodontium. Among them, periodontitis is defined as a chronic, multi-bacterial infection that elicits low-grade systemic inflammation <i>via</i> the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as local invasion and long-distance translocation of periodontal pathogens. Periodontitis can also induce or exacerbate other chronic systemic inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis and diabetes and can lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Recently, periodontal pathogens have been implicated in the etiology and pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders (such as depression and schizophrenia), especially as dysregulation of the immune system also plays an integral role in the etiology and pathophysiology of these disorders. This review will discuss the role of the oral microbiota associated with periodontal diseases in anxiety, mood and trauma- and stress-related disorders. Epidemiological data of periodontal diseases in individuals with these disorders will be presented, followed by a discussion of the microbiological and immunological links between the oral microbiota and the central nervous system. Pre-clinical and clinical findings on the oral microbiota related to periodontal diseases in anxiety, mood and trauma- and stress-related phenotypes will be reviewed, followed by a discussion on the bi-directionality of the oral-brain axis. Lastly, we will focus on the oral microbiota associated with periodontal diseases as a target for future therapeutic interventions to alleviate symptoms of these debilitating psychiatric disorders.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2021,MarÃ­a MartÃ­nez; Teodor T Postolache; Borja GarcÃ­a-Bueno; Juan C Leza; Elena Figuero; Christopher A Lowry; Stefanie Malan-MÃ¼ller
33722869,"Bugs and Brains, the Gut and Mental Health Study: a mixed-methods study investigating microbiota composition and function in anxiety, depression and irritable bowel syndrome.","Research has highlighted relationships between the micro-organisms that inhabit our gastrointestinal tract (oral and gut microbiota) with host mood and gastrointestinal functioning. Mental health disorders and functional gastrointestinal disorders co-occur at high rates, although the mechanisms underlying these associations remain unclear. The Bugs and Brains Study aims to investigate complex relationships between anxiety/depression and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in two ways. First, its primary component will compare the gut and oral microbiota in females with anxiety/depression and/or IBS relative to controls, and investigate underlying physiological, endocrine and immune factors, as well as associations with diet and psychosocial factors. In an ancillary component, the study will also investigate gastrointestinal and mental health symptoms in a larger sample, and explore relationships with diet, exercise, oral health, substance use, medical history, early life adversity and psychosocial factors.The Bugs and Brains Study aims to recruit 160 females to the primary component: (1) 40 controls; (2) 40 participants with a depressive/anxiety disorder, but no IBS; (3) 40 participants with IBS, but no depressive/anxiety disorder and (4) 40 participants with both depressive/anxiety disorder and IBS. Participation is completed within 1âmonth, and involves comprehensive questionnaires, anthropometrics, a diagnostic clinical interview, collection of two saliva samples, and stool, urine and hair samples. This study aims to use a systems biology approach to characterise oral and gut microbial composition <u>and</u> function using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and nuclear MR spectroscopy.

34172092,Depletion of acetate-producing bacteria from the gut microbiota facilitates cognitive impairment through the gut-brain neural mechanism in diabetic mice.,"Modification of the gut microbiota has been reported to reduce the incidence of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D). We hypothesized that the gut microbiota shifts might also have an effect on cognitive functions in T1D. Herein we used a non-absorbable antibiotic vancomycin to modify the gut microbiota in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced T1D mice and studied the impact of microbial changes on cognitive performances in T1D mice and its potential gut-brain neural mechanism.We found that vancomycin exposure disrupted the gut microbiome, altered host metabolic phenotypes, and facilitated cognitive impairment in T1D mice. Long-term acetate deficiency due to depletion of acetate-producing bacteria resulted in the reduction of synaptophysin (SYP) in the hippocampus as well as learning and memory impairments. Exogenous acetate supplement or fecal microbiota transplant recovered hippocampal SYP level in vancomycin-treated T1D mice, and this effect was attenuated by vagal inhibition or vagotomy.Our results demonstrate the protective role of microbiota metabolite acetate in cognitive functions and suggest long-term acetate deficiency as a risk factor of cognitive decline.

33777957,Brain Neurotransmitter Modulation by Gut Microbiota in Anxiety and Depression.,"Anxiety and depression are highly prevalent mental illnesses worldwide and have long been thought to be closely associated to neurotransmitter modulation. There is growing evidence indicating that changes in the composition of the gut microbiota are related to mental health including anxiety and depression. In this review, we focus on combining the intestinal microbiota with serotonergic, dopaminergic, and noradrenergic neurotransmission in brain, with special emphasis on the anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in stress-related rodent models. Therefore, we reviewed studies conducted on germ-free rodents, or in animals subjected to microbiota absence using antibiotics, as well as via the usage of probiotics. All the results strongly support that the brain neurotransmitter modulation by gut microbiota is indispensable to the physiopathology of anxiety and depression. However, a lot of work is needed to determine how gut microbiota mediated neurotransmission in human brain has any physiological significance and, if any, how it can be used in therapy. Overall, the gut microbiota provides a novel way to alter neurotransmitter modulation in the brain and treat gut-brain axis diseases, such as anxiety and depression.",Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,2021,Fei Huang; Xiaojun Wu
33918462,Gut Microbiota and Bipolar Disorder: An Overview on a Novel Biomarker for Diagnosis and Treatment.,"The gut microbiota is the set of microorganisms that colonize the gastrointestinal tract of living creatures, establishing a bidirectional symbiotic relationship that is essential for maintaining homeostasis, for their growth and digestive processes. Growing evidence supports its involvement in the intercommunication system between the gut and the brain, so that it is called the gut-brain-microbiota axis. It is involved in the regulation of the functions of the Central Nervous System (CNS), behavior, mood and anxiety and, therefore, its implication in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders. In this paper, we focused on the possible correlations between the gut microbiota and Bipolar Disorder (BD), in order to determine its role in the pathogenesis and in the clinical management of BD. Current literature supports a possible relationship between the compositional alterations of the intestinal microbiota and BD. Moreover, due to its impact on psychopharmacological treatment absorption, by acting on the composition of the microbiota beneficial effects can be obtained on BD symptoms. Finally, we discussed the potential of correcting gut microbiota alteration as a novel augmentation strategy in BD. Future studies are necessary to better clarify the relevance of gut microbiota alterations as state and disease biomarkers of BD.",International journal of molecular sciences,2021,Lorenza Lucidi; Mauro Pettorruso; Federica Vellante; Francesco Di Carlo; Franca Ceci; Maria Chiara Santovito; Ilenia Di Muzio; Michele Fornaro; Antonio Ventriglio; Carmine Tomasetti; Alessandro Valchera; Alessandro Gentile; Yong-Ku Kim; Giovanni Martinotti; Silvia Fraticelli; Massimo Di Giannantonio; Domenico De Berardis
33497754,Gut microbiota alteration and modulation in psychiatric disorders: Current evidence on fecal microbiota transplantation.,"The micro-organisms residing within the gastrointestinal tract, namely gut microbiota, form a dynamic population proper of each individual, mostly composed by bacteria which co-evolved symbiotically with human species. The advances of culture-independent techniques allowed the understanding of the multiple functions of the gut microbiota in human physiology and disease, the latter often recognising a predisposing condition in an imbalanced intestinal microbial ecosystem (dysbiosis). A complex mutual interconnection between the central nervous system (CNS), the intestine and the gut microbiota, known as ""microbiota-gut-brain axis"", has been hypothesized to play a pivotal role in maintaining central and peripheral functions, as well as mental health. Thus, dysbiosis with specific microbiota imbalances seems to be strongly associated with the onset psychiatric disorders by altering neurodevelopment, enhancing neurodegeneration, affecting behaviour and mood. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) consists of transferring the fecal matter from a donor into the gastrointestinal tract of a recipient, and it is used to quickly modulate the gut microbiota. This review focuses on the uses of FMT in psychiatric disorders. FMT has been used to induce dysbiosis and to study the disease development, or to heal dysbiosis-related mental disorders. Overall, FMT of impaired microbiota resulted effective in enhancing psychiatric-like disturbances (mainly depression and anxiety) in recipient animals, plausibly by impairing immune system, inflammatory and metabolic pathways, neurochemical processes and neuro-transmission. On the other side, preclinical and clinical data suggest that reversing or mitigating dysbiosis seems a promising strategy to restore behavioural impairments or to obtain psychiatric symptom relief. However, current evidence is limited by the lack of procedural standardization, the paucity of human studies in the vastity of psychiatric conditions and the need of a microbiota-targeted donor-recipient matching.",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,2021,Carlo Romano Settanni; Gianluca Ianiro; Stefano BibbÃ²; Giovanni Cammarota; Antonio Gasbarrini

Recently with the confirmation that the gut microbiota has a bidirectional connection with the brain, it is being proposed that modification of the microbiota can possibly extirpate neurological diseases. Development of probiotic foods and formulations for neural health benefits has garnered interest, with a renewed focus. In this context, this review discusses the evidences collected on the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of probiotics, especially during the time span of 2015-till now. Although, more clinical trials are necessary to elucidate the exact mechanism of probiotic mode of action but several of the established probiotic strains have been investigated and it appears that few of them have demonstrated their potential as 'psychobiotics'. The formulation of new psychobiotic-based therapeutics is in the spotlight. It is expected that in near future, biological effect of probiotics on neurological conditions will open up an entirely new avenue for personalized medication and healthcare in mental health, and they can be tailored according to the gut-microbiota of specific individuals.",FEMS microbiology letters,2021,Gargi Dey; Sohom Mookherjee

Although the precise etiology of psoriasis remains unclear, gut-microbiota axis might play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Here we investigated whether the composition of microbiota in the intestine and skin is altered in the imiquimod (IMQ)-treated mouse model of psoriasis. Topical application of IMQ to back skin caused significant changes in the composition of microbiota in the intestine and skin of IMQ-treated mice compared to control mice. The LEfSe algorithm identified the species Staphylococcus lentus as potential skin microbial marker for IMQ group. Furthermore, there were correlations for several microbes between the intestine and skin, suggesting a role of skin-gut-microbiota in IMQ-treated mice. Levels of succinic acid and lactic acid in feces from IMQ-treated mice were significantly higher than control mice. Moreover, the predictive functional analysis of the microbiota in the intestine and skin showed that IMQ caused alterations in several KEGG pathways. In conclusion, the current data indicated that topical application with IMQ to skin alters the composition of the microbiota in the gut and skin of host. It is likely that skin-gut microbiota axis plays a role in pathogenesis of psoriasis.",Scientific reports,2021,Hiroyo Shinno-Hashimoto; Yaeko Hashimoto; Yan Wei; Lijia Chang; Yuko Fujita; Tamaki Ishima; Hiroyuki Matsue; Kenji Hashimoto

34946184,Gut Bacteria and Neuropsychiatric Disorders.,"Bacteria in the gut microbiome plays an intrinsic part in immune activation, intestinal permeability, enteric reflex, and entero-endocrine signaling. Apart from physiological and structural changes brought about by gut bacteria on entero-epithelial cells and mucus layers, a vast number of signals generated in the gastro-intestinal tract (GIT) reaches the brain via the vagus nerve. Research on the gut-brain axis (GBA) has mostly been devoted to digestive functions and satiety. Less papers have been published on the role gut microbiota play in mood, cognitive behavior and neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism, depression and schizophrenia. Whether we will be able to fully decipher the connection between gut microbiota and mental health is debatable, especially since the gut microbiome is diverse, everchanging and highly responsive to external stimuli. Nevertheless, the more we discover about the gut microbiome and the more we learn about the GBA, the greater the chance of developing novel therapeutics, probiotics and psychobiotics to treat gastro-intestinal disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but also improve cognitive functions and prevent or treat mental disorders.

United States (US) military Veterans are a unique population in that their military-related exposures can have consequences for both physical and mental health, but the gut microbiome of this population has been understudied. In this publication, we describe exposures, health conditions, and medication use of Veterans in the US Veteran Microbiome Project (US-VMP) and examine the associations between these characteristics and the gut microbiota. This cohort included 331 US Veterans seeking healthcare with the Veterans Health Administration who were 83% male with an average (Â±SD) age of 47.6Â âÂ±Â â13.4 years. The cohort displayed a high prevalence of PTSD (49.8%) and history of traumatic brain injuries (76.1%), and high current use of prescription medications (74.9%) to treat various acute and chronic conditions. We observed significant associations between the gut microbiota composition and gastroenteritis, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), bipolar disorders, symptoms of severe depression based on the Beck Depression Inventory, stimulant and opioid use disorders, beta-blockers, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor antidepressants, diabetes medications, and proton pump inhibitors. Many of the Veteran characteristics examined were associated with altered relative abundances of specific taxa. We found that PVD and cardiovascular disease were associated with lower microbiota diversity in the gut (i.e., Î±-diversity), while supplemental vitamin use was associated with higher Î±-diversity. Our study contributes novel insights as to whether the unique exposures of Veterans in this cohort correlate with gut microbiota characteristics and, in line with previous findings with other population-level studies of the microbiome, confirms associations between numerous health conditions and medications with the gut microbiome.","Brain, behavior, & immunity - health",2021,Maggie A Stanislawski; Christopher E Stamper; Kelly A Stearns-Yoder; Andrew J Hoisington; Diana P Brostow; Jeri E Forster; Teodor T Postolache; Christopher A Lowry; Lisa A Brenner
34393849,Association Between Abundance of <i>Haemophilus</i> in the Gut Microbiota and Negative Symptoms of Schizophrenia.,"Increasing evidence indicates an interaction between dysbiosis of the microbiota and the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. However, limited information is available on the specific microbial communities associated with symptoms of schizophrenia. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate gut microbiota dysbiosis and its relationship with psychopathologies in schizophrenia. We recruited 126 participants and divided them into three groups according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, criteria-acute group (patients with acute schizophrenia), remission group (patients with schizophrenia in remission), and control group (healthy controls). Psychotic symptoms were evaluated using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Microbiota compositions, diversity and community structure were evaluated using 16S rRNA sequencing. Pearson's correlation analysis was used to evaluate the association between bacterial taxa and psychotic symptoms. The beta-diversity of microbiota composition in the acute group was distinct from that in the remission and control groups (PC1 = 21.11% vs. PC2 = 12.86%, <i>P</i> = 0.021). Furthermore, Pearson's correlation analysis revealed that abundance of <i>Haemophilu</i>s was positively correlated with negative psychiatric symptoms (<i>r</i> = 0.303, <i>P</i> = 0.021), while abundance of <i>Coprococcus</i> was negatively correlated with negative psychiatric symptoms (<i>r</i> = -<i>0.285, P</i> = <i>0.025</i>). Moreover, abundance of <i>Haemophilus</i> was positively correlated with cognition (<i>r</i> = 0.428, <i>P</i> = 0.009), excitement (<i>r</i> = 0.266, <i>P</i> = 0.037), and depression (<i>r</i> = 0.295, <i>P</i> = 0.020). The study findings suggest that alterations in certain gut microbiota may interfere with psychological symptoms in schizophrenia. Our results provide evidence that may help in the development of therapeutic strategies using microbial-based targets.

33742731,Fecal microbiota transplantation ameliorates gut microbiota imbalance and intestinal barrier damage in rats with stress-induced depressive-like behavior.,"The gut-microbiota-brain axis is the most important complex and bidirectional pathway between the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system. This study investigated the potential of microbe-induced gut-to-brain signaling to modulate the effect of stress on depressive-like behavior, intestinal barrier, and neuroinflammation. Result showed that fecal microbiota transplantation increased the consumption of sucrose solutions and decreased the immobility time in forced swimming test. This treatment also increased Firmicutes and decreased Bacteroidetes and Desulfobacterota at phylum levels; reduced the loss of villi and epithelial cells; suppressed the inflammatory cell infiltration in the ileum; increased the expression of ZO-1, occludin; protected the mucosal layer function; and suppressed the high levels of inflammasomes (NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, and IL-1Î²) in rat brain. In summary, fecal microbiota transplantation improves the depressive-like behavior, alters the gut microbiota imbalance, and alleviates the intestinal tract inflammation, intestinal mucosa disruption, and neuroinflammation in rats induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress.",The European journal of neuroscience,2021,Jingjing Rao; Ruining Xie; Li Lin; Jian Jiang; Lei Du; Xindie Zeng; Gongying Li; Chunmei Wang; Yi Qiao
34589731,Abnormalities of the composition of the gut microbiota and short-chain fatty acids in mice after splenectomy.,"The brain-gut-microbiota axis is a complex multi-organ bidirectional signaling system between the brain and microbiota that participates in the host immune system. The spleen, as the largest immune organ in the body, has a key role in the brain-gut-microbiota axis. Here, we investigated whether splenectomy could affect depression-like phenotypes and the composition of the gut microbiota in adult mice. In behavioral tests, splenectomy did not cause depression-like behaviors in mice. Conversely, splenectomy led to significant alterations in the diversity of gut microbes compared with the findings in control (no surgery) and sham-operated mice. In an unweighted UniFrac distance analysis, the boxplots representing the splenectomy group were distant from those representing the other two groups. We found differences in abundance for several bacteria in the splenectomy group at the taxonomic level compared with the other two groups. Finally, splenectomy induced significant changes in lactic acid and n-butyric acid levels compared with those in the other groups. Interestingly, there were significant correlations between the counts of certain bacteria and lactic acid (or n-butyric acid) levels in all groups. These data suggest that splenectomy leads to an abnormal composition of the gut microbiota. It is likely that the spleen-gut-microbiota axis plays a crucial role in the composition of the gut microbiota by regulating immune homeostasis.","Brain, behavior, & immunity - health",2021,Yan Wei; Lijia Chang; Tamaki Ishima; Xiayun Wan; Li Ma; Gerile Wuyun; Yaoyu Pu; Kenji Hashimoto
34870091,Compositional and functional alterations in the oral and gut microbiota in patients with psychosis or schizophrenia: A systematic review.,"<b>Background:</b> Gut and oral microbiota are intrinsically linked to human health. Recent studies suggest a direct link with mental health through bidirectional gut-brain pathways. Emerging evidence suggests that the composition and/or function of intestinal microbiome differs in those with psychosis and schizophrenia as compared with controls. There is relatively little research on the predicted or actual functional alterations associated with the composition of oral and gut microbiota in patients with psychosis. We will perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify, evaluate and if possible, combine the published literature on compositional alterations in the oral and gut microbiota in patients with psychosis or schizophrenia compared with healthy controls. We also aim to explore the potential functional impact of any compositional changes. <b>Methods:</b> Original studies involving humans and animals using a case-control, cohort or cross-sectional design will be included. The electronic databases PsycINFO, EMBASE, Web of Science, PubMed/MEDLINE and Cochrane will be systematically searched. Quantitative analyses will be performed using random-effects meta-analyses to calculate mean difference with 95% confidence intervals. <b>Discussion:</b> Changes in microbiota composition in psychosis and schizophrenia have been correlated with alternations in brain structure and function, altered immunity, altered metabolic pathways and symptom severity. Changes have also been identified as potential biomarkers for psychosis that might aid in diagnosis. Understanding how predicted or actual functional alterations in microbial genes or metabolic pathways influence symptomatic expression and downstream clinical outcomes may contribute to the development of microbiome targeted interventions for psychosis. <b>Registration:</b> The study is prospectively registered in PROSPERO, the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42021260208).",HRB open research,2021,Nuala Murray; Sukainah Al Khalaf; David Kaulmann; Edgar Lonergan; John F Cryan; Gerard Clarke; Ali Khashan; Karen O'Connor
34032650,Psychobiotics: Evolution of Novel Antidepressants.,"The gut-brain axis is a bidirectional communication system which allows the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract to interact with and respond to each other rapidly and effectively. It is becoming increasingly clear that major players in this complex system are gut bacteria. The mechanisms of signal transmission from bacteria to the brain are complex and not fully elucidated, but include neural, endocrine, immune, and metabolic pathways. It was initially demonstrated in a rodent model of depression that the gut microbiota was altered. This observation has been replicated in patients with major depression who show decreased microbial diversity. Furthermore, when rodents receive a microbiota transplant from a depressed patient their behaviour alters, as does their tryptophan metabolism and immune status. Several studies of psychobiotics (bacteria with a potential mental health benefit) have been conducted in healthy populations and in patients with depression. While some psychobiotics have shown efficacy in treating depression, other bacteria have yielded negative findings. Larger-scale, well-designed studies are required. EU-funded guidelines recommend that patients with depression or vulnerability to depression should be encouraged to enhance a plant-based diet with a high content of grains/fibres, fermented foods, and fish. A significant impact of such a diet is likely mediated through the gut microbiota.",Modern trends in psychiatry,2021,Timothy G Dinan; Mary I Butler; John F Cryan
33407119,Alterations in the intestinal microbiome and mental health status of workers in an underground tunnel environment.,"Working in an underground tunnel environment is unavoidable in professions such as miners and tunnel workers, and there is a concern about the health of these workers. Few studies have addressed alterations in the intestinal microbiome of workers within that environment.Fecal samples were collected from the workers before they entered the tunnel (baseline status, BS) and after they left the tunnel (exposed status, ES), respectively (a time period of 3âweeks between them). We analyzed 16S rRNAÂ sequencing to show the changes in microbial composition and self-evaluation of mental health questionnaire was also performed. The results showed that Shannon and Simpson indices decreased significantly from BS to ES. A higher abundance was found in the phylum Actinobacteria, classes Actinobacteria and Deltaproteobacteria, orders Bifidobacteriales, Coriobacteriales, and Desulfovibrionales, families Bifidobacteriaceae, Peptostreptococcaceae, Coriobacteriaceae, Clostridiaceae_1, Desulfovibrionaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, and Microbacteriaceae, and genera Bifidobacterium, Romboutsia, Clostridium sensu stricto, and Leucobacter in ES, while BS showed greater levels of genera Faecalibacterium and Roseburia. The self-evaluation showed that at least one-half of the tunnel workers experienced one or more symptoms of mental distress (inattention, sleeplessness, loss of appetite, headache or dizziness, irritability) after working in the underground tunnel environment.Collectively, the underground tunnel environment led to alterations in the intestinal microbiome, which might be relevant to symptoms of mental distress in underground-tunnel workers.",BMC microbiology,2021,Zhen-Hua Lu; Yi-Wen Liu; Zhao-Hua Ji; Ting Fu; Min Yan; Zhong-Jun Shao; Yong Long
34480631,Microglial depletion and abnormalities in gut microbiota composition and short-chain fatty acids in mice after repeated administration of colony stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibitor PLX5622.,"PLX5622, a brain-penetrant highly specific inhibitor of the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), is used to eliminate microglia in the brain. Considering the role of microglia and gut microbiota in the brain homeostasis, this study was undertaken to investigate whether repeated intragastric administration of PLX5622 (65Â mg/kg/day for consecutive 7Â days) could affect the composition of gut microbiota and the concentration of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in fresh feces of adult mice. Repeated administration of PLX5622 caused significant reductions of the expression of genes and proteins for microglial markers in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus compared to control mice although the elimination of brain's microglia was partial. There was a significant alteration in the Î²-diversity of intestine microbiota in the PLX5622-treated group. Linear discriminant analysis effect size identified eight significant enriched bacteria as microbial markers for PLX5622-treated group. Repeated administration of PLX5622 affected the relative abundance of several bacteria at the genus and species levels. Furthermore, repeated administration of PLX5622 caused a significant change in lactic acid compared to control group. Interestingly, we found significant correlations between microglial markers in the brain and the relative abundance of several bacteria, suggesting microbiome-microglia crosstalk through the brain-gut axis. These data demonstrate that repeated administration of PLX5622 leads to an abnormal composition of the gut microbiota and lactic acid in adult mice. Therefore, abnormalities in the composition of gut microbiota after repeated treatment of PLX5622 should be considered for behavioral and biological functions in animals treated with CSF1R inhibitors.",European archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience,2022,Yong Yang; Tamaki Ishima; Xiayun Wan; Yan Wei; Lijia Chang; Jiancheng Zhang; Youge Qu; Kenji Hashimoto
34074025,MAIT Cells and Microbiota in Multiple Sclerosis and Other Autoimmune Diseases.,"The functions of mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells in homeostatic conditions include the interaction with the microbiota and its products, the protection of body barriers, and the mounting of a tissue-repair response to injuries or infections. Dysfunction of MAIT cells and dysbiosis occur in common chronic diseases of inflammatory, metabolic, and tumor nature. This review is aimed at analyzing the changes of MAIT cells, as well as of the microbiota, in multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune disorders. Common features of dysbiosis in these conditions are the reduced richness of microbial species and the unbalance between pro-inflammatory and immune regulatory components of the gut microbiota. The literature concerning MAIT cells in these disorders is rather complex, and sometimes not consistent. In multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune conditions, several studies have been done, or are in progress, to find correlations between intestinal permeability, dysbiosis, MAIT cell responses, and clinical biomarkers in treated and treatment-naÃ¯ve patients. The final aims are to explain what activates MAIT cells in diseases not primarily infective, which interactions with the microbiota are potentially pathogenic, and their dynamics related to disease course and disease-modifying treatments.",Microorganisms,2021,Rosella Mechelli; Silvia Romano; Carmela Romano; Emanuele Morena; Maria Chiara Buscarinu; Rachele Bigi; Gianmarco Bellucci; Roberta ReniÃ¨; Giulia Pellicciari; Marco Salvetti; Giovanni Ristori
33713734,Affective disorders impact prevalence of Flavonifractor and abundance of Christensenellaceae in gut microbiota.,"Background Affective disorders (AD) have been associated with a higher prevalence of the gut Flavonifractor genus and a lower abundance of the gut Christensenellaceae family. Objective and methods By pooling two independent study samples of patients with AD (nÂ =Â 176), their unaffected first-degree relatives (nÂ =Â 70) and healthy controls (nÂ =Â 101) we aimed to replicate and extend our prior findings of differential Flavonifractor prevalence and Christensenellaceae abundance when comparing patients with AD and healthy controls. The gut microbiota was profiled using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Results The pattern of higher prevalence of Flavonifractor and lower Centered Log-Ratio (CLR) abundance of Christensenellaceae was associated with AD. In generalized linear models the CLR abundance of Christensenellaceae was lower in patients with AD (pÂ =Â 0.024), and in smokers (pÂ =Â 1.9*10<sup>-4</sup>), and inversely associated with increasing waist circumference (pÂ =Â 0.031). The prevalence of Flavonifractor was higher in patients with AD (pÂ =Â 0.033) and in smokers (pÂ =Â 0.036). No impact of psychotropic medication was found. The CLR abundance of Christensenellaceae (pÂ =Â 0.041), but not the prevalence of Flavonifractor (pÂ =Â 0.20) could distinguish non-smoking patients with AD from non-smoking healthy controls, whereas no such associations were found in smokers. Unaffected relatives neither differed from patients with AD nor from healthy controls. Conclusion Compared with findings in healthy controls, AD was associated with a significantly lower CLR abundance of the health-linked Christensenellaceae and a significantly higher prevalence of Flavonifractor; findings that are associated with enhanced oxidative stress and systemic low-grade inflammation. If our observations are validated in future independent studies, they support the notion that parts of aberrant gut microbiota are shared by AD and states of dysmetabolism.",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,2021,Klara Coello; Tue Haldor Hansen; Nikolaj SÃ¸rensen; Ninja Meinhard Ottesen; Kamilla Woznica Miskowiak; Oluf Pedersen; Lars Vedel Kessing; Maj Vinberg
34357554,Immune-microbiome interplay and its implications in neurodegenerative disorders.,"The neurodegeneration and its related CNS pathologies need an urgent toolbox to minimize the global mental health burden. The neuroimmune system critically regulates the brain maturation and survival of neurons across the nervous system. The chronic manipulated immunological drive can accelerate the neuronal pathology hence promoting the burden of neurodegenerative disorders. The gut is home for trillions of microorganisms having a mutual relationship with the host system. The gut-brain axis is a unique biochemical pathway through which the gut residing microbes connects with the brain cells and regulates various physiological and pathological cascades. The gut microbiota and CNS communicate using a common language that synchronizes the tuning of immune cells. The intestinal gut microbial community has a profound role in the maturation of the immune system as well as the development of the nervous system. We have critically summarised the clinical and preclinical reports from the past a decade emphasising that the significant changes in gut microbiota can enhance the host susceptibility towards neurodegenerative disorders. In this review, weÂ have discussed how the gut microbiota-mediated immune response inclines the host physiology towards neurodegeneration and indicated the gut microbiota as a potential future candidate for the management of neurodegenerative disorders.",Metabolic brain disease,2022,Ankit Uniyal; Vineeta Tiwari; Mousmi Rani; Vinod Tiwari
33252574,Understanding the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.,"Schizophrenia is a chronic mental disorder with marked symptoms of hallucination, delusion, and impaired cognitive behaviors. Although multidimensional factors have been associated with the development of schizophrenia, the principal cause of the disorder remains debatable. Microbiome involvement in the etiology of schizophrenia has been widely researched due to the advancement in sequencing technologies. This review describes the contribution of the gut microbiome in the development of schizophrenia that is facilitated by the gut-brain axis. The gut microbiota is connected to the gut-brain axis via several pathways and mechanisms, that are discussed in this review. The role of the oral microbiota, probiotics and prebiotics in shaping the gut microbiota are also highlighted. Lastly, future perspectives for microbiome research in schizophrenia are addressed.",Psychiatric genetics,2021,Mahin Ghorbani; Heera Rajandas; Sivachandran Parimannan; Gerard Benedict Stephen Joseph; Mei Mei Tew; Siti Salwa Ramly; Muhammad Arif Muhamad Rasat; Su Yin Lee
33454868,Gut microbiota homeostasis restoration may become a novel therapy for breast cancer.,"Breast cancer is the most diagnosed cancer in women. It significantly impairs a patient's physical and mental health. Gut microbiota comprise the bacteria residing in a host's gastrointestinal tract. Through studies over the last decade, we now know that alterations in the composition of the gut microbiome are associated with protection against colonization by pathogens and other diseases, such as diabetes and cancer. This review focuses on how gut microbiota can affect breast cancer development through estrogen activity and discusses the types of bacteria that may be involved in the onset and the progression of breast cancer. We also describe potential therapies to curtail the risk of breast cancer by restoring gut microbiota homeostasis and reducing systemic estrogen levels. This review will further explore the relationship between intestinal microbes and breast cancer and propose a method to treat breast cancer by improving intestinal microbes. We aimed at discovering new methods to prevent or treat BC by changing intestinal microorganisms.",Investigational new drugs,2021,Zhi-Peng Feng; Hong-Yi Xin; Ze-Wei Zhang; Chen-Guang Liu; Zheng Yang; Hua You; Hong-Wu Xin
33487078,Nutrition-based interventions for mood disorders.,"<b>Introduction</b>: 'Nutritional Psychiatry' is an emerging area of research that has great potential as an adjunctive tool for the prevention and treatment of diverse neuropsychiatric disorders. Several nutrition-related aspects, such as obesity, dietary patterns, gut microbiome composition and gut permeability, bioactive food compounds, and nutrients can influence pathways implicated in the pathophysiology of mood disorders.<b>Areas covered</b>: Here, the authors review the current evidence on nutrition-mood interaction and nutrition-based treatments for the two main mood disorders, i.e., major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder.<b>Expert opinion</b>: Consistent evidence from observational studies has pointed out the association between a 'healthy' diet, generally characterized by a higher intake of fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, whole grains, and good quality sources of protein (i.e. fish and/or seafood), and decreased risk of mood disorders and the parallel association between a 'Western' diet pattern and increased risk. However, only a few clinical trials have evaluated the effect of nutritional interventions on the treatment of these conditions. The bidirectional interaction between the brain and the gut, named 'brain-gut-microbiome axis' or 'gut-brain axis', plays a key role in the link between nutrition and mood disorders. Therefore, nutrition-based strategies for gut microbiota modulation are promising fields in mood disorders.",Expert review of neurotherapeutics,2021,Lais B Martins; Jenneffer Rayane Braga TibÃ£es; Marsal Sanches; Felice Jacka; Michael Berk; AntÃ´nio L Teixeira
34830610,Targeting the Gut Microbiome in Prader-Willi Syndrome.,"Overwhelming evidence demonstrates an important role of the gut microbiome in the development of a wide range of diseases, including obesity, metabolic disorders, and mental health symptoms. Indeed, interventions targeting the gut microbiome are being actively investigated as a therapeutic strategy to tackle these diseases. Given that obesity and mental health symptoms are both hallmarks of Prader-Willi syndrome, targeting the gut microbiome may be a promising therapeutical strategy. Only a few studies have investigated the gut microbiome in the context of Prader-Willi syndrome and assessed the efficacy of probiotic supplementation as a therapeutic strategy for this disease. Here, we review the knowledge obtained to this date regarding the gut microbiome in individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome. The limited evidence available indicate that probiotic supplementation improves some metabolic and mental health aspects, however further studies are warranted to determine whether targeting the gut microbiome may constitute a safe and efficient strategy to treat individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome.",Journal of clinical medicine,2021,Marta Ramon-Krauel; Montse Amat-Bou; Mercedes Serrano; Antonio F Martinez-Monseny; Carles Lerin
34338703,Co-supplementation of camelina oil and a prebiotic is more effective for in improving cardiometabolic risk factors and mental health in patients with NAFLD: a randomized clinical trial.,"This trial evaluated the effects of co-supplementing <i>Camelina sativa</i> oil (CSO) and a prebiotic as modulators of the gut microbiota on cardiometabolic risk factors and mental health in NAFLD patients. In all, 44 subjects with NAFLD were allocated to either an intervention (20 g d<sup>-1</sup> CSO + resistant dextrin) or a placebo (20 g d<sup>-1</sup> CSO + maltodextrin) group and received a calorie-restricted diet (-500 kcal d<sup>-1</sup>) for 12 weeks. Fasting plasma levels of gucose, insulin, hs-CRP, endotoxin, antioxidant enzyme activity, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), malondialdehyde (MDA), 8-iso-prostaglandin F2Î±, and uric acid were measured at the baseline and post-intervention. The depression, anxiety and stress scale (DASS) and the general health questionnaire (GHQ) were used to assess mental health. Co-supplementing CSO and resistant dextrin significantly decreased the level of insulin concentration (-0.84 Î¼U ml<sup>-1</sup>, <i>p</i> = 0.011), HOMA-IR (-0.27, <i>p</i> = 0.021), hs-CRP (-1.25 pg ml<sup>-1</sup>, <i>p</i> = 0.023), endotoxin (-3.70 EU mL<sup>-1</sup>, <i>p</i> = 0.001), cortisol (-2.43, <i>p</i> = 0.033), GHQ (-5.03, <i>p</i> = 0.035), DASS (-9.01, <i>p</i> = 0.024), and MDA (-0.54 nmol mL<sup>-1</sup>, <i>p</i> = 0.021) and increased the levels of TAC (0.16 mmol L<sup>-1</sup>, <i>p</i> = 0.032) and superoxide dismutase (106.32 U g<sup>-1</sup> Hb, <i>p</i> = 0.45) in the intervention group compared with the placebo group. No significant changes were observed in the levels of other biomarkers.

The multifactorial pathogenesis of obesity partly explains the important challenge posed to health policy regarding its clinical treatment, with increasing evidences have shown that obesity and metabolic disturbances are closely linked to variations in gut microbiota (GM) function and composition. Indeed, GM play a key contribution in energy metabolism, with GM modulation being increasingly linked to changes in body weight and body mass index. In such matter, probiotics have been proposed as a promising new therapeutic strategy to treat/prevent obesity.

31685046,Shotgun metagenomics reveals both taxonomic and tryptophan pathway differences of gut microbiota in major depressive disorder patients.,"The microbiota-gut-brain axis, especially the microbial tryptophan (Trp) biosynthesis and metabolism pathway (MiTBamp), may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder (MDD). However, studies on the MiTBamp in MDD are lacking. The aim of the present study was to analyze the gut microbiota composition and the MiTBamp in MDD patients.We performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing of stool samples from 26 MDD patients and 29 healthy controls (HCs). In addition to the microbiota community and the MiTBamp analyses, we also built a classification based on the Random Forests (RF) and Boruta algorithm to identify the gut microbiota as biomarkers for MDD.The Bacteroidetes abundance was strongly reduced whereas that of Actinobacteria was significantly increased in the MDD patients compared with the abundance in the HCs. Most noteworthy, the MDD patients had increased levels of Bifidobacterium, which is commonly used as a probiotic. Four Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) orthologies (KOs) (K01817, K11358, K01626, K01667) abundances in the MiTBamp were significantly lower in the MDD group. Furthermore, we found a negative correlation between the K01626 abundance and the HAMD scores in the MDD group. Finally, RF classification at the genus level can achieve an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.890.The present findings enabled a better understanding of the changes in gut microbiota and the related Trp pathway in MDD.

33920695,Neurobiological Processes Induced by Aerobic Exercise through the Endocannabinoidome.,"Evidence suggesting the triangulation of the endocannabinoid system, exercise, and neurological health is emerging. In addition to the endocannabinoids <i>N</i>-arachidonoylethanolamine (anandamide; AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), the expanded endocannabinoid system, known as the endocannabinoidome (eCBome), appears to be an important player in this relationship. The eCBome includes several endocannabinoid-like mediators such as <i>N</i>-acylethanolamines and 2-monoacylglycerols, the enzymes involved in their biosynthesis and degradation, and the receptors they affect. This review aims to relate the functional interactions between aerobic exercise, and the molecular and cellular pathways related to endocannabinoids, in the hypothalamus, hippocampus, and the periphery, with special attention given to associations with emotional state, cognition, and mental health. Given the well-documented roles of many eCBome members in regulating stress and neurological processes, we posit that the eCBome is an important effector of exercise-induced central and peripheral adaptive mechanisms that benefit mental health. Gut microbiota imbalance, affecting the gut-brain axis and metabolism, also influences certain eCBome-modulated inflammation pathways. The integrity of the gut microbiota could thus be crucial in the onset of neuroinflammation and mental conditions. Further studies on how the modulation by exercise of the peripheral eCBome affects brain functions could reveal to be key elements in the prevention and treatment of neuropsychological disorders.",Cells,2021,Fabiola Forteza; Giada Giorgini; FrÃ©dÃ©ric Raymond
34691318,Microbial Therapeutics in Neurocognitive and Psychiatric Disorders.,"Microbial therapeutics, which include gut biotics and fecal transplantation, are interventions designed to improve the gut microbiome. Gut biotics can be considered as the administration of direct microbial populations. The delivery of this can be done through live microbial flora, certain food like fiber, microbial products (metabolites and elements) obtained through the fermentation of food products, or as genetically engineered substances, that may have therapeutic benefit on different health disorders. Dietary intervention and pharmacological supplements with gut biotics aim at correcting disruption of the gut microbiota by repopulating with beneficial microorganism leading to decrease in gut permeability, inflammation, and alteration in metabolic activities, through a variety of mechanisms of action. Our understanding of the pharmacokinetics of microbial therapeutics has improved with <i>in vitro</i> models, sampling techniques in the gut, and tools for the reliable identification of gut biotics. Evidence from human studies points out that prebiotics, probiotics and synbiotics have the potential for treating and preventing mental health disorders, whereas with paraprobiotics, proteobiotics and postbiotics, the research is limited at this point. Some animal studies point out that gut biotics can be used with conventional treatments for a synergistic effect on mental health disorders. If future research shows that there is a possibility of synergistic effect of psychotropic medications with gut biotics, then a gut biotic or nutritional prescription can be given along with psychotropics. Even though the overall safety of gut biotics seems to be good, caution is needed to watch for any known and unknown side effects as well as the need for risk benefit analysis with certain vulnerable populations. Future research is needed before wide spread use of natural and genetically engineered gut biotics. Regulatory framework for gut biotics needs to be optimized. Holistic understanding of gut dysbiosis, along with life style factors, by health care providers is necessary for the better management of these conditions. In conclusion, microbial therapeutics are a new psychotherapeutic approach which offer some hope in certain conditions like dementia and depression. Future of microbial therapeutics will be driven by well-done randomized controlled trials and longitudinal research, as well as by replication studies in human subjects.",Journal of clinical medicine research,2021,Kannayiram Alagiakrishnan; Tyler Halverson
33967849,"Effectiveness of Probiotic, Prebiotic, and Synbiotic Supplementation to Improve Perinatal Mental Health in Mothers: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.","<b>Introduction:</b> There is an emerging interest in modulating the gut microbiota to target the gut-brain axis and improve maternal mental health in the perinatal period. This systematic review evaluated the effectiveness of prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics supplementation during pregnancy to reduce the risk of maternal mental health problems in the perinatal period. <b>Methods:</b> Electronic biomedical databases and clinical trial registries were searched from database inception through August 2020 to identify randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating the effect of probiotic, prebiotic, or synbiotic supplements administered to women during pregnancy on measures of perinatal depression, anxiety, and other mental health outcomes. Study selection, risk of bias appraisal, and data extraction were independently performed by two reviewers. Pooled mean differences (MD) and odds ratios (pOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated in random-effects meta-analyses for the outcomes of interest in the review. <b>Results:</b> From 3,868 studies identified through the search strategy, three RCTs of low risk of bias involving 713 participants were included, all three testing probiotics. There were no differences between probiotics and control groups in the mean depression scores (MD -0.46; 95% CI -2.16, 1.25) at end of follow-up. Although statistical significance was not achieved, probiotics showed an advantage in the proportion of participants scoring below an established cut-off for depression (pOR 0.68; 95% CI 0.43, 1.07). Compared to placebo, probiotics in pregnancy reduced anxiety symptoms (MD -0.99; 95% CI -1.80, -0.18); however, this advantage was not translated in a reduction in the proportion of participants scoring above an established cut-off for anxiety (pOR 0.65; 95% CI 0.23, 1.85). There were no differences between probiotics and control groups in global mental health scores at end of follow-up (MD 1.09; 95% CI -2.04, 4.22). <b>Conclusion:</b> There is limited but promising evidence about the effectiveness of probiotics during pregnancy to reduce anxiety symptoms and reduce the proportion of women scoring ABOVE a cut-off depression score. There is a lack of RCT evidence supporting prebiotics and synbiotics supplementation for similar purposes in the perinatal period. More research is needed before prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics are recommended to support maternal mental health and well-being in the perinatal period. <b>Systematic Review Registration:</b> PROSPERO, CRD42019137158.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2021,Vidhi Desai; Anita L Kozyrskyj; Stuart Lau; Omolara Sanni; Liz Dennett; Jens Walter; Maria B Ospina
34603341,Consumption of Butylated Starch Alleviates the Chronic Restraint Stress-Induced Neurobehavioral and Gut Barrier Deficits Through Reshaping the Gut Microbiota.,"The beneficial effect of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) on host health has been well recognized based on the booming knowledge from gut microbiome research. The role of SCFA in influencing psychological function is highlighted in recent years but has not been fully elucidated. In this study, the SCFA-acylated starches were used to accomplish a sizeable intestine-targeted release of the SCFAs, and the neurobehavioral, immunological, and microbial effects were further investigated. Acetylated-, butylated-, and isobutylated-starch could attenuate the depression-like behaviors and excessive corticosterone production in chronically stressed mice.

34970638,CUMS and dexamethasone induce depression-like phenotypes in mice by differentially altering gut microbiota and triggering macroglia activation.,"Although the link between gut microbiota and depression has been suggested, changes of gut microbiota vary largely among individuals with depression.Explore the heterogeneity of microbiota-gut-brain axis and new pathogenic characteristics in murine models of depression.Adolescent female mice were randomly divided into control (CON) group (n=10), chronic unexpected mild stress (CUMS) group (n=15) and dexamethasone (DEX) group (n=15). Mice in the DEX group were gavaged twice a day with 0.2âmg/kg of DEX for 5 weeks, whereas CON mice were given the same amount of solvent. Mice in the CUMS group were exposed to stressors. After behavioural evaluations, all mice were sacrificed for harvesting tissues and blood samples. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was conducted for measuring levels of corticosterone (CORT) and interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²) in sera, whereas levels of protein expression in colon and hippocampal tissues were examined by western blot. Faecal microbial communities were analysed by sequencing 16S rDNAs.Mice in CUMS and DEX groups exhibited severe depression-like behaviours. Compared with CON mice, CUMS-exposed mice showed a significant increase in both Î± and Î² diversity. Prevotellaceae and Desulfovibrio were enriched, whereas Bacilli were decreased in the faeces of mice in the CUMS group. DEX-treated mice had a decrease in the abundance of <i>Clostridium XVIII</i>. Levels of occludin in colon tissue of DEX-treated mice were reduced. Relative to mice in the CON and CUMS groups, DEX-treated mice contained higher serum levels of CORT and IL-1Î². Compared with CON mice, mice in the DEX and CUMS groups had higher levels of IL-1Î² in sera and lower levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), Nestin, Synapsin-1 and P2Y12 receptor in the hippocampus.Changes of gut microbiota diversity, intestinal integrity and neuroinflammation in the brain contribute to CUMS-induced depression, whereas pathobionts and excessive immunosuppression with damaged neuronal synapses is a basis of the DEX-induced depression.",General psychiatry,2021,Jing Wu; Jinhang Li; Chhetri Gaurav; Usman Muhammad; Yantian Chen; Xueyi Li; Jinghong Chen; Zejian Wang
34238926,Gut microbiota signature in treatment-naÃ¯ve attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.,"Compelling evidence supports alterations in gut microbial diversity, bacterial composition, and/or relative abundance of several bacterial taxa in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, findings for ADHD are inconsistent among studies, and specific gut microbiome signatures for the disorder remain unknown. Given that previous studies have mainly focused on the pediatric form of the disorder and involved small sample sizes, we conducted the largest study to date to compare the gastrointestinal microbiome composition in 100 medication-naÃ¯ve adults with ADHD and 100 sex-matched healthy controls. We found evidence that ADHD subjects have differences in the relative abundance of several microbial taxa. At the family level, our data support a lower relative abundance of Gracilibacteraceae and higher levels of Selenomonadaceae and Veillonellaceae in adults with ADHD. In addition, the ADHD group showed higher levels of Dialister and Megamonas and lower abundance of Anaerotaenia and Gracilibacter at the genus level. All four selected genera explained 15% of the variance of ADHD, and this microbial signature achieved an overall sensitivity of 74% and a specificity of 71% for distinguishing between ADHD patients and healthy controls. We also tested whether the selected genera correlate with age, body mass index (BMI), or scores of the ADHD rating scale but found no evidence of correlation between genera relative abundance and any of the selected traits. These results are in line with recent studies supporting gut microbiome alterations in neurodevelopment disorders, but further studies are needed to elucidate the role of the gut microbiota on the ADHD across the lifespan and its contribution to the persistence of the disorder from childhood to adulthood.",Translational psychiatry,2021,Vanesa Richarte; Cristina SÃ¡nchez-Mora; Montserrat Corrales; Christian Fadeuilhe; Laura Vilar-RibÃ³; Lorena Arribas; Estela Garcia; Silvia Karina Rosales-Ortiz; Alejandro Arias-Vasquez; MarÃ­a Soler-Artigas; Marta RibasÃ©s; Josep Antoni Ramos-Quiroga

Accumulated evidence has shown that, in their adaptation to a flight-based lifestyle, remodeling of the gut microbiota in bats may have contributed to immune tolerance to viruses. This evidence from bats provides profound insights into the potential influence of gut microbiota in COVID-19 disease in humans. Here, we highlight recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms by which the gut microbiota helps bats tolerate deadly viruses, and summarize the current clinical evidence on the influence of gut microbiota on the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and risk of COVID-19 leading to a fatal outcome. In addition, we discuss the implications of gut microbiota-targeted approaches for preventing infection and reducing disease severity in COVID-19 patients.",Science China.

However, the best therapeutic schedule and related mechanism on CCRA were still uncertain. Studies on blood enrichment and anti-tumor effects of combined Danggui Buxue Decoction (DBD), Fe and rhEPO based on CCRA and gut microbiota modulation were conducted in this paper. Here, CCRA model was successfully induced by subcutaneous inoculation of CT-26 and i.p. oxaliplatin, rhEPO + DBD high dosage + Fe (EDF) and rhEPO + DBD high dosage (ED) groups had the best blood enrichment effect. Attractively, EDF group also showed antitumor activity. The sequencing results of gut microbiota showed that compared to P group, the relative abundances of Lachnospiraceae and opportunistic pathogen (Odoribacter) in ED and EDF groups were decreased. Interestingly, EDF also decreased the relative abundances of cancer-related bacteria (Helicobacter, Lactococcus, Alloprevotella) and imbalance-inducing bacteria (Escherichia-Shigella and Parabacteroides) and increased the relative abundances of butyrate-producing bacteria (Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014), however, ED showed the opposite effects to EDF, this might be the reason of the smaller tumor volume in EDF group. Our findings proposed the best treatment combination of DBD, rhEPO and Fe in CCRA and provided theoretical basis and literature reference for CCRA-induced intestinal flora disorder and the regulatory mechanism of EDF.",Chinese journal of natural medicines,2021,Xu-Qin Shi; Zhen-Hua Zhu; Shi-Jun Yue; Yu-Ping Tang; Yan-Yan Chen; Zong-Jin Pu; Hui-Juan Tao; Gui-Sheng Zhou; Jin-Ao Duan
34280457,Stress gets into the belly: Early life stress and the gut microbiome.,"Research has established that stress ""gets under the skin,"" impacting neuroendocrine and neuroimmune pathways to influence risk for physical and mental health outcomes. These effects can be particularly significant for early life stress (ELS), or adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). In this review, we explore whether stress gets ""into the belly,"" that is, whether psychosocial stress affects the gut microbiome. We review animal and human research utilizing a variety of stress paradigms (acute laboratory stressors, chronic stress, stressful life events, perceived stress, ELS, in utero stress) and their impacts on the gut microbiota, with a particular focus on ELS. We also review data on dietary interventions to moderate impact of stress on the gut microbiome. Our review suggests strong evidence that acute laboratory stress, chronic stress, and ELS affect the gut microbiota in rodents, and growing evidence that perceived stress and ELS may impact the gut microbiota in humans. Emerging data also suggests, particularly in rodents, that dietary interventions such as omega-3 fatty acids and pre- and pro-biotics may buffer against the effects of stress on the gut microbiome, but more research is needed. In sum, growing evidence suggests that stress impacts not only the neuroendocrine and neuroimmune axes, but also the microbiota-gut-brain-axis, providing a pathway by which stress may get ""into the belly"" to influence health risk.",Behavioural brain research,2021,Liisa Hantsoo; Babette S Zemel

34174901,Beyond the lesion site: minocycline augments inflammation and anxiety-like behavior following SCI in rats through action on the gut microbiota.,"Minocycline is a clinically available synthetic tetracycline derivative with anti-inflammatory and antibiotic properties. The majority of studies show that minocycline can reduce tissue damage and improve functional recovery following central nervous system injuries, mainly attributed to the drug's direct anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and neuroprotective properties. Surprisingly the consequences of minocycline's antibiotic (i.e., antibacterial) effects on the gut microbiota and systemic immune response after spinal cord injury have largely been ignored despite their links to changes in mental health and immune suppression.Here, we sought to determine minocycline's effect on spinal cord injury-induced changes in the microbiota-immune axis using a cervical contusion injury in female Lewis rats. We investigated a group that received minocycline following spinal cord injury (immediately after injury for 7âdays), an untreated spinal cord injury group, an untreated uninjured group, and an uninjured group that received minocycline. Plasma levels of cytokines/chemokines and fecal microbiota composition (using 16s rRNA sequencing) were monitored for 4âweeks following spinal cord injury as measures of the microbiota-immune axis. Additionally, motor recovery and anxiety-like behavior were assessed throughout the study, and microglial activation was analyzed immediately rostral to, caudal to, and at the lesion epicenter.We found that minocycline had a profound acute effect on the microbiota diversity and composition, which was paralleled by the subsequent normalization of spinal cord injury-induced suppression of cytokines/chemokines. Importantly, gut dysbiosis following spinal cord injury has been linked to the development of anxiety-like behavior, which was also decreased by minocycline. Furthermore, although minocycline attenuated spinal cord injury-induced microglial activation, it did not affect the lesion size or promote measurable motor recovery.We show that minocycline's microbiota effects precede its long-term effects on systemic cytokines and chemokines following spinal cord injury. These results provide an exciting new target of minocycline as a therapeutic for central nervous system diseases and injuries.",Journal of neuroinflammation,2021,Emma K A Schmidt; Pamela J F Raposo; Abel Torres-Espin; Keith K Fenrich; Karim Fouad
34277527,Towards Tailored Gut Microbiome-Based and Dietary Interventions for Promoting the Development and Maintenance of a Healthy Brain.,"Mental health is determined by a complex interplay between the Neurological Exposome and the Human Genome. Multiple genetic and non-genetic (exposome) factors interact early in life, modulating the risk of developing the most common complex neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), with potential long-term consequences on health. To date, the understating of the precise etiology underpinning these neurological alterations, and their clinical management pose a challenge. The crucial role played by diet and gut microbiota in brain development and functioning would indicate that modulating the gut-brain axis may help protect against the onset and progression of mental-health disorders. Some nutritional deficiencies and gut microbiota alterations have been linked to NDDs, suggesting their potential pathogenic implications. In addition, certain dietary interventions have emerged as promising alternatives or adjuvant strategies for improving the management of particular NDDs, at least in particular subsets of subjects. The gut microbiota can be a key to mediating the effects of other exposome factors such as diet on mental health, and ongoing research in Psychiatry and Neuropediatrics is developing Precision Nutrition Models to classify subjects according to a diet response prediction based on specific individual features, including microbiome signatures. Here, we review current scientific evidence for the impact of early life environmental factors, including diet, on gut microbiota and neuro-development, emphasizing the potential long-term consequences on health; and also summarize the state of the art regarding the mechanisms underlying diet and gut microbiota influence on the brain-gut axis. Furthermore, we describe the evidence supporting the key role played by gut microbiota, diet and nutrition in neurodevelopment, as well as the effectiveness of certain dietary and microbiome-based interventions aimed at preventing or treating NDDs. Finally, we emphasize the need for further research to gain greater insight into the complex interplay between diet, gut microbiome and brain development.

31859119,"Infections, antibiotic treatment and the Microbiome in relation to schizophrenia.","Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder with several potential pathophysiological mechanisms, including immune activation. Infections have been identified as a significant contributing risk factor for schizophrenia; this association is reviewed together with the potential impact of antibiotic treatment and alterations of the intestinal microbiota. Both infections and the treatment with antibiotics may alter the composition of the gut microbiota, causing dysbiosis, which in animal studies has been associated with alterations of behavior. Of the few studies that have been conducted on humans, some have suggested alterations in the microbial composition of individuals with schizophrenia compared to healthy controls, albeit with conflicting results. Recently, increased attention has emerged regarding potential adverse effects from antibiotics, as a number of these have been associated with an increased risk of psychotic episodes. Particularly, the fluoroquinolones have been associated with neurotoxic adverse events. The association between schizophrenia and infections, antibiotic treatment and dysbiosis, may be an epiphenomenon, which could be explained by other confounding factors. However, these associations could be causal and could therefore be important risk factors in a subgroup of patients. Large-scale well-matched longitudinal studies are needed with measurements of immune markers from multiple biological samples, ranging from material close to the brain, as cerebrospinal fluid and brain-scans targeting neuroinflammation, to analysis of blood and intestinal microbiota. This would help to obtain more definite results on the association between infections, immune components and microbiota alterations in relation to schizophrenia.",Schizophrenia research,2021,Amalie W Klein-Petersen; Ole KÃ¶hler-Forsberg; Michael E Benros
34650506,The Relationship Between the Gut Microbiome-Immune System-Brain Axis and Major Depressive Disorder.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prominent cause of disability worldwide. Current antidepressant drugs produce full remission in only about one-third of MDD patients and there are no biomarkers to guide physicians in selecting the best treatment for individuals. There is an urgency to learn more about the etiology of MDD and to identify new targets that will lead to improved therapy and hopefully aid in predicting and preventing MDD. There has been extensive interest in the roles of the immune system and the gut microbiome in MDD and in how these systems interact. Gut microbes can contribute to the nature of immune responses, and a chronic inflammatory state may lead to increased responsiveness to stress and to development of MDD. The gut microbiome-immune system-brain axis is bidirectional, is sensitive to stress and is important in development of stress-related disorders such as MDD. Communication between the gut and brain involves the enteric nervous system (ENS), the autonomic nervous system (ANS), neuroendocrine signaling systems and the immune system, and all of these can interact with the gut microbiota. Preclinical studies and preliminary clinical investigations have reported improved mood with administration of probiotics and prebiotics, but large, carefully controlled clinical trials are now necessary to evaluate their effectiveness in treating MDD. The roles that several gut microbe-derived molecules such as neurotransmitters, short chain fatty acids and tryptophan play in MDD are reviewed briefly. Challenges and potential future directions associated with studying this important axis as it relates to MDD are discussed.",Frontiers in neurology,2021,Jane A Foster; Glen B Baker; Serdar M Dursun
35185631,The Gut-Brain-Immune Axis in Autism Spectrum Disorders: A State-of-Art Report.,"The interest elicited by the large microbial population colonizing the human gut has ancient origins and has gone through a long evolution during history. However, it is only in the last decades that the introduction of high-throughput technologies has allowed to broaden this research field and to disentangle the numerous implications that gut microbiota has in health and disease. This comprehensive ecosystem, constituted mainly by bacteria but also by fungi, parasites, and viruses, is proven to be involved in several physiological and pathological processes that transcend the intestinal homeostasis and are deeply intertwined with apparently unrelated body systems, such as the immune and the nervous ones. In this regard, a novel speculation is the relationship between the intestinal microbial flora and the pathogenesis of some neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders, including the clinical entities defined under the umbrella term of autism spectrum disorders. The bidirectional interplay has led researchers to coin the term gut-brain-immune system axis, subverting the theory of the brain as an immune-privileged site and underscoring the importance of this reciprocal influence already from fetal life and especially during the pre- and post-natal neurodevelopmental process. This revolutionary theory has also unveiled the possibility to modify the gut microbiota as a way to treat and even to prevent different kinds of pathologies. In this sense, some attempts have been made, ranging from probiotic administration to fecal microbiota transplantation, with promising results that need further elaboration. This state-of-art report will describe the main aspects regarding the human gut microbiome and its specific role in the pathogenesis of autism and its related disorders, with a final discussion on the therapeutic and preventive strategies aiming at creating a healthy intestinal microbial environment, as well as their safety and ethical implications.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2021,Chiara Puricelli; Roberta Rolla; Luca Gigliotti; Elena Boggio; Eleonora Beltrami; Umberto Dianzani; Roberto Keller
34835436,The Potential Utility of Prebiotics to Modulate Alzheimer's Disease: A Review of the Evidence.,"The gut microbiome has recently emerged as a critical modulator of brain function, with the so-called gut-brain axis having multiple links with a variety of neurodegenerative and mental health conditions, including Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Various approaches for modulating the gut microbiome toward compositional and functional states that are consistent with improved cognitive health outcomes have been documented, including probiotics and prebiotics. While probiotics are live microorganisms that directly confer beneficial health effects, prebiotics are oligosaccharide and polysaccharide structures that can beneficially modulate the gut microbiome by enhancing the growth, survival, and/or function of gut microbes that in turn have beneficial effects on the human host. In this review, we discuss evidence showing the potential link between gut microbiome composition and AD onset or development, provide an overview of prebiotic types and their roles in altering gut microbial composition, discuss the effectiveness of prebiotics in regulating gut microbiome composition and microbially derived metabolites, and discuss the current evidence linking prebiotics with health outcomes related to AD in both animal models and human trials. Though there is a paucity of human clinical trials demonstrating the effectiveness of prebiotics in altering gut microbiome-mediated health outcomes in AD, current evidence highlights the potential of various prebiotic approaches for beneficially altering the gut microbiota or gut physiology by promoting the production of butyrate, indoles, and secondary bile acid profiles that further regulate gut immunity and mucosal homeostasis, which are associated with beneficial effects on the central immune system and brain functionality.",Microorganisms,2021,Jea Woo Kang; Angela M Zivkovic
34014031,Impaired blood-brain barrier in the microbiota-gut-brain axis: Potential role of bipolar susceptibility gene TRANK1.,"Bipolar disorder (BD) is a common psychiatric illness with high prevalence and disease burden. Accumulating susceptibility genes for BD have been identified in recent years. However, the exact functions of these genes remain largely unknown. Despite its high heritability, gene and environment interaction is commonly accepted as the major contributing factor to BD pathogenesis. Intestine microbiota is increasingly recognized as a critical environmental factor for human health and diseases via the microbiota-gut-brain axis. BD individuals showed altered diversity and compositions in the commensal microbiota. In addition to pro-inflammatory factors, such as interleukin-6 and tumour necrosis factor-Î±, type 1 interferon signalling pathway is also modulated by specific intestinal bacterial strains. Disruption of the microbiota-gut-brain axis contributes to peripheral and central nervous system inflammation, which accounts for the BD aetiology. Administration of type 1 interferon can induce the expression of TRANK1, which is associated with elevated circulating biomarkers of the impaired blood-brain barrier in BD patients. In this review, we focus on the influence of intestine microbiota on the expression of bipolar gene TRANK1 and propose that intestine microbiota-dependent type 1 interferon signalling is sufficient to induce the over-expression of TRANK1, consequently causing the compromise of BBB integrity and facilitating the entrance of inflammatory mediators into the brain. Activated neuroinflammation eventually contributes to the occurrence and development of BD. This review provides a new perspective on how gut microbiota participate in the pathogenesis of BD. Future studies are needed to validate these assumptions and develop new treatment targets for BD.",Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,2021,Jianbo Lai; Jiajun Jiang; Peifen Zhang; Caixi Xi; Lingling Wu; Xingle Gao; Yaoyang Fu; Danhua Zhang; Yiqing Chen; Huimin Huang; Yiyi Zhu; Shaohua Hu
33467657,Mechanisms Underlying the Cognitive and Behavioural Effects of Maternal Obesity.,"The widespread consumption of 'western'-style diets along with sedentary lifestyles has led to a global epidemic of obesity. Epidemiological, clinical and preclinical evidence suggests that maternal obesity, overnutrition and unhealthy dietary patterns programs have lasting adverse effects on the physical and mental health of offspring. We review currently available preclinical and clinical evidence and summarise possible underlying neurobiological mechanisms by which maternal overnutrition may perturb offspring cognitive function, affective state and psychosocial behaviour, with a focus on (1) neuroinflammation; (2) disrupted neuronal circuities and connectivity; and (3) dysregulated brain hormones. We briefly summarise research implicating the gut microbiota in maternal obesity-induced changes to offspring behaviour. In animal models, maternal obesogenic diet consumption disrupts CNS homeostasis in offspring, which is critical for healthy neurodevelopment, by altering hypothalamic and hippocampal development and recruitment of glial cells, which subsequently dysregulates dopaminergic and serotonergic systems. The adverse effects of maternal obesogenic diets are also conferred through changes to hormones including leptin, insulin and oxytocin which interact with these brain regions and neuronal circuits. Furthermore, accumulating evidence suggests that the gut microbiome may directly and indirectly contribute to these maternal diet effects in both human and animal studies. As the specific pathways shaping abnormal behaviour in offspring in the context of maternal obesogenic diet exposure remain unknown, further investigations are needed to address this knowledge gap. Use of animal models permits investigation of changes in neuroinflammation, neurotransmitter activity and hormones across global brain network and sex differences, which could be directly and indirectly modulated by the gut microbiome.",Nutrients,2021,Kyoko Hasebe; Michael D Kendig; Margaret J Morris
34098340,Maternal prenatal gut microbiota composition predicts child behaviour.,"Murine studies demonstrate that maternal prenatal gut microbiota influences brain development and behaviour of offspring. No human study has related maternal gut microbiota to behavioural outcomes during early life. This study aimed to evaluate relationships between the prenatal faecal microbiota, prenatal diet and childhood behaviour.A sub-cohort of 213 mothers and 215 children were selected from a longitudinal pre-birth cohort. Maternal prenatal exposure measures collected during the third trimester included the faecal microbiota (generated using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing), and dietary intake. The behavioural outcome used the Childhood Behaviour Checklist at age two. Models were adjusted for prenatal diet, smoking, perceived stress, maternal age and sample batch.We found evidence that the alpha diversity of the maternal faecal microbiota during the third trimester of pregnancy predicts child internalising behaviour at two years of age (-2Â·74, (-4Â·71, -0Â·78), pÂ =Â 0Â·01 (Wald test), R<sup>2</sup>=0Â·07). Taxa from butyrate-producing families, Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae, were more abundant in mothers of children with normative behaviour. A healthy prenatal diet indirectly related to decreased child internalising behaviours via higher alpha diversity of maternal faecal microbiota.These findings support animal studies showing that the composition of maternal prenatal gut microbiota is related to offspring brain development and behaviour. Our findings highlight the need to evaluate potential impacts of the prenatal gut microbiota on early life brain development.This study was funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia (1082307, 1147980), Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Barwon Health and Deakin University.",EBioMedicine,2021,Samantha L Dawson; Martin O'Hely; Felice N Jacka; Anne-Louise Ponsonby; Christos Symeonides; Amy Loughman; Fiona Collier; Margarita Moreno-Betancur; Peter Sly; David Burgner; Mimi L K Tang; Richard Saffery; Sarath Ranganathan; Michael A Conlon; Leonard C Harrison; Susanne Brix; Karsten Kristiansen; Peter Vuillermin; 
34290352,The change of gut microbiota in MDD patients under SSRIs treatment.,"The alterations in the gut microbiota have been reported to be correlated with the development of depression. The purpose of this study was to investigate the changes of intestinal microbiota in depressed patients after antidepressant treatment. We recruited 30 MDD patients (MDD group) and 30 healthy controls (control group). The MDD group received individualized treatment with escitalopram at a maximum dose of 20Â mg/day. After depressive symptoms improved to a HAMD scale scoreâ>â50%, a fecal sample was collected again and used as the follow-up group. The differences of gut microbiota between patients and controls, the characteristics of gut microbiota under treatment and the potential differences in metabolic functions were thus investigated. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was significantly different within three groups, and the ratio of follow-up group was significantly lower than those of the other two groups. Alpha diversity was significantly higher in MDD group than those of the other groups, and the alpha diversity was not significantly different between control and follow-up groups. The beta diversity of some patients resembled participants in the control group. The metabolic function of gut microbiota after treatment was still different from that of the control group. This study suggests that the intestinal flora of depressed patients has a tendency to return to normal under escitalopram treatment.",Scientific reports,2021,Yang Shen; Xiao Yang; Gaofei Li; Jiayu Gao; Ying Liang

34348619,"Metabolomic Connections between Schizophrenia, Antipsychotic Drugs and Metabolic Syndrome: A Variety of Players.","Diagnosis of schizophrenia lacks reliable medical diagnostic tests and robust biomarkers applied to clinical practice. Schizophrenic patients undergoing treatment with antipsychotics suffer reduced life expectancy due to metabolic disarrangements that co-exist with their mental illness and predispose them to develop metabolic syndrome, which is also exacerbated by medication. Metabolomics is an emerging and potent technology able to accelerate this biomedical research.This review focus on a detailed vision of the molecular mechanisms involved both in schizophrenia and antipsychotic-induced metabolic syndrome, based on innovative metabolites that consistently change in nascent metabolic syndrome, drug-naÃ¯ve, first episode psychosis and/or schizophrenic patients compared to healthy subjects. Main Lines: Supported by metabolomic approaches, although not exclusively, noteworthy variations are reported mainly through serum samples of patients and controls in several scenes: 1) alterations in fatty acids, inflammatory response indicators, amino acids and biogenic amines, biometals, and gut microbiota metabolites (schizophrenia); 2) alterations in metabolites involved in carbohydrate and gut microbiota metabolism, inflammation and oxidative stress (metabolic syndrome), some of them shared with schizophrenia; 3) alterations of cytokines secreted by adipose tissue, phosphatidylcholines, acylcarnitines, Sirtuin 1, orexin-A, and changes in microbiota composition (antipsychotic-induced metabolic syndrome).Novel insights into the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and metabolic side-effects associated with its antipsychotic treatment represent an urgent request for scientists and clinicians.

33651324,Gut microbiota dysbiosis is associated with worse emotional states in HIV infection.,"The biological mechanisms underlying emotional distress in HIV infection are likely to be complex but remain understudied. We investigated whether dysbiotic signatures in the gut microbiome of persons living with HIV (PLWH) are associated with their emotional status. We retrospectively examined the gut microbiome and clinical evaluation of 129 adults (94 PLWH and 35 HIV-) enrolled at UC San Diego's HIV Neurobehavioral Research Program. A subset of participants (32 PLWH vs. 13 HIV-) underwent an emotional assessment using the NIH Toolbox Emotion Battery summarized by three composite scores (negative affect, social satisfaction, and psychological well-being). We then sequenced the 16S rDNA V3-V4 regions from stool and performed taxonomic assignment using CLC Microbial Genomics Module. The gut microbiota profiles were evaluated in relation to participants' emotional assessment. All analyses were done in R statistical software. We found that the relative abundance of aerotolerant bacteria was significantly higher in PLWH (pÂ <Â 0.01) and was associated with a lifetime major depression diagnosis independently of HIV status (pÂ =Â 0.05). Moreover, PLWH experienced significantly worse psychological well-being (pÂ =Â 0.02), less social satisfaction (pÂ =Â 0.03), and more negative affect (pÂ =Â 0.02). Higher levels of aerotolerant bacteria were associated with worse psychological well-being (rhoÂ =Â -0.35, pÂ =Â 0.02), less social satisfaction (rÂ =Â -Â 0.42, pÂ <Â 0.01), and more negative affect (rhoÂ =Â 0.46, pÂ <Â 0.01). The association of aerotolerant bacteria with social satisfaction and negative affect was independent of HIV status (pÂ <Â 0.05, for both).

34485176,Altered Fecal Microbiota Composition in Older Adults With Frailty.,"Frailty is a common geriatric syndrome that is diagnosed and staged based mainly on symptoms. We aimed to evaluate frailty-related alterations of the intestinal permeability and profile fecal microbiota of healthy and frail older adults to identify microbial biomarkers of this syndrome.We collected serum and fecal samples from 94 community-dwelling older adults, along with anthropometric, medical, mental health, and lifestyle data. Serum inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and HGMB1 and the intestinal permeability biomarker zonulin were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing method was performed to determine the fecal composition of fecal microbiota. We analyzed the diversity and composition differences of the gut microbiota in the two groups and assessed the relationship between the changes in microbiota structure and clinical biomarkers.Older adults with frailty showed higher concentrations of IL-6, HGMB1, and zonulin. Although there were no statistically significant differences in the diversity index and evenness indices or species richness of fecal microbiota between the two groups, we found significant microbiota structure differences. Compared with the control group, fecal samples from the frail group had higher levels of <i>Akkermansia</i>, <i>Parabacteroides</i>, and <i>Klebsiella</i> and lower levels of the commensal genera <i>Faecalibacterium</i>, <i>Prevotella</i>, <i>Roseburia</i>, <i>Megamonas</i>, and <i>Blautia.</i> Spearman's correlation analysis showed that the intergenus interactions were more common in healthy controls than older adults with frailty. <i>Escherichia</i>/<i>Shigella</i>, <i>Pyramidobacter</i>, <i>Alistipes</i>, and <i>Akkermansia</i> were positively correlated with IL-6, while <i>Faecalibacterium</i>, <i>Prevotella</i>, and <i>Roseburia</i> were negatively correlated with IL-6. <i>Alistipes</i> were found to be positively correlated with HGMB1. <i>Akkermansia</i> and <i>Alistipes</i> were linked to the increased serum level of inflammatory factors and intestinal permeability.Frailty is associated with differences in the composition of fecal microbiota. These findings might aid in the development of probiotics or microbial-based therapies for frailty.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2021,YuShuang Xu; YiHua Wang; HeWei Li; Yong Dai; Di Chen; MengMeng Wang; Xin Jiang; ZaoZao Huang; HongLu Yu; JuanJuan Huang; ZhiFan Xiong
35024387,Altered stress responses in adults born by Caesarean section.,"Birth by Caesarean-section (C-section), which increases the risk for metabolic and immune disorders, disrupts the normal initial microbial colonisation of the gut, in addition to preventing early priming of the stress and immune-systems.. Animal studies have shown there are enduring psychological processes in C-section born mice. However, the long-term impact of microbiota-gut-brain axis disruptions due to birth by C-section on psychological processes in humans is unknown. Forty age matched healthy young male university students born vaginally and 36 C-section delivered male students were recruited. Participants underwent an acute stressor, the Trier social stress test (TSST), during a term-time study visit. A subset of participants also completed a study visit during the university exam period, representing a naturalistic stressor. Participants completed a battery of cognitive tests and self-report measures assessing mood, anxiety, and perceived stress. Saliva, blood, and stool samples were collected for analysis of cortisol, peripheral immune profile, and the gut microbiota. Young adults born by C-section exhibit increased psychological vulnerability to acute stress and a prolonged period of exam-related stress. They did not exhibit an altered salivary cortisol awakening response to the TSST, but their measures of positive affect were significantly lower than controls throughout the procedure. Both C-section and vaginally-delivered participants performed equally well on cognitive assessments. Most of the initial effects of delivery mode on the gut microbiome did not persist into adulthood as the gut microbiota profile showed modest changes in composition in adult vaginally-delivered and C-sectioned delivered subjects. From an immune perspective, concentrations of IL-1Î² and 1L-10 were higher in C-section participants. These data confirm that there is a potential enduring effect of delivery mode on the psychological responses to acute stress during early adulthood. The mental health implications of these observations require further study regarding policies on C-section use.",Neurobiology of stress,2022,Timothy G Dinan; Paul J Kennedy; Livia H Morais; Amy Murphy; Caitriona M Long-Smith; Gerard M Moloney; Thomaz F S Bastiaanssen; Andrew P Allen; Aoife Collery; David Mullins; Anne-Marie Cusack; Kirsten Berding; Paul W O'Toole; Gerard Clarke; Catherine Stanton; John F Cryan
34518605,Altered fecal microbiota composition in individuals who abuse methamphetamine.,"As a severe public health problem, methamphetamine (METH) abuse places a heavy burden on families and society. A growing amount of evidence has indicated communication between gut microbiota and the CNS in drug addiction, with associations to neural, endocrine and immune pathways. Thus, we searched for alterations in the gut microbiota and their potential effects in METH users through 16S rRNA gene sequencing. A decreased Shannon index indicated lower bacterial diversity in the METH users than in the age-matched control group. The gut microbial community composition in the METH users was also altered, including reductions in Deltaproteobacteria and Bacteroidaceae abundances and increases in Sphingomonadales, Xanthomonadales, Romboutsia and Lachnospiraceae abundances. Moreover, the Fusobacteria abundance was correlated with the duration of METH use. Enterobacteriaceae, Ruminococcaceae, Bacteroides, and Faecalibacterium had statistically significant correlations with items related to the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia and to general psychopathology in the METH users, and all have previously been reported to be altered in individuals with psychotic syndromes, especially depression. Abstraction, one of the items of the cognitive assessment, was positively related to Blautia. These findings revealed alterations in the gut microbiota of METH users, and these alterations may play a role in psychotic syndrome and cognitive impairment. Although the mechanisms behind the links between these disorders and METH abuse are unknown, the relationships may indicate similarities in the pathogenesis of psychosis induced by METH abuse and other causes, providing a new paradigm for addiction and METH use disorder treatment.",Scientific reports,2021,Yongde Yang; Xuan Yu; Xuebing Liu; Guangya Liu; Kuan Zeng; Gang Wang
34004259,Abnormalities in the composition of the gut microbiota in mice after repeated administration of DREADD ligands.,"Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) are known as genetically modified G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which can be activated by synthetic ligands such as clozapine N-oxide (CNO) and DREADD agonist 21 (compound 21: C21). The brain-gut-microbiota axis has a crucial role in bidirectional interactions between the brain and the gastrointestinal microbiota. In this study, we investigated whether repeated administration of CNO or C21 could influence the gut microbiota and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in feces of adult mice. Repeated administration of CNO or C21 as drinking water did not alter the Î±- and Î²-diversity of gut microbiota in mice compared with control mice. However, we found significant changes in relative abundance for several bacteria in the CNO (or C21) group at the taxonomic level compared to the control group. The linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) algorithm distinguished the family Prevotellaceae, the genus Anaerocolumna, the genus Prevotella, and the genus Frisingicoccus, these four specific microbial markers for the CNO group relative to the control group. In addition, the LEfSe algorithm identified the family Clostridiaceae, the genus Faecalicatena and the genus Marinisporobacter, these three bacteria of different taxonomic as potential microbial markers for the C21 group relative to the control group. In contrast, repeated administration of CNO (or C21) did not alter SCFAs in feces samples of adult mice. The data suggest that repeated administration of CNO or C21 contributes to an unusual organization of the gut microbiota in adult mice. Therefore, abnormalities in the composition of gut microbiota by repeated dosing of DREADD ligands should be taken into consideration for behavioral and biological functions in rodents treated with DREADD ligands.",Brain research bulletin,2021,Wei Guo; Xiayun Wan; Li Ma; Jiancheng Zhang; Kenji Hashimoto

(R,S)-ketamine is a racemic mixture of equal amounts of (R)-ketamine (arketamine) and (S)-ketamine (esketamine). In 2019, an esketamine nasal spray from Johnson & Johnson was approved in the United States of America and Europe for treatment-resistant depression. However, an increasing number of preclinical studies show that arketamine has greater potency and longer-lasting antidepressant-like effects than esketamine in rodents, despite the lower binding affinity of arketamine for the NMDAR. In clinical trials, non-ketamine NMDAR-related compounds did not exhibit ketamine-like robust antidepressant actions in patients with depression, despite these compounds showing antidepressant-like effects in rodents. Thus, the rodent data do not necessarily translate to humans due to the complexity of human psychiatric disorders. Collectively, the available studies indicate that it is unlikely that NMDAR plays a major role in the antidepressant action of (R,S)-ketamine and its enantiomers, although the precise molecular mechanisms underlying antidepressant actions of (R,S)-ketamine and its enantiomers remain unclear. In this paper, we review recent findings on the molecular mechanisms underlying the antidepressant actions of (R,S)-ketamine and its potent enantiomer arketamine. Furthermore, we discuss the possible role of the brain-gut-microbiota axis and brain-spleen axis in stress-related psychiatric disorders and in the antidepressant-like action of arketamine.

34588398,Metformin acts on the gut-brain axis to ameliorate antipsychotic-induced metabolic dysfunction.,"Antipsychotic-induced metabolic dysfunction (AIMD) is an intractable clinical challenge worldwide. The situation is becoming more critical as second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), to a great extent, have replaced the role of first-generation antipsychotics in managing major psychiatric disorders. Although the exact mechanisms for developing AIMD is intricate, emerging evidence has indicated the involvement of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in AIMD. SGAs treatment may change the diversity and compositions of intestinal flora (e.g., decreased abundance of Bacteroidetes and Akkermansia muciniphila, and increased Firmicutes). Short-chain fatty acids and other metabolites derived from gut microbiota, on the one hand, can regulate the activity of intestinal endocrine cells and their secretion of satiety hormones (e.g., glucagon-like peptide 1, peptide YY, cholecystokinin and ghrelin); on the other hand, can activate the vagus nerve or transport into the brain to exert a central modulation of foraging behaviors via binding to neuropeptide receptors. Interestingly, metformin, a classical antidiabetic agent, is capable of alleviating AIMD possibly by regulating the microbiota-gut-brain axis. That is, metformin can not only partially reverse the alterations of gut microbial communities due to SGAs treatment, but also play a positive role in rectifying the disturbances of peripheral and central satiety-related neuropeptides. Current evidence has indicated a promising role for metformin on ameliorating AMID, but further verifications in well-designed clinical trials are still warranted.",Bioscience trends,2021,Xiaorong Wang; Huimin Huang; Yiyi Zhu; Shaoli Li; Peifen Zhang; Jiajun Jiang; Caixi Xi; Lingling Wu; Xingle Gao; Yaoyang Fu; Danhua Zhang; Yiqing Chen; Shaohua Hu; Jianbo Lai
33895287,Manipulations of the gut microbiome alter chemotherapy-induced inflammation and behavioral side effects in female mice.,"Chemotherapy treatment is associated with acute behavioral side effects (fatigue, anorexia) that significantly reduce patient quality of life and are dose-limiting, thereby increasing mortality (Kidwell et al., 2014). Disruptions to gut homeostasis (diarrhea, constipation, microbial dysbiosis) are also observed in patients receiving chemotherapy. In non-oncological patients, facets of mental health (fatigue, anxiety, depression) correlate with alterations in the gut microbiome, suggestive of a contribution of the gut in CNS disease etiology. The potential gut-to-brain pathway is poorly understood in patients receiving chemotherapy. Our prior studies have demonstrated a correlation between chemotherapy treatment, gut changes, peripheral and central inflammation, and behavioral symptoms in mice. Here we aimed to determine the extent to which chemotherapy-associated gut manipulations modulate the behavioral and biological consequences of chemotherapy. We measured sickness behaviors, peripheral and central inflammatory mediators, and anxiety in conventional or germ-free female mice: 1) cohabitating with mice of the opposite treatment group, 2) pre-treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, or 3) given an intra-gastric gavage of gut content from chemotherapy-treated mice. In cohabitation studies, presumed coprophagia promoted body mass recovery, however strong associations with inflammation and behavior were not observed. Reduction of gut microbial alpha diversity via antibiotics did not prevent chemotherapy-associated side effects, however the relative abundances of the genera Tyzzerella, Romboutsia, and Turicibacter correlated with circulating inflammatory (IL-1Î²) and behavioral outcomes (lethargy, anxiety-like behavior). A gut microbiota transplant from chemotherapy-treated mice decreased central locomotion in open field testing, increased circulating CXCL1, and increased hippocampal Il6 and Tnfa in germ-free mice compared to germ-free mice that received a transplant from vehicle-treated mice. Taken together, these data provide further evidence that the gut microbiota likely contributes to the development of chemotherapy-associated side effects. This work has significant implications in the future treatment of anxiety in patients, and warrants future studies using microbe-based treatment options.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2021,C V Grant; B R Loman; M T Bailey; L M Pyter

Fifty individuals with suspected NCGS/WS were subjected to the DBPC challenge test; anthropometric measurements, psychometric questionnaires, and fecal samples were collected. Twenty-seven (54%) participants were gluten responsive (NCGS), and 23 were placebo responsive, with an order effect. NCGS individuals displayed a significantly lower risk of eating disorders and a higher mental health score when compared to placebo-responsive participants, confirmed by multiple logistic regression analyses (OR = 0.87; 95% CI 0.76-0.98, <i>p</i> = 0.021, and OR = 1.30; 95% CI 1.06-1.59, <i>p</i> = 0.009, respectively). Principal coordinate analyses based on microbiota composition showed a separation by the DBPC response (<i>p</i> = 0.039). For <i>Bacteroides</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.05) and <i>Parabacteroides</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.007), the frequency of amplicon sequence variants was lower, and that for <i>Blautia</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.009) and <i>Streptococcus</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.004) was higher in NCGS individuals at multiple regression analyses. No difference in the mycobiota composition was detected between the groups. In conclusion, almost half of the individuals with suspected gluten sensitivity reported symptoms with placebo; they showed lower mental health scores, increased risk for eating disorders, and a different gut microbiota composition.",Nutrients,2021,Valentina Ponzo; Ilario Ferrocino; Ilaria Goitre; Marianna Pellegrini; Mauro Bruno; Marco Astegiano; Gianni Cadario; Eleonora Castellana; Fabio Bioletto; Maria Rita Corvaglia; Patrizia Malfa; Luca Cocolin; Ezio Ghigo; Simona Bo
34869080,Altered Fecal Microbiota Correlated With Systemic Inflammation in Male Subjects With Methamphetamine Use Disorder.,"Methamphetamine use disorder (MUD) is a major public health problem worldwide with limited effective treatment options. Previous studies have reported methamphetamine-associated alterations in gut microbiota. A potential role of gut microbiota in regulating methamphetamine-induced brain dysfunction through interactions with the host immune system has been proposed, but evidence for this hypothesis is limited. The present study aimed to investigate the alterations in the fecal microbiota and explore its relationship with systemic inflammation in MUD. Fecal samples were obtained from 26 male subjects with MUD and 17 sex- and age- matched healthy controls. Fecal microbial profiles were analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing. Plasma inflammatory markers were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Associations between fecal microbiota, systemic inflammatory markers and clinical characteristics were examined by Spearman partial correlation analysis while controlling for possible confounders. Compared with healthy controls, individuals with MUD showed no difference in fecal microbial diversity, but exhibited differences in the relative abundance of several microbial taxa. At the genus level, a higher abundance of <i>Collinsella</i>, <i>Odoribacter</i> and <i>Megasphaera</i> and lower levels of <i>Faecalibacterium</i>, <i>Blautia</i>, <i>Dorea</i> and <i>Streptococcus</i> were detected in subjects with MUD. More importantly, altered fecal microbiota was found to be correlated with plasma levels of CRP, IL-2, IL-6 and IL-10. The order <i>Lactobacillales</i>, exhibiting lower abundance in participants with MUD, was positively related to the duration of methamphetamine abstinence and the plasma level of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. This study is the first to provide evidence for a link between altered fecal microbiota and systemic inflammation in MUD. Further elucidation of interactions between gut microbiota and the host immune system may be beneficial for the development of novel therapeutic approaches for MUD.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2021,Di Deng; Hang Su; Yuehong Song; Tianzhen Chen; Qianqian Sun; Haifeng Jiang; Min Zhao

We assessed accumulation of AGEs in plasma, kidney, and liver and measured inflammatory markers and gut microbial composition. After 10Â weeks of baked chow, a substantial panel of AGEs were increased in plasma, liver, and kidney. These increases were normalized after the switch diet. The inflammatory z-score increased after the baked chow diet. Gut microbial composition differed significantly between groups, with enriched Dubosiella spp. dominating these alterations.A high AGE-diet led to an increase of AGEs in plasma, kidney, and liver and to more inflammation and modification of the gut microbiota. These effects were reversed or discontinued by a diet lower in AGEs.","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2021,Katja C W van Dongen; Armand M A Linkens; Suzan M W Wetzels; Kristiaan Wouters; Tim Vanmierlo; Marjo P H van de Waarenburg; Jean L J M Scheijen; Willem M de Vos; Clara Belzer; Casper G Schalkwijk
34413106,Protocol for the National Nurse Health Study (NNHS): a web-based ambispective cohort study.,"The physical and mental health of nurses may significantly impact the entire medical care group and directly affect the quality of medical services. Due to the intense emotional involvement and often problematic working conditions that characterise their profession, nurses appear to be especially susceptible to a complex set of stressors with repercussions to their health. Several landmark studies of nurses have provided an abundance of evidence on risk factors that influence the health status of nurses. However, few studies have investigated the health status of nurses who work in high-intensity work environments in China. The National Nurse Health Study (NNHS) objective is to build an ambispective cohort to gather web-based information on early-life events, daily habits, occupational and environmental risk factors, and health outcomes of a specific subset of healthcare professionals of Chinese nurses.NNHS, which was developed at a tertiary hospital in Beijing, China, is a research initiative that enrolls registered nurses working at Peking University Third Hospital. A web-based self-administered system was designed to collect health-related data and link them with previous physical examination data. During the study period, participants with signed informed consent will be invited to annually repeat a similar procedure.The NNHS research protocol was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee and provides promising data that contribute to the understanding of pathophysiological links between early-life events, body composition, gut microbiota, and inflammatory and metabolic risk profiles. Moreover, the combination of a user-friendly tool with the innovative purposes of the NNHS offers a remarkable resource to test hypotheses about mechanisms of diseases, including work stress, and further plan preventive programmes in public health.The study was registered on Clinicaltrials.gov (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04572347) and the China Cohort Consortium (http://chinacohort.bjmu.edu.cn/project/102/).",BMJ open,2021,Lin Zhuo; Heli Zhang; Rongmei Geng; Panfeng Wang; Lin Zeng; Ying Che; Peng Wang; Pengfei Li; Tao Huang; Baohua Li; Siyan Zhan

34002020,Endocannabinoid system mediates the association between gut-microbial diversity and anhedonia/amotivation in a general population cohort.,"Anhedonia and amotivation are debilitating symptoms and represent unmet therapeutic needs in a range of clinical conditions. The gut-microbiome-endocannabinoid axis might represent a potential modifiable target for interventions. Based on results obtained from animal models, we tested the hypothesis that the endocannabinoid system mediates the association between gut-microbiome diversity and anhedonia/amotivation in a general population cohort. We used longitudinal data collected from 786 volunteer twins recruited as part the TwinsUK register. Our hypothesis was tested with a multilevel mediation model using family structure as random intercept. The model was set using alpha diversity (within-individual gut-microbial diversity) as predictor, serum and faecal levels of the endocannabinoid palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) as mediator, and anhedonia/amotivation as outcome. PEA is considered the endogenous equivalent of cannabidiol, with increased serum levels believed to have anti-depressive effects, while increased stool PEA levels, reflecting increased excretion, are believed to have opposite, detrimental, effects on mental health. We therefore expected that either reduced serum PEA or increased stool PEA would mediate the association between microbial diversity and anhedonia amotivation. Analyses were adjusted for obesity, diet, antidepressant use, sociodemographic and technical covariates. Data were imputed using multiple imputation by chained equations. Mean age was 65.2âÂ±â7.6; 93% of the sample were females. We found a direct, significant, association between alpha diversity and anhedonia/amotivation (Î²â=â-0.37; 95%CI: -0.71 to -0.03; Pâ=â0.03). Faecal, but not serum, levels of the endocannabinoid palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) mediated this association: the indirect effect was significant (Î²â=â-0.13; 95%CI: -0.24 to -0.01; Pâ=â0.03), as was the total effect (Î²â=â-0.38; 95%CI: -0.72 to -0.04; Pâ=â0.03), whereas the direct effect of alpha diversity on anhedonia/amotivation was attenuated fully (Î²â=â-0.25; 95%CI: -0.60 to 0.09; Pâ=â0.16). Our results suggest that gut-microbial diversity might contribute to anhedonia/amotivation via the endocannabinoid system. These findings shed light on the biological underpinnings of anhedonia/amotivation and suggest the gut microbiota-endocannabinoid axis as a promising therapeutic target in an area of unmet clinical need.",Molecular psychiatry,2021,Amedeo Minichino; Matthew A Jackson; Marta Francesconi; Claire J Steves; Cristina Menni; Philip W J Burnet; Belinda R Lennox
33807447,Changes in Gut Microbiota after a Four-Week Intervention with Vegan vs. Meat-Rich Diets in Healthy Participants: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"An essential role of the gut microbiota in health and disease is strongly suggested by recent research. The composition of the gut microbiota is modified by multiple internal and external factors, such as diet. A vegan diet is known to show beneficial health effects, yet the role of the gut microbiota is unclear. Within a 4-week, monocentric, randomized, controlled trial with a parallel group design (vegan (VD) vs. meat-rich (MD)) with 53 healthy, omnivore, normal-weight participants (62% female, mean 31 years of age), fecal samples were collected at the beginning and at the end of the trial and were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (Clinical Trial register: DRKS00011963). Alpha diversity as well as beta diversity did not differ significantly between MD and VD. Plotting of baseline and end samples emphasized a highly intra-individual microbial composition. Overall, the gut microbiota was not remarkably altered between VD and MD after the trial. <i>Coprococcus</i> was found to be increased in VD while being decreased in MD. <i>Roseburia</i> and <i>Faecalibacterium</i> were increased in MD while being decreased in VD.

Given the importance of the microbiota-gut-brain axis, we investigated the differences in gut microbiota between representative cases of these two diseases and sought to develop a microbiome-based approach for their differential diagnosis. <b>Methods:</b> We enrolled 23 patients with MDD, 21 with GAD, and 10 healthy subjects (healthy crowd, HC) in the present study. We used 16S rRNA gene-sequencing analysis to determine the microbial compositions of the gut microbiome based on Illumina Miseq and according to the standard protocol. <b>Results:</b> GAD showed a significant difference in microbiota richness and diversity as compared with HC. Additionally, Otu24167, Otu19140, and Otu19751 were significantly decreased in MDD relative to HC, and Otu2581 and Otu10585 were significantly increased in GAD relative to MDD. At the genus level, the abundances of <i>Sutterella</i> and <i>Fusicatenibacter</i> were significantly lower in MDD relative to HC, and the abundances of <i>Fusicatenibacter</i> and <i>Christensenellaceae</i>_R7_group were significantly lower in GAD than in HC. The abundance of <i>Sutterella</i> was significantly higher whereas that of <i>Faecalibacterium</i> was significantly lower in GAD relative to MDD. Moreover, we observed that <i>Christensenellaceae</i>_R7_group negatively correlated with the factor score (Limited to Hopelessness) and total score of HAMD-24 (<i>p</i> < 0.05), whereas <i>Fusicatenibacter</i> negatively correlated with FT4 (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Furthermore, the GAD group showed significant differences at the genus level for <i>Faecalibacterium</i>, which negatively correlated with PTC (<i>p</i> < 0.05). <b>Conclusions:</b> This study elucidated a unique gut-microbiome signature associated with MDD and GAD that could facilitate differential diagnosis and targeted therapy.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2021,Zaiquan Dong; Xiaoling Shen; Yanni Hao; Jin Li; Haoran Li; Haizheng Xu; Li Yin; Weihong Kuang
34589800,Beyond the neuro-immune interplay in depression: Could gut microbes be the missing link?,"Accumulating evidence have positioned inflammatory signaling pathways as crucial routes by which microbes inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract (the gut microbiota) communicate with the host brain to influence behavior, with impacts on mental illnesses. In this short review, an overview of inflammatory and gut microbiota status in human depression and in rodent models of the illness are provided. Next, potential inflammatory pathways mediating the communications between the gut and the brain under stressful conditions are described. Finally, dietary interventions targeting the gut microbiota-immune-brain axis in the context of depression are briefly discussed.","Brain, behavior, & immunity - health",2021,Marie-Claude Audet
34440563,Targeting Metabolic Dysfunction for the Treatment of Mood Disorders: Review of the Evidence.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD) are often chronic with many patients not responding to available treatments. As these mood disorders are frequently associated with metabolic dysfunction, there has been increased interest in novel treatments that would target metabolic pathways. The objectives of this scoping review were to synthesize evidence on the impact on mood symptoms of lipid lowering agents and anti-diabetics drugs, while also reviewing current knowledge on the association between mood disorders and dyslipidemia or hyperglycemia. We propose that metabolic dysfunction is prevalent in both MDD and BD and it may contribute to the development of these disorders through a variety of pathophysiological processes including inflammation, brain structural changes, hormonal alterations, neurotransmitter disruptions, alteration on brain cholesterol, central insulin resistance, and changes in gut microbiota. Current evidence is conflicting on the use of statins, polyunsaturated fatty acids, thiazolidinediones, glucagon-like peptide agonists, metformin, or insulin for the treatment of MDD and BD. Given the paucity of high-quality randomized controlled trials, additional studies are needed before any of these medications can be repurposed in routine clinical practice. Future trials need to enrich patient recruitment, include evaluations of mechanism of action, and explore differential effects on specific symptom domains such as anhedonia, suicidality, and cognition.","Life (Basel, Switzerland)",2021,Brett D M Jones; Salman Farooqui; Stefan Kloiber; Muhammad Omair Husain; Benoit H Mulsant; Muhammad Ishrat Husain
34560239,Regulation of neurotoxicity in the striatum and colon of MPTP-induced Parkinson's disease mice by gut microbiome.,"Increasing evidence suggests the role of gut-microbiota-brain axis in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). The objective of this study was to examine whether repeated administration of MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) can influence the neurotoxicity in the striatum and colon, and the composition of gut microbiota and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in feces of adult mice. MPTP caused the reduction of dopamine transporter (DAT) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the striatum, and increases in phosphorylated Î±-synuclein (p-Î±-Syn) in the striatum and colon. There was a negative correlation between the expression of TH in the striatum and the expression of p-Î±-Syn in the colon, suggesting a role of gut-brain communication. MPTP caused abnormalities in the Î±- and Î²-diversity of gut microbiota in the mice. Furthermore, the relative abundance of the genus Faecalicatena in the MPTP-treated group was significantly lower than that of control group. Interestingly, there was a positive correlation between the genus Faecalicatena and the expression of TH in the striatum. Moreover, MPTP did not alter the levels of SCFAs in feces samples. However, there was a positive correlation between the relative abundance of the genus Faecalicatena and propionic acid. The data suggest that MPTP-induced increases in colonic p-Î±-Syn expression might be associated with dopaminergic neurotoxicity in the striatum via gut-microbiota-brain axis.",Brain research bulletin,2021,Jiajing Shan; Youge Qu; Siming Wang; Yan Wei; Lijia Chang; Li Ma; Kenji Hashimoto

34576833,Specific Changes in the Mammalian Gut Microbiome as a Biomarker for Oxytocin-Induced Behavioral Changes.,"Prolonged exposure to psychiatric pharmacological agents is often associated with marked gastrointestinal phenomena, including changes in food intake, bowel motility, gastric emptying, and transit time. Those changes are reflected in the gut microbiota composition of the patient and can, therefore, be objectively measured. This is in contrast to the standard psychiatric evaluation of patients, which includes symptoms that are subjectively assessed (i.e., mood, anxiety level, perception, thought disorders, etc.). The association between a drug's effect on the microbiota and psychiatric symptoms may allow for quantifiable surrogate markers of treatment effectiveness. Changes in the levels of specific drug-sensitive bacterial species can, thus, potentially serve as biomarkers for the intake and effectiveness of psychiatric drugs. Here, we show substantial microbiota changes that were associated with oxytocin administration and the decreased anxiety/depression-like behaviors it conferred in a rat model of corticosterone-induced stress. Compared with oxytocin, citalopram produced more minor effects on the rats' microbiota. Alterations in the gut microbiota may, therefore, reflect the consumption and effectiveness of some psychiatric drugs.",Microorganisms,2021,Itzhak Dangoor; DuÅ¡anka StaniÄ; Leah Reshef; Vesna PeÅ¡iÄ; Uri Gophna
33664475,Sialylated human milk oligosaccharides program cognitive development through a non-genomic transmission mode.,"Breastmilk contains bioactive molecules essential for brain and cognitive development. While sialylated human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) have been implicated in phenotypic programming, their selective role and underlying mechanisms remained elusive. Here, we investigated the long-term consequences of a selective lactational deprivation of a specific sialylated HMO in mice. We capitalized on a knock-out (KO) mouse model (B6.129-St6gal1<sup>tm2Jxm</sup>/J) lacking the gene responsible for the synthesis of sialyl(alpha2,6)lactose (6'SL), one of the two sources of sialic acid (Neu5Ac) to the lactating offspring. Neu5Ac is involved in the formation of brain structures sustaining cognition. To deprive lactating offspring of 6'SL, we cross-fostered newborn wild-type (WT) pups to KO dams, which provide 6'SL-deficient milk. To test whether lactational 6'SL deprivation affects cognitive capabilities in adulthood, we assessed attention, perseveration, and memory. To detail the associated endophenotypes, we investigated hippocampal electrophysiology, plasma metabolomics, and gut microbiota composition. To investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms, we assessed gene expression (at eye-opening and in adulthood) in two brain regions mediating executive functions and memory (hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, PFC). Compared to control mice, WT offspring deprived of 6'SL during lactation exhibited consistent alterations in all cognitive functions addressed, hippocampal electrophysiology, and in pathways regulating the serotonergic system (identified through gut microbiota and plasma metabolomics). These were associated with a site- (PFC) and time-specific (eye-opening) reduced expression of genes involved in central nervous system development. Our data suggest that 6'SL in maternal milk adjusts cognitive development through a short-term upregulation of genes modulating neuronal patterning in the PFC.",Molecular psychiatry,2021,Jonas Hauser; Edoardo Pisa; Alejandro Arias VÃ¡squez; Flavio Tomasi; Alice Traversa; Valentina Chiodi; Francois-Pierre Martin; Norbert Sprenger; Oksana Lukjancenko; Alix Zollinger; Sylviane Metairon; Nora Schneider; Pascal Steiner; Alberto Martire; Viviana Caputo; Simone MacrÃ¬
33677218,Fecal microbiota transplantation ameliorates stress-induced depression-like behaviors associated with the inhibition of glial and NLRP3 inflammasome in rat brain.,"Evidence from previous studies has demonstrated that the gut-microbiota-brain axis is vital in regulating of behavior and neuroinflammation in the central nervous system. Considering the putative connection among gut microbiota, neural function, and behavior, the present study investigated the potential signaling of gut microbiota to modulate depression-like behaviors and neuroinflammation.Rats showing depression-like behaviors induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress received fecal microbiota treatment or vehicle for 14 days, and alterations in behavior and neuroinflammation were assessed. ELISA, immunofluorescence staining and Western blot were used to analysis the activation of glial cells and NLRP3 inflammasome.Treatment with fecal microbiota transplantation ameliorated depression-like behaviors. 5-Hydroxytryptamine decreased in the chronic unpredictable mild stress rat model but significantly increased after fecal microbiota transplantation. The treatment with fecal microbiota transplantation decreased the production of IL-1Î² and TNF-Î±. Moreover, fecal microbiota transplantation administration suppressed the activation of Iba1 positive microglia cells and GFAP positive astrocytes cells and reduced the expression of NLRP3, ASC, Caspase-1, and IL-1Î² pathway in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus.Fecal microbiota transplantation can improve depression-like behaviors induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress. The anti-depression effects of fecal microbiota transplantation were associated with the suppressed activation of glial cells and NLRP3 inflammasome in the brain.",Journal of psychiatric research,2021,Jingjing Rao; Yi Qiao; Ruining Xie; Li Lin; Jian Jiang; Chunmei Wang; Gongying Li
33508544,Transcriptional markers of excitation-inhibition balance in germ-free mice show region-specific dysregulation and rescue after bacterial colonization.,"Studies of germ-free (GF) mice demonstrate that gut microbiota can influence behaviour by modulating neurochemical pathways in the brain, and that bacterial colonization normalizes behavioural deficits in GF-mice. Since disrupted GABAergic and glutamatergic signaling are reported in mood disorders, this study investigated the effect of gut microbiota manipulations on EIB-relevant gene expression in the brain.GF Swiss-Webster mice were colonized with E. coli JM83, complex microbiota (specific-pathogen-free; SPF), or no microbiota, and compared with controls (nÂ =Â 6/group). 21 synaptic genes representing GABAergic, glutamatergic, BDNF, and astrocytic functions were measured in the hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex using quantitative PCR. Gene co-expression analysis was used to identify gene modules related to colonization status, and compared by permutation analysis. Gene expression profiles were compared to existing post-mortem cohorts of depressed subjects (nÂ =Â 28 cases vs 28 controls).Region-specific alterations in gene expression were observed in GF-mice compared to controls. 58% of all genes (14/24) altered in GF-mice were normalized following SPF-colonization. GF-mice displayed disorganization of gene co-expression networks in all three brain regions (hippocampus, pÂ =Â 0.0003; amygdala, pÂ =Â 0.0012; mPFC, pÂ =Â 0.0069), which was restored by SPF colonization in hippocampus (p v.s. GFÂ =Â 0.0003, p v.s. controlÂ =Â 0.60). The hippocampal gene expression profile in GF-mice was significantly correlated with that in human depression (ÏÂ =Â 0.51, pÂ =Â 0.027), and this correlation was not observed after colonization.Together, we show that the absence of gut microbiota disrupts the expression of EIB-relevant genes in mice, and colonization restores EIB-relevant expression, in ways that are relevant to human depression.",Journal of psychiatric research,2021,Vivek Philip; Dwight F Newton; Hyunjung Oh; Stephen M Collins; Premysl Bercik; Etienne Sibille
34311029,Fatty acids and beyond: Age and Alzheimer's disease related changes in lipids reveal the neuro-nutraceutical potential of lipids in cognition.,"Lipids are essential in maintaining brain function, and lipid profiles have been reported to be altered in aged and Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains as compared to healthy mature brains. Both age and AD share common metabolic hallmarks such as increased oxidative stress and perturbed metabolic function, and age remains the most strongly correlated risk factor for AD, a neurodegenerative disease. A major accompanying pathological symptom of these conditions is cognitive impairment, which is linked with changes in lipid metabolism. Thus, nutraceuticals that affect brain lipid metabolism or lipid levels as a whole have the potential to ameliorate cognitive decline. Lipid analyses and lipidomic studies reveal changes in specific lipid types with aging and AD, which can identify potential lipid-based nutraceuticals to restore the brain to a healthy lipid phenotype. The brain lipid profile can be influenced directly with dietary administration of lipids themselves, although because of synergistic effects of nutrients it may be more useful to consider a multi-component diet rather than single nutrient supplementation. Gut microbiota also serve as a source of beneficial lipids, and the value of treatments that manipulate the composition of gut microbiome should not be ignored. Lastly, instead of direct supplementation, compounds that affect pathways involved with lipid metabolism should also be considered as a way of manipulating lipid levels to improve cognition. In this review, we briefly discuss the role of lipids in the brain, the changing lipid profile in AD, current research on lipid-based nutraceuticals and their therapeutic potential to combat cognitive impairment.",Neurochemistry international,2021,Kei-Lin Murata Ooi; Kristina Vacy; Wah Chin Boon
34895297,The Moo'D Study: protocol for a randomised controlled trial of A2 beta-casein only versus conventional dairy products in women with low mood.,"Beta-casein is a major protein in cow's milk, of which A1 and A2 are the most frequent variants. Recent evidence implicates A1 beta-casein consumption in mechanisms that are of potential importance to mental health, yet its possible effects on psychological endpoints remains unknown. The primary aim of the study is to evaluate the comparative effects of consumption of dairy products containing A2 beta-casein versus conventional dairy (i.e. containing both A1 and A2 beta-casein) on symptoms of psychological distress in women with low mood.'The Moo'D Study' is a 16-week, superiority, 1:1 parallel group, triple-blinded, randomised controlled trial. Ninety women with low mood (Patient Health Questionnaire score â¥ 5) will be randomised to consume either A2 beta-casein only or conventional dairy products. The primary outcome, symptoms of psychological distress, will be measured by the 21-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale. Secondary outcomes will include symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress, severity of low mood, cognition, gut microbiota composition, gut symptomatology, markers of immune function, gut inflammation, systemic metabolites, endothelial integrity and oxidative stress, body composition, perceived wellbeing, sleep, quality of life, resource use and cost-effectiveness.This study will advance our understanding of the possible impact of milk proteins on psychological distress in women as well as elucidate mechanisms underpinning any association.

34147969,Ingestion of Faecalibaculum rodentium causes depression-like phenotypes in resilient Ephx2 knock-out mice: A role of brain-gut-microbiota axis via the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve.,"The brain-gut-microbiota axis plays a crucial role in the bidirectional interactions between the brain and the gut. Soluble epoxide hydrolase (coded by the Ephx2 gene) plays an important role in inflammation, which has been implicated in stress-related depression. Ephx2 knock-out (KO) mice exposed to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) did not show depression-like behaviors, indicating stress resilience. Here we examined whether the brain-gut-microbiota axis influences the resilience in Ephx2 KO mice.Effects of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from CSDS-susceptible (or control) mice in wild-type (WT) mice and Ephx2 KO mice treated with an antibiotic cocktail (ABX) were investigated. Behavioral, biochemical tests and 16S ribosome RNA analysis were performed.FMT from CSDS-susceptible mice produced anhedonia-like behavior in ABX-treated WT and Ephx2 KO mice. The 16S ribosome RNA analysis showed that Faecalibaculum rodentium (F. rodentium) may be responsible for the observed anhedonia-like behavior following FMT from CSDS-susceptible mice. Ingestion of F. rodentium for 14 days produced depression- and anhedonia-like behaviors, higher blood levels of interleukin-6, and reduced expression of synaptic proteins in the prefrontal cortex of ABX-treated Ephx2 KO mice. Furthermore, subdiaphragmatic vagotomy blocked the development of these behavioral abnormalities after ingestion of F. rodentium.Detailed mechanisms are unclear.These findings suggest that F. rodentium might contribute to the conversion of resilient Ephx2 KO mice into KO mice with depression-like phenotypes.

34474339,Lycium barbarumÂ polysaccharide attenuates emotional injury of offspring elicited by prenatal chronic stress in rats via regulation of gut microbiota.,"Stress during pregnancy is not only detrimental to a woman's own physical and mental health, but can also cause changes in the intrauterine environment and even have an impact on later growth and development, this study was designed to understand the changes of gut microbiota in the maternal and offspring caused by prenatal chronic stress, and to explore the regulatory effect of LBP on gut microbiota, and then to improve the emotional damage caused by prenatal chronic stress in the offspring. A rat model of prenatal chronic stress was made and used LBP to intervene by gavage. Fresh feces of offspring were collected, the concentration of microbial metabolites were tested by ELISA. Illumina MiSeqPE300 sequencing technology was used to determine the sequence of 16S rRNA V3-V4 of microorganisms. On the PND 42, the emotional function of offspring were tested by open-field test (OFT), sucrose preference test (SPT) and tail of suspend test (TST). Results indicated that stress factors increased the plasma corticosterone level of rats during pregnancy and they appeared depressive behaviors. The body weight of offspring during prenatal chronic stress was lower than the control group, and the plasma corticosterone level was increased. Prenatal chronic stress had a significant impact on emotional performance of the offspring on OFT, SPT and TST. Alpha diversity of gut microbiota and microbiota composition in offspring of prenatal chronic stress was attenuated and some relationships existed between these parameters. LBP treatment reduced offspring's plasma corticosterone level and improved their body weight, changed the emotional function, increased the diversity of gut microbiota. Collectively, these findings disclose that prenatal chronic stress not only causes emotional injury on the offspring, but also changes the gut microbiota of the mother and offspring; LBP may regulate the intestinal flora of the mother, then reducing the influence of stress factors on the emotional injury of offspring.",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2021,Feng Zhao; Suzhen Guan; Youjuan Fu; Kai Wang; Zhihong Liu; Tzi Bun Ng

33936013,"GABA Production by Human Intestinal <i>Bacteroides</i> spp.: Prevalence, Regulation, and Role in Acid Stress Tolerance.","The high neuroactive potential of metabolites produced by gut microbes has gained traction over the last few years, with metagenomic-based studies suggesting an important role of microbiota-derived Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in modulating mental health. Emerging evidence has revealed the presence of the glutamate decarboxylase (GAD)-encoding gene, a key enzyme to produce GABA, in the prominent human intestinal genus <i>Bacteroides</i>. Here, we investigated GABA production by <i>Bacteroides</i> in culture and metabolic assays combined with comparative genomics and phylogenetics. A total of 961 <i>Bacteroides</i> genomes were analyzed <i>in silico</i> and 17 metabolically and genetically diverse human intestinal isolates representing 11 species were screened <i>in vitro</i>. Using the model organism <i>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</i> DSM 2079, we determined GABA production kinetics, its impact on milieu pH, and we assessed its role in mitigating acid-induced cellular damage. We showed that the GAD-system consists of at least four highly conserved genes encoding a GAD, a glutaminase, a glutamate/GABA antiporter, and a potassium channel. We demonstrated a high prevalence of the GAD-system among <i>Bacteroides</i> with 90% of all <i>Bacteroides</i> genomes (96% in human gut isolates only) harboring all genes of the GAD-system and 16 intestinal <i>Bacteroides</i> strains producing GABA <i>in vitro</i> (ranging from 0.09 to 60.84 mM). We identified glutamate and glutamine as precursors of GABA production, showed that the production is regulated by pH, and that the GAD-system acts as a protective mechanism against acid stress in <i>Bacteroides</i>, mitigating cell death and preserving metabolic activity. Our data also indicate that the GAD-system might represent the only amino acid-dependent acid tolerance system in <i>Bacteroides</i>.

34488774,Transcriptomics reveal different metabolic strategies for acid resistance and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) production in select Levilactobacillus brevis strains.,"Of the many neurotransmitters in humans, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) shows potential for improving several mental health indications such as stress and anxiety. The microbiota-gut-brain axis is an important pathway for GABAergic effects, as microbially-secreted GABA within the gut can affect host mental health outcomes. Understanding the molecular characteristics of GABA production by microbes within the gut can offer insight to novel therapies for mental health.Three strains of Levilactobacillus brevis with syntenous glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) operons were evaluated for overall growth, glutamate utilization, and GABA production in typical synthetic growth media supplemented with monosodium glutamate (MSG). Levilactobacillus brevis Lbr-6108â¢ (Lbr-6108), formerly known as L. brevis DPC 6108, and Levilactobacillus brevis Lbr-35 â¢ (Lbr-35) had similar growth profiles but differed significantly in GABA secretion and acid resistance. Lbr-6108 produced GABA early within the growth phase and produced significantly more GABA than Lbr-35 and the type strain Levilactobacillus brevis ATCC 14869 after the stationary phase. The global gene expression during GABA production at several timepoints was determined by RNA sequencing. The GAD operon, responsible for GABA production and secretion, activated in Lbr-6108 after only 6 h of fermentation and continued throughout the stationary phase. Furthermore, Lbr-6108 activated many different acid resistance mechanisms concurrently, which contribute to acid tolerance and energy production. In contrast, Lbr-35, which has a genetically similar GAD operon, including two copies of the GAD gene, showed no upregulation of the GAD operon, even when cultured with MSG.This study is the first to evaluate whole transcriptome changes in Levilactobacillus brevis during GABA production in different growth phases. The concurrent expression of multiple acid-resistance mechanisms reveals niche-specific metabolic functionality between common human commensals and highlights the complex regulation of GABA metabolism in this important microbial species. Furthermore, the increased and rapid GABA production of Lbr-6108 highlights the strain's potential as a therapeutic and the overall value of screening microbes for effector molecule output.",Microbial cell factories,2021,Sagarika Banerjee; Matthew Poore; Svetlana Gerdes; Derek Nedveck; Lene Lauridsen; Heidi Thomsen Kristensen; Henrik Max Jensen; Phillip M Byrd; Arthur C Ouwehand; Elaine Patterson; Wesley Morovic

33938181,Human glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) is an antimicrobial adjuvant re-sensitising multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.,"Increasing antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative bacteria has mandated the development of both novel antibiotics and alternative therapeutic strategies. Evidence of interplay between several gastrointestinal peptides and the gut microbiota led us to investigate potential and broad-spectrum roles for the incretin hormone, human glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) against the <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> bacteria, <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Erwinia amylovora</i>. GIP had a potent disruptive action on drug efflux pumps of the multidrug resistant bacteria <i>E. coli TG1</i> and <i>E. amylovora 1189</i> strains. The effect was comparable to bacterial mutants lacking the inner and outer membrane efflux pump factor proteins AcrB and TolC. While GIP was devoid of direct antimicrobial activity, it has a potent membrane depolarizing effect, and at low concentrations, it significantly potentiated the activity of eight antibiotics and bile salt by reducing MICs by 4-8-fold in <i>E. coli TG1</i> and 4-20-fold in <i>E. amylovora 1189</i>.

34830242,Assessment of the Effects of Dietary Vitamin D Levels on Olanzapine-Induced Metabolic Side Effects: Focus on the Endocannabinoidome-Gut Microbiome Axis.,"Vitamin D deficiency is associated with poor mental health and dysmetabolism. Several metabolic abnormalities are associated with psychotic diseases, which can be compounded by atypical antipsychotics that induce weight gain and insulin resistance. These side-effects may be affected by vitamin D levels. The gut microbiota and endocannabinoidome (eCBome) are significant regulators of both metabolism and mental health, but their role in the development of atypical antipsychotic drug metabolic side-effects and their interaction with vitamin D status is unknown. We studied the effects of different combinations of vitamin D levels and atypical antipsychotic drug (olanzapine) exposure on whole-body metabolism and the eCBome-gut microbiota axis in female C57BL/6J mice under a high fat/high sucrose (HFHS) diet in an attempt to identify a link between the latter and the different metabolic outputs induced by the treatments. Olanzapine exerted a protective effect against diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance, largely independent of dietary vitamin D status. These changes were concomitant with olanzapine-mediated decreases in <i>Trpv1</i> expression and increases in the levels of its agonists, including various <i>N</i>-acylethanolamines and 2-monoacylglycerols, which are consistent with the observed improvement in adiposity and metabolic status. Furthermore, while global gut bacteria community architecture was not altered by olanzapine, we identified changes in the relative abundances of various commensal bacterial families. Taken together, changes of eCBome and gut microbiota families under our experimental conditions might contribute to olanzapine and vitamin D-mediated inhibition of weight gain in mice on a HFHS diet.",International journal of molecular sciences,2021,Armita Abolghasemi; Claudia Manca; Fabio A Iannotti; Melissa Shen; Nadine Leblanc; SÃ©bastien Lacroix; Cyril Martin; Nicolas Flamand; Vincenzo Di Marzo; Cristoforo Silvestri
34961418,Effects of Berberine on Gut Microbiota in Patients with Mild Metabolic Disorders Induced by Olanzapine.,"Secondary metabolic disturbances in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder may be attributed to olanzapine. It is important to prevent mild metabolic disorders progressing to metabolic syndrome. This study aims to investigate the effects of berberine on intestinal flora in patients with mild metabolic disorders induced by olanzapine. A total of 132 patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or schizoaffective psychosis that had been treated with olanzapine for at least 9 months were randomly assigned ([Formula: see text] = 66 each) to receive berberine or placebo tablets for 12 weeks. Metabolic assessments and intestinal flora were quantified at baseline and after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment. Incidence rates of adverse reactions were recorded. FPG, FPI, HOMA-IR, HbA1, TG, BMI, and WC were significantly lower in patients who received berberine compared to placebo after 12 weeks of treatment ([Formula: see text]< 0.05). The abundance of firmicutes and coliform were significantly lower and the abundance of bacteroides significantly higher in patients who received berberine compared to placebo after 12 weeks of treatment ([Formula: see text]< 0.05). In patients who received berberine, the abundance of firmicutes was significantly decreased, and the abundance of bacteroides was significantly increased, and in patients who received placebo, the abundance of firmicutes was significantly increased post-treatment, compared to baseline (both [Formula: see text]< 0.05). In conclusions, berberine may regulate intestinal flora and metabolism in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and mild metabolic disturbances induced by olanzapine.",The American journal of Chinese medicine,2021,Zhengping Pu; Yunying Sun; Hongxia Jiang; Qingmei Hou; Hui Yan; Hui Wen; Guorong Li
34550085,"The Safety and Efficacy of Microbial Ecosystem Therapeutic-2 in People With Major Depression: Protocol for a Phase 2, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study.","The gut-brain axis is a bidirectional signaling pathway between the gastrointestinal tract and the brain; it is being studied because of its potential influence in mediating mood, anxiety, and other neuropsychiatric symptoms. Previous research examining the effects of gut microbiota on neuropsychiatric disorders suggests that gut repopulation treatments such as probiotics, microbe therapy, and fecal microbiota transplantation show promising results in treating symptoms of anxiety and depression. This study explores the use of an alternative gut repopulation treatment to fecal microbiota transplantation, known as Microbial Ecosystem Therapeutic (MET)-2, as an intervention against symptoms of depression. MET-2 is a daily, orally administered capsule containing 40 bacterial strains purified from a single healthy donor.The primary aim of this study is to assess changes in mood in people with major depression that occur pre-, post-, and during the administration of MET-2. The secondary aims are to assess changes in anxiety symptoms, blood biomarker concentrations, and the level of repopulation of healthy gut bacteria as a response to treatment.In this study, we will recruit 60 adults aged between 18 and 45 years old with major depression and randomly assign them to treatment or placebo groups. Patients in the treatment group will receive MET-2 once a day for 6 weeks, whereas patients in the placebo group will receive a matching placebo for 6 weeks. Participants will complete biweekly visits during the treatment period and a follow-up visit at 2 weeks post treatment. As a primary outcome measure, participants' mood will be assessed using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale. Secondary outcome measures include changes in mood, anxiety, early stress, gastrointestinal symptoms, and tolerability of MET-2 treatment using a series of clinical scales and changes in blood markers, particularly immunoglobulins (Igs; IgA, IgG, and IgM) and inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor-Î±, transforming growth factor-Î², interleukin-6, and interleukin-10). Changes in the relative abundance, diversity, and level of engraftment in fecal samples will be assessed using 16S rRNA sequencing. All data will be integrated to identify biomarkers that could indicate disease state or predict improvement in depressive symptoms in response to MET-2 treatment.Given the association between the gut microbiome and depression, we hypothesized that participants receiving MET-2 would experience greater improvement in depressive symptoms than those receiving placebo owing to the recolonization of the gut microbiome with healthy bacteria modulating the gut-brain axis connection.This study is the first of its kind to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a microbial therapy such as MET-2 in comparison with placebo for major depressive disorder. We hope that this study will also reveal the potential capabilities of microbial therapies to treat other psychiatric illnesses and mood disorders.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04602715; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04602715.DERR1-10.2196/31439.",JMIR research protocols,2021,Arthi Chinna Meyyappan; Cassandra Sgarbossa; Gustavo Vazquez; David J Bond; Daniel J MÃ¼ller; Roumen Milev

Several constructs such as experiential avoidance, cognitive fusion, shame, and self-criticism have recently emerged as potential intervention targets to improve mental health in IBD. Psychotherapeutic models such as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and compassion-based interventions are known to target these constructs. In this protocol, we aim to describe a two-arm Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) testing the efficacy of an ACT and compassion-focused intervention named Living with Intention, Fullness, and Engagement with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (LIFEwithIBD) intervention + Treatment As Usual (TAU) vs. TAU in improving psychological distress, quality of life, work and social functioning, IBD symptom perception, illness-related shame, psychological flexibility, self-compassion, disease activity, inflammation biomarkers, and gut microbiota diversity. <b>Methods:</b> This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT03840707, date assigned 13/02/2019). The LIFEwithIBD intervention is an adaptation to the IBD population of the Mind programme for people with cancer, an acceptance, mindfulness, and compassion-based intervention designed to be delivered in a group format. The LIFEwithIBD intervention's structure and topics are presented in this protocol. Participants were recruited at the Gastroenterology Service of the Coimbra University Hospital between June and September 2019. Of the 355 patients screened, 61 participants were selected, randomly assigned to one of two conditions [experimental group (LIFEwithIBD + TAU) or control group (TAU)] and completed the baseline assessment. Outcome measurement took place at baseline, post-intervention, 3- and 12-month follow-ups. <b>Discussion:</b> Results from this RCT will support future studies testing the LIFEwithIBD intervention or other acceptance and/or compassion-based interventions for IBD.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2021,InÃªs A Trindade; Joana Pereira; Ana Galhardo; Nuno B Ferreira; Paola Lucena-Santos; SÃ©rgio A Carvalho; Sara Oliveira; David Skvarc; BÃ¡rbara S Rocha; Francisco Portela; ClÃ¡udia Ferreira
34437440,Association of Polygenic Risk Score and Bacterial Toxins at Screening Colonoscopy with Colorectal Cancer Progression: A Multicenter Case-Control Study.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide, and its incidence is correlated with infections, chronic inflammation, diet, and genetic factors. An emerging aspect is that microbial dysbiosis and chronic infections triggered by certain bacteria can be risk factors for tumor progression. Recent data suggest that certain bacterial toxins implicated in DNA attack or in proliferation, replication, and death can be risk factors for insurgence and progression of CRC. In this study, we recruited more than 300 biopsy specimens from people undergoing colonoscopy, and we analyzed to determine whether a correlation exists between the presence of bacterial genes coding for toxins possibly involved in CRC onset and progression and the different stages of CRC. We also analyzed to determine whether CRC-predisposing genetic factors could contribute to bacterial toxins response. Our results showed that CIF toxin is associated with polyps or adenomas, whereas pks+ seems to be a predisposing factor for CRC. Toxins from <i>Escherichia coli</i> as a whole have a higher incidence rate in adenocarcinoma patients compared to controls, whereas <i>Bacteroides fragilis</i> toxin does not seem to be associated with pre-cancerous nor with cancerous lesions. These results have been obtained irrespectively of the presence of CRC-risk loci.",Toxins,2021,Alfonso Piciocchi; Elena Angela Pia Germinario; Koldo Garcia Etxebarria; Silvia Rossi; Lupe Sanchez-Mete; Barbara Porowska; Vittoria Stigliano; Paolo Trentino; Andrea Oddi; Fabio Accarpio; Gian Luca Grazi; Giovanni Bruno; Massimo Bonucci; Massimo Giambenedetti; Patrizia Spigaglia; Fabrizio Barbanti; Slawomir Owczarek; Ida Luzzi; Elisabetta Delibato; Zaira Maroccia; Lorenza NisticÃ²; Carla Fiorentini; Mauro D'Amato; Roberta De Angelis; Alessia Fabbri
33422641,A role of the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve in depression-like phenotypes in mice after fecal microbiota transplantation from Chrna7 knock-out mice with depression-like phenotypes.,"The Î±7 subtype of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (Î±7 nAChR: coded by Chrna7) regulates the cholinergic ascending anti-inflammatory pathway involved in depression. We previously reported that Chrna7 knock-out (KO) mice show depression-like phenotypes through systemic inflammation. In this study, we investigated whether fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from Chrna7 KO mice causes depression-like phenotypes in mice treated with an antibiotic cocktail (ABX). Chrna7 KO mice with depression-like phenotypes show an abnormal gut microbiota composition, although the alpha diversity and beta diversity were not altered. FMT from Chrna7 KO mice caused depression-like phenotypes, systemic inflammation, and downregulation of synaptic proteins in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in the ABX-treated mice compared to FMT from the control mice. The Principal component analysis based on the OTU level showed that the FMT group from the KO mice were different from the FMT group from the control mice. We found differences in abundance for several bacteria in the FMT group from the KO mice at the taxonomic level when compared with the other group. Interestingly, subdiaphragmatic vagotomy significantly blocked the development of depression-like phenotypes in the ABX-treated mice after FMT from Chrna7 KO mice. These data suggest that FMT from Chrna7 KO mice produce depression-like phenotypes in ABX-treated mice via the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve. The brain-gut-microbiota axis association with the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve plays an important role in the development of depression.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2021,Yaoyu Pu; Yunfei Tan; Youge Qu; Lijia Chang; Siming Wang; Yan Wei; Xingming Wang; Kenji Hashimoto
35151796,Brain-gut-microbiota axis in depression: A historical overview and future directions.,"Depression is the most common mental disorder and a leading cause of disability worldwide. Despite abundant research, the precise mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of depression remain elusive. Accumulating evidence from preclinical and clinical studies suggests that alterations in the gut microbiota, microbe-derived short-chain fatty acids, D-amino acids and metabolites play a key role in the pathophysiology of depression via the brain-gut-microbiota axis, including the neural and immune systems. Notably, the brain-gut-microbiota axis might play a crucial role in susceptibility versus resilience in rodents exposed to stress. Vagotomy is reported to block depression-like phenotypes in rodents after fecal microbiota transplantation of ""depression-related"" microbiome, suggesting that the vagus nerve influences depression through the brain-gut-microbiota axis. In this article, we review recent findings regarding the brain-gut-microbiota axis in depression and discuss its potential as a therapeutic target for depression.",Brain research bulletin,2022,Lijia Chang; Yan Wei; Kenji Hashimoto

Perspectives on what we know, what we need to investigate and how to put knowledge into practice.","The gut and brain link via various metabolic and signalling pathways, each with the potential to influence mental, brain and cognitive health. Over the past decade, the involvement of the gut microbiota in gut-brain communication has become the focus of increased scientific interest, establishing the microbiota-gut-brain axis as a field of research. There is a growing number of association studies exploring the gut microbiota's possible role in memory, learning, anxiety, stress, neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Consequently, attention is now turning to how the microbiota can become the target of nutritional and therapeutic strategies for improved brain health and well-being. However, while such strategies that target the gut microbiota to influence brain health and function are currently under development with varying levels of success, still very little is yet known about the triggers and mechanisms underlying the gut microbiota's apparent influence on cognitive or brain function and most evidence comes from pre-clinical studies rather than well controlled clinical trials/investigations. Filling the knowledge gaps requires establishing a standardised methodology for human studies, including strong guidance for specific focus areas of the microbiota-gut-brain axis, the need for more extensive biological sample analyses, and identification of relevant biomarkers. Other urgent requirements are new advanced models for in vitro and in vivo studies of relevant mechanisms, and a greater focus on omics technologies with supporting bioinformatics resources (training, tools) to efficiently translate study findings, as well as the identification of relevant targets in study populations. The key to building a validated evidence base rely on increasing knowledge sharing and multi-disciplinary collaborations, along with continued public-private funding support.

36099873,The microbiota-gut-brain axis in sleep disorders.,"Sleep is a complex physiological process and is a critical determinant of physical and mental health. In the past decades, significant progress has been made in understanding the neural mechanisms of sleep and awakening. However, the initiation and maintenance of the sleep-wake cycle is regulated not only by the central system but is also affected by signals from peripheral tissues. Growing evidence shows that the microbiota-gut-brain axis contributes to the regulation of sleep behavior both directly and indirectly and may play a critical role in the etiology and pathogenesis of sleep disorders. Sleep deprivation leads to dysfunction of gut microbiota and sleep disorders are accompanied by altered gut microbiota composition. In this review, we describe the bidirectional relationships between sleep and gut microbiota and summarize the abnormal characteristics of gut bacteria in distinct conditions including sleep disturbances, sleep disorders and sleep disorders comorbid with neuropsychiatric disorders. We also examine the potential routes of microbiota-gut-brain axis in sleep and gut microbiome interactions, including metabolic, immune, and neural pathways, and propose microbiota-targeted interventions for improving sleep. Manipulating gut microbiota may be a promising avenue for the development of novel interventions for sleep disorders.",Sleep medicine reviews,2022,Zhe Wang; Zhong Wang; Tangsheng Lu; Wenhao Chen; Wei Yan; Kai Yuan; Le Shi; Xiaoxing Liu; Xinyu Zhou; Jie Shi; Michael V Vitiello; Ying Han; Lin Lu
35194166,"A systematic review of gut microbiota composition in observational studies of major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.","The emerging understanding of gut microbiota as 'metabolic machinery' influencing many aspects of physiology has gained substantial attention in the field of psychiatry. This is largely due to the many overlapping pathophysiological mechanisms associated with both the potential functionality of the gut microbiota and the biological mechanisms thought to be underpinning mental disorders. In this systematic review, we synthesised the current literature investigating differences in gut microbiota composition in people with the major psychiatric disorders, major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SZ), compared to 'healthy' controls. We also explored gut microbiota composition across disorders in an attempt to elucidate potential commonalities in the microbial signatures associated with these mental disorders. Following the PRISMA guidelines, databases were searched from inception through to December 2021. We identified 44 studies (including a total of 2510 psychiatric cases and 2407 controls) that met inclusion criteria, of which 24 investigated gut microbiota composition in MDD, seven investigated gut microbiota composition in BD, and 15 investigated gut microbiota composition in SZ. Our syntheses provide no strong evidence for a difference in the number or distribution (Î±-diversity) of bacteria in those with a mental disorder compared to controls. However, studies were relatively consistent in reporting differences in overall community composition (Î²-diversity) in people with and without mental disorders. Our syntheses also identified specific bacterial taxa commonly associated with mental disorders, including lower levels of bacterial genera that produce short-chain fatty acids (e.g. butyrate), higher levels of lactic acid-producing bacteria, and higher levels of bacteria associated with glutamate and GABA metabolism. We also observed substantial heterogeneity across studies with regards to methodologies and reporting.

36093196,Gut microbiota: Linking nutrition and perinatal depression.,"Perinatal depression is a mood disorder that is reported in women during pregnancy (prenatal) and after childbirth (postnatal). The onset of perinatal depression is associated with changes in reproductive hormones, stress hormones and neurosteroids. These chemical compounds can be modulated by the gut microbiota, which may affect maternal mental health during the perinatal period <i>via</i> the gut-brain-axis. Recent studies suggest that nutritional and dietary interventions (vitamin D, Ï-3 fatty acids, iron, and fiber) effectively prevent or mitigate maternal depression and anxiety, but their efficacy is confounded by various factors, including the gut microbiota. Probiotics are efficacious in maintaining microbiota homeostasis, and thus, have the potential to modulate the development of perinatal mood disorders, despite no evidence in human. Therefore, clinical trials are warranted to investigate the role of probiotic supplementation in perinatal depression and behavioral changes.

Here we performed faecal metagenomic, serum metabolomics and neuroimaging studies on a cohort of 109 unmedicated patients with depressed bipolar disorder (BD) patients and 40 healthy controls (HCs) to characterise the microbial-gut-brain axis in BD. Acrossâover 12,000 measured metabolic features, we observed a large discrepancy (73.54%) in the serum metabolome between BD patients and HCs, spotting differentially abundant microbial-derived neuroactive metabolites including multiple B-vitamins, kynurenic acid, gamma-aminobutyric acid and short-chain fatty acids. These metabolites could be linked to the abundance of gut microbiota presented with corresponding biosynthetic potentials, including Akkermansia muciniphila, Citrobacter spp. (Citrobacter freundii and Citrobacter werkmanii), Phascolarctobacterium spp., Yersinia spp. (Yersinia frederiksenii and Yersinia aleksiciae), Enterobacter spp. (Enterobacter cloacae and Enterobacter kobei) and Flavobacterium spp. Based on functional neuroimaging, BD-related neuroactive microbes and metabolites were discovered as potential markers associated with BD-typical features of functional connectivity of brain networks, hinting at aberrant cognitive function, emotion regulation, and interoception.

35819136,"Antibiotics and mental health: The good, the bad and the ugly.","Antibiotics are recognised as, on occasion, producing psychiatric side effects, most notably depression and anxiety. Apart from antimicrobial activity, antibiotics have multiple off-target effects. The brain-gut-microbiota axis has multiple sites for off-target activity, which may produce either positive or negative antibiotic effects. Here we review how antibiotics impact mental health by acting through the brain-gut-microbiota axis. Microbes in the gut influence brain function by acting through the vagus nerve or by altering the production of short-chain fatty acids or the amino acid tryptophan, the building block of serotonin. Not all antimicrobial actions of antibiotics have a negative impact. The first antidepressant discovered was actually an antibiotic: isoniazid is an antibacterial drug developed for treating tuberculosis. Minocycline, which enters the brain and mediates its effects through microglia, shows antidepressant activity. Some antibiotics bring about a significant decrease in gut microbial diversity, and this is viewed as a risk factor for depression. Other risk factors induced by antibiotics include altered gut barrier function, activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, reducing levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor or oxytocin and alteration of vagal tone. Although most patients taking antibiotics do not suffer from an iatrogenic psychiatric disorder, some do. As clinicians, we need to keep this in mind. The development of new antibiotics is primarily focused on antibiotic resistance, but efforts should be made to reduce off-target brain-gut-microbiota effects resulting in mental health problems.",Journal of internal medicine,2022,Katherine Dinan; Timothy Dinan

Evidence suggests that carbohydrates, especially fiber, are beneficial for the well-being and growth of gut microorganisms and consequently for the host in this symbiotic relationship, producing microbial alterations a negative effect on mental health and different organic systems. In addition, evidence suggests a negative impact of simple carbohydrates and refined carbohydrates on mood categories, including alertness and tiredness, reinforcing a vicious circle.

35831877,The gut-liver axis in sepsis: interaction mechanisms and therapeutic potential.,"Sepsis is a potentially fatal condition caused by dysregulation of the body's immune response to an infection. Sepsis-induced liver injury is considered a strong independent prognosticator of death in the critical care unit, and there is anatomic and accumulating epidemiologic evidence that demonstrates intimate cross talk between the gut and the liver. Intestinal barrier disruption and gut microbiota dysbiosis during sepsis result in translocation of intestinal pathogen-associated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular patterns into the liver and systemic circulation. The liver is essential for regulating immune defense during systemic infections via mechanisms such as bacterial clearance, lipopolysaccharide detoxification, cytokine and acute-phase protein release, and inflammation metabolic regulation. When an inappropriate immune response or overwhelming inflammation occurs in the liver, the impaired capacity for pathogen clearance and hepatic metabolic disturbance can result in further impairment of the intestinal barrier and increased disruption of the composition and diversity of the gut microbiota. Therefore, interaction between the gut and liver is a potential therapeutic target.

35508109,Microbiota alterations in proline metabolism impact depression.,"The microbiota-gut-brain axis has emerged as a novel target in depression, a disorder with low treatment efficacy. However, the field is dominated by underpowered studies focusing on major depression not addressing microbiome functionality, compositional nature, or confounding factors. We applied a multi-omics approach combining pre-clinical models with three human cohorts including patients with mild depression. Microbial functions and metabolites converging onto glutamate/GABA metabolism, particularly proline, were linked to depression. High proline consumption was the dietary factor with the strongest impact on depression. Whole-brain dynamics revealed rich club network disruptions associated with depression and circulating proline. Proline supplementation in mice exacerbated depression along with microbial translocation.

35157987,Brain-spleen axis in health and diseases: A review and future perspective.,"The spleen, an important tissue for the immune system, acts as a filter for blood within the immune system. Accumulating evidence suggests that the spleen affects a number of brain functions in health and diseases via immune modulation. Systemic inflammation or chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) can cause splenomegaly in rodents. Interestingly, the new antidepressant arketamine could normalize splenomegaly and depression-like behaviors in CSDS-susceptible mice. A recent study strongly supports the direct connection pathway between the brain and spleen, whereby the spleen can regulate the humoral immune defense by the two brain regions, such as corticotropin-related neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA). Furthermore, afferent and efferent vagus nerve signaling may contribute to brain and spleen communication. In this article, we review recent findings of the brain-spleen axis in health and diseases.",Brain research bulletin,2022,Yan Wei; Tong Wang; Lei Liao; Xinrong Fan; Lijia Chang; Kenji Hashimoto

Diet influences the onset and consequences of neurological diseases, and dietary factors may influence mental health at individual and population level. The link between unhealthy diet, impaired cognitive function and neurodegenerative diseases indicates that adopting a healthy diet would ultimately afford prevention and management of neurological diseases and brain aging. Neurodegenerative diseases are of multifactorial origin and result in progressive loss of neuronal function in the brain, leading to cognitive impairment and motoneuron disorders. The so-called Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) with its healthy ingredients rich in antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immune, neuroprotective, antidepressant, antistress and senolytic activity plays an essential role in the prevention and management of neurological diseases and inhibits cognitive decline in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. The MedDiet also modulates the gut-brain axis by promoting a diversity of gut microbiota. In view of the importance of diet in neurological diseases management, this review focuses on the dietary components, natural compounds and medicinal plants that have proven beneficial in neurological diseases and for brain health.

Psychobiotics are microbiota-targeted interventions that can result in mental health benefits and protect the aging brain. This study investigated the gut microbiome composition and predicted microbial functional pathways of middle-aged and older adults that met criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI), compared to neurologically healthy individuals, and investigated the impact of probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial. A total of 169 community-dwelling middle-aged (52-59 years) and older adults (60-75 years) received a three-month intervention and were randomized to probiotic and placebo groups. Participants were further subdivided based on cognitive status into groups with intact or impaired cognition and samples were collected at baseline and post supplementation.Microbiome analysis identified Prevotella ruminicola, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, and Bacteroides xylanisolvens as taxa correlated with MCI. Differential abundance analysis at baseline identified Prevotella as significantly more prevalent in MCI subjects compared to cognitively intact subjects (ALDEx2 P =Â 0.0017, ANCOM-BC P =Â 0.0004). A decrease in the relative abundance of the genus Prevotella and Dehalobacterium in response to LGG supplementation in the MCI group was correlated with an improved cognitive score.Our study points to specific members of the gut microbiota correlated with cognitive performance in middle-aged and older adults. Should findings be replicated, these taxa could be used as key early indicators of MCI and manipulated by probiotics, prebiotics, and symbiotics to promote successful cognitive aging.

35565888,The Role of the Microbiome-Brain-Gut Axis in the Pathogenesis of Depressive Disorder.,"The role of gut microbiota and its association with the central nervous system via the microbiome-brain-gut axis has been widely discussed in the literature. The aim of this review is to investigate the impact of gut microbiota on the development of depression and underlying molecular mechanisms. There are two possible pathways in which this interaction might occur. The first one suggests that depressive disorder could lead to dysbiosis and one of the causes may be the influence on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The second one considers if changes in the composition of gut microbiota might cause depressive disorder. The mechanisms that could be responsible for this interaction include the secretion of neurotransmitters, gut peptides and the activation of the immune system. However, current knowledge on this topic does not allow for us to state an unambiguous conclusion, and future studies that take into consideration more precise stress-measurement methods are needed to further explore direct mechanisms of the interaction between gut microbiota and mental health.",Nutrients,2022,Ewelina MÅynarska; Joanna Gadzinowska; Julita Tokarek; Joanna Forycka; Aleksandra Szuman; Beata Franczyk; Jacek Rysz
34750307,Microbiota-targeted interventions for mental health.,"The gut microbiota has emerged as a key conduit in mental health and is a promising target for interventions. This review provides an update on recent advances in using microbiota-targeted approaches for the management of mental health.Approaches that have emerged as microbiota-targeted interventions in the management of mental health include probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, fecal microbiota transplant as well as diet. Among these approaches, probiotic supplementation has been investigated most prominently, providing promising evidence for its use in improving mood and anxiety. There is also growing interest in the use of multistrain probiotics, whole dietary interventions or combined approaches, with encouraging results emerging from recent studies.Although the current literature preliminarily supports targeting the microbiota to manage mental health and use as adjuvant therapies for certain brain disorders, large gaps remain and especially data including clinical cohorts remains scarce. Research studies including larger cohorts, well-characterized clinical populations and defined duration and dosage of the intervention are required to develop evidence-based guidelines for microbiota-targeted strategies.",Current opinion in psychiatry,2022,Kirsten Berding; John F Cryan
36039924,The anti-inflammatory effects of a Mediterranean diet: a review.,"Chronic noncommunicable diseases remain the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and the majority are preventable with a healthy diet and lifestyle, but controversy remains as to the best approach. Greater adherence to a traditional Mediterranean diet has consistently been associated with lower morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease, diabetes and many cancers, and lower all-cause mortality. Despite the well known benefits on chronic disease risk there remains some scepticism as to the effects of this dietary pattern across populations outside the Mediterranean and the mechanisms of action of this traditional plant-based dietary pattern.This narrative review aims to summarize the latest evidence on the health protective effects of a traditional Mediterranean diet on chronic noncommunicable diseases, specifically focussing on the anti-inflammatory effects of this highly published dietary pattern.Recent high-quality evidence now supports a Mediterranean diet in secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease with impacts on atherosclerosis progression, likely through reduction of systemic inflammation and irrespective of changes in cholesterol or weight. The Mediterranean diet has a low Dietary Inflammatory Index illustrating its anti-inflammatory potential. This dietary pattern beneficially modulates the gut microbiota and immune system, including emerging evidence for efficacy against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (coronavirus disease 2019). Emerging evidence shows clinicians are not routinely recommending a Mediterranean diet despite well known evidence due to barriers such as lack of training, patient materials and concerns about potential patient adherence.The physiological mechanisms of action of this healthy diet pattern are becoming better understood to be multisystem and involving the gut. Larger controlled trials investigating mechanistic effects in broader non-Mediterranean populations are warranted. Although reflected in therapeutic guidelines for chronic disease management worldwide there are individual, clinical practice and health system barriers to its implementation that need a multisectoral approach to address.",Current opinion in clinical nutrition and metabolic care,2022,Catherine Itsiopoulos; Hannah L Mayr; Colleen J Thomas

The aim of this novel observational longitudinal case-control study, ""Meals, Microbiota and Mental Health in Children and Adolescents (MMM-Study)"" is to contribute to the promotion of treatment options for children and adolescents diagnosed with mental disorders through identification of patterns that may affect the symptoms. All children and adolescents, 5-15 years referred to the outpatient clinic of the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Department at The National University Hospital in Reykjavik, Iceland, for one year (nâ150) will be invited to participate. There are two control groups, i.e., sex-matched children from the same postal area (nâ150) and same parent siblings (full siblings) in the same household close in age +/- 3 years (n<150). A three-day food diary, rating scales for mental health, and multiple questionnaires will be completed. Biosamples (fecal-, urine-, saliva-, blood samples, and buccal swab) will be collected and used for 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of the oral and gut microbiome, measurements of serum factors, quantification of urine metabolites and host genotype, respectively. For longitudinal follow-up, data collection will be repeated after three years in the same groups. Integrative analysis of diet, gut microbiota, intestinal permeability, serum metabolites, and mental health will be conducted applying bioinformatics and systems biology approaches.

However, effective treatment measures have not been found to alleviate the occurrence and development of NDs. Abnormal accumulation of pathogenic proteins is an important cause of NDs. Therefore, effective inhibition of the accumulation of pathogenic proteins has become a priority. As the second brain of human, the gut plays an important role in regulate emotion and cognition functions. Recent studies have reported that the disturbance of gut microbiota (GM) is closely related to accumulation of pathogenic proteins in NDs. On the one hand, pathogenic proteins directly produced by GM are transmitted from the gut to the central center <i>via</i> vagus nerve. On the other hand, The harmful substances produced by GM enter the peripheral circulation through intestinal barrier and cause inflammation, or cross the blood-brain barrier into the central center to cause inflammation, and cytokines produced by the central center cause the production of pathogenic proteins. These pathogenic proteins can produced by the above two aspects can cause the activation of central microglia and further lead to NDs development. In addition, certain GM and metabolites have been shown to have neuroprotective effects. Therefore, modulating GM may be a potential clinical therapeutic approach for NDs. In this review, we summarized the possible mechanism of NDs caused by abnormal accumulation of pathogenic proteins mediated by GM to induce the activation of central microglia, cause central inflammation and explore the therapeutic potential of dietary therapy and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in NDs.",Frontiers in microbiology,2022,Wei Wei; Shixu Wang; Chongchong Xu; Xuemei Zhou; Xinqing Lian; Lin He; Kuan Li
35889175,Impact of Environmental Pollutants on Gut Microbiome and Mental Health via the Gut-Brain Axis.,"Over the last few years, the microbiome has emerged as a high-priority research area to discover missing links between brain health and gut dysbiosis.

Engaging microbiome-generated metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids, the immune system, the enteric nervous system, the endocrine system (including the HPA axis), tryptophan metabolism or the vagus nerve plays a crucial role in communication between the gut microbes and the brain. Humans are exposed to a wide range of pollutants in everyday life that impact our intestinal microbiota and manipulate the bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain, resulting in predisposition to psychiatric or neurological disorders. However, the interaction between xenobiotics, microbiota and neurotoxicity has yet to be completely investigated. Although research into the precise processes of the microbiota-gut-brain axis is growing rapidly, comprehending the implications of environmental contaminants remains challenging.

35345829,Curcumin Alleviates DSS-Induced Anxiety-Like Behaviors via the Microbial-Brain-Gut Axis.,"The anxiety and depression caused by inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are known to greatly affect the mental health of patients. The mechanism of psychiatric disorders caused by IBD is not fully understood. Previous research has suggested that the gut microbiome plays a key role in IBD. Curcumin is a yellow polyphenol extracted from the rhizome of the ginger plant, which has been shown to have effects against both depression and anxiety. Research has indicated that curcumin affects the gut microbiome and exerts antianxiety and neuroprotective effects through the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGB). However, whether curcumin can alleviate the psychiatric disorders caused by IBD and how curcumin affects the MGB axis through the gut microbiota have not been fully understood. Therefore, this study was aimed at determining the metabolic parameters and microbiological environment in the peripheral and central nervous system to determine the effects of curcumin against anxiety induced by dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS) in mice. To elaborate on the link between the gut microbiota and how curcumin alleviates anxiety-like behaviors, we performed a fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiment. The results suggested that curcumin can effectively relieve anxiety-like behaviors caused by DSS in mice. Further, curcumin treatment can alleviate disturbances in the gut microbiota and systemic disorders of lipid metabolism caused by DSS. Finally, through FMT, we verified that curcumin increased phosphatidylcholine in the prefrontal cortex of the mice and alleviated DSS-induced anxiety-like behaviors by modulating specific gut microbiota. We also revealed that <i>Muribaculaceae</i> may be a key part of the gut microbiota for curcumin to alleviate DSS-induced anxiety-like behaviors through the MGB axis.",Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,2022,Fan Zhang; Yanlin Zhou; Haitao Chen; Hao Jiang; Feini Zhou; Bin Lv; Maosheng Xu

Specifically, our review consists of three mini reviews on the associations exploring: (1) ecological biodiversity and human microbiota; (2) human microbiota and neuropsychiatric disorders; (3) ecological biodiversity and neuropsychiatric disorders. We conclude that the environment could directly transfer microbes to humans and that human studies support the gut microbiota as part of the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. Overall, the results from the three mini reviews consistently support the biodiversity hypothesis. These findings demonstrated the plausibility of biodiversity exerting mental health effects through biophysiological mechanisms instead of psychological mechanisms alone.

35966709,Gut microbiota dysbiosis: The potential mechanisms by which alcohol disrupts gut and brain functions.,"Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a high-risk psychiatric disorder and a key cause of death and disability in individuals. In the development of AUD, there is a connection known as the microbiota-gut-brain axis, where alcohol use disrupts the gut barrier, resulting in changes in intestinal permeability as well as the gut microbiota composition, which in turn impairs brain function and worsens the patient's mental status and gut activity. Potential mechanisms are explored by which alcohol alters gut and brain function through the effects of the gut microbiota and their metabolites on immune and inflammatory pathways. Alcohol and microbiota dysregulation regulating neurotransmitter release, including DA, 5-HT, and GABA, are also discussed. Thus, based on the above discussion, it is possible to speculate on the gut microbiota as an underlying target for the treatment of diseases associated with alcohol addiction. This review will focus more on how alcohol and gut microbiota affect the structure and function of the gut and brain, specific changes in the composition of the gut microbiota, and some measures to mitigate the changes caused by alcohol exposure. This leads to a potential intervention for alcohol addiction through fecal microbiota transplantation, which could normalize the disruption of gut microbiota after AUD.",Frontiers in microbiology,2022,Ganggang Chen; Fenglei Shi; Wei Yin; Yao Guo; Anru Liu; Jiacheng Shuai; Jinhao Sun
34654024,Associations Between the Gut Microbiota and Internalizing Behaviors in Preschool Children.,"Emerging evidence points toward a connection between mental health and the gut microbiota and its metabolites (e.g., short-chain fatty acids). It is unknown whether the gut microbiota is associated with the development of mental health problems (e.g., internalizing or externalizing behaviors) in preschool children. The objective of this study was to evaluate associations between the gut microbiota and internalizing and externalizing behaviors in preschool-aged children.A community sample of 248 typically developing children (3-5 years of age) provided a stool sample for gut microbiota and SCFA analysis. Parents reported child internalizing and externalizing behaviors using the Child Behavior Checklist. Associations between child behaviors and gut microbiota measures were analyzed using Spearman correlations followed by an adjustment for multiple testing, with subanalysis conducted in children clinically ""at risk"" for behavioral problems compared with those who were not.There was a correlation between Shannon alpha diversity with internalizing behaviors (rs = -0.134, p = .035) and its subscale somatic complaints (rs = -0.144, p = .023). In addition, children clinically ""at risk"" for internalizing problems had decreased alpha diversity (U = 551, p = .017). Internalizing behaviors correlated with valerate and isobutyrate (rs = -0.147, p = .021; rs = -0.140, p = .028, respectively). Furthermore the somatic complaints subscale additionally correlated with acetate and butyrate (rs = -0.219, p = .001; rs = -0.241, p < .001, respectively). These findings were also present in children ""at risk"" for internalizing problems (U = 569, p = .026; U = 571, p = .028) and somatic complaints (U = 164, p = .004; U = 145, p = .001).These analyses reveal novel associations between internalizing behaviors and the gut microbiota in preschool children. Furthermore, a relationship between somatic complaints and acetate and butyrate was identified, indicating that interventions that increase SCFA production warrant future investigation.",Psychosomatic medicine,2022,Marcel van de Wouw; Yanan Wang; Matthew L Workentine; Elnaz Vaghef-Mehrabani; Deborah Dewey; Raylene A Reimer; Lianne Tomfohr-Madsen; Gerald F Giesbrecht
36211431,Maternal gut microbiota during pregnancy and the composition of immune cells in infancy.,"Preclinical studies have shown that maternal gut microbiota during pregnancy play a key role in prenatal immune development but the relevance of these findings to humans is unknown. The aim of this prebirth cohort study was to investigate the association between the maternal gut microbiota in pregnancy and the composition of the infant's cord and peripheral blood immune cells over the first year of life.The Barwon Infant Study cohort (<i>n</i>=1074 infants) was recruited using an unselected sampling frame. Maternal fecal samples were collected at 36 weeks of pregnancy and flow cytometry was conducted on cord/peripheral blood collected at birth, 6 and 12 months of age. Among a randomly selected sub-cohort with available samples (<i>n</i>=293), maternal gut microbiota was characterized by sequencing the 16S rRNA V4 region. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were clustered based on their abundance. Associations between maternal fecal microbiota clusters and infant granulocyte, monocyte and lymphocyte subsets were explored using compositional data analysis. Partial least squares (PLS) and regression models were used to investigate the relationships/associations between environmental, maternal and infant factors, and OTU clusters.We identified six clusters of co-occurring OTUs. The first two components in the PLS regression explained 39% and 33% of the covariance between the maternal prenatal OTU clusters and immune cell populations in offspring at birth. A cluster in which <i>Dialister, Escherichia</i>, and <i>Ruminococcus</i> were predominant was associated with a lower proportion of granulocytes (<i>p</i>=0.002), and higher proportions of both central naÃ¯ve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD45RA<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>-</sup>) (<i>p</i><0.001) and naÃ¯ve regulatory T cells (Treg) (CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD45RA<sup>+</sup>/FoxP3<sup>low</sup>) (<i>p</i>=0.02) in cord blood. The association with central naÃ¯ve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells persisted to 12 months of age.This birth cohort study provides evidence consistent with past preclinical models that the maternal gut microbiota during pregnancy plays a role in shaping the composition of innate and adaptive elements of the infant's immune system following birth.",Frontiers in immunology,2022,Yuan Gao; Martin O'Hely; Thomas P Quinn; Anne-Louise Ponsonby; Leonard C Harrison; Hanne FrÃ¸kiÃ¦r; Mimi L K Tang; Susanne Brix; Karsten Kristiansen; Dave Burgner; Richard Saffery; Sarath Ranganathan; Fiona Collier; Peter Vuillermin

Given the expansion of the microbial sciences with the new human microbiome field facilitated by the decrease in sequencing costs, we now know more about the role of gut microbiota in human health. In this short review, particular focus is given to the gut-brain axis and its role in psychiatric diseases such as anxiety and depression. Additionally, factors that contribute to changes in the gut-brain axis, including the gut microbiome, nutrition, the host's genome, and ethnic difference, are highlighted.

36139496,Multi-Strain Probiotic Mixture Affects Brain Morphology and Resting State Brain Function in Healthy Subjects: An RCT.,"Probiotics can alter brain function via the gut-brain axis. We investigated the effect of a probiotic mixture containing <i>Bifidobacterium longum</i>, <i>Lactobacillus helveticus</i> and <i>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</i>. In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded crossover design, 22 healthy subjects (6 m/16 f; 24.2 Â± 3.4 years) underwent four-week intervention periods with probiotics and placebo, separated by a four-week washout period. Voxel-based morphometry indicated that the probiotic intervention affected the gray matter volume of a cluster covering the left supramarginal gyrus and superior parietal lobule (<i>p</i> < 0.0001), two regions that were also among those with an altered resting state functional connectivity. Probiotic intervention resulted in significant (FDR < 0.05) functional connectivity changes between regions within the default mode, salience, frontoparietal as well as the language network and several regions located outside these networks. Psychological symptoms trended towards improvement after probiotic intervention, i.e., the total score of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (<i>p</i> = 0.056) and its depression sub-score (<i>p</i> = 0.093), as well as sleep patterns (<i>p</i> = 0.058). The probiotic intervention evoked distinct changes in brain morphology and resting state brain function alongside slight improvements of psycho(bio)logical markers of the gut-brain axis. The combination of those parameters may provide new insights into the modes of action by which gut microbiota can affect gut-brain communication and hence brain function.",Cells,2022,Julia Rode; Hanna M T Edebol Carlman; Julia KÃ¶nig; Ashley N Hutchinson; Per Thunberg; Jonas Persson; Robert J Brummer
35050172,Gut Microbiota Metabolites in Major Depressive Disorder-Deep Insights into Their Pathophysiological Role and Potential Translational Applications.,"The gut microbiota is a complex and dynamic ecosystem essential for the proper functioning of the organism, affecting the health and disease status of the individuals. There is continuous and bidirectional communication between gut microbiota and the host, conforming to a unique entity known as ""holobiont"". Among these crosstalk mechanisms, the gut microbiota synthesizes a broad spectrum of bioactive compounds or metabolites which exert pleiotropic effects on the human organism. Many of these microbial metabolites can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) or have significant effects on the brain, playing a key role in the so-called microbiota-gut-brain axis. An altered microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis is a major characteristic of many neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD). Significative differences between gut eubiosis and dysbiosis in mental disorders like MDD with their different metabolite composition and concentrations are being discussed. In the present review, the main microbial metabolites (short-chain fatty acids -SCFAs-, bile acids, amino acids, tryptophan -trp- derivatives, and more), their signaling pathways and functions will be summarized to explain part of MDD pathophysiology. Conclusions from promising translational approaches related to microbial metabolome will be addressed in more depth to discuss their possible clinical value in the management of MDD patients.",Metabolites,2022,Miguel A Ortega; Miguel Angel Alvarez-Mon; Cielo GarcÃ­a-Montero; Oscar Fraile-Martinez; Luis G Guijarro; Guillermo Lahera; Jorge Monserrat; Paula Valls; Fernando Mora; Roberto RodrÃ­guez-JimÃ©nez; Javier Quintero; Melchor Ãlvarez-Mon
36570854,Reviewing the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of depression and exploring new therapeutic options.,"The relationship between gut microbiota (GM) and mental health is one of the focuses of psychobiology research. In recent years, the microbial-gut-brain axis (MGBA) concept has gradually formed about this bidirectional communication between gut and brain. But how the GM is involved in regulating brain function and how they affect emotional disorders these mechanisms are tenuous and limited to animal research, and often controversial. Therefore, in this review, we attempt to summarize and categorize the latest advances in current research on the mechanisms of GM and depression to provide valid information for future diagnoses and therapy of mental disorders. Finally, we introduced some antidepressant regimens that can help restore gut dysbiosis, including classic antidepressants, Chinese materia medica (CMM), diet, and exogenous strains. These studies provide further insight into GM's role and potential pathways in emotion-related diseases, which holds essential possible clinical outcomes for people with depression or related psychiatric disorders. Future research should focus on clarifying the causal role of GM in disease and developing microbial targets, applying these findings to the prevention and treatment of depression.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2022,Wenjie Han; Na Wang; Mengzhen Han; Meng Ban; Tao Sun; Junnan Xu
37118092,Intermittent fasting protects against Alzheimer's disease in mice by altering metabolism through remodeling of the gut microbiota.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia without effective clinical treatment. Here, we show that intermittent fasting (IF) improves cognitive functions and AD-like pathology in a transgenic AD mouse model (5XFAD). IF alters gut microbial composition with a significant enrichment in probiotics such as Lactobacillus. The changes in the composition of the gut microbiota affect metabolic activities and metabolite production. Metabolomic profiling analysis of cecal contents revealed IF leads to a decreased carbohydrate metabolism (for example, glucose) and an increased abundance in amino acids (for example, sarcosine and dimethylglycine). Interestingly, we found that the administration of IF-elevated sarcosine or dimethylglycine mimics the protective effects of IF in 5XFAD mice, including the amelioration of cognitive decline, amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) burden and glial overactivation. Our findings thus demonstrate an IF regimen is a potential approach to prevent AD progression, at least through the gut-microbiota-metabolites-brain axis, and constitutes an innovative AD therapeutic avenue.",Nature aging,2022,Rui-Yuan Pan; Jing Zhang; Jinlei Wang; Yingyi Wang; Zhihui Li; Yang Liao; Yajin Liao; Chenggang Zhang; Zhiqiang Liu; Lijuan Song; Jiezhong Yu; Zengqiang Yuan

35299696,The Role of MicroRNA and Microbiota in Depression and Anxiety.,"Depression and anxiety are devastating disorders. Understanding the mechanisms that underlie the development of depression and anxiety can provide new hints on novel treatments and preventive strategies. Here, we summarize the latest findings reporting the novel roles of gut microbiota and microRNAs (miRNAs) in the pathophysiology of depression and anxiety. The crosstalk between gut microbiota and the brain has been reported to contribute to these pathologies. It is currently known that some miRNAs can regulate bacterial growth and gene transcription while also modulate the gut microbiota composition, suggesting the importance of miRNAs in gut and brain health. Treatment and prevention strategies for neuropsychiatric diseases, such as physical exercise, diet, and probiotics, can modulate the gut microbiota composition and miRNAs expressions. Nonetheless, there are critical questions to be addressed to understand further the mechanisms involved in the interaction between the gut microbiota and miRNAs in the brain. This review summarizes the recent findings of the potential roles of microbiota and miRNA on the neuropathology of depression and anxiety, and its potential as treatment strategies.",Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience,2022,Julia M Rosa; Douglas A Formolo; Jiasui Yu; Thomas H Lee; Suk-Yu Yau
36440396,A genetic association study reveals the relationship between the oral microbiome and anxiety and depression symptoms.,"Growing evidence supports that alterations in the gut microbiota play an essential role in the etiology of anxiety, depression, and other psychiatric disorders. However, the potential effect of oral microbiota on mental health has received little attention.Using the latest genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data of the oral microbiome, polygenic risk scores (PRSs) of 285 salivary microbiomes and 309 tongue dorsum microbiomes were conducted. Logistic and linear regression models were applied to evaluate the relationship between salivary-tongue dorsum microbiome interactions with anxiety and depression. Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was utilized to compute the causal effects between the oral microbiome, anxiety, and depression.We observed significant salivary-tongue dorsum microbiome interactions related to anxiety and depression traits. Significantly, one common interaction was observed to be associated with both anxiety score and depression score, <i>Centipeda periodontii SGB 224</i> Ã <i>Granulicatella uSGB 3289</i> (P <sub>depressionscore</sub> = 1.41 Ã 10<sup>-8</sup>, P <sub>anxietyscore</sub> = 5.10 Ã 10<sup>-8</sup>). Furthermore, we detected causal effects between the oral microbiome and anxiety and depression. Importantly, we identified one salivary microbiome associated with both anxiety and depression in both the UKB database and the Finngen public database, <i>Eggerthia</i> (P <sub>IVW - majordepression - UKB</sub> = 2.99 Ã 10<sup>-6</sup>, P <sub>IVW - Self - reportedanxiety/panicattacks - UKB</sub> = 3.06 Ã 10<sup>-59</sup>, P <sub>IVW - depression - Finngen</sub> = 3.16 Ã 10 <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><msubsup><mrow></mrow> <mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow> <mrow><mo>-</mo> <mn>16</mn></mrow> </msubsup> </math> P <sub>IVW - anxiety - Finngen</sub> = 1.14 Ã 10<sup>-115</sup>).This study systematically explored the relationship between the oral microbiome and anxiety and depression, which could help improve our understanding of disease pathogenesis and propose new diagnostic targets and early intervention strategies.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2022,Chun'e Li; Yujing Chen; Yan Wen; Yumeng Jia; Shiqiang Cheng; Li Liu; Huijie Zhang; Chuyu Pan; Jingxi Zhang; Zhen Zhang; Xuena Yang; Peilin Meng; Yao Yao; Feng Zhang
35445772,Abnormal gut microbiota and bile acids in patients with first-episode major depressive disorder and correlation analysis.,"Gut microbiota and its metabolite bile acids may play a significant role in the occurrence and development of major depressive disorder (MDD). Therefore, this study analyzes gut microbiota and bile acids, as well as their correlation in patients.Thirty-one patients with MDD and 29 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled in this study. We collected their both blood and feces. Plasma bile acid content was determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and gut microbiota was detected by 16SrRNA gene sequencing and subsequently analyzed. We also analyzed the correlation between different gut microbiota, bile acids, and Hamilton Depression (HAMD) score.The Î±-diversity analysis found that Simpson and Pielou evenness index was much higher in HCs than in the patients with MDD. The Î²-diversity of the two groups were differences by nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis. Linear discriminant analysis effect size analysis identified 16 different strains. Bile acids detection showed that 23-nordeoxycholic acid in patients with MDD was significantly higher than in HCs, whereas taurolithocholic acid (TLCA), glycolithocholic acid (GLCA), and lithocholic acid 3-sulfate were significantly lower. Spearman correlation analysis showed that Turicibacteraceae, Turicibacterales, and Turicibacter were positively related with TLCA, GLCA, glycodeoxycholic acid (GDCA), and taurodeoxycholic acid, and were negatively correlated with HAMD score. At the same time, TLCA, GLCA, and GDCA were negatively correlated with HAMD score.Gut microbiota and bile acids metabolism are disturbances in MDD, and there exists a correlation between gut microbiota and bile acids metabolism. Moreover, their interaction may be related to the pathophysiological mechanism of MDD.",Psychiatry and clinical neurosciences,2022,Ning Sun; Jie Zhang; Jizhi Wang; Zhifen Liu; Xin Wang; Pengli Kang; Chunxia Yang; Penghong Liu; Kerang Zhang
36014798,The Effects of Physical Activity on the Gut Microbiota and the Gut-Brain Axis in Preclinical and Human Models: A Narrative Review.,"Increasing evidence supports the importance of the gut microbiota (GM) in regulating multiple functions related to host physical health and, more recently, through the gut-brain axis (GBA), mental health. Similarly, the literature on the impact of physical activity (PA), including exercise, on GM and GBA is growing. Therefore, this narrative review summarizes and critically appraises the existing literature that delves into the benefits or adverse effects produced by PA on physical and mental health status through modifications of the GM, highlighting differences and similarities between preclinical and human studies. The same exercise in animal models, whether performed voluntarily or forced, has different effects on the GM, just as, in humans, intense endurance exercise can have a negative influence. In humans and animals, only aerobic PA seems able to modify the composition of the GM, whereas cardiovascular fitness appears related to specific microbial taxa or metabolites that promote a state of physical health. The PA favors bacterial strains that can promote physical performance and that can induce beneficial changes in the brain. Currently, it seems useful to prioritize aerobic activities at a moderate and not prolonged intensity. There may be greater benefits if PA is undertaken from a young age and the effects on the GM seem to gradually disappear when the activity is stopped. The PA produces modifications in the GM that can mediate and induce mental health benefits.",Nutrients,2022,Stefania Cataldi; Luca Poli; Fatma NeÅe Åahin; Antonino Patti; Luigi Santacroce; Antonino Bianco; Gianpiero Greco; Barbara Ghinassi; Angela Di Baldassarre; Francesco Fischetti
35370947,Composition of the Gut Microbiota in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"The latest research accumulates information to explore the correlation between gut microbiota and neurodevelopmental disorders, which may lead to new approaches to treat diseases such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, the conclusions of previous studies are not completely consistent. The objective of the systematic review and meta-analysis was to identify evidence on the dysbiosis of gut microbiota in ADHD and find potential distinctive traits compared to healthy controls.Electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO, were searched up to August 24, 2021, using predetermined terms. Meta-analysis was performed to estimate the comparison of microbiota profiles (alpha and beta diversity) and the relative abundance of gut microbiota in ADHD patients and healthy controls.A total of eight studies were included in the meta-analysis, containing 316 ADHD patients and 359 healthy controls. There was a higher Shannon index in ADHD patients than in healthy controls (SMDâ=â0.97; 95% CI, 0.13 to 1.82; <i>P</i>â=â0.02; <i>I<sup>2</sup></i> â=â96%), but the significance vanished after sensitivity analysis because of high heterogeneity. No significant differences in other alpha diversity indexes were found. Regarding the relative abundance of gut microbiota, the genus <i>Blautia</i> was significantly elevated in ADHD patients compared with controls (SMDâ=â0.34; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.63; <i>P</i>â=â0.02; <i>I<sup>2</sup></i> â=â0%).Patients with ADHD had gut microbiome alterations compared to healthy controls. Though more studies with strict methodology are warranted due to the high heterogeneity, further studies to translate the findings of gut microbiota dysbiosis to clinical application in ADHD patients are needed and may guide targeted therapies.[https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.php?RecordID=273993], identifier PROSPERO (CRD42021273993).",Frontiers in endocrinology,2022,Ning Wang; Xuping Gao; Zifeng Zhang; Li Yang
35115853,Alterations of the Gut Microbiota in Response to Total Sleep Deprivation and Recovery Sleep in Rats.,"Accumulating evidence suggests that both sleep loss and gut dysbiosis can lead to metabolic disorders. However, less is known about the impact of total sleep deprivation (SD) and sleep recovery on the composition, function, and metabolic dynamics of the gut microbiota.Specific-pathogen free Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 48 h of SD with gentle handling and then allowed to recover for 1 week. Taxonomic profiles of fecal microbiota were obtained at baseline, 24 h of SD, 48 h of SD, and 1 week of recovery. We used 16<i>S</i> rRNA gene sequencing to analyze the gut microbial composition and function and further characterize microbiota-derived metabolites in rats.The microbiota composition analysis revealed that gut microbial composition and metabolites did not change in the rats after 24 h of SD but were significantly altered after 48 h of SD. These changes were reversible after 1 week of sleep recovery. A functional analysis was performed based on Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) annotations, indicating that 19 KEGG pathways were significantly altered in the gut microbiota in SD rats. These functional changes occurred within 24 h of SD, were more apparent after 48 h of SD, and did not fully recover after 1 week of sleep recovery.These results indicate that acute total SD leads to significant compositional and functional changes in the gut microbiota, and these changes are reversible.",Nature and science of sleep,2022,Zhong Wang; Kai Yuan; Yan-Bin Ji; Su-Xia Li; Le Shi; Zhe Wang; Xin-Yu Zhou; Yan-Ping Bao; Wen Xie; Ying Han; Jie Shi; Lin Lu; Wei Yan; Wen-Hao Chen

35634468,The Microbiome and Gut Endocannabinoid System in the Regulation of Stress Responses and Metabolism.,"The endocannabinoid system, with its receptors and ligands, is present in the gut epithelium and enteroendocrine cells, and is able to modulate brain functions, both indirectly through circulating gut-derived factors and directly through the vagus nerve, finally acting on the brain's mechanisms regarding metabolism and behavior. The gut endocannabinoid system also regulates gut motility, permeability, and inflammatory responses. Furthermore, microbiota composition has been shown to influence the activity of the endocannabinoid system. This review examines the interaction between microbiota, intestinal endocannabinoid system, metabolism, and stress responses. We hypothesize that the crosstalk between microbiota and intestinal endocannabinoid system has a prominent role in stress-induced changes in the gut-brain axis affecting metabolic and mental health. Inter-individual differences are commonly observed in stress responses, but mechanisms underlying resilience and vulnerability to stress are far from understood. Both gut microbiota and the endocannabinoid system have been implicated in stress resilience. We also discuss interventions targeting the microbiota and the endocannabinoid system to mitigate metabolic and stress-related disorders.",Frontiers in cellular neuroscience,2022,Raj Kamal Srivastava; Beat Lutz; Inigo Ruiz de Azua

What about the influence of the muscle-gut-brain (MGB) axis on mental health? The gut microbiota colonizes the intestinal tract and plays a pivotal role in digestion, production of vitamins and immune system development, but it is also able to exert a particular effect on psychological well-being and appears to play a critical role in regulating several muscle metabolic pathways. Endogenous and exogenous factors may cause dysbiosis, with relevant consequences on the composition and function of the gut microbiota that may also modulate muscle responses to exercise. The capacity of specific psychobiotics in ameliorating mental health as complementary strategies has been recently suggested as a novel treatment for some neuropsychiatric diseases. Moreover, physical exercise can modify qualitative and quantitative composition of the gut microbiota and alleviate certain psychopathological symptoms. In this minireview, we documented evidence about the impact of the MGB axis on mental health, which currently appears to be a possible target in the context of a multidimensional intervention mainly including pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments, especially for depressive mood.",Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,2022,Davide Maria Cammisuli; Jonathan Fusi; Giorgia ScarfÃ²; Simona Daniele; Gianluca Castelnuovo; Ferdinando Franzoni
35157946,Stressful events induce long-term gut microbiota dysbiosis and associated post-traumatic stress symptoms in healthcare workers fighting against COVID-19.,"The microbiota-gut-brain axis is a key pathway perturbed by prolonged stressors to produce brain and behavioral disorders. Frontline healthcare workers (FHWs) fighting against COVID-19 typically experience stressful event sequences and manifest some mental symptoms; however, the role of gut microbiota in such stress-induced mental problems remains unclear. We investigated the association between the psychological stress of FHW and gut microbiota.We used full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize the longitudinal changes in gut microbiota and investigated the impact of microbial changes on FHWs' mental status.Stressful events induced significant depression, anxiety, and stress in FHWs and disrupted the gut microbiome; gut dysbiosis persisted for at least half a year. Different microbes followed discrete trajectories during the half-year of follow-up. Microbes associated with mental health were mainly Faecalibacterium spp. and [Eubacterium] eligens group spp. with anti-inflammatory effects. Of note, the prediction model indicated that low abundance of [Eubacterium] hallii group uncultured bacterium and high abundance of Bacteroides eggerthii at Day 0 (immediately after the two-month frontline work) were significant determinants of the reappearance of post-traumatic stress symptoms in FHWs.The lack of metabolomic evidence and animal experiments result in the unclear mechanism of gut dysbiosis-related stress symptoms.The stressful event sequences of fighting against COVID-19 induce characteristic longitudinal changes in gut microbiota, which underlies dynamic mental state changes.",Journal of affective disorders,2022,Fengjie Gao; Ruijin Guo; Qingyan Ma; Yening Li; Wei Wang; Yajuan Fan; Yanmei Ju; Binbin Zhao; Yuan Gao; Li Qian; Zai Yang; Xiaoyan He; Xiaoying Jin; Yixin Liu; Yuan Peng; Ce Chen; Yunchun Chen; Chengge Gao; Feng Zhu; Xiancang Ma
35276927,One Giant Leap from Mouse to Man: The Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis in Mood Disorders and Translational Challenges Moving towards Human Clinical Trials.,"The microbiota-gut-brain axis is a bidirectional communication pathway that enables the gut microbiota to communicate with the brain through direct and indirect signaling pathways to influence brain physiology, function, and even behavior. Research has shown that probiotics can improve several aspects of health by changing the environment within the gut, and several lines of evidence now indicate a beneficial effect of probiotics on mental and brain health. Such evidence has prompted the arrival of a new term to the world of biotics research: psychobiotics, defined as any exogenous influence whose effect on mental health is bacterially mediated. Several taxonomic changes in the gut microbiota have been reported in neurodevelopmental disorders, mood disorders such as anxiety and depression, and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. While clinical evidence supporting the role of the gut microbiota in mental and brain health, and indeed demonstrating the beneficial effects of probiotics is rapidly accumulating, most of the evidence to date has emerged from preclinical studies employing different animal models.

Microbiome dysbiosis has been consistently described in many diseases. The pathogenesis and weight regulation mechanism in anorexia nervosa (AN) also seem to be implicated in the dynamic bidirectional adjustment of the microbiota-gut-brain axis. This review aims at elucidating this relationship.This review starts with a description of pathogenic gut-brain pathways. Next, we focus on the latest research on the associations between gut microbiota and weight change in the condition of AN. The strategies to alter the intestinal microbiome for the treatment of this disorder are discussed, including dietary, probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation.Gut microbiome is inextricably linked to AN. It may regulate weight gain in the process of refeeding via the microbiota-gut-brain axis, while the specific mechanism has yet to be clearly established. In the future, a better understanding of gut microbiome could have implications for developing microbiome-based prevention, diagnostics and therapies.",Expert review of gastroenterology & hepatology,2022,Yaohui Wei; Sufang Peng; Cheng Lian; Qing Kang; Jue Chen
35085752,(R)-ketamine ameliorates demyelination and facilitates remyelination in cuprizone-treated mice: A role of gut-microbiota-brain axis.,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common demyelinating disease that attacks the central nervous system. We recently reported that the new antidepressant (R)-ketamine could ameliorate the disease progression in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model of MS. Cuprizone (CPZ) has been used to produce demyelination which resembles demyelination in MS patients. This study was undertaken to investigate whether (R)-ketamine could affect demyelination in CPZ-treated mice and remyelination after CPZ withdrawal. Repeated treatment with (R)-ketamine (10Â mg/kg/day, twice weekly, for 6Â weeks) significantly ameliorated demyelination and activated microglia in the brain compared with saline-treated mice. Furthermore, pretreatment with ANA-12 (TrkB antagonist) significantly blocked the beneficial effects of (R)-ketamine on the demyelination and activated microglia in the brain of CPZ-treated mice. The 16S rRNA analysis showed that (R)-ketamine significantly improved abnormal composition of gut-microbiota and decreased levels of lactic acid of CPZ-treated mice. In addition, there were significant correlations between demyelination (or microglial activation) in the brain and the relative abundance of several microbiome, suggesting a link between gut microbiota and brain. Interestingly, (R)-ketamine could facilitate remyelination in the brain after CPZ withdrawal. In conclusion, the study suggests that (R)-ketamine could ameliorate demyelination in the brain of CPZ-treated mice through TrkB activation, and that gut-microbiota-microglia crosstalk may play a role in the demyelination of CPZ-treated mice. Therefore, it is likely that (R)-ketamine could be a new therapeutic drug for MS.",Neurobiology of disease,2022,Xingming Wang; Lijia Chang; Xiayun Wan; Yunfei Tan; Youge Qu; Jiajing Shan; Yong Yang; Li Ma; Kenji Hashimoto
35279596,"Targeting NLRP3 inflammasome modulates gut microbiota, attenuates corticospinal tract injury and ameliorates neurobehavioral deficits after intracerebral hemorrhage in mice.","Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) has a high mortality and disability rate. Fewer studies focus on white matter injury (WMI) after ICH, especially the corticospinal tract (CST) injury located in the spinal cord, which correlates with motor impairments. Recent studies have shown that gut microbiota dysbiosis occurs after ICH. Furthermore, NLRP3 inflammasome can be activated after ICH, resulting in inflammatory cascade reactions and aggravating brain injury. However, no direct and causal correlation among NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition, altered gut microbiota, and CST injury following ICH has been reported. This study aimed to investigate the effect of MCC950, a selective NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor, on the gut microbiota and CST injury after ICH. We observed that compared with the sham group, the members of Firmicutes, such as Faecalibaculum and Dubosiella, were depleted in the ICH +Â Vehicle group, whereas the members of Proteobacteria and Campilobacterota were enriched, such as Enterobacter and Helicobacter. After treatment with MCC950, the Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium and Paenibacillus were relatively abundant in the gut flora of mice. Moreover, we observed CST injury located in cervical enlargement of the spinal cord, and MCC950 alleviated it. Furthermore, treatment with MCC950 decreased the mNSS score and brain water content in ICH. Taken together, the present study showed that MCC950 modulated gut microbiota, effectively attenuated CST injury located in cervical enlargement of the spinal cord, and ameliorated neurological deficits after ICH. This study provided a novel report that links NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition, gut microbiota alteration and CST injury following ICH and profound implications for ICH treatment.",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2022,Linglong Xiao; Huaping Zheng; Jing Li; Meiqin Zeng; Dian He; Jianhao Liang; Kaijian Sun; Yunhao Luo; Feng Li; Baohong Ping; Wen Yuan; Hongwei Zhou; Qinghua Wang; Haitao Sun
36140263,Alterations of the Composition and Neurometabolic Profile of Human Gut Microbiota in Major Depressive Disorder.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is among the most prevalent mental disorders worldwide. Factors causing the pathogenesis of MDD include gut microbiota (GM), which interacts with the host through the gut-brain axis. In previous studies of GM in MDD patients, 16S rRNA sequencing was used, which provided information about composition but not about function. In our study, we analyzed whole metagenome sequencing data to assess changes in both the composition and functional profile of GM. We looked at the GM of 36 MDD patients, compared with that of 38 healthy volunteers. Comparative taxonomic analysis showed decreased abundances of <i>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</i>, <i>Roseburia hominis</i>, and <i>Roseburia intestinalis</i>, and elevated abundances of <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Ruthenibacterium lactatiformans</i> in the GM of MDD patients. We observed decreased levels of bacterial genes encoding key enzymes involved in the production of arginine, asparagine, glutamate, glutamine, melatonin, acetic, butyric and conjugated linoleic acids, and spermidine in MDD patients. These genes produced signature pairs with <i>Faecalibacterium prausntizii</i> and correlated with decreased levels of this species in the GM of MDD patients. These results show the potential impact of the identified biomarker bacteria and their metabolites on the pathogenesis of MDD, and should be confirmed in future metabolomic studies.",Biomedicines,2022,Alexey S Kovtun; Olga V Averina; Irina Y Angelova; Roman A Yunes; Yana A Zorkina; Anna Y Morozova; Alexey V Pavlichenko; Timur S Syunyakov; Olga A Karpenko; George P Kostyuk; Valery N Danilenko

Seven studies were identified. Neuromodulation was associated with changes in relative bacterial abundances, but not with (changes in) Î±-diversity or Î²-diversity. Summarizing, currently reported findings suggest that neuromodulation interventions are associated with moderate changes in the gut microbiome.

36056574,A Pilot Study of the Gut Microbiota Associated With Depressive Symptoms and Sleep Disturbance Among Chinese and Korean Immigrants in the United States.,"Depression is prevalent among Asian Americans (AsA) during the COVID-19 pandemic, and depression often leads to sleep disturbance in this population. The gut microbiota (GM) plays a critical role in mental health and sleep quality, and the composition of the GM is largely unknown among AsA.Examine associations of the GM with depressive symptoms and sleep disturbance among Chinese and Korean American immigrants.Depressive symptoms (PROMIS Short Form-Depression) and sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI]) were collected via surveys. PROMIS measure T-score > 55 indicates positive depressive symptoms, and a total PSQI score > 5 indicates sleep disturbance. 16S rRNA V3-V4 gene regions were sequenced from fecal specimens to measure GM. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance and linear discriminant analysis effect size were applied to examine associations of the GM with symptoms.Among 20 participants, 55% (<i>n</i> = 11) reported depressive symptoms and 35% (<i>n</i> = 7) reported sleep disturbance. A higher Î±-diversity was marginally associated with lower depressive symptoms: Chao1 (r = -0.39, <i>p</i> = 0.09) and Shannon index (r = -0.41, <i>p</i> = 0.08); Î²-diversity distinguished participants between categories of depressive symptoms (weighted UniFrac, <i>p</i>=0.04) or sleep disturbance (Jaccard, <i>p</i>=0.05). Those with depressive symptoms showed a higher abundance of <i>Actinobacteria,</i> while those without depressive symptoms had a higher abundance of <i>Bacteroidetes</i>. No significant taxa were identified for sleep disturbance.Gut microbial diversity showed promising associations with depressive symptoms and sleep disturbance among Chinese and Korean immigrants.

35631301,Anthocyanins in Chronic Diseases: The Power of Purple.,"Anthocyanins are mainly purple-coloured phenolic compounds of plant origin that as secondary metabolites are important in plant survival. Understanding their health benefits in humans requires sourcing these unstable compounds in sufficient quantities at a reasonable cost, which has led to improved methods of extraction. Dark-coloured fruits, cereals and vegetables are current sources of these compounds. The range of potential sustainable sources is much larger and includes non-commercialised native plants from around the world and agri-waste containing anthocyanins. In the last 5 years, there have been significant advances in developing the therapeutic potential of anthocyanins in chronic human diseases. Anthocyanins exert their beneficial effects through improvements in gut microbiota, oxidative stress and inflammation, and modulation of neuropeptides such as insulin-like growth factor-1. Their health benefits in humans include reduced cognitive decline; protection of organs such as the liver, as well as the cardiovascular system, gastrointestinal tract and kidneys; improvements in bone health and obesity; and regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism. This review summarises some of the sources of anthocyanins and their mechanisms and benefits in the treatment of chronic human diseases.",Nutrients,2022,Sunil K Panchal; Oliver D John; Michael L Mathai; Lindsay Brown

36648872,Obesity and Its Multiple Clinical Implications between Inflammatory States and Gut Microbiotic Alterations.,"Obesity is a chronic multifactorial disease that has become a serious health problem and is currently widespread over the world. It is, in fact, strongly associated with many other conditions, including insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, the onset of different types of malignant tumors and alterations in reproductive function. According to the literature, obesity is characterized by a state of low-grade chronic inflammation, with a substantial increase in immune cells, specifically macrophage infiltrates in the adipose tissue which, in turn, secrete a succession of pro-inflammatory mediators. Furthermore, recent studies on microbiota have postulated new possible mechanisms of interaction between obesity and unbalanced nutrition with inflammation. This intestinal ""superorganism"" complex seems to influence not only the metabolic balance of the host but also the immune response, favoring a state of systemic inflammation and insulin resistance. This review summarizes the major evidence on the interactions between the gut microbiota, energetic metabolism and host immune system, all leading to a convergence of the fields of immunology, nutrients physiology and microbiota in the context of obesity and its possible clinical complications. Finally, possible therapeutic approaches aiming to rebalance the intestinal microbial ecosystem are evaluated to improve the alteration of inflammatory and metabolic states in obesity and related diseases.","Diseases (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,Walter Milano; Francesca Carizzone; Mariagabriella Foia; Magda Marchese; Mariafrancesca Milano; Biancamaria Saetta; Anna Capasso
36271691,Unveiling of dietary and gut-microbiota derived B vitamins: Metabolism patterns and their synergistic functions in gut-brain homeostasis.,"Nutrition-gut cross-talk holds a vital position in sustaining intestinal function, and micronutrient metabolism has emerged as the foremost metabolic pathway to preserve gut homeostasis. Among micronutrients, B vitamins have evolved prior to DNA/RNA and are known for their vital roles for major evolutionary transitions in extant organisms. Despite their universal requirement and critical role, not all the three domains of life are endowed with a natural ability for <i>de novo</i> B vitamins synthesis. The human gut microbiome constitutes prototrophs and auxotroph which are entirely dependent on dietary intake and gut microbial production of B vitamins. The syntrophic metabolism involving cross-feeding of B vitamins and community-wide exchange between commensal bacteria elicit important changes in the diversity and composition of the human gut microbiome. Hereto, we discuss the B-vitamins sharing among prototrophic and auxotrophic gut bacteria, their absorption in small intestine and transport in distal gut, functional role in relation to the gut homeostasis and symptoms linked to their deficiency. We also briefly explore their potential involvement as psychobiotics in brain energetic metabolism (kynurenines/tryptophan pathway) for neurological functions and highlight their deficiency related malfunctioning.",Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2024,Qi Zhan; Rui Wang; Kiran Thakur; Jing-Yu Feng; Yun-Yang Zhu; Jian-Guo Zhang; Zhao-Jun Wei
35600753,Gut microbiome in schizophrenia and antipsychotic-induced metabolic alterations: a scoping review.,"Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a severe mental disorder with high morbidity and lifetime disability rates. Patients with SCZ have a higher risk of developing metabolic comorbidities such as obesity and diabetes mellitus, leading to increased mortality. Antipsychotics (APs), which are the mainstay in the treatment of SCZ, increase the risk of these metabolic perturbations. Despite extensive research, the mechanism underlying SCZ pathophysiology and associated metabolic comorbidities remains unclear. In recent years, gut microbiota (GMB) has been regarded as a 'chamber of secrets', particularly in the context of severe mental illnesses such as SCZ, depression, and bipolar disorder. In this scoping review, we aimed to investigate the underlying role of GMB in the pathophysiology of SCZ and metabolic alterations associated with APs. Furthermore, we also explored the therapeutic benefits of prebiotic and probiotic formulations in managing SCZ and AP-induced metabolic alterations. A systematic literature search yielded 46 studies from both preclinical and clinical settings that met inclusion criteria for qualitative synthesis. Preliminary evidence from preclinical and clinical studies indicates that GMB composition changes are associated with SCZ pathogenesis and AP-induced metabolic perturbations. Fecal microbiota transplantation from SCZ patients to mice has been shown to induce SCZ-like behavioral phenotypes, further supporting the plausible role of GMB in SCZ pathogenesis. This scoping review recapitulates the preclinical and clinical evidence suggesting the role of GMB in SCZ symptomatology and metabolic adverse effects associated with APs. Moreover, this scoping review also discusses the therapeutic potentials of prebiotic/probiotic formulations in improving SCZ symptoms and attenuating metabolic alterations related to APs.",Therapeutic advances in psychopharmacology,2022,Raghunath Singh; Nicolette Stogios; Emily Smith; Jiwon Lee; Kateryna Maksyutynsk; Emily Au; David C Wright; Giada De Palma; Ariel Graff-Guerrero; Philip Gerretsen; Daniel J MÃ¼ller; Gary Remington; Margaret Hahn; Sri Mahavir Agarwal
35526743,The gut microbiome and adult hippocampal neurogenesis: A new focal point for epilepsy?,"Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a neurological disorder affecting millions of people worldwide and currently represents the most common form of focal epilepsy. Thus, the search for aetiological and pathophysiological parameters of TLE is ongoing. Preclinical work and post-mortem human studies suggest adult hippocampal neurogenesis as a potentially relevant factor in TLE pathogenesis. Although progress has been made in elucidating the molecular links between TLE and hippocampal neurogenesis, recent evidence suggests that additional peripheral mediators may be involved. The microbiota-gut-brain axis mediates bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain and could comprise a link between neurogenesis and TLE. In this review, we discuss emerging evidence highlighting a potential role for the gut microbiome in connecting TLE pathogenesis and hippocampal neurogenesis. We focus in particular on mechanisms associated with neuronal excitability, neuroinflammation and gut microbial metabolites. As the evidence does not yet support a direct link between gut microbiota-regulated hippocampal neurogenesis and TLE aetiology or pathophysiology, future studies are needed to establish whether current findings comprise circumstantial links or a potentially novel avenue for clinically relevant research.",Neurobiology of disease,2022,Sebastian Dohm-Hansen; Francisco Donoso; Paul J Lucassen; Gerard Clarke; Yvonne M Nolan
35207483,Novel Pharmacological Approaches to the Treatment of Depression.,"Major depressive disorder is one of the most prevalent mental health disorders. Monoamine-based antidepressants were the first drugs developed to treat major depressive disorder. More recently, ketamine and other analogues were introduced as fast-acting antidepressants. Unfortunately, currently available therapeutics are inadequate; lack of efficacy, adverse effects, and risks leave patients with limited treatment options. Efforts are now focused on understanding the etiology of depression and identifying novel targets for pharmacological treatment. In this review, we discuss promising novel pharmacological targets for the treatment of major depressive disorder. Targeting receptors including N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, G-protein-coupled receptor 39, metabotropic glutamate receptors, galanin and opioid receptors has potential antidepressant effects. Compounds targeting biological processes: inflammation, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, and gut microbiota have also shown therapeutic potential. Additionally, natural products including plants, herbs, and fatty acids improved depressive symptoms and behaviors. In this review, a brief history of clinically available antidepressants will be provided, with a primary focus on novel pharmaceutical approaches with promising antidepressant effects in preclinical and clinical studies.","Life (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,Elias Elias; Ariel Y Zhang; Melissa T Manners
35453597,Gut Microbiota-Brain Axis as a Potential Modulator of Psychological Stress after Spinal Cord Injury.,"A growing body of evidence from preclinical and clinical studies has associated alterations of the gut microbiota-brain axis with the progression and development of a number of pathological conditions that also affect cognitive functions. Spinal cord injuries (SCIs) can be produced from traumatic and non-traumatic causes. It has been reported that SCIs are commonly associated with anxiety and depression-like symptoms, showing an incidence range between 11 and 30% after the injury. These psychological stress-related symptoms are associated with worse prognoses in SCIs and have been attributed to psychosocial stressors and losses of independence. Nevertheless, emotional and mental modifications after SCI could be related to changes in the volume of specific brain areas associated with information processing and emotions. Additionally, physiological modifications have been recognized as a predisposing factor for mental health depletion, including the development of gut dysbiosis. This condition of imbalance in microbiota composition has been shown to be associated with depression in clinical and pre-clinical models. Therefore, the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the relationship between SCIs, gut dysbiosis and psychological stress could contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies to improve SCI patients' quality of life.",Biomedicines,2022,Samir Musleh-Vega; Jorge Ojeda; Pia M Vidal
35135531,Enhanced intestinal protein fermentation in schizophrenia.,"Emerging findings highlighted the associations of mental illness to nutrition and dysbiosis in the intestinal microbiota, but the underlying mechanisms, especially in schizophrenia (SZ), remain unclarified.We conducted a case-control study of SZÂ patients (case to control=100:52) by performing sequencing of theÂ gut metagenome; measurement of fecal and plasma non-targeted metabolome;Â including short-, medium-, and long-chain fatty acids; and targeted metabolites, along with recorded details of daily intakes of food.The metagenome analysis uncovered enrichment of asaccharolytic species and reduced abundance of carbohydrate catabolism pathways and enzymes in the gut of SZ patients, but increased abundance of peptidases in contrast to their significantly reduced protein intake. Fecal metabolome analysis identified increased concentrations of many protein catabolism products, including amino acids (AAs), urea, branched short-chain fatty acids, and various nitrogenous derivates of aromatic AAs in SZ patients. Protein synthesis, represented by the abundance of AA-biosynthesis pathways and aminoacyl-tRNA transferases in metagenome, was significantly decreased. The AUCs (area under the curve) of the diagnostic random forest models based on their abundance achieved 85% and 91%, respectively. The fecal levels of AA-fermentative enzymes and products uniformly showed positive correlations with the severity of psychiatric symptoms.Our findings revealed apparent dysbiosis in the intestinal microbiome of SZ patients, where microbial metabolism is dominated by protein fermentation and shift from carbohydrate fermentation and protein synthesis in healthy conditions.

36363733,"Psycho-Microbiology, a New Frontier for Probiotics: An Exploratory Overview.","Probiotics are gradually gaining importance in the field of psychiatry in the form of psychobiotics. Psychobiotics' studies examine the existing relationship between gut microbiota and mental phenomena; the intake of certain strains of probiotics, such as <i>Bifidobacterium</i> and <i>Lactobacillus</i>, for example, allow the gut microbial system to be modified in order to provide benefits at the psychic, immune, hormonal, and mental levels. Those who suffer from forms of depression, anxiety disorders, chronic stress, low mood, but also people who do not suffer from such disorders, can therefore benefit from the use of psychobiotics. Thanks to probiotics, neurochemicals can in fact be produced within the gut microbiota and interact with receptors of the enteric nervous system that innervate the entire gastrointestinal tract. Once they enter the portal circulation, these substances go on to influence components of the nervous system and ultimately the brain, through what is called the gut-brain axis. This article proposes an exploratory overview of the proven effects of probiotics on brain activity and psycho-related diseases, focusing on clinical studies and measurable outcomes.

34907601,"Intergenerational effects of a paternal Western diet during adolescence on offspring gut microbiota, stress reactivity, and social behavior.","The global consumption of highly processed, calorie-dense foods has contributed to an epidemic of overweight and obesity, along with negative consequences for metabolic dysfunction and disease susceptibility. As it becomes apparent that overweight and obesity have ripple effects through generations, understanding of the processes involved is required, in both maternal and paternal epigenetic inheritance. We focused on the patrilineal effects of a Western-style high-fat (21%) and high-sugar (34%) diet (WD) compared to control diet (CD) during adolescence and investigated F0 and F1 mice for physiological and behavioral changes. F0 males (fathers) showed increased body weight, impaired glycemic control, and decreased attractiveness to females. Paternal WD caused significant phenotypic changes in F1 offspring, including higher body weights of pups, increased Actinobacteria abundance in the gut microbiota (ascertained using 16S microbiome profiling), a food preference for WD pellets, increased male dominance and attractiveness to females, as well as decreased behavioral despair. These results collectively demonstrate the long-term intergenerational effects of a Western-style diet during paternal adolescence. The behavioral and physiological alterations in F1 offspring provide evidence of adaptive paternal programming via epigenetic inheritance. These findings have important implications for understanding paternally mediated intergenerational inheritance, and its relevance to offspring health and disease susceptibility.",FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,2022,Carina Bodden; Terence Y Pang; Yingshi Feng; Faria Mridha; Geraldine Kong; Shanshan Li; Matthew J Watt; Amy C Reichelt; Anthony J Hannan

We report on the first randomised controlled trial (RCT) to examine the effects of a high-prebiotic dietary intervention and probiotic supplements on mental health.""Gut Feelings"" was an 8-week, 2 Ã 2 factorial RCT of 119 adults with moderate psychological distress and low prebiotic food intake. Treatment arms: (1) probiotic supplement and diet-as-usual (probiotic group); (2) high-prebiotic diet and placebo supplement (prebiotic diet group); (3) probiotic supplement and high-prebiotic diet (synbiotic group); and (4) placebo supplement and diet-as-usual (placebo group). The primary outcome was assessment of total mood disturbance (TMD; Profile of Mood States Short Form) from baseline to 8 weeks. Secondary outcomes included anxiety, depression, stress, sleep, and wellbeing measures.A modified intention-to-treat analysis using linear mixed effects models revealed that the prebiotic diet reduced TMD relative to placebo at 8 weeks [Cohen's <i>d</i> = -0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) = -1.18, -0.03; <i>p</i> = 0.039].

Improved anxiety, stress, and sleep were noted in response to the prebiotic diet while the probiotic tentatively improved wellbeing, relative to placebo. No benefit was found in response to the synbiotic intervention. All treatments were well tolerated with few adverse events.A high-prebiotic dietary intervention may improve mood, anxiety, stress, and sleep in adults with moderate psychological distress and low prebiotic intake.

However, the role of spleen nerve in inflammation-related depression remains unclear.The effects of the splenic nerve denervation (SND) in the depression-like phenotype, systemic inflammation, and abnormal composition of gut microbiota in adult mice after administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were examined.LPS (0.5Â mg/kg) caused depression-like phenotype, systemic inflammation, splenomegaly, increased expression of Iba1 (ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1) and decreased expression of postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95) in the hippocampus in the sham-operated mice. In contrast, LPS did not produce depression-like phenotype, and abnormal expressions of Iba1 and PSD-95 in the hippocampus in the SND-operated mice. Furthermore, SND significantly blocked LPS-induced increased plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 although SND did not affect LPS-induced splenomegaly and increased plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor-Î± in mice. There were significant changes in several microbiota among the four groups. Interestingly, there were correlations between the relative abundance of several microbiota and Iba1 (or PSD-95) expression in the hippocampus. In addition, expression of Iba1 in the hippocampus was correlated with the relative abundance of several microbiota.Detailed mechanisms are unclear.These results suggest that the splenic nerve plays a role in inflammation-related depression, microglial activation in the hippocampus, and that gut microbiota may regulate microglial function in the brain via gut-microbiota-brain axis.",Journal of affective disorders,2022,Li Ma; Jiancheng Zhang; Yuko Fujita; Hiroyo Shinno-Hashimoto; Jiajing Shan; Xiayun Wan; Youge Qu; Lijia Chang; Xingming Wang; Kenji Hashimoto
35715396,Experiencing social exclusion changes gut microbiota composition.,"Gut microbiota is suggested to regulate the host's mental health via the gut-brain axis. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the microbiome and psychological pain due to social exclusion. Adult individuals with (nâ=â14) and without (nâ=â25) social exclusion experience were assessed for the psychological status using self-reported questionnaires: Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Beck Depression Inventory, and the UCLA Loneliness Scale. The gut microbiota was analyzed by 16âS rRNA gene sequencing and bioinformatics. The exclusion group had a 1.70-fold higher total BAI score and 2.16-fold higher levels of anxiety-related physical symptoms (pâ<â0.05). The gut microbial profiles also differed between the two groups. The exclusion group showed higher probability of having Prevotella-enriched microbiome (odds ratio, 2.29; 95% confidence interval, 1.65-2.75; pâ<â0.05), a significantly reduced Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, and decreased abundance of Faecalibacterium spp. (pâ<â0.05) which was associated with the duration and intensity of social exclusion (pâ<â0.05). Our results indicate that the psychological pain due to social exclusion is correlated with the gut microbiota composition, suggesting that targeting social exclusion-related microorganisms can be a new approach to solving psychological problems and related social issues.",Translational psychiatry,2022,Chong-Su Kim; Go-Eun Shin; Yunju Cheong; Ji-Hee Shin; Dong-Mi Shin; Woo Young Chun
36421473,New Insights into the Gut Microbiota in Neurodegenerative Diseases from the Perspective of Redox Homeostasis.,"An imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants in the body can lead to oxidative stress, which is one of the major causes of neurodegenerative diseases. The gut microbiota contains trillions of beneficial bacteria that play an important role in maintaining redox homeostasis. In the last decade, the microbiota-gut-brain axis has emerged as a new field that has revolutionized the study of the pathology, diagnosis, and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Indeed, a growing number of studies have found that communication between the brain and the gut microbiota can be accomplished through the endocrine, immune, and nervous systems. Importantly, dysregulation of the gut microbiota has been strongly associated with the development of oxidative stress-mediated neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, a deeper understanding of the relationship between the gut microbiota and redox homeostasis will help explain the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases from a new perspective and provide a theoretical basis for proposing new therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we will describe the role of oxidative stress and the gut microbiota in neurodegenerative diseases and the underlying mechanisms by which the gut microbiota affects redox homeostasis in the brain, leading to neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, we will discuss the potential applications of maintaining redox homeostasis by modulating the gut microbiota to treat neurodegenerative diseases, which could open the door for new therapeutic approaches to combat neurodegenerative diseases.","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,Yu Wang; Zhe Zhang; Bowen Li; Bo He; Lei Li; Edouard C Nice; Wei Zhang; Jia Xu
36437014,Assessment and Treatment of Eating Disorders.,"Eating disorders are serious psychiatric conditions in terms of chronicity and have the highest mortality rate among psychiatric disorders. The assessment and treatment of eating disorders are also challenging, due to patients' denial of their illness and reluctance for change. Despite a large number of previous assessment and treatment studies, new strategies to overcome these difficulties are still needed. This study casts light on four aspects; involvement of the brain's reward system, stages of change in relationship with motivation, refeeding syndrome during renourishment, and gut microbiota changes relating to chronicity. Further studies relating to these aspects are encouraged.",Journal of nutritional science and vitaminology,2022,Kazuhiro Yoshiuchi; Hisashi Yamada; Shu Takakura; Masanori Isobe; Koutatsu Maruyama; Toshihiko Nagata
35432038,The Oral-Microbiome-Brain Axis and Neuropsychiatric Disorders: An Anthropological Perspective.,"In the 21st century, neuropsychiatric disorders (NPDs) are on the rise, yet the causal mechanisms behind this global epidemic remain poorly understood. A key to these unknowns may lie within the vast communities of bacteria, fungi, and viruses in the body (microbiota), which are intimately linked with health and disease. NPDs were recently shown to be connected to gut microbiota, which can communicate with and influence the brain through the Gut-Brain-Axis (GBA). Parallel studies examining oral microbiota and their connections to the brain also suggest that microbes in the mouth can similarly influence NPD outcomes. However, the mechanisms and pathways that illuminate how oral microbiota and brain communicate in NPDs remain unknown. Here, we review identified mechanisms and pathways that oral microbiota use to engage the brain, and we lay the theoretical foundation for an oral-microbiota-brain axis (OMBA). Specifically, we examine established neuroinflammatory and immune system activation responses that underpin interactions between the oral microbiota and the central nervous system (CNS), detailing four specific mechanisms: (1) microbial and metabolite escape, (2) neuroinflammation, (3) CNS signaling, and (4) response to neurohormones. We then scrutinize why including the OMBA, in addition to the GBA, is critically needed to elucidate specific causal relationships between microbial dysbiosis and observed NPD development and progression. Furthermore, we argue for comprehensive, interdisciplinary approaches that integrate lab-based microbiome research and population-level studies that examine the OMBA to improve NPDs. We specifically identify key anthropological perspectives that integrate sociocultural, epidemiological, genetic, and environmental factors that shape the oral microbiome and its interactions with NPDs. Together, future studies of the OMBA in conjunction with interdisciplinary approaches can be used to identify NPD risks and improve outcomes, as well as develop novel intervention and treatment strategies.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2022,Grace B Bowland; Laura S Weyrich
36120376,Neferine alleviates chronic stress-induced depression by regulating monoamine neurotransmitter secretion and gut microbiota structure.,"Neferine (Nef) might possess anti-depressive properties; however, its therapeutic effects are yet to be elucidated. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to explore the anti-depressant property of Nef using a mouse model of chronic stress-induced depression. Fifteen depression-prone mice were randomly selected and divided into three groups, namely, the model, Nef, and fluoxetine (Flu) groups. We observed that in tail suspension and forced swimming tests, the Nef and Flu treatments significantly decreased the immobility time of the depressed mice, and increased their sucrose preference indices. Moreover, both Nef and Flu treatments induced significant increases in the levels of anti-depressant neurotransmitters, including dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT), and norepinephrine (NE), and also reduced pathological damage to the hippocampus of the depressed mice. Incidentally, Illumina MiSeq sequencing analysis demonstrated that the relative abundance of <i>Lactobacillus</i> in the intestinal microbiota of depressed mice was restored after Nef/Flu treatment. Moreover, colonic <i>Lactobacillus</i> abundance was positively correlated with the levels of DA, 5-HT, and NE in the hippocampus of the mice. In conclusion, Nef improved monoamine neurotransmitter secretion and modulated the intestinal flora structure, particularly the abundance of <i>Lactobacillus</i>. Hence, it showed considerable anti-depressant potential, and might be a prospective anti-depressant therapeutic agent.",Frontiers in pharmacology,2022,Zaiquan Dong; Qinglian Xie; Feiyu Xu; Xiaoling Shen; Yanni Hao; Jin Li; Haizhen Xu; Qiang Peng; Weihong Kuang
35286767,Potential of Probiotics as an Adjunct for Patients with Major Depressive Disorder.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is an enfeebling disease with a lifetime incidence of 20%. While accumulating studies implicate a correlation between the disease and gut microbiota, data show that not every patient responded to probiotic treatments. To comprehensively assess the potential role of probiotics in MDD, this study first summarizes the current pathological hypothesis of the disease from a life-stage perspective, focuses on the potential role of ""depression gut microbiota."" Currently available managements are then briefly summarized and novel bio-materials having potential therapeutic effects on MDD are also evaluated. To harness the positive effect of probiotics, prebiotics, and postbiotics, clinical evidence and their applications on MDD patients are listed. Factors that may counteract the pre/probiotic applications, such as diet, physiology, gender difference, and use of antibiotics and antidepressants are also discussed. The endocannabinoid (eCBs) system may be promising targets for probiotic therapy. More evidence is needed to demonstrate the hierarchical factors in the complex network driving the disease, and probiotic can be one promising adjunct for patients with MDD.",Molecular nutrition & food research,2022,Weihe Cang; Junrui Wu; Ruixue Ding; Weiming Wang; Na Li; Haisu Shi; Lin Shi; Yuankun Lee; Rina Wu
36583066,Impact of broad-spectrum antibiotics on the gut-microbiota-spleen-brain axis.,"The spleen is a key immune-related organ that plays a role in communication between the brain and the immune system through the brain-spleen axis and brain-gut-microbiota axis. However, how the gut microbiota affects spleen and brain function remains unclear. Here, we investigated whether microbiome depletion induced by administration of an antibiotic cocktail (ABX) affects spleen and brain function. Treatment with ABX for 14 days resulted in a significant decrease in spleen weight and significant alterations in splenic functions, including the percentage of neutrophils, NK cells, macrophages, and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Furthermore, ABX treatment resulted in the depletion of a large portion of the gut microbiota. Untargeted metabolomics analysis showed that ABX treatment caused alterations in the levels of certain compounds in the plasma, spleen, and brain. Moreover, ABX treatment decreased the expression of microglia marker Iba1 in the cerebral cortex. Interestingly, correlations were found between the abundance of different microbiome components and metabolites in various tissues, as well as splenic cell populations and spleen weight. These findings suggest that ABX-induced microbiome depletion and altered metabolite levels may affect spleen and brain function through the gut-microbiota-spleen-brain axis.","Brain, behavior, & immunity - health",2023,Xiayun Wan; Akifumi Eguchi; Akemi Sakamoto; Yuko Fujita; Yong Yang; Youge Qu; Masahiko Hatano; Chisato Mori; Kenji Hashimoto
36400152,Brain-gut microbiota multimodal predictive model in patients with bipolar depression.,"The ""microbiota-gut-brain axis"" which bridges the brain and gut microbiota is involved in the pathological mechanisms of bipolar disorder (BD), but rare is known about the exact association patterns and the potential for clinical diagnosis and treatment outcome prediction.At baseline, fecal samples and resting-state MRI data were collected from 103 BD depression patients and 39 healthy controls (HCs) for metagenomic sequencing and network-based functional connectivity (FC), grey matter volume (GMV) analyses. All patients then received 4-weeks quetiapine treatment and were further classified as responders and non-responders. Based on pre-treatment datasets, the correlation networks were established between gut microbiota and neuroimaging measures and the multimodal kernal combination support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were constructed to distinguish BD patients from HCs, and quetiapine responders from non-responders.The multi-modal pre-treatment characteristics of quetiapine responders, were closer to the HCs compared to non-responders. And the correlation network analyses found the substantial correlations existed in HC between the Anaerotruncus_ unclassifiedï¼Porphyromonas_asaccharolyticaï¼Actinomyces_graevenitzii et al. and the functional connectomes involved default mode network (DMN),somatomotor (SM), visual, limbic and basal ganglia networks were disrupted in BD. Moreover, in terms of the multimodal classifier, it reached optimized area under curve (AUC-ROC) at 0.9517 when classified BD from HC, and also acquired 0.8292 discriminating quetiapine responders from non-responders, which consistently better than even using the best unique modality.Lack post-treatment and external validation datasets; size of HCs is modest.Multi-modalities of combining pre-treatment gut microbiota with neuroimaging endophenotypes might be a superior approach for accurate diagnosis and quetiapine efficacy prediction in BD.",Journal of affective disorders,2023,Caixi Xi; Ang Li; Jianbo Lai; Xiaojie Huang; Peifen Zhang; Su Yan; Mengfan Jiao; Huimin Huang; Shaohua Hu
36502554,Antibiotic use and the development of depression: A systematic review.,"Increasingly, disruption of the gastrointestinal ecosystem is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of several medical conditions, including depression. Antibiotics can induce substantial changes in the gastrointestinal microbiota and several lines of evidence suggest that antibiotics exposure may increase the risk of developing depression. This systematic review examined this potential association.PubMed, Ovid EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsychINFO databases, as well as unpublished resources, were searched for studies in humans published from 2000 onwards. The studies needed to consider the connection between antibiotic exposure (either alone or in combination with other antibiotics and medications) and the development of depressive symptoms and/or disorders (in isolation to other psychological conditions).Nine studies met the eligibility criteria. All were observational in nature. The studies were conducted in different age groups with various indications for receiving antibiotics. Together, these relatively low-quality studies suggest a potential association between antibiotic exposure and subsequent development of depression symptoms. Specifically, studies from the United Kingdom and Sweden indicate that the risk of depression is increased by at least 20%, with the former (over 1 million participants) reporting an increased risk with the number of courses and agents used, that persists with a slow decline over the ten years following exposure.The inherent limitations associated with the studies' methodologies make a reliable conclusion difficult. While the risk of antimicrobial resistance may prohibit large randomised clinical trials in healthy individuals, future placebo-controlled trials with antibiotics-based protocols (e.g. for acne) should explore their effect on mental health.",Journal of psychosomatic research,2023,Mahsa Pouranayatihosseinabad; Yihienew Bezabih; Jason Hawrelak; Gregory M Peterson; Felicity Veal; Corinne Mirkazemi
36078738,The Role of Psychobiotics to Ensure Mental Health during the COVID-19 Pandemic-A Current State of Knowledge.,"Psychobiotics are defined as probiotics, mainly of the genus <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, that confer mental health benefits to the host when consumed in a particular quantity through the interaction with commensal gut microbiota. The gut microbiota, which means a diverse and dynamic population of microorganisms harboring the gastrointestinal tract, communicates with the brain and vice versa through the brain-gut axis. The mechanisms of action of psychobiotics may be divided into four groups: synthesis of neurotransmitters and neurochemicals, regulation of the HPA axis, influence on the immune system, and synthesis of metabolites. Recent years showed that the COVID-19 pandemic affected not only physical, but also mental health. Social isolation, fear of infection, the lack of adequate vaccine, disinformation, increased number of deaths, financial loss, quarantine, and lockdown are all factors can cause psychiatric problems. The aim of this review was to discuss the potential role of psychobiotic in light of the current problems, based on <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies, meta-analyses, clinical trials evidence, and registered studies assessing probiotics' therapeutic administration in the prevention or treatment of symptoms or side effects of COVID-19.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2022,Dorota ZieliÅska; Marcelina Karbowiak; Aneta Brzezicka
35840611,The effects of probiotics on risk and time preferences.,"Animal models, human neuroimaging and lesion studies revealed that the gut microbiota can influence the interaction between the central and the enteric nervous systems via the gut-brain axis (GBA) and can affect brain regions linked to basic emotional and cognitive processes. The role of the gut microbiota in decision-making in healthy humans thus far remains largely unknown. Our study establishes a functional relationship between the gut microbiota and healthy humans' decisions that involve risk and time. We conducted a between subjects' placebo-controlled double-blinded design, with two groups and two sessions separated by 28Â days, during which participants received daily doses of probiotics or a placebo. We investigated whether the prolonged and controlled intake of probiotics affects risk-taking behavior and intertemporal choices using incentivized economic tasks. We found a significant decrease in risk-taking behavior and an increase in future-oriented choices in the probiotics group as compared to the placebo group. These findings provide the first direct experimental evidence suggesting a potential functional role on the part of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in decision-making, creating a path for potential clinical applications and allowing for a better understanding of the underlying neural mechanisms of risk-taking behavior and intertemporal choices.",Scientific reports,2022,Aline M Dantas; Alexander T Sack; Elisabeth Bruggen; Peiran Jiao; Teresa Schuhmann
36329546,A critical analysis of eating disorders and the gut microbiome.,"The gut microbiota, also known as our ""second brain"" is an exciting frontier of research across a multitude of health domains. Gut microbes have been implicated in feeding behaviour and obesity, as well as mental health disorders including anxiety and depression, however their role in the development and maintenance of eating disorders (EDs) has only recently been considered. EDs are complex mental health conditions, shaped by a complicated interplay of factors. Perhaps due to an incomplete understanding of the etiology of EDs, treatment remains inadequate with affected individuals likely to face many relapses. The gut microbiota may be a missing piece in understanding the etiology of eating disorders, however more robust scientific inquiry is needed in the field before concrete conclusions can be made. In this spotlight paper, we critically evaluate what is known about the bi-directional relationship between gut microbes and biological processes that are implicated in the development and maintenance of EDs, including physiological functioning, hormones, neurotransmitters, the central nervous system, and the immune system. We outline limitations of current research, propose concrete steps to move the field forward and, hypothesize potential clinical implications of this research. Our gut is inhabited by millions of bacteria which have more recently been referred to as ""our second brain"". In fact, these microbes are thought to play a role in ED behaviour, associated anxiety and depression, and even affect our weight. Recent research has dove into this field with promising findings that have the potential to be applied clinically to improve ED recovery. The present paper discusses what is known about the gut microbiome in relation to EDs and the promising implications that leveraging this knowledge, through fecal microbiome transplants, probiotics, and microbiome-directed supplemental foods, could have on ED treatment.",Journal of eating disorders,2022,Sydney M Terry; Jacqueline A Barnett; Deanna L Gibson
36959989,Emerging Role and Place of Probiotics in the Management of Pediatric Neurodevelopmental Disorders.,"The current decade has witnessed significant developments with the latest therapeutic agents for managing various infectious diseases to complex hemato-oncological conditions, leading to a decrease in morbidity and mortality, while improving the quality of life (QoL), and increasing the life span. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), which are on the rise across all age-groups, are being driven by unhealthy lifestyles and improved mental health issues. The current therapeutic agents were found to offer only symptomatic relief of varying efficacy and significant adverse effects, leading clinicians to evaluate other options for the management of both neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. The role of gut microbiota has emerged as a potential target for the treatment of both neurodegenerative diseases and neurodevelopmental disorders like attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)/autism spectrum disorders (ASD) as a result of the decoding of the human genome and advances in our understanding of the human gut microbiome, including its interactions with the human brain. This review has been undertaken to understand on date level of understanding of human microbiota and towards identifying probiotic strains with proven efficacy and safety. According to recent investigations, several <i>lactobacillus</i> strains, including <i>L.</i> <i>Paracasei 37</i>, <i>L. Planetarium 128, L. reuteri DSM 17938</i>, and <i>Bifidobacterium longum</i>, have been effective in treating children's neurodevelopmental disorders such as ASD and ADHD.

Microbiota alterations as well as signs of neuroinflammation have been also reported in ASD. The involvement of immune dysregulation in ASD is further supported by evidence suggesting that maternal immune activation (MIA), especially during early pregnancy, may be a risk factor for ASD. The present study was aimed at characterizing the effects of MIA on behavior, gut microbiota and neuroinflammation in the mouse offspring also considering the impact of MIA in the two sexes. MIA offspring exhibited significant ASD-like behavioral alterations (i.e., deficits in sociability and sensorimotor gating, perseverative behaviors). The analysis of microbiota revealed changes in specific microbial taxa that recapitulated those seen in ASD children. In addition, molecular analyses indicated sex-related differences in the neuroinflammatory responses triggered by MIA, with a more prominent effect in the cerebellum.

Some of microbiota were transplanted into germ-free rats with the intragastric administration of XPJYF grain at the dose of 1.533Â g/kg/day. The behaviors were studied by forced swimming test, open field test, sucrose preference test, and body weight. Products of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis, neurotransmitter, and serum cytokines were investigated by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a biomarker of astrocyte, was quantified using immunofluorescence. Microbiota culturing in vitro after XPJYF treatment was analyze by 16âs RNA sequencing technology. We used lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to mimic activated rat primary astrocyte in vitro.

36191590,Features of gut microbiota in patients with anorexia nervosa.,"Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a psychological disorder, which is characterized by the misunderstanding of body image, food restriction, and low body weight. An increasing number of studies have reported that the pathophysiological mechanism of AN might be associated with the dysbiosis of gut microbiota. The purpose of our study was to explore the features of gut microbiota in patients with AN, hoping to provide valuable information on its pathogenesis and treatment.In this cross-sectional study, from August 2020 to June 2021, patients with AN who were admitted into Peking University Third Hospital and Peking University Sixth Hospital ( n â = â30) were recruited as the AN group, and healthy controls (HC) were recruited from a middle school and a university in Beijing ( n â = â30). Demographic data, Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) scores of the two groups, and length of stay of the AN group were recorded. Microbial diversity analysis of gut microbiota in stool samples from the two groups was analyzed by 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing.The weight (AN vs. HC, [39.31âÂ±â7.90]âkg vs. [56.47âÂ±â8.88]âkg, P â<â0.001) and body mass index (BMI, AN vs. HC, [14.92âÂ±â2.54]âkg/m 2vs. [20.89âÂ±â2.14]âkg/m 2 , P â<â0.001) of patients with AN were statistically significantly lower than those of HC, and HAMD scores in AN group were statistically significantly higher than those of HC.

We included original human studies examining adults and children with impulsive and/or violent behavior that assessed the gut microbiota composition of participants, delivery mode, infant feeding mode, or early antibiotic exposure. Bibliographic searches yielded 429 articles, and 21 met the eligibility criteria. Two studies reported data on patients with schizophrenia with violent behavior, while 19 studies reported data on patients with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The results showed several bacterial taxa associated with ADHD symptomatology and with violent behavior in patients with schizophrenia. No association was found between delivery mode and impulsive behavior, nor did any articles relate infant feeding mode to violent human behavior. Those studies investigating early antibiotic exposure yielded ambiguous results. The heterogeneity of the data and the different methodologies of the included studies limited the external validity of the results. We found few studies that addressed the possible microbiome involvement in the pathophysiology of impulsive and violent behavior in humans. Our review revealed a gap in knowledge regarding links between the gut microbiome and these extreme behavioral patterns.",Behavioural brain research,2023,Michaela LangmajerovÃ¡; Radka RoubalovÃ¡; AntonÃ­n Å ebela; Jan Vevera
35711580,Schizophrenia Patients With Prevotella-Enterotype Have a Higher Risk of Obesity.,"Recent studies have indicated the critical influence of gut microbiota on the occurrence of obesity. There is a significant risk of obesity in people with schizophrenia. This work proposed that the disorder of gut microbiota in patients with schizophrenia was based on microbial enterotypes. Ninety-seven patients with schizophrenia and 69 matched health controls were eligible. The fresh feces of all the subjects were collected and used to complete 16S rRNA sequence. Statistical analysis was performed to identify the intestinal type of gut microbiota and analyze their potential effects on metabolic function. The patients with enterotype-P had a higher BMI than that of the others. Several differences in the gut microbes of enterotype-P were found between the patients and the controls. Proteobacteria and Firmicutes had significantly higher abundance in the patients' group with enterotype-P. The Bacteroidetes had higher abundance in health controls with enterotype-P. Different metabolic pathways of the microbiota with the enterotype-P were identified in the subjects categorized in different BMI intervals. The schizophrenia patients had a significantly higher BMI than that of health controls. The patients with enterotype-P had a higher BMI. Therefore, the enterotype-P might have a critical influence on a variety of metabolic pathways to disturb the metabolism of glucose and lipid in human body.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2022,Ying Liang; Yang Shen; Gaofei Li; Ye Yuan; Meng Zhang; Jiayu Gao
35956395,Positive Effects of Î±-Lactalbumin in the Management of Symptoms of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.,"To date, the involvement of Î±-Lactalbumin (Î±-LA) in the management of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) refers to its ability to improve intestinal absorption of natural molecules like inositols, overcoming the inositol resistance. However, due to its own aminoacidic building blocks, Î±-LA is involved in various biological processes that can open new additional applications. A great portion of women with PCOS exhibit gastrointestinal dysbiosis, which is in turn one of the triggering mechanisms of the syndrome. Due to its prebiotic effect, Î±-LA can recover dysbiosis, also improving the insulin resistance, obesity and intestinal inflammation frequently associated with PCOS. Further observations suggest that altered gut microbiota negatively influence mental wellbeing. Depressive mood and low serotonin levels are indeed common features of women with PCOS. Thanks to its content of tryptophan, which is the precursor of serotonin, and considering the strict link between gut and brain, using Î±-LA contributes to preserving mental well-being by maintaining high levels of serotonin. In addition, considering women with PCOS seeking pregnancy, both altered microbiota and serotonin levels can induce later consequences in the offspring. Therefore, a deeper knowledge of potential applications of Î±-LA is required to transition to preclinical and clinical studies extending its therapeutic advantages in PCOS.",Nutrients,2022,Vincenzo Cardinale; Elisa Lepore; Sabrina Basciani; Salvatore Artale; Maurizio Nordio; Mariano Bizzarri; Vittorio Unfer
36571897,"Repeated use of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine is associated with the resilience in mice after chronic social defeat stress: A role of gut-microbiota-brain axis.","3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), the most widely used illicit compound worldwide, is the most attractive therapeutic drug for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Recent observational studies of US adults demonstrated that lifetime MDMA use was associated with lower risk of depression. Here, we examined whether repeated administration of MDMA can affect resilience versus susceptibility in mice exposed to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS). CSDS produced splenomegaly, anhedonia-like phenotype, and higher plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the saline-treated mice. In contrast, CSDS did not cause these changes in the MDMA-treated mice. Analysis of gut microbiome found several microbes altered between salineÂ +Â CSDS group and MDMAÂ +Â CSDS group. Untargeted metabolomics analysis showed that plasma levels of N-epsilon-methyl-L-lysine in the salineÂ +Â CSDS group were significantly higher than those in the control and MDMAÂ +Â CSDS groups. Interestingly, there were positive correlations between plasma IL-6 levels and the abundance of several microbes (or plasma N-epsilon-methyl-L-lysine) in the three groups. Furthermore, there were also positive correlations between the abundance of several microbes and N-epsilon-methyl-L-lysine in the three groups. In conclusion, these data suggest that repeated administration of MDMA might contribute to stress resilience in mice subjected to CSDS through gut-microbiota-brain axis.",Psychiatry research,2023,Youge Qu; Akifumi Eguchi; Xiayun Wan; Li Ma; Lijia Chang; Jiajing Shan; Yong Yang; Chisato Mori; Kenji Hashimoto
36209779,An exploratory study of the gut microbiota in major depression with anxious distress.,"To explore differences in the diversity and composition of the gut microbiome between major depressive disorder (MDD) with and without anxious distress.The study comprised 117 participants (79 female, 36 male, 2 other, mean age 38.2Â Â±Â 13.4Â years) with a current major depressive episode (MDE) with (nÂ =Â 63) and without (nÂ =Â 54) the anxious distress specifier. A clinical psychologist administered the structured clinical interview for the DSM-5-RV to confirm a diagnosis of depression. Participants provided stool samples which were immediately frozen and stored at -80Â Â°C. These samples were analysed using the Illumina 16S Metagenomics sequencing protocol in which the sequencing primers target the V3 and V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene. Participants also completed mental health questionnaires to assess severity of depression (BDI-II), generalized anxiety (GAD-7), and stress (PSS).There were no significant group differences in Î±-diversity (Shannon's diversity Index; Simpson Index), richness (ACE; Chao1), (Pielou's) evenness, or beta diversity (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index and weighted UniFrac distance) of gut bacteria. Significant group differences in the relative abundance of gut microbiota however were observed at each taxonomical level, including across 15 genera and 18 species.This was an exploratory study that needs to be replicated across larger samples and compared with a healthy control group.The research contributes to knowledge of the depressive gut microbial profile unique to the anxious distress subtype of MDD.",Journal of affective disorders,2023,Gabrielle Ritchie; Esben Strodl; Sophie Parham; Matthew Bambling; Susanna Cramb; Luis Vitetta
36558556,The Effect of Breast Milk Microbiota on the Composition of Infant Gut Microbiota: A Cohort Study.,"Evidence shows that breast milk microbiota and an infantâs gut microbiota are related. This study aimed to compare the effects of breast milk microbiota on the construction and colonization of gut microbiota in newborns. In this study, 23 healthy infants were selected and divided into a breastfeeding group (13) and a mixed feeding group (10) based on the feeding method within one month of age. Infant fecal and breast milk samples were collected on the day of birth (0 day) and 30 days after birth (30 days) for 16S rRNA second-generation sequencing and SCFA detection. The results showed that Firmicutes and Actinobacteriota on day 0 and Firmicutes and Proteobacteria on 30 d dominated breast milk gut microbiota. There were correlations between the breast milk microbiota and the infant gut microbiota in each group (p < 0.05). Additionally, breast milk microbiota correlated more significantly with infantsâ SCFAs in the breastfeeding group than in the mixed feeding group. This study showed that breast milk microbiota partially influences the construction of infant gut microbiota, with some key strains having a crucial influence, such as Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Enterobacter. However, the effect of breast milk microbiota on infant gut microbiota is not through direct strain transmission but has been indirectly influenced, which may be related to the cross-feeding effect mediated by SCFAs.",Nutrients,2022,Yapeng Li; Lei Ren; Yunyi Wang; Jinxing Li; Qingqing Zhou; Chenrui Peng; Yuchen Li; Ruyue Cheng; Fang He; Xi Shen
35312049,Can gut microbiota throughout the first 10 years of life predict executive functioning in childhood?,"Animal models suggest that the gut microbiota can influence cognitive development and functioning via various pathways. In line with that, a first human study found associations between infant fecal microbiota composition and cognition at 2 years of age. This longitudinal study investigated whether fecal microbiota composition in infancy and childhood is associated with executive functioning in childhood. We followed healthy individuals from birth to their 10th year of life. Executive functioning was assessed using the Digit Span working memory test at 10 years of age and the ecologically valid Behavior Rating Inventory for executive functioning at 8 and 10 years. Stool samples were collected at month 1, 3 and 4 as well as at 6 and 10 years. The V4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA was analyzed to determine microbial composition at the genus level. Using established statistical techniques for microbiota analysis, we did not find associations between fecal microbiota composition and executive functioning after accounting for breastfeeding, maternal education, child sex and age. Our study results are most compatible with the absence or only a weak relationship between infant and childhood fecal microbiota composition and executive functioning in childhood in healthy community children.",Developmental psychobiology,2022,Henrik Andreas Eckermann; Yangwenshan Ou; Leo Lahti; Carolina de Weerth
35666299,Gut-microbiota-brain axis in the vulnerability to psychosis in adulthood after repeated cannabis exposure during adolescence.,"Increasing epidemiological evidence shows that the use of cannabis during adolescence could increase the risk for psychosis in adulthood. However, the precise mechanisms underlying long-lasting cannabis-induced risk for psychosis remain unclear. Accumulating evidence suggests the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders. Here, we examined whether gut microbiota plays a role in the risk for psychosis of adult after exposure of cannabinoid (CB) receptor agonist WIN55,212-2 during adolescence. Repeated administration of WIN55,212-2 (2Â mg/kg/day) during adolescence (P35-P45) significantly increased the expression of Iba1 (ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) of adult mice after administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS: 0.5Â mg/kg). In contrast, there were no changes in blood levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines between the two groups. Although alpha-diversity and beta-diversity of gut microbiota were no differences between the two groups, there were several microbes altered between the two groups. Interestingly, there were significant correlations between the relative abundance of microbiota and Iba1 expression in the mPFC and NAc. Furthermore, there were also significant correlations between the relative abundance of microbiota and several metabolites in the blood. These findings suggest that gut microbiota may play a role in the microglial activation in the mPFC and NAc of adult mice after repeated WIN55,212-2 exposure during adolescence. Therefore, it is likely that gut-microbiota-microglia crosstalk might play a role in increased risk for psychosis in adults with cannabis use during adolescence.",European archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience,2022,Xiayun Wan; Akifumi Eguchi; Youge Qu; Yong Yang; Lijia Chang; Jiajing Shan; Chisato Mori; Kenji Hashimoto
35799798,Association Between Non-Suicidal Self-Injury and Gut Microbial Characteristics in Chinese Adolescent.,"By exploring the gut-related microbiota differences of adolescents with non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and depression (without NSSI) and healthy volunteers, we provide a theoretical basis for the prevention and control of NSSI in adolescents through intestinal microecological regulation.A total of 99 subjects were recruited in Guangdong Province, China, including 51 adolescents with NSSI (KD), 24 healthy adolescents (NOR1), and 24 depression adolescents without NSSI (NOR2). General clinical data and fecal samples were collected from all subjects, who were assessed using the NSSI Behavioral Questionnaire and the 24-item Hamilton Depression Scale. The taxonomic composition of the gut microbiota was determined using the 16S rDNA gene sequencing method.There were significant differences in diversity between the KD and NOR1, and the species uniformity index of the KD according to the Shannon and Simpson indices was significantly reduced compared with that of the NOR1 (4.81 vs 5.21, p<0.01; 0.02 vs 0.01, p<0.05). The relative abundances were different among the KD, NOR1 and NOR2, as reflected at the taxonomic levels of class, order, family, genus, and species. Bacteroides were the dominant flora of the KD and NOR2, while Mitsuokella was the dominant flora that distinguished the KD from the NOR2.We found that gut microbiota diversity was decreased in adolescents with NSSI, and the relative abundance was altered at different taxonomic levels. These results enrich the understanding of the relationship between NSSI and depression and the gut microbiota, Supporting that NSSI and depression are not homologous disorders. What is more, it establishes the basis for exploring the mechanisms of flora action in NSSI, providing a possible direction for NSSI to achieve a better prognosis and prevent relapse.",Neuropsychiatric disease and treatment,2022,Li-Fei Cai; Shi-Bin Wang; Cai-Lan Hou; Ze-Bin Li; Yi-Jun Liao; Fu-Jun Jia
36370535,"Gut mycobiota dysbiosis in drug-naÃ¯ve, first-episode schizophrenia.","Bacterial dysbiosis has been demonstrated in patients with schizophrenia (SCH). The aim of the present study was to investigate alterations in mycobiota composition and fungi-bacteria correlation network in drug-naÃ¯ve, first episode SCH. We recruited 205 SCH patients and 125 healthy controls (HCs), whose gut bacterial and fungal compositions were characterized by 16S and 18S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing, respectively. Fungal-bacterial relative correlation network analysis was performed using the Spearman's test and distance correlation. We also computed relative networks connectedness, which represents the ratio of significant interactions (edges) and taxa (nodes) in the network. SCH patients showed lower fungal Î±-diversity compared with that of HCs. Furthermore, we identified 29 differential fungal markers at multiple taxonomies between SCH patients and HCs. SCH patients also showed a significantly lower fungi-to-bacteria Î±-diversity ratio compared with that of HCs (pÂ =Â 1.81Â ÃÂ 10<sup>-8</sup>). In risk prediction models, we observed that combining bacterial and fungal markers achieved higher accuracy than that of bacterial markers alone (AUCÂ =Â 0.847 vs AUCÂ =Â 0.739; pÂ =Â 0.043). Fungal-bacterial correlation network was denser in HCs than in SCH patients and was characterized by a high number of neighbors (pÂ <Â 0.05). In addition, an increased abundance of Purpureocillium was associated with more severe psychiatric symptoms and poorer cognitive function in SCH patients (p <Â 0.05). Our study demonstrated a disrupted and weakened fungi-bacteria network in SCH patients, which might be associated with their clinical manifestations. Future research on fungal-bacterial correlation network is warranted to advance our understanding about the role of mycobiota in the etiology of SCH and to explore novel intervention approaches.",Schizophrenia research,2022,Xiuxia Yuan; Xue Li; Yulin Kang; Lijuan Pang; Gangrui Hei; Xiaoyun Zhang; Shuying Wang; Xinyi Zhao; Siwei Zhang; Qi Tao; Liyuan Zhang; Qiyue Zhu; Luxian Lv; Xiaoduo Fan; Shaohua Hu; Xueqin Song

36699448,The host genetics affects gut microbiome diversity in Chinese depressed patients.,"The gut microbiome and host genetics are both associated with major depressive disorder (MDD); however, the molecular mechanisms among the associations are poorly understood, especially in the Asian, Chinese group. Our study applied linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) and genome-wide association analysis in the cohort with both gut sequencing data and genomics data. We reported the different gut microbiota characteristics between MDD and control groups in the Chinese group and further constructed the association between host genetics and the gut microbiome. <i>Actinobacteria</i> and <i>Pseudomonades</i> were found more in the MDD group. We found significant differences in the ACE and Chao indexes of alpha diversity while no discrepancy in beta diversity. We found three associations between host genetics with microbiome features: beta diversity and rs6108 (<i>p</i> = 8.65 Ã 10<sup>-9</sup>), <i>Actinobacteria</i> and rs77379751 (<i>p</i> = 8.56 Ã 10<sup>-9</sup>), and PWY-5913 and rs1775633082 (<i>p</i> = 4.54 Ã 10<sup>-8</sup>). A species of the <i>Romboutsia</i> genus was co-associated with the species of <i>Ruminococcus gnavus</i> in an internetwork through four genes: <i>METTL8</i>, <i>ITGB2</i>, <i>OTULIN</i>, and <i>PROSER3</i>, with a strict threshold (<i>p</i> < 5 Ã 10<sup>-4</sup>). Furthermore, our findings suggested that the gut microbiome diversity might affect microRNA expression in the brain and influenced <i>SERPINA5</i> and other spatially close genes afterward.

35399732,Gut-Thyroid axis: How gut microbial dysbiosis associated with euthyroid thyroid cancer.,"Thyroid cancer in humans has a fast-growing prevalence, with the most common lethal endocrine malignancy for unknown reasons<b>.</b> The current study was aimed to perform qualitative and quantitative investigation and characterization of the gut bacterial composition of euthyroid thyroid cancer patients. The fecal samples were collected from sixteen euthyroid thyroid cancer patients and ten from healthy subjects. The PCR-DGGE was conducted by targetting the V3 region of 16S rRNA gene, as well as real-time PCR for <i>Bacteroides vulgatus, E.coli Bifidobacterium, Clostridium leptum</i> and <i>Lactobacillus</i> were carried. High-throughput sequencing of V3+V4 region of 16S rRNA gene was performed on Hiseq 2500 platform on 20 (10 healthy & 10 diseased subjects) randomly selected fecal samples. The richness indices and comparative diversity analysis showed significant gut microbial modification in euthyroid thyroid cancer than control. At phylum level, there was significant enrichment of Firmicutes, Verrucomicrobia, while a significant decrease in Bacteroidetes was detected in the experimental group. At family statistics, significant high levels of Ruminococcaceae and Verrucomicrobiaceae, while the significant lower abundance of Bacteroidaceae, Prevotellaceae, Porphyromonadaceae, and Alcaligenaceae was after observed. It also found that the significantly raised level of <i>Escherichia-Shigella, Akkermansia</i> [Eubacterium]_coprostanoligenes<i>, Dorea, Subdoligranulum,</i> and <i>Ruminococcus_2 genera,</i> while significantly lowered genera of the patient group were <i>Prevotella_9</i>, <i>Bacteroides</i> and <i>Klebsiella</i>. The species-level gut microbial composition showed a significantly raised level of <i>Escherichia coli in</i> euthyroid thyroid cancer. Thus, this study reveals that euthyroid thyroid cancer patients have significant gut microbial dysbiosis. Moreover, Statistics (P<0.05) of each gut microbial taxa were significantly changed in euthyroid thyroid cancer patients. Therefore, the current study may propose new approaches to understanding thyroid cancer patients' disease pathways, mechanisms, and treatment.",Journal of Cancer,2022,Hafiz Muhammad Ishaq; Imran Shair Mohammad; Riaz Hussain; Rashida Parveen; Jafir Hussain Shirazi; Yang Fan; Muhammad Shahzad; Khezar Hayat; Huan Li; Ayesha Ihsan; Kiran Sher Muhammad; Muhammad Usman; Siruo Zhang; Lu Yuan; Shakir Ullah; Ana ClÃ¡udia Paiva-Santos; Jiru Xu
36191806,A role of gut-microbiota-brain axis via subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve in depression-like phenotypes in Chrna7 knock-out mice.,"The Î±7 subtype of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (Î±7 nAChR: coded by Chrna7) is known to regulate the cholinergic ascending anti-inflammatory pathway. We previously reported that Chrna7 knock-out (KO) mice show depression-like behaviors through abnormal composition of gut microbiota and systemic inflammation. Given the role of subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve in gut-microbiota-brain axis, we investigated whether subdiaphragmatic vagotomy (SDV) could affect depression-like behaviors, abnormal composition of gut microbiota, and microbes-derived metabolites in Chrna7 KO mice. SDV blocked depression-like behaviors and reduced expression of synaptic proteins in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of Chrna7 KO mice. LEfSe (linear discriminant analysis effect size) analysis revealed that the species Lactobacillus sp. BL302, the species Lactobacillus hominis, and the species Lactobacillus reuteri, were identified as potential microbial markers in the KOÂ +Â SDV group. There were several genus and species altered among the three groups [wild-type (WT)Â +Â sham group, KOÂ +Â sham group, KOÂ +Â SDV group]. Furthermore, there were several plasma metabolites altered among the three groups. Moreover, there were correlations between relative abundance of several microbiome and behavioral data (or synaptic proteins). Network analysis showed correlations between relative abundance of several microbiome and plasma metabolites (or behavioral data). These data suggest that Chrna7 KO mice produce depression-like behaviors and reduced expression of synaptic proteins in the mPFC through gut-microbiota-brain axis via subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve.",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,2023,Yong Yang; Akifumi Eguchi; Xiayun Wan; Lijia Chang; Xingming Wang; Youge Qu; Chisato Mori; Kenji Hashimoto
35967810,The Potential of Honey as a Prebiotic Food to Re-engineer the Gut Microbiome Toward a Healthy State.,"Honey has a long history of use for the treatment of digestive ailments. Certain honey types have well-established bioactive properties including antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities. In addition, honey contains non-digestible carbohydrates in the form of oligosaccharides, and there is increasing evidence from <i>in vitro</i>, animal, and pilot human studies that some kinds of honey have prebiotic activity. Prebiotics are foods or compounds, such as non-digestible carbohydrates, that are used to promote specific, favorable changes in the composition and function of the gut microbiota. The gut microbiota plays a critical role in human health and well-being, with disturbances to the balance of these organisms linked to gut inflammation and the development and progression of numerous conditions, such as colon cancer, irritable bowel syndrome, obesity, and mental health issues. Consequently, there is increasing interest in manipulating the gut microbiota to a more favorable balance as a way of improving health by dietary means. Current research suggests that certain kinds of honey can reduce the presence of infection-causing bacteria in the gut including <i>Salmonella</i>, <i>Escherichia coli</i>, and <i>Clostridiodes difficile</i>, while simultaneously stimulating the growth of potentially beneficial species, such as <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Bifidobacteria.</i> In this paper, we review the current and growing evidence that shows the prebiotic potential of honey to promote healthy gut function, regulate the microbial communities in the gut, and reduce infection and inflammation. We outline gaps in knowledge and explore the potential of honey as a viable option to promote or re-engineer a healthy gut microbiome.",Frontiers in nutrition,2022,Kathleen R Schell; Kenya E Fernandes; Erin Shanahan; Isabella Wilson; Shona E Blair; Dee A Carter; Nural N Cokcetin
36058421,Altered gut microbiota correlates with behavioral problems but not gastrointestinal symptoms in individuals with autism.,"Despite inconsistent results across studies, emerging evidence suggests that the microbial micro-environment may be associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Geographical and cultural factors highly impact microbial profiles, and there is a shortage of data from East Asian populations. This study aimed to comprehensively characterize microbial profiles in an East Asian sample and explore whether gut microbiota contributes to clinical symptoms, emotional/behavioral problems, and GI symptoms in ASD.We assessed 82 boys and young men with ASD and 31 typically developing controls (TDC), aged 6-25Â years. We analyzed the stool sample of all participants with 16S V3-V4 rRNA sequencing and correlated its profile with GI symptoms, autistic symptoms, and emotional/behavioral problems.Autistic individuals, compared to TDC, had worse GI symptoms. There were no group differences in alpha diversity of species richness estimates (Shannon-wiener and Simpson diversity indices). Participants with ASD had an increased relative abundance of Fusobacterium, Ruminococcus torques group (at the genus level), and Bacteroides plebeius DSM 17135 (at the species level), while a decreased relative abundance of Ruminococcaceae UCG 013, Ervsipelotrichaceae UCG 003, Parasutterella, Clostridium sensu stricto 1, Turicibacter (at the genus level), and Clostridium spiroforme DSM 1552 and Intestinimonas butyriciproducens (at the species level). Altered taxonomic diversity in ASD significantly correlated with autistic symptoms, thought problems, delinquent behaviors, self dysregulation, and somatic complaints. We did not find an association between gut symptoms and gut microbial dysbiosis.Our findings suggest that altered microbiota are associated with behavioral phenotypes but not GI symptoms in ASD. The function of the identified microbial profiles mainly involves the immune pathway, supporting the hypothesis of a complex relationship between altered microbiome, immune dysregulation, and ASD that may advance the discovery of molecular biomarkers for ASD.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2022,Yu-Chieh Chen; Hsiang-Yuan Lin; Yiling Chien; Yu-Hung Tung; Yen-Hsuan Ni; Susan Shur-Fen Gau
35981685,Depression-like behaviors in mouse model of SjÃ¶gren's syndrome: A role of gut-microbiota-brain axis.,"Depression is a common psychiatric symptom in patients with SjÃ¶gren's syndrome (SS). Prevalence of depression in SS patients is significantly higher than that in the general population. Increasing evidence suggests a crucial role of gut-microbiota-brain axis in depression. In this study, we investigated whether non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, a widely used animal model of SS, exhibit depression-like phenotypes and abnormal composition of gut microbiota. Eleven-week-old NOD mice spontaneously exhibited SS-related symptoms without pancreatic destruction. NOD mice displayed depression-like behaviors, decreased expression of synaptic proteins in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and abnormal composition of gut microbiota. Interestingly, SS-related proinflammatory factors in the submandibular gland (SMG) and autoantibodies (anti-SSA and anti-SSB) in the plasma were correlated with the expression of synaptic proteins in the PFC or depression-like behaviors. In addition, there were correlations between the relative abundance of microbiota and SS-related symptoms (or depression-related phenotypes). These data suggest that SS-related symptoms and abnormal composition of gut microbiota may play a role in depression-like phenotypes in NOD mice through gut-microbiota-brain axis.","Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior",2022,Yaoyu Pu; Yangyang He; Xueting Zhao; Qiuping Zhang; Ji Wen; Kenji Hashimoto; Yi Liu
36550632,Oxymatrine ameliorates white matter injury by modulating gut microbiota after intracerebral hemorrhage in mice.,"White matter injury (WMI) significantly affects neurobehavioral recovery in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) patients. Gut dysbiosis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders. Oxymatrine (OMT) has therapeutic effects on inflammation-mediated diseases. Whether OMT exerts therapeutic effects on WMI after ICH and the role of gut microbiota involved in this process is largely unknown.Neurological deficits, WMI, gut microbial composition, intestinal barrier function, and systemic inflammation were investigated after ICH. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) was performed to elucidate the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of ICH.OMT promoted long-term neurological function recovery and ameliorated WMI in the peri-hematoma region and distal corticospinal tract (CST) region after ICH. ICH induced significant and persistent gut dysbiosis, which was obviously regulated by OMT. In addition, OMT alleviated intestinal barrier dysfunction and systemic inflammation. Correlation analysis revealed that gut microbiota alteration was significantly correlated with inflammation, intestinal barrier permeability, and neurological deficits after ICH. Moreover, OMT-induced gut microbiota alteration could confer protection against neurological deficits and intestinal barrier disruption.Our study demonstrates that OMT ameliorates ICH-induced WMI and neurological deficits by modulating gut microbiota.",CNS neuroscience & therapeutics,2023,Jing Li; Jianhao Liang; Meiqin Zeng; Kaijian Sun; Yunhao Luo; Huaping Zheng; Feng Li; Wen Yuan; Hongwei Zhou; Junshan Liu; Haitao Sun
35309241,Consensus on potential biomarkers developed for use in clinical tests for schizophrenia.,"Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness affecting approximately 20 million individuals globally. Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the illness. If left undiagnosed and untreated, schizophrenia results in impaired social function, repeated hospital admissions, reduced quality of life and decreased life expectancy. Clinical diagnosis largely relies on subjective evidence, including self-reported experiences, and reported behavioural abnormalities followed by psychiatric evaluation. In addition, psychoses may occur along with other conditions, and the symptoms are often episodic and transient, posing a significant challenge to the precision of diagnosis. Therefore, objective, specific tests using biomarkers are urgently needed for differential diagnosis of schizophrenia in clinical practice.We aimed to provide evidence-based and consensus-based recommendations, with a summary of laboratory measurements that could potentially be used as biomarkers for schizophrenia, and to discuss directions for future research.We searched publications within the last 10 years with the following keywords: 'schizophrenia', 'gene', 'inflammation', 'neurotransmitter', 'protein marker', 'gut microbiota', 'pharmacogenomics' and 'biomarker'. A draft of the consensus was discussed and agreed on by all authors at a round table session.We summarised the characteristics of candidate diagnostic markers for schizophrenia, including genetic, inflammatory, neurotransmitter, peripheral protein, pharmacogenomic and gut microbiota markers. We also proposed a novel laboratory process for diagnosing schizophrenia in clinical practice based on the evidence summarised in this paper.Further efforts are needed to identify schizophrenia-specific genetic and epigenetic markers for precise diagnosis, differential diagnosis and ethnicity-specific markers for the Chinese population. The development of novel laboratory techniques is making it possible to use these biomarkers clinically to diagnose disease.",General psychiatry,2022,Ping Lin; Junyu Sun; Xiaoyan Lou; Dan Li; Yun Shi; Zhenhua Li; Peijun Ma; Ping Li; Shuzi Chen; Weifeng Jin; Shuai Liu; Qing Chen; Qiong Gao; Lili Zhu; Jie Xu; Mengyuan Zhu; Mengxia Wang; Kangyi Liang; Ling Zhao; Huabin Xu; Ke Dong; Qingtian Li; Xunjia Cheng; Jinghong Chen; Xiaokui Guo
36365032,The Role of the Microbiome in the Metabolic Health of People with Schizophrenia and Related Psychoses: Cross-Sectional and Pre-Post Lifestyle Intervention Analyses.,"The microbiome has been implicated in the development of metabolic conditions which occur at high rates in people with schizophrenia and related psychoses. This exploratory proof-of-concept study aimed to: (i) characterize the gut microbiota in antipsychotic naÃ¯ve or quasi-naÃ¯ve people with first-episode psychosis, and people with established schizophrenia receiving clozapine therapy; (ii) test for microbiome changes following a lifestyle intervention which included diet and exercise education and physical activity. Participants were recruited from the Eastern Suburbs Mental Health Service, Sydney, Australia. Anthropometric, lifestyle and gut microbiota data were collected at baseline and following a 12-week lifestyle intervention. Stool samples underwent 16S rRNA sequencing to analyse microbiota diversity and composition. Seventeen people with established schizophrenia and five people with first-episode psychosis were recruited and matched with 22 age-sex, BMI and ethnicity matched controls from a concurrent study for baseline comparisons. There was no difference in Î±-diversity between groups at baseline, but microbial composition differed by 21 taxa between the established schizophrenia group and controls. In people with established illness pre-post comparison of Î±-diversity showed significant increases after the 12-week lifestyle intervention. This pilot study adds to the current literature that detail compositional differences in the gut microbiota of people with schizophrenia compared to those without mental illness and suggests that lifestyle interventions may increase gut microbial diversity in patients with established illness. These results show that microbiome studies are feasible in patients with established schizophrenia and larger studies are warranted to validate microbial signatures and understand the relevance of lifestyle change in the development of metabolic conditions in this population.","Pathogens (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,Maryanne O'Donnell; Scott B Teasdale; Xin-Yi Chua; Jamie Hardman; Nan Wu; Jackie Curtis; Katherine Samaras; Patrick Bolton; Margaret J Morris; Cyndi Shannon Weickert; Tertia Purves-Tyson; Fatima El-Assaad; Xiao-Tao Jiang; Georgina L Hold; Emad El-Omar

35937875,Gut microbiome: A potential indicator for predicting treatment outcomes in major depressive disorder.,"The therapeutic outcomes in major depressive disorder (MDD), one of the most common and heterogeneous mental illnesses, are affected by factors that remain unclear and often yield unsatisfactory results. Herein, we characterized the composition and metabolic function of the gut microbiota of patients with MDD during antidepressant treatment, based on 16S rRNA sequencing and metabolomics. The microbial signatures at baseline differed significantly between responder and non-responder groups. The gut microbiota of the non-responder group was mainly characterized by increased relative abundances of the phylum Actinobacteria, families Christensenellaceae and Eggerthellaceae, and genera <i>Adlercreutzia</i> and <i>Christensenellaceae R7 group</i> compared to that of the responder group. Additionally, the gut microbiota composition of the responder and non-responder groups differed significantly before and after treatment, especially at the genus level. Moreover, 20 differential metabolites between the responder and non-responder groups were identified that were mainly involved in lipid metabolism (cholestane steroids and steroid esters). Eggerthellaceae and <i>Adlercreutzia</i> displayed strong co-occurrence relationships with certain metabolites, suggesting alternations in the gut microbiome, and associated metabolites may be potential mediators of successful antidepressant treatment. Overall, our study demonstrates that alterations in gut microbiota composition and metabolic function might be relevant to the response to antidepressants, thereby providing insight into mechanisms responsible for their efficacy.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2022,Zaiquan Dong; Xiaoling Shen; Yanni Hao; Jin Li; Haizhen Xu; Li Yin; Weihong Kuang
36088985,A role of microRNA-149 in the prefrontal cortex for prophylactic actions of (R)-ketamine in inflammation model.,"MicroRNAs (or miRNAs) are short, regulatory RNAs that act as post-transcriptional repressors of gene expression. Recently, we reported that the nuclear factor of activated T cells 4 (NFATc4) signaling might contribute to sustained prophylactic effects of new antidepressant (R)-ketamine in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated inflammation model of depression. In this study, we examined the role of miRNAs (miR-149 and miR-7688-5p) which can regulate NFATc4 in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of male mice after administration of LPS (1.0Â mg/kg). There was a positive correlation between the expression of Nfatc4 and the expression of miR-149 in the PFC. There was also a negative correlation between gene expression of Nfatc4 and gene expression of miR-7688-5p in the PFC. Gut microbiota analysis showed that pretreatment with (R)-ketamine (10Â mg/kg) could restore altered composition of gut microbiota in LPS-treated mice. A network analysis showed that gut microbiota may regulate gene expression of Nfatc4 and miR-149 (or miR-7688-5p) in the PFC. Finally, inhibition of miR-149 by antagomiR-149 blocked LPS-induced depression-like behavior by attenuating LPS-induced expression of NFATc4 in the PFC. These findings suggest that the regulation of NFATc4 signaling by miR-149 might play a role in persistent prophylactic effects of (R)-ketamine, and that gut microbiota may regulate the gene expression of miRNAs in the PFC through gut-microbiota-brain axis.",Neuropharmacology,2022,Li Ma; Long Wang; Lijia Chang; Jiajing Shan; Youge Qu; Xingming Wang; Yuko Fujita; Kenji Hashimoto
36358286,The Effect of Long-Term Moderate Static Magnetic Field Exposure on Adult Female Mice.,"Because of the high cost and safety of ultra-high magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), its application has certain limitations. Whereas 0.5â3 T MRI has been widely applied in hospitals, static magnetic fields (SMFs) have been shown to improve mice mental health and have anti-tumor potentials. Here, we compared the effects of the upward and downward 150 mT SMF groups with the sham group on C57BL/6J adult female mice. Locomotor and exploratory activity were also measured by behavioral tests, including the open field and elevated plus test. Additionally, physiology, pathology indicators and gut microbiota were examined. We found that 150 mT SMFs long-term exposure enhanced locomotive and exploratory activity of mice, especially the downward 150 mT SMF. Compared with the downward 150 mT SMF group, the movement speed and distance in the center area of the sham group were increased by 65.99% (p < 0.0001) and 68.58% (p = 0.0038), respectively. Moreover, compared to the sham group, downward 150 mT SMF increased the number of entrances to the center area by 67.0% (p = 0.0082) and time in the center area by 77.12% (p = 0.0054). Additionally, we observed that upward 150 mT SMF improved the number of follicles (~2.5 times, p = 0.0325) and uterine glands through increasing the total antioxidant capacity and reducing lipid peroxidation level in mice. Gut microbiome analysis showed that 150 mT SMFs long-term exposure improved the microbiota abundance (Clostridium, Bifidobacterium, Ralstonia and Yaniella) in the genus level, which may affect metabolism, anxiety and behavior in adult female mice. Our results demonstrated that 150 mT SMFs long-term exposure not only had good biosafety, but also improved athletic performance, emotion and the function of ovarian, uterine and gut microbiota abundance in adult female mice, which unraveled the potential of moderate long-term SMF exposure in clinical applications.",Biology,2022,Xingxing Yang; Biao Yu; Chao Song; Chuanlin Feng; Jing Zhang; Xinyu Wang; Guofeng Cheng; Rui Yang; Wei Wang; Yong Zhu
35352107,Psychobiotics in diet: significance and applications of neuroactive and psychoactive microbial metabolites.,"The brain governs psychiatric behavior of an individual by regulating certain neuroactive compounds produced within the body. These might also be produced by the microbes present in the gut, along with certain probiotic strains: the psychobiotics. A healthy diet including psychobiotics plays an important role in neurological functioning by producing a number of psychoactive compounds. Health benefits of probiotic microorganisms to the host and their psychoactive metabolites involved in the alternation of brain functioning are summarized in this article. The effect of diet on gut microbiota is highlighted, along with the possibility of probiotic bacteria as psychobiotics in the treatment or prevention of mental health-related disorders. The psychobiotic formulations seem to be a step toward precision probiotics development.",Nutrition reviews,2022,Rajat Giri; Rakesh Kumar Sharma
36158270,Associations of gut microbiota with dyslipidemia based on sex differences in subjects from Northwestern China.,"The gut microbiota (GM) has been proven to play a role in the regulation of host lipid metabolism, which provides a new theory about the pathogenesis of dyslipidemia. However, the associations of GM with dyslipidemia based on sex differences remain unclear and warrant elucidation.To investigate the associations of GM features with serum lipid profiles based on sex differences in a Chinese population.This study ultimately recruited 142 participants (73 females and 69 males) at Honghui Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University. The anthropometric and blood metabolic parameters of all participants were measured. According to their serum lipid levels, female and male participants were classified into a high triglyceride (H_TG) group, a high total cholesterol (H_CHO) group, a low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (L_HDL-C) group, and a control (CON) group with normal serum lipid levels. Fresh fecal samples were collected for 16S rRNA gene sequencing. UPARSE software, QIIME software, the RDP classifier and the FAPROTAX database were used for sequencing analyses.The GM composition at the phylum level included Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes as the core GM. Different GM features were identified between females and males, and the associations between GM and serum lipid profiles were different in females and males. The GM features in different dyslipidemia subgroups changed in both female patients and male patients. Proteobacteria, Lactobacillaceae, <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Lactobacillus_salivarius</i> were enriched in H_CHO females compared with CON females, while Coriobacteriia were enriched in L_HDL-C females. In the comparison among the three dyslipidemia subgroups in females, <i>Lactobacillus_salivarius</i> were enriched in H_CHO females, and Prevotellaceae were enriched in L_HDL-C females. Compared with CON or H_TG males, Prevotellaceae, <i>unidentified_Ruminococcaceae</i>, <i>Roseburia</i> and <i>Roseburia_inulinivorans</i> were decreased in L_HDL-C males (<i>P</i> value < 0.05), and linear discriminant analysis effect size analysis indicated an enrichment of the above GM taxa in H_TG males compared with other male subgroups. Additionally, <i>Roseburia_inulinivorans</i> abundance was positively correlated with serum TG and total cholesterol levels, and <i>Roseburia</i> were positively correlated with serum TG level. Furthermore, Proteobacteria (0.724, 95%CI: 0.567-0.849), Lactobacillaceae (0.703, 95%CI: 0.544-0.832), <i>Lactobacillus</i> (0.705, 95%CI: 0.547-0.834) and <i>Lactobacillus_salivarius</i> (0.706, 95%CI: 0.548-0.835) could distinguish H_CHO females from CON females, while Coriobacteriia (0.710, 95%CI: 0.547-0.841), Coriobacteriales (0.710, 95%CI: 0.547-0.841), Prevotellaceae (0.697, 95%CI: 0.534-0.830), <i>Roseburia</i> (0.697, 95%CI: 0.534-0.830) and <i>Roseburia_inulinivorans</i> (0.684, 95%CI: 0.520-0.820) could discriminate H_TG males from CON males. Based on the predictions of GM metabolic capabilities with the FAPROTAX database, a total of 51 functional assignments were obtained in females, while 38 were obtained in males. This functional prediction suggested that cellulolysis increased in L_HDL-C females compared with CON females, but decreased in L_HDL-C males compared with CON males.This study indicates associations of GM with serum lipid profiles, supporting the notion that GM dysbiosis may participate in the pathogenesis of dyslipidemia, and sex differences should be considered.",World journal of gastroenterology,2022,Lei Guo; Yang-Yang Wang; Ji-Han Wang; He-Ping Zhao; Yan Yu; Guo-Dong Wang; Kun Dai; Yu-Zhu Yan; Yan-Jie Yang; Jing Lv
36216056,Effects of urban particulate matter on gut microbiome and partial schizophrenia-like symptoms in mice: Evidence from shotgun metagenomic and metabolomic profiling.,"Epidemiological evidence reported that particulate matter (PM) was associated with increased schizophrenia (SCZ) risk. Disturbance of gut microbiome was involved in SCZ. However, it remains unclear whether PM induces SCZ-like symptoms and how gut microbiome regulates them. Therefore, a multi-omics animal experiment was conducted to verify how urban PM induces SCZ-like behavior and altered gut microbiota and metabolic pathways.Using a completely random design, mice were divided into three groups: PM group, control group and MK801 group, which received daily tracheal instillation of PM solution, sterile PBS solution and intraperitoneal injection of MK801 (establish SCZ model), respectively. After a 14-day intervention, feces were collected for multi-omics testing (shotgun metagenomic sequencing and untargeted metabolomic profiling), followed by open field test, tail suspension test, and passive avoidance test. Besides, fecal microbiome of PM group and control group were transplanted into ""pseudo-sterile"" mice, then behavioral tests were conducted.Similar to MK801 group, mice in PM group showed SCZ-like symptoms, including increased spontaneous activity, excitability, anxiety and decreased learning and spatial memory. PM exposure significantly increased the relative abundance of Verrucomicrobia and decreased that of Fibrobacteres et al. The metabolism pathways of estrogen signaling (estriol, 16-glucuronide-estriol and 21-desoxycortisol) and choline metabolism (phosphocholine) were significantly altered by PM exposure. Verrucomicrobia was negatively correlated with the level of estriol, which was correlated with decreased learning and spatial memory. Fibrobacteres and Deinococcus-Thermus were positively correlated with the level of phosphocholine, which was correlated with increased spontaneous activity, excitability and anxiety. Fecal microbiome transplantation from PM group mice reproduced excitability and anxiety symptoms.Exposure to PM may affect composition of gut microbiome and alterations of estrogen signaling pathway and choline metabolism pathway, which were associated with partial SCZ-like behaviors. But whether gut microbiome regulates these metabolic pathways and behaviors remains to be determined.",The Science of the total environment,2023,Weizhuo Yi; Yifu Ji; Hua Gao; Shengyong Luo; Rubing Pan; Jian Song; Yangyang He; Yuxuan Li; Yudong Wu; Shuangshuang Yan; Yunfeng Liang; Xiaoni Sun; Xiaoyu Jin; Lu Mei; Jian Cheng; Hong Su
36244970,Depression and fatigue in active IBD from a microbiome perspective-a Bayesian approach to faecal metagenomics.,"Extraintestinal symptoms are common in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and include depression and fatigue. These are highly prevalent especially in active disease, potentially due to inflammation-mediated changes in the microbiota-gut-brain axis. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between structural and functional microbiota characteristics and severity of fatigue and depressive symptoms in patients with active IBD.We included clinical data of 62 prospectively enrolled patients with IBD in an active disease state. Patients supplied stool samples and completed the questionnaires regarding depression and fatigue symptoms. Based on taxonomic and functional metagenomic profiles of faecal gut microbiota, we used Bayesian statistics to investigate the associative networks and triangle motifs between bacterial genera, functional modules and symptom severity of self-reported fatigue and depression.Associations with moderate to strong evidence were found for 3 genera (Odoribacter, Anaerotruncus and Alistipes) and 3 functional modules (pectin, glycosaminoglycan and central carbohydrate metabolism) with regard to depression and for 4 genera (Intestinimonas, Anaerotruncus, Eubacterium and Clostridiales g.i.s) and 2 functional modules implicating amino acid and central carbohydrate metabolism with regard to fatigue.This study provides the first evidence of association triplets between microbiota composition, function and extraintestinal symptoms in active IBD. Depression and fatigue were associated with lower abundances of short-chain fatty acid producers and distinct pathways implicating glycan, carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. Our results suggest that microbiota-directed therapeutic approaches may reduce fatigue and depression in IBD and should be investigated in future research.",BMC medicine,2022,Anne Kerstin Thomann; Torsten WÃ¼stenberg; Jakob Wirbel; Laura-Louise Knoedler; Philipp Arthur Thomann; Georg Zeller; Matthias Philip Ebert; Stefanie Lis; Wolfgang Reindl
36493975,Key role of the gut-microbiota-brain axis via the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve in demyelination of the cuprizone-treated mouse brain.,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common demyelinating disease that attacks the central nervous system. Dietary intake of cuprizone (CPZ) produces demyelination resembling that of patients with MS. Given the role of the vagus nerve in gut-microbiota-brain axis in development of MS, we performed this study to investigate whether subdiaphragmatic vagotomy (SDV) affects demyelination in CPZ-treated mice. SDV significantly ameliorated demyelination and microglial activation in the brain compared with sham-operated CPZ-treated mice. Furthermore, 16S ribosomal RNA analysis revealed that SDV significantly improved the abnormal gut microbiota composition of CPZ-treated mice. An untargeted metabolomic analysis demonstrated that SDV significantly improved abnormal blood levels of metabolites in CPZ-treated mice compared with sham-operated CPZ-treated mice. Notably, there were correlations between demyelination or microglial activation in the brain and the relative abundance of several microbiome populations, suggesting a link between gut microbiota and the brain. There were also correlations between demyelination or microglial activation in the brain and blood levels of metabolites. Together, these data suggest that CPZ produces demyelination in the brain through the gut-microbiota-brain axis via the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve.",Neurobiology of disease,2023,Xingming Wang; Akifumi Eguchi; Yong Yang; Lijia Chang; Xiayun Wan; Jiajing Shan; Youge Qu; Li Ma; Chisato Mori; Jianjun Yang; Kenji Hashimoto
35788394,Long-lasting beneficial effects of maternal intake of sulforaphane glucosinolate on gut microbiota in adult offspring.,"Mounting evidence suggests the impact of maternal diet on the health of offspring. We reported that maternal diet of sulforaphane glucosinolate (SGS) could prevent behavioral abnormalities in offspring after maternal immune activation. The present study was designed to investigate whether the dietary intake of SGS during pregnancy and lactation influences the composition of gut microbiota in the offspring. The dietary intake of SGS during pregnancy and lactation caused significant changes in the Î±-diversity and Î²-diversity of gut microbiota in 3-week-old offspring (SGS-3W group) and 10-week-old offspring (SGS-10W group). The LEfSe algorithm identified several microbes as important phylotypes in the SGS-3W or SGS-10W groups. Predictive functional metagenomes showed that the maternal intake of SGS caused several KEGG pathways alterations with respect to the genetic information processing and metabolism. Furthermore, the plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±) in the SGS-10W group after the injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS: 0.5 mg/kg) were significantly lower than those of the CON-10W group. It is noteworthy that there were positive correlations between the relative abundance of the genus Blautia and IL-6 (or TNF-Î±) in adult offspring. Moreover, there were sex differences of gut microbiota composition in offspring. In conclusion, these data suggest that the dietary intake of SGS during pregnancy and lactation might produce long-lasting beneficial effects in adult offspring through the persistent modulation of gut microbiota. It is likely that the modulation of gut microbiota by maternal nutrition may confer resilience versus vulnerability to stress-related psychiatric disorders in the offspring.",The Journal of nutritional biochemistry,2022,Yan Wei; Lijia Chang; Guoqi Liu; Xingming Wang; Yong Yang; Kenji Hashimoto
36558405,Plasma Concentrations of Short-Chain Fatty Acids in Active and Recovered Anorexia Nervosa.,"Anorexia nervosa (AN) is one of the most lethal psychiatric disorders. To date, we lack adequate knowledge about the (neuro)biological mechanisms of this disorder to inform evidence-based pharmacological treatment. Gut dysbiosis is a trending topic in mental health, including AN. Communication between the gut microbiota and the brain is partly mediated by metabolites produced by the gut microbiota such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). Previous research has suggested a role of SCFA in weight regulation (e.g., correlations between specific SCFA-producing bacteria and BMI have been demonstrated). Moreover, fecal SCFA concentrations are reported to be altered in active AN. However, data concerning SCFA concentrations in individuals who have recovered from AN are limited. In the present study, we analyzed and compared the plasma concentrations of seven SCFA (acetic-, butyric-, formic-, isobutyric-, isovaleric-, propionic-, and succinic acid) in females with active AN (<i>n</i> = 109), recovered from AN (AN-REC, <i>n</i> = 108), and healthy-weight age-matched controls (CTRL, <i>n</i> = 110), and explored correlations between SCFA concentrations and BMI. Significantly lower plasma concentrations of butyric, isobutyric-, and isovaleric acid were detected in AN as well as AN-REC compared with CTRL. We also show significant correlations between plasma concentrations of SCFA and BMI. These results encourage studies evaluating whether interventions directed toward altering gut microbiota and SCFA could support weight restoration in AN.",Nutrients,2022,Jingjing Xu; Rikard Landberg; Catharina Lavebratt; Cynthia M Bulik; Mikael LandÃ©n; Ida A K Nilsson
35650202,Fecal microbiota transplantation from patients with rheumatoid arthritis causes depression-like behaviors in mice through abnormal T cells activation.,"Depression is common in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA); however, the precise mechanisms underlying a link between depression and RA remain unclear. Accumulating evidence suggests the role of gut-microbiota-brain axis in depression. In this study, we investigated whether collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice produce depression-like behaviors and abnormal composition of gut microbiota. Furthermore, we investigated whether fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from RA patients causes depression-like phenotypes in antibiotic cocktail (ABX)-treated mice. CIA mice displayed depression-like behaviors, increased blood levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), decreased expression of synaptic proteins in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and abnormal composition of gut microbiota. Furthermore, FMT from RA patients caused depression-like phenotypes, alterations of gut microbiota composition, increased levels of IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±), and downregulation of synaptic proteins in the PFC compared to FMT from healthy controls. There were correlations between relative abundance of microbiota and plasma cytokines, expression of synaptic proteins in the PFC or depression-like behaviors. Interestingly, FMT from RA patients induced T cells differentiation in Peyer's patches and spleen. Reduced percentage of Treg cells with an increase of Th1/Th2 index was observed in the mice after FMT from RA patients. These findings suggest that CIA mice exhibit depression-like behaviors, systemic inflammation, and abnormal composition of gut microbiota, and that FMT from RA patients produces depression-like behaviors in ABX-treated mice via T cells differentiation. Therefore, abnormalities in gut microbiota in RA patients may contribute to depression via gut-microbiota-brain axis.",Translational psychiatry,2022,Yaoyu Pu; Qiuping Zhang; Zhigang Tang; Chenyang Lu; Liang Wu; Yutong Zhong; Yuehong Chen; Kenji Hashimoto; Yubin Luo; Yi Liu
35981631,Antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion improves LPS-induced acute lung injury via gut-lung axis.,"Acute lung injury (ALI) is an acute inflammatory disorder. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the pathology of ALI remain elusive. An increasing evidence suggests the role of the gut-microbiota axis in the pathology of lung injury. This study aimed to investigate whether antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion could affect ALI in mice after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration.The effects of antibiotic cocktail (ABX) on ALI in the mice after intratracheally administration of LPS (5Â mg/kg) were examined. Furthermore, 16s rRNA analysis and measurement of short-chain fatty acids in feces samples and metabolomics analysis of blood samples were performed.LPS significantly increased the interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of water-treated mice. Interestingly, an ABX significantly attenuated the LPS-induced increase in IL-6 in BALF and lung injury scores. Furthermore, ABX and/or LPS treatment markedly altered the Î±- and Î²-diversity of the gut microbiota. There were significant differences in the Î±- and Î²-diversity of the waterÂ +Â LPS group and ABXÂ +Â LPS group. LEfSe analysis identified Enterococusfaecalis, Clostriumtertium, and Bacteroidescaecimyris as potential microbial markers for ABXÂ +Â LPS group. Untargeted metabolomics analysis identified several plasma metabolites responsible for discriminating waterÂ +Â LPS group from ABXÂ +Â LPS group. There were correlations between the relative abundance of the microbiome and plasma metabolites. Integrative network analysis showed correlations between IL-6 levels in BALF and several gut microbes (or plasma metabolites).These data suggest that ABX-induced microbiome depletion could protect against LPS-induced ALI via the gut-microbiota-lung axis.",Life sciences,2022,Yaeko Hashimoto; Akifumi Eguchi; Yan Wei; Hiroyo Shinno-Hashimoto; Yuko Fujita; Tamaki Ishima; Lijia Chang; Chisato Mori; Takuji Suzuki; Kenji Hashimoto
35956326,Inflammatory Signatures of Maternal Obesity as Risk Factors for Neurodevelopmental Disorders: Role of Maternal Microbiota and Nutritional Intervention Strategies.,"Obesity is a main risk factor for the onset and the precipitation of many non-communicable diseases. This condition, which is associated with low-grade chronic systemic inflammation, is of main concern during pregnancy leading to very serious consequences for the new generations. In addition to the prominent role played by the adipose tissue, dysbiosis of the maternal gut may also sustain the obesity-related inflammatory milieu contributing to create an overall suboptimal intrauterine environment. Such a condition here generically defined as ""inflamed womb"" may hold long-term detrimental effects on fetal brain development, increasing the vulnerability to mental disorders. In this review, we will examine the hypothesis that maternal obesity-related gut dysbiosis and the associated inflammation might specifically target fetal brain microglia, the resident brain immune macrophages, altering neurodevelopmental trajectories in a sex-dependent fashion.

This study aimed to characterize the gut microbiota of a presenior population, and analyze the association between some bacteria and quality of life with the Short Form (SF) 36 questionnaire.Participants were adult men and women ages 50 to 80 y (nâ¯=â¯74). In addition to the SF-36 questionnaire, fecal samples were collected in cryotubes, and 16S RNA gene sequencing was performed to characterize microbial features. Participants were classified into two groups according to SF-36 punctuation. Linear and logistic regression models were performed to assess the possible association between any bacterial bowl and SF-36 score. Receiver operating characteristics curves were fitted to define the relative diagnostic strength of different bacterial taxa for the correct determination of quality of life.A positive relationship was established between SF-36 score and Actinobacteria (Pâ¯=â¯0.0310; Râ¯=â¯0.2510) compared with Peptostreptococcaceae (Pâ¯=â¯0.0259; Râ¯=â¯-0.2589), which increased with decreasing quality of life. Logistic regressions models and receiver operating characteristics curves showed that the relative abundance of Actinobacteria and Peptostreptococcaceae may be useful to predict quality of life in a presenior population (area under the curve: 0.71).Quality of life may be associated with the relative abundance of certain bacteria, especially Actinobacteria and Peptostreptococcaceae, which may have a specific effect on certain markers and health care, which is important to improve quality of life in older populations.","Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)",2022,BegoÃ±a de Cuevillas; JosÃ© I Riezu-Boj; Itziar Abete; M Angeles Zulet; Cristina Galarregui; Carlos J Gonzalez-Navarro; FermÃ­n I Milagro; J Alfredo MartÃ­nez; Santiago Navas-Carretero
36191374,Comparison of the chronic unpredictable mild stress and the maternal separation in mice postpartum depression modeling.,"Postpartum depression (PPD) is a serious mental health concern of new mothers worldwide. In view of the particularity of puerpera, the research on pathogenesis and drug development of PPD are highly dependent on animal models. Although both maternal separation (MS) and chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) modeling approaches have been used in PPD studies, the characteristics of the two rodent models have not been compared to explain which is more advantageous in PPD research. In this study, we applied 21-day MS and CUMS paradigms to induce mouse model of PPD and compared their differences in behavior, physiology and gut microbiota. As a result, the two models exhibited significant increases of immobility time in forced swim test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST), whereas sucrose preference index and pup weight were significantly decreased. Both displayed depression-like behaviors, and CUMS was more obvious, which demonstrated by the lower levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and higher hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis related mRNA expression (corticotropin releasing hormone, corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1) in CMUS group than that in MS group. The gut microbiota in MS and CUMS groups were significantly different in terms of the relative abundances of Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria. In conclusion, MS model and CUMS model have different performance in behavior and physiology. The CUMS model showed more obvious parameter changes, which may be more suitable for PPD induced by various social environmental factors.",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2022,Yan Zhang; Li Zhang; Birui Shi; Fulong Huang; Yinhuang Gao; Zhishuo Miao; Ke Ma; Ziyao Zhan; Wei Zou; Menghua Liu
35594949,Effects of (R)-ketamine on reduced bone mineral density in ovariectomized mice: A role of gut microbiota.,"Depression is a high risk for osteoporosis, suggesting an association between depression and low bone mineral density (BMD). We reported that the novel antidepressant (R)-ketamine could ameliorate the reduced BMD in the ovariectomized (OVX) mice which is an animal model of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Given the role of gut microbiota in depression and bone homeostasis, we examined whether gut microbiota plays a role in the beneficial effects of (R)-ketamine in the reduced BMD of OVX mice. OVX or sham was operated for female mice. Subsequently, saline (10Â ml/kg/day, twice weekly) or (R)-ketamine (10Â mg/kg/day, twice weekly) was administered intraperitoneally into OVX or sham mice for the six weeks. The reduction of cortical BMD and total BMD in the OVX mice was significantly ameliorated after subsequent repeated intermittent administration of (R)-ketamine. Furthermore, there were significant changes in the Î±- and Î²-diversity between OVXÂ +Â saline group and OVXÂ +Â (R)-ketamine group. There were correlations between several OTUs and cortical (or total) BMD. There were also positive correlations between the genera Turicibacter and cortical (or total) BMD. Moreover, there were correlations between several metabolites in blood and cortical (or total) BMD. These data suggest that (R)-ketamine may ameliorate the reduced cortical BMD and total BMD in OVX mice through anti-inflammatory actions via gut microbiota. Therefore, it is likely that (R)-ketamine would be a therapeutic drug for depressed patients with low BMD or patients with osteoporosis.",Neuropharmacology,2022,Xiayun Wan; Akifumi Eguchi; Yuko Fujita; Li Ma; Xingming Wang; Yong Yang; Youge Qu; Lijia Chang; Jiancheng Zhang; Chisato Mori; Kenji Hashimoto
36579574,The Potential Impact of Age on Gut Microbiota in Patients with Major Depressive Disorder: A Secondary Analysis of the Prospective Observational Study.,"We aimed to investigate the impact of aging on the relationship among the composition of gut microbiota, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, and the course of treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD) by analyzing the datasets from our previous study. Patients with MDD were recruited, and their stools were collected at three time points (baseline, midterm, and endpoint) following the usual antidepressant treatment. Gut microbiota were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Patients were categorized into two groups based on their age: the late-life group over 60 years and the middle-aged group under 60 years. GI symptoms were assessed with scores of item 11 of the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale. One hundred and ninety samples were collected from 32 patients with MDD. Several gut microbes had higher relative abundances in the late-life group than in the middle-aged group. In addition, the late-life group showed significantly higher diversity in the Chao1 index at baseline compared with the middle-aged group. We further found possible microbial taxa related to GI symptoms in patients with late-life depression. The abundance of several bacterial taxa may contribute to GI symptoms in the late-life depression, and our findings suggest that the therapeutic targets for the application of gut microbiota may differ depending on the age group of patients with depression.",Journal of personalized medicine,2022,Katsuma Miyaho; Kenji Sanada; Shunya Kurokawa; Arisa Tanaka; Tomoyuki Tachibana; Chiharu Ishii; Yoshihiro Noda; Shinichiro Nakajima; Shinji Fukuda; Masaru Mimura; Taishiro Kishimoto; Akira Iwanami
37124355,Alteration of Gut Microbiome in Patients With Schizophrenia Indicates Links Between Bacterial Tyrosine Biosynthesis and Cognitive Dysfunction.,"Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a heterogeneous neuropsychiatric disorder for which current treatment has insufficient efficacy and severe adverse effects. The modifiable gut microbiome might be a potential target for intervention to improve neurobiological functions through the gut-microbiome-brain axis.In this case-control study, gut microbiota of 132 patients with SCZ and increased waist circumference were compared with gut microbiota of two age- and sex-matched control groups, composed of 132 healthy individuals and 132 individuals with metabolic syndrome. Shotgun sequencing was used to characterize fecal samples at the taxonomic and functional levels. Cognition of the patients with SCZ was evaluated using the Brief Assessment of Cognition instrument.SCZ gut microbiota differed significantly from those of healthy control subjects and individuals with metabolic syndrome in terms of richness and global composition. SCZ gut microbiota were notably enriched in <i>Flavonifractor plautii</i>, <i>Collinsella aerofaciens</i>, <i>Bilophila wadsworthia</i>, and <i>Sellimonas intestinalis</i>, while depleted in <i>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</i>, <i>Ruminococcus lactaris</i>, <i>Ruminococcus bicirculans</i>, and <i>Veillonella rogosae</i>. Functional potential of the gut microbiota accounted for 11% of cognition variability. In particular, the bacterial functional module for synthesizing tyrosine, a precursor for dopamine, was in SCZ cases positively associated with cognitive score (ÏÂ = 0.34, <i>q</i> â¤ .1).Overall, this study shows that the gut microbiome of patients with SCZ differs greatly from that of healthy control subjects or individuals with metabolic syndrome. Cognitive function of patients with SCZ is associated with the potential for gut bacterial biosynthesis of tyrosine, a precursor for dopamine, suggesting that gut microbiota might be an intervention target for alleviation of cognitive dysfunction in SCZ.",Biological psychiatry global open science,2023,Florence Thirion; Helene Speyer; Tue Haldor Hansen; Trine Nielsen; Yong Fan; Emmanuelle Le Chatelier; SÃ©bastien Fromentin; Magali Berland; Florian Plaza OÃ±ate; Nicolas Pons; Nathalie Galleron; Florence Levenez; Lajos MarkÃ³; Till Birkner; Torben JÃ¸rgensen; Sofia K Forslund; Henrik Vestergaard; Torben Hansen; Merete Nordentoft; Ole Mors; Michael E Benros; Oluf Pedersen; Stanislav D Ehrlich
36079050,Intestinal Permeability and Depression in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Depression is a global health problem that requires an early and accurate diagnosis to ensure quick access to appropriate treatment. Among multiple psychopathological paths, recent attention has focused on analysing the brain-gut-microbiota axis. The intestinal barrier plays a key role, and dysfunctions occurring at this level have implications for mental health. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of intestinal permeability biomarkers, i.e., calprotectin, zonulin, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) and intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FAB), in relation to depression in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This is the first study of this kind taking place in Romania, Eastern Europe, with an emphasis on patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The correlations identified between depression and calprotectin and depression and LBP have the potential to shed light on the process of rapid diagnosis of depression with the help of biomarkers. Since depression is correlated with a decrease in the quality of life in patients with IBD, the need for access to appropriate treatments must be urgent.",Journal of clinical medicine,2022,Miorita Melina Iordache; Cristina Tocia; Mariana Aschie; Andrei Dumitru; Mihaela Manea; Georgeta Camelia Cozaru; Lucian Petcu; Sabina E Vlad; Eugen Dumitru; Anca Chisoi
35308288,Three Different Types of Î²-Glucans Enhance Cognition: The Role of the Gut-Brain Axis.,"Dietary fiber is fermented in the lower gastrointestinal tract, potentially impacting the microbial ecosystem and thus may improve elements of cognition and brain function via the gut-brain axis. Î²-glucans, soluble dietary fiber, have different macrostructures and may exhibit different effects on the gut-brain axis. This study aimed to compare the effects of Î²-glucans from mushroom, curdlan and oats bran, representing Î²-(1,3)/(1,6)-glucan, Î²-(1,3)-glucan or Î²-(1,3)/(1,4)-glucan, on cognition and the gut-brain axis.C57BL/6J mice were fed with either control diet or diets supplemented with Î²-glucans from mushroom, curdlan and oats bran for 15 weeks. The cognitive functions were evaluated by using the temporal order memory and Y-maze tests. The parameters of the gut-brain axis were examined, including the synaptic proteins and ultrastructure and microglia status in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC), as well as colonic immune response and mucus thickness and gut microbiota profiles.All three supplementations with Î²-glucans enhanced the temporal order recognition memory. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the post-synaptic protein 95 (PSD95) increased in the PFC. Furthermore, mushroom Î²-glucan significantly increased the post-synaptic thickness of synaptic ultrastructure in the PFC whilst the other two Î²-glucans had no significant effect. Three Î²-glucan supplementations decreased the microglia number in the PFC and hippocampus, and affected complement C3 and cytokines expression differentially. In the colon, every Î²-glucan supplementation increased the number of CD206 positive cells and promoted the expression of IL-10 and reduced IL-6 and TNF-Î± expression. The correlation analysis highlights that degree of cognitive behavior improved by Î²-glucan supplementations was significantly associated with microglia status in the hippocampus and PFC and the number of colonic M2 macrophages. In addition, only Î²-glucan from oat bran altered gut microbiota and enhanced intestinal mucus.We firstly demonstrated long-term supplementation of Î²-glucans enhanced recognition memory. Comparing the effects of Î²-glucans on the gut-brain axis, we found that Î²-glucans with different molecular structures exhibit differentia actions on synapses, inflammation in the brain and gut, and gut microbiota. This study may shed light on how to select appropriate Î²-glucans as supplementation for the prevention of cognitive deficit or improving immune function clinically.",Frontiers in nutrition,2022,Minmin Hu; Peng Zhang; Ruiqi Wang; Menglu Zhou; Ning Pang; Xiaoying Cui; Xing Ge; Xiaomei Liu; Xu-Feng Huang; Yinghua Yu
35013099,A pilot exploration of multi-omics research of gut microbiome in major depressive disorders.,"The pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) remains obscure. Recently, the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis's role in MDD has an increasing attention. However, the specific mechanism of the multi-level effects of gut microbiota on host metabolism, immunity, and brain structure is unclear. Multi-omics approaches based on the analysis of different body fluids and tissues using a variety of analytical platforms have the potential to provide a deeper understanding of MGB axis disorders. Therefore, the data of metagenomics, metabolomic, inflammatory factors, and MRI scanning are collected from the two groups including 24 drug-naÃ¯ve MDD patients and 26 healthy controls (HCs). Then, the correlation analysis is performed in all omics. The results confirmed that there are many markedly altered differences, such as elevated Actinobacteria abundance, plasma IL-1Î² concentration, lipid, vitamin, and carbohydrate metabolism disorder, and diminished grey matter volume (GMV) of inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) in the MDD patients. Notably, three kinds of discriminative bacteria, Ruminococcus bromii, Lactococcus chungangensis, and Streptococcus gallolyticus have an extensive correlation with metabolome, immunology, GMV, and clinical symptoms. All three microbiota are closely related to IL-1Î² and lipids (as an example, phosphoethanolamine (PEA)). Besides, Lactococcus chungangensis is negatively related to the GMV of left IFG. Overall, this study demonstrate that the effects of gut microbiome exert in MDD is multifactorial.",Translational psychiatry,2022,Haoyang Zhao; Kangyu Jin; Chaonan Jiang; Fen Pan; Jing Wu; Honglin Luan; Zhiyong Zhao; Jingkai Chen; Tingting Mou; Zheng Wang; Jing Lu; Shaojia Lu; Shaohua Hu; Yi Xu; Manli Huang

35432048,The Correlation Between Probiotics and Anxiety and Depression Levels in Cancer Patients: A Retrospective Cohort Study.,"Studies have shown a correlation between gut microbiota and anxiety and depression levels. However, these studies are mainly animal studies or clinical studies of non-cancer patients, there is still a lack of relevant studies in cancer patients. The main objective of this trial was to analyze the correlation between probiotics and anxiety and depression levels in cancer patients.We screened all cancer patients consecutively admitted to the inpatient department of the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine in May 2020. A total of 292 cancer patients met our inclusion criteria. Then, we followed up all patients for 24 weeks. Patients who had incomplete data or loss of follow-up were excluded. In addition, in patients who took probiotics, those did not take probiotics consistently or did not take specific probiotics were excluded. Ultimately, the number of patients enrolled was 82 in probiotics cohort and 100 in non-probiotics cohort. The 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD-17) questionnaire was used to measure the depression levels of the patients, and we also used Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) questionnaire to assess the patients' anxiety levels. A logistic regression model was used to analyze whether the difference in baseline data of two cohorts would affect the final result.Demographic and clinical characteristics of all cancer patients enrolled in probiotics cohort and non-probiotics cohort were similar except the cancer therapy (<i>P</i> = 0.004). According to the HAMA score, we divided cancer patients into non-anxiety group (HAMA score < 14) and anxiety group (HAMA score â¥ 14). Similarly, cancer patients were also divided into non-depression group (HAMD-17 score â¤ 7) and depression group (HAMD-17 score > 7). The results demonstrated that there was no statistical difference in the proportion of patients with anxiety (6.1 and 13.0%, respectively, <i>P</i> = 0.121) and depression (30.5 and 23.0%, respectively, <i>P</i> = 0.254) between probiotics and non-probiotics cohorts. The results of logistic regression model analysis further proved that the baseline difference in cancer therapy did not affect the conclusions.Our results still suggest that there is no significant correlation between probiotics and anxiety and depression levels in cancer patients. Therefore, we do not recommend supplementing probiotics for cancer patients to prevent anxiety and depression. Moreover, high-quality RCTs are also needed to further confirm the conclusions of this study.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2022,Ziqi Ye; Yanfang Zhang; Mengfei Du; Shaojia Lu; Qingwei Zhao; Si Yang

Therefore, we prepared a study protocol for a double-blind, crossover, randomized clinical trial to determine the complex effects of human probiotics on memory, psychological, and biological measures in the elderly.We selected eligible participants using an effective electronic questionnaire containing the inclusion and exclusion criteria and a brief electronic cognitive test. One-third of the respondents with the worst cognitive scores on the electronic test are randomized to group A, starting with a 3-month probiotic intervention, and to group B, starting with a placebo. In a crossover design, both groups change their intervention/placebo status after 3 months for the next 3 months. Participants refusing longer personal assessments due to the COVID-19 pandemic were randomly allocated to one of two subgroups assessed online. Participants in both groups are matched in age, education, gender, and cognitive scores on electronic testing at baseline. At three time points, participants are assessed using a neuropsychological battery, self-report measures of mood, a physical fitness test, blood, urine, and stool samples, and actigraphy. A subset of participants also provided their biological samples and underwent the neuropsychological battery in an extended testing phase 3 months after study termination to find out the long-term effect of the intervention.This is the first trial to address the comprehensive effects of human probiotics on memory and many other measures in the elderly.

36283312,Ginsenoside Rh4 remodels the periphery microenvironment by targeting the brain-gut axis to alleviate depression-like behaviors.,"Depression is a neuropsychiatric disease that threatens the physical and mental health of humans worldwide. This study explored the potential anti-depressant effects of ginsenoside Rh4 and its mechanisms of action. The results showed that Rh4 could significantly inhibit depression-like behavior in the depression mouse model and alleviate neuronal damage and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis disorder. Concurrently, Rh4 inhibits hippocampal neuronal apoptosis and synaptic structural damage due to the overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines and overactivation of microglia and astrocytes by inhibiting the immune-inflammatory response and signaling molecular interaction pathways. Rh4 can also improve intestinal flora and increase the short-chain fatty-acids content. The correlation analysis indicated that the Rh4-inhibited LPS/NLRP3/caspase-1/IL-1Î² signaling pathway plays a key role in ameliorating depression. Therefore, this study provides valuable insights into the mode of action of Rh4 on the brain-gut axis in depression, suggesting that Rh4 may be a promising clinical drug for the treatment of depression.",Food chemistry,2023,Jingjing Shao; Xiaoxuan Ma; Linlin Qu; Pei Ma; Rong Huang; Daidi Fan

Manipulation of the gut microenvironment by probiotics might improve mental health and prevent stress-related psychiatric disorders. The present study aimed to determine whether <i>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</i> (<i>L. rhamnosus</i>) zz-1 could prevent the occurrence of depression and its potential mechanisms using a mouse model with chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). The results indicated that <i>L. rhamnosus</i> zz-1 intervention ameliorated CUMS-induced depression-like behaviors of mice with reduced body growth rate, lowered sucrose preference, increased immobility time, as well as decreased curiosity and mobility. Moreover, <i>L. rhamnosus</i> zz-1 significantly inhibited hormones released due to hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, alleviated CUMS-induced deficits of monoamine neurotransmitters, and increased the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB). These benefits were partially linked to the regulation of the intestinal microenvironment. <i>L. rhamnosus</i> zz-1 alleviated intestinal damage and reduced intestinal inflammation of the depressed mice. Meanwhile, <i>L. rhamnosus</i> zz-1 effectively adjusted the dysbiosis of mouse gut microbiota induced by CUMS, such as changes in the abundance of the <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> NK4A136 group, <i>Bacteroides</i>, and <i>Muribaculum</i>. Taken together, these results demonstrated that <i>L. rhamnosus</i> zz-1 was effective in preventing depression from chronic stress, adding new evidence to support the mental benefits of probiotics.",Food & function,2022,Jinzhao Xu; Mengqi Tang; Xinyu Wu; Xiangli Kong; Yini Liu; Xiaoxi Xu
36235606,Circulating Levels of Short-Chain Fatty Acids during Pregnancy and Infant Neurodevelopment.,"Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) play a key role in the gut microbiota-brain crosstalk regulating the main neurodevelopmental processes during pregnancy. The aim of this study is to investigate the longitudinal relationship between prenatal levels of the main SCFAs in maternal serum and infant cognitive development and temperament on day 40 postpartum after adjusting for several pre-, peri- and post-natal confounders.A sample of 357 healthy mother-infant pairs were followed from the beginning of pregnancy to 40 days after birth. Serum SCFA concentrations were assessed in the first and third trimester of pregnancy by LC-MS/MS; and socio-demographic, nutritional, and psychological variables were collected. At 40 days, the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-III and the Early Infancy Temperament Questionnaire were administered.Lower serum levels of acetic, butyric and isobutyric acid, mainly during the first trimester, were related to better language and psychomotor development and, in the case of butyric acid, better intensity behavior in infants. Medium levels of propionic acid were related to better scores for development, mood and temperament.These findings suggest that in a community sample of healthy pregnant women from a Mediterranean region of northern Spain, lower serum levels of SCFAs, especially in the first trimester of pregnancy, seem to be related to better infant neurodevelopment.",Nutrients,2022,Carmen HernÃ¡ndez-MartÃ­nez; Josefa Canals; NÃºria Voltas; Francisco MartÃ­n-LujÃ¡n; Victoria Arija
35918353,Investigation of memory-enhancing effects of Streptococcus thermophilus EG007 in mice and elucidating molecular and metagenomic characteristics using nanopore sequencing.,"Over the past decades, accumulating evidences have highlighted the gut microbiota as a key player in the brain functioning via microbiota-gut-brain axis, and accordingly, the beneficial role of several probiotic strains in cognitive ability also have been actively investigated. However, the majority of the research have demonstrated the effects against age-related cognitive decline or neurological disease. To this end, we aimed to investigate lactic acid bacteria strains having beneficial effects on the cognitive function of healthy young mice and elucidate underlying characteristics by carrying out nanopore sequencing-based genomics and metagenomics analysis. 8-week consumption of Streptococcus thermophilus EG007 demonstrated marked enhancements in behavior tests assessing short-term spatial and non-spatial learning and memory. It was revealed that EG007 possessed genes encoding various metabolites beneficial for a health condition in many aspects, including gamma-aminobutyric acid producing system, a neurotransmitter associated with mood and stress response. Also, by utilizing 16S-23S rRNA operon as a taxonomic marker, we identified more accurate species-level compositional changes in gut microbiota, which was increase of certain species, previously reported to have associations with mental health or down-regulation of inflammation or infection-related species. Moreover, correlation analysis revealed that the EG007-mediated altered microbiota had a significant correlation with the memory traits.",Scientific reports,2022,Hyaekang Kim; Soomin Jeon; Jina Kim; Donghyeok Seol; JinChul Jo; Seoae Cho; Heebal Kim
35790976,"The effects of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) administration on the microbiome-gut-brain axis in adolescents with anorexia nervosa (the MiGBAN study): study protocol for a longitudinal, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.","Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe psychiatric disease that often takes a chronic course due to insufficient treatment options. Emerging evidence on the gut-brain axis offers the opportunity to find innovative treatments for patients with psychiatric disorders. The gut microbiome of patients with AN shows profound alterations that do not completely disappear after weight rehabilitation. In previous studies, the administration of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) resulted in effects that might be beneficial in the treatment of AN, affecting the microbiome, body weight and executive functions. Therefore, the MiGBAN study aims to examine the effects of a nutritional supplementation with PUFA on the gut microbiome and body mass index (BMI) in patients with AN.This is a longitudinal, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Within 2 years, 60 adolescent patients aged 12 to 19 years with AN will receive either PUFA or placebo for 6 months additional to treatment as usual. After 1 year, the long-term effect of PUFA on the gut microbiome and consecutively on BMI will be determined. Secondary outcomes include improvement of gastrointestinal symptoms, eating disorder psychopathology, and comorbidities. Additionally, the interaction of the gut microbiome with the brain (microbiome-gut-brain axis) will be studied by conducting MRI measurements to assess functional and morphological changes and neuropsychological assessments to describe cognitive functioning. Anti-inflammatory effects of PUFA in AN will be examined via serum inflammation and gut permeability markers. Our hypothesis is that PUFA administration will have positive effects on the gut microbiota and thus the treatment of AN by leading to a faster weight gain and a reduction of gastrointestinal problems and eating disorder psychopathology.Due to previously heterogeneous results, a systematic and longitudinal investigation of the microbiome-gut-brain axis in AN is essential. The current trial aims to further analyse this promising research field to identify new, effective therapeutic tools that could help improve the treatment and quality of life of patients. If this trial is successful and PUFA supplementation contributes to beneficial microbiome changes and a better treatment outcome, their administration would be a readily applicable additional component of multimodal AN treatment.German Clinical Trials Register DRKS00017130 .

35996352,Probiotics supplementation and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF): a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"An emerging body of evidence has demonstrated the beneficial effects of probiotics on various mental health conditions. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we sought to examine the effects of probiotics supplementation on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in adults.PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were searched, from database inception to April 2021, for eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We pooled mean differences and standard deviations from RCTs using random-effect models.Overall, meta-analysis of 11 trials (<i>n</i>â=â648 participants) showed no significant changes in serum level of BDNF following probiotics. However, subgroup analysis revealed that probiotics increased BDNF levels in individuals suffering from neurological disorders (<i>n</i>â=â214 participants; WMDâ=â3.08âng/mL, 95% CI: 1.83, 4.34; <i>P</i>â=â0.001; <i>I</i><sup>2â</sup>=â7.5%; P-heterogeneity 0.34), or depression (<i>n</i>â=â268 participants; WMDâ=â0.77âng/mL, 95% CI: 0.07, 1.47; <i>P</i>â=â0.032; <i>I</i><sup>2â</sup>=â88.4%; P-heterogeneityâ<â0.001). Furthermore, a significant increase in BDNF levels was found in studies that administered the mixture of <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Bifidobacterium genera</i>, and were conducted in Asia .Our main findings suggest that probiotics may be effective in elevating BDNF levels in patients with depression and neurological disorders, and a mixed of <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Bifidobacterium</i> appear to show greater efficacy than the single genus supplement.

36364950,Exploration of the Gut-Brain Axis through Metabolomics Identifies Serum Propionic Acid Associated with Higher Cognitive Decline in Older Persons.,"The gut microbiome is involved in nutrient metabolism and produces metabolites that, via the gutâbrain axis, signal to the brain and influence cognition. Human studies have so far had limited success in identifying early metabolic alterations linked to cognitive aging, likely due to limitations in metabolite coverage or follow-ups. Older persons from the Three-City population-based cohort who had not been diagnosed with dementia at the time of blood sampling were included, and repeated measures of cognition over 12 subsequent years were collected. Using a targeted metabolomics platform, we identified 72 circulating gut-derived metabolites in a caseâcontrol study on cognitive decline, nested within the cohort (discovery n = 418; validation n = 420). Higher serum levels of propionic acid, a short-chain fatty acid, were associated with increased odds of cognitive decline (OR for 1 SD = 1.40 (95% CI 1.11, 1.75) for discovery and 1.26 (1.02, 1.55) for validation). Additional analyses suggested mediation by hypercholesterolemia and diabetes. Propionic acid strongly correlated with blood glucose (r = 0.79) and with intakes of meat and cheese (r > 0.15), but not fiber (r = 0.04), suggesting a minor role of prebiotic foods per se, but a possible link to processed foods, in which propionic acid is a common preservative. The adverse impact of propionic acid on metabolism and cognition deserves further investigation.",Nutrients,2022,Jeanne Neuffer; RaÃºl GonzÃ¡lez-DomÃ­nguez; Sophie LefÃ¨vre-Arbogast; Dorrain Y Low; BÃ©nÃ©dicte Driollet; Catherine Helmer; Andrea Du Preez; Chiara de Lucia; Silvie R Ruigrok; Barbara Altendorfer; Ludwig Aigner; Paul J Lucassen; Aniko Korosi; Sandrine Thuret; Claudine Manach; MercÃ¨ PallÃ s; Mireia Urpi-SardÃ ; Alex SÃ¡nchez-Pla; Cristina Andres-Lacueva; CÃ©cilia Samieri

Most medications for treating IBS, including spasmolytics, laxatives, and antidiarrheals, have low efficacy. Effective and safe therapeutic treatments have yet to be developed for IBS.This study assessed the efficacy and safety of a food supplement containing standardized menthol, limonene, and gingerol in human participants with IBS or IBS/functional dyspepsia (FD).A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.We randomly assigned 56 patients with IBS or IBS/FD to an intervention group (Group 1) or control group (Group 2) that were given supplement or placebo, respectively, in addition to the standard treatment regimen for 30 d. Three outpatient visits were conducted during the study. Symptom severity was measured at each visit using a 7Ã7 questionnaire. Qualitative and quantitative composition of the intestinal microbiota were assessed at visits 1 and 3 based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing.At visit 1 (before treatment), the median total 7Ã7 questionnaire score was in the moderately ill range for both groups, with no difference between the groups (p = 0.1). At visit 2, the total 7Ã7 score decreased to mildly ill, with no difference between the groups (p = 0.4). At visit 3, the total score for group 1 indicated borderline illness and for group 2 remained indicated mild illness (p = 0.009). Even though we observed some variations in gut microbiota between the groups, we did not find any statistically significant changes.The food supplement with standardized menthol, limonene, and gingerol content increased the efficacy of standard therapy in IBS and FD patients.

However, commonly consumed fermented and prebiotic-containing foods have not been well-tested. The aim of the present study was to determine whether consumption of fermented food and food-derived prebiotics is associated with cognitive performance, depressive, and anxiety symptoms in psychiatrically healthy medical students under psychological stress.The study protocol with data analysis plan was prospectively registered. Food consumption was evaluated with a 7-day dietary record. Cognitive performance was modeled with academic examination performance in relation to subject knowledge. Pre-exam depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, respectively.In total, 372 medical students (22.7 Â± 1.1 years of age, 66% female) completed the study. No relationship was observed between cognitive performance under stress and either fermented food (adjusted Î² 0.02, 95% CI -0.07-0.11, <i>p</i> = 0.63) or food-derived prebiotics consumption (adjusted Î² -0.00, 95% CI -0.09-0.09, <i>p</i> = 0.99).

Therefore, it is essential to seek prevention and treatment strategies for mental disorders. Several gut microbiota, especially Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, are demonstrated to affect mental health through microbiota-gut-brain axis, and the gut microbiota dysbiosis can be related to mental disorders, such as anxiety, depression, and other mental disorders.

37069399,The gut microbiota contributes to the pathogenesis of anorexia nervosa in humans and mice.,"Anorexia nervosa (AN) is an eating disorder with a high mortality. About 95% of cases are women and it has a population prevalence of about 1%, but evidence-based treatment is lacking. The pathogenesis of AN probably involves genetics and various environmental factors, and an altered gut microbiota has been observed in individuals with AN using amplicon sequencing and relatively small cohorts. Here we investigated whether a disrupted gut microbiota contributes to AN pathogenesis. Shotgun metagenomics and metabolomics were performed on faecal and serum samples, respectively, from a cohort of 77 females with AN and 70 healthy females. Multiple bacterial taxa (for example, Clostridium species) were altered in AN and correlated with estimates of eating behaviour and mental health. The gut virome was also altered in AN including a reduction in viral-bacterial interactions. Bacterial functional modules associated with the degradation of neurotransmitters were enriched in AN and various structural variants in bacteria were linked to metabolic features of AN. Serum metabolomics revealed an increase in metabolites associated with reduced food intake (for example, indole-3-propionic acid). Causal inference analyses implied that serum bacterial metabolites are potentially mediating the impact of an altered gut microbiota on AN behaviour. Further, we performed faecal microbiota transplantation from AN cases to germ-free mice under energy-restricted feeding to mirror AN eating behaviour. We found that the reduced weight gain and induced hypothalamic and adipose tissue gene expression were related to aberrant energy metabolism and eating behaviour. Our 'omics' and mechanistic studies imply that a disruptive gut microbiome may contribute to AN pathogenesis.",Nature microbiology,2023,Yong Fan; RenÃ© Klinkby StÃ¸ving; Samar Berreira Ibraim; Tuulia HyÃ¶tylÃ¤inen; Florence Thirion; Tulika Arora; Liwei Lyu; Evelina Stankevic; Tue Haldor Hansen; Pierre DÃ©chelotte; Tim Sinioja; Oddny Ragnarsdottir; Nicolas Pons; Nathalie Galleron; BenoÃ®t Quinquis; Florence Levenez; Hugo Roume; Gwen Falony; Sara Vieira-Silva; Jeroen Raes; Loa Clausen; Gry Kjaersdam TellÃ©us; Fredrik BÃ¤ckhed; Matej Oresic; S Dusko Ehrlich; Oluf Pedersen
38203207,"Our Mental Health Is Determined by an Intrinsic Interplay between the Central Nervous System, Enteric Nerves, and Gut Microbiota.","Bacteria in the gut microbiome play an intrinsic part in immune activation, intestinal permeability, enteric reflex, and entero-endocrine signaling. The gut microbiota communicates with the central nervous system (CNS) through the production of bile acids, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), glutamate (Glu), Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA), dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), serotonin (5-HT), and histamine. A vast number of signals generated in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) reach the brain via afferent fibers of the vagus nerve (VN). Signals from the CNS are returned to entero-epithelial cells (EES) via efferent VN fibers and communicate with 100 to 500 million neurons in the submucosa and myenteric plexus of the gut wall, which is referred to as the enteric nervous system (ENS). Intercommunications between the gut and CNS regulate mood, cognitive behavior, and neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism, depression, and schizophrenia. The modulation, development, and renewal of nerves in the ENS and changes in the gut microbiome alter the synthesis and degradation of neurotransmitters, ultimately influencing our mental health. The more we decipher the gut microbiome and understand its effect on neurotransmission, the closer we may get to developing novel therapeutic and psychobiotic compounds to improve cognitive functions and prevent mental disorders. In this review, the intricate control of entero-endocrine signaling and immune responses that keep the gut microbiome in a balanced state, and the influence that changing gut bacteria have on neuropsychiatric disorders, are discussed.",International journal of molecular sciences,2023,Leon M T Dicks
37849234,Microbiota from Alzheimer's patients induce deficits in cognition and hippocampal neurogenesis.,"Alzheimer's disease is a complex neurodegenerative disorder leading to a decline in cognitive function and mental health. Recent research has positioned the gut microbiota as an important susceptibility factor in Alzheimer's disease by showing specific alterations in the gut microbiome composition of Alzheimer's patients and in rodent models. However, it is unknown whether gut microbiota alterations are causal in the manifestation of Alzheimer's symptoms. To understand the involvement of Alzheimer's patient gut microbiota in host physiology and behaviour, we transplanted faecal microbiota from Alzheimer's patients and age-matched healthy controls into microbiota-depleted young adult rats. We found impairments in behaviours reliant on adult hippocampal neurogenesis, an essential process for certain memory functions and mood, resulting from Alzheimer's patient transplants. Notably, the severity of impairments correlated with clinical cognitive scores in donor patients. Discrete changes in the rat caecal and hippocampal metabolome were also evident. As hippocampal neurogenesis cannot be measured in living humans but is modulated by the circulatory systemic environment, we assessed the impact of the Alzheimer's systemic environment on proxy neurogenesis readouts. Serum from Alzheimer's patients decreased neurogenesis in human cells in vitro and were associated with cognitive scores and key microbial genera. Our findings reveal for the first time, that Alzheimer's symptoms can be transferred to a healthy young organism via the gut microbiota, confirming a causal role of gut microbiota in Alzheimer's disease, and highlight hippocampal neurogenesis as a converging central cellular process regulating systemic circulatory and gut-mediated factors in Alzheimer's.",Brain : a journal of neurology,2023,Stefanie Grabrucker; Moira Marizzoni; Edina SilajdÅ¾iÄ; Nicola Lopizzo; Elisa Mombelli; Sarah Nicolas; Sebastian Dohm-Hansen; Catia Scassellati; Davide Vito Moretti; Melissa Rosa; Karina Hoffmann; John F Cryan; Olivia F O'Leary; Jane A English; Aonghus Lavelle; Cora O'Neill; Sandrine Thuret; Annamaria Cattaneo; Yvonne M Nolan
37960197,"Causality Investigation between Gut Microbiota, Derived Metabolites, and Obstructive Sleep Apnea: A Bidirectional Mendelian Randomization Study.","Various studies have highlighted the important associations between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and gut microbiota and related metabolites. Nevertheless, the establishment of causal relationships between these associations remains to be determined. Multiple mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were performed to genetically predict the causative impact of 196 gut microbiota and 83 metabolites on OSA. Two-sample MR was used to assess the potential association, and causality was evaluated using inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, and weighted median (WM) methods. Multivariable MR (MVMR) was employed to ascertain the causal independence between gut microbiota and the metabolites linked to OSA. Additionally, Cochran's Q test, the MR Egger intercept test and the MR Steiger test were used for the sensitivity analyses. The analysis of the 196 gut microbiota revealed that <i>genus</i>_<i>Ruminococcaceae</i> (<i>UCG009</i>) (P<sub>IVW</sub> = 0.010) and <i>genus</i>_<i>Subdoligranulum</i> (P<sub>IVW</sub> = 0.041) were associated with an increased risk of OSA onset. Conversely, <i>Family</i>_<i>Ruminococcaceae</i> (P<sub>IVW</sub> = 0.030), <i>genus</i>_<i>Coprococcus2</i> (P<sub>WM</sub> = 0.025), <i>genus</i>_<i>Eggerthella</i> (P<sub>IVW</sub> = 0.011), and <i>genus</i>_<i>Eubacterium</i> (<i>xylanophilum</i>_<i>group</i>) (P<sub>IVW</sub> = 0.001) were negatively related to the risk of OSA. Among the 83 metabolites evaluated, 3-dehydrocarnitine, epiandrosterone sulfate, and leucine were determined to be potential independent risk factors associated with OSA. Moreover, the reverse MR analysis demonstrated a suggestive association between OSA exposure and six microbiota taxa.

36986226,The Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis: Psychoneuroimmunological Insights.,"There is growing interest in the role that the intestinal microbiota and the related autoimmune processes may have in the genesis and presentation of some psychiatric diseases. An alteration in the communication of the microbiota-gut-brain axis, which constitutes a communicative model between the central nervous system (CNS) and the gastro-enteric tract, has been identified as one of the possible causes of some psychiatric diseases. The purpose of this narrative review is to describe evidence supporting a role of the gut microbiota in psychiatric diseases and the impact of diet on microbiota and mental health. Change in the composition of the gut microbiota could determine an increase in the permeability of the intestinal barrier, leading to a cytokine storm. This could trigger a systemic inflammatory activation and immune response: this series of events could have repercussions on the release of some neurotransmitters, altering the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and reducing the presence of trophic brain factors.

38353184,Stressed to the Core: Inflammation and Intestinal Permeability Link Stress-Related Gut Microbiota Shifts to Mental Health Outcomes.,"Stress levels are surging, alongside the incidence of stress-related psychiatric disorders. Perhaps a related phenomenon, especially in urban areas, the human gut contains fewer bacterial species than ever before. Although the functional implications of this absence are unclear, one consequence may be reduced stress resilience. Preclinical and clinical evidence has shown how stress exposure can alter the gut microbiota and their metabolites, affecting host physiology. Also, stress-related shifts in the gut microbiota jeopardize tight junctions of the gut barrier. In this context, bacteria and bacterial products can translocate from the gut to the bloodstream, lymph nodes, and other organs, thereby modifying systemic inflammatory responses. Heightened circulating inflammation can be an etiological factor in stress-related psychiatric disorders, including some cases of depression. In this review, we detail preclinical and clinical evidence that traces these brain-to-gut-to-brain pathways that underlie stress-related psychiatric disorders and potentially affect their responsivity to conventional psychiatric medications. We also review evidence for interventions that modulate the gut microbiota (e.g., antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics) to reduce stress responses and psychiatric symptoms. Lastly, we discuss challenges to translation and opportunities for innovations that could impact future psychiatric clinical practice.",Biological psychiatry,2024,Annelise A Madison; Michael T Bailey

38045052,Gut microbiota-derived short-chain fatty acids ameliorate methamphetamine-induced depression- and anxiety-like behaviors in a Sigmar-1 receptor-dependent manner.,"Methamphetamine (Meth) abuse can cause serious mental disorders, including anxiety and depression. The gut microbiota is a crucial contributor to maintaining host mental health. Here, we aim to investigate if microbiota participate in Meth-induced mental disorders, and the potential mechanisms involved. Here, 15Â mg/kg Meth resulted in anxiety- and depression-like behaviors of mice successfully and suppressed the Sigma-1 receptor (SIGMAR1)/BDNF/TRKB pathway in the hippocampus. Meanwhile, Meth impaired gut homeostasis by arousing the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-related colonic inflammation, disturbing the gut microbiome and reducing the microbiota-derived short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Moreover, fecal microbiota from Meth-administrated mice mediated the colonic inflammation and reproduced anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in recipients. Further, SCFAs supplementation optimized Meth-induced microbial dysbiosis, ameliorated colonic inflammation, and repressed anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. Finally, <i>Sigmar1</i> knockout (<i>Sigmar1</i><sup>-/-</sup>) repressed the BDNF/TRKB pathway and produced similar behavioral phenotypes with Meth exposure, and eliminated the anti-anxiety and -depression effects of SCFAs.

36017855,Gut-Brain Axis and Neurological Disorders-How Microbiomes Affect our Mental Health.,"The gut microbiota is an essential part of the gastrointestinal tract and recent research, including clinical and preclinical studies, shed light on the interaction between the gut and the brain. A rising amount of evidence strongly proves the involvement of gut microbes in brain function and their contribution in altering behavior, mood, and ultimately in the pathogenesis of certain neurological conditions. The gut microbiota produces and modulates neurotransmitters such as GABA, serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, etc. Furthermore, there is a presence of a biological link between the microbiota, immune signaling, and CNS suggesting that microbial metabolites could regulate both neurological and immunological activities in the brain. Thus, this review focuses on the bidirectional communication between the gut and brain, its impact and role in the modulation of various neurological disorders, such as schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, etc., and attempts to explore the underlying mechanism for the same. The article also discusses studies involving germ-free mice, studies on the effects of faeces transfer of microbiota, and research involving gut microbiota composition in animal models. The effects of probiotics and prebiotics on neurological disorders are also discussed, along with the clinical studies for each of them. In a nutshell, extensive studies are required to explore this bidirectional communication between the gut and brain, which might help researchers develop new therapeutic targets in treating neurological disorders and increase our understanding of the gut-brain axis.",CNS & neurological disorders drug targets,2023,Nirav Yogesh Bhatia; Manjiri Prabhakar Jalgaonkar; Anuja Balu Hargude; Atul P Sherje; Manisha Jignesh Oza; Gaurav Mahesh Doshi
36650572,Risk factors for eating disorders: findings from a rapid review.,"Risk factors represent a range of complex variables associated with the onset, development, and course of eating disorders. Understanding these risk factors is vital for the refinement of aetiological models, which may inform the development of targeted, evidence-based prevention, early intervention, and treatment programs. This Rapid Review aimed to identify and summarise research studies conducted within the last 12Â years, focusing on risk factors associated with eating disorders.The current review forms part of a series of Rapid Reviews to be published in a special issue in the Journal of Eating Disorders, funded by the Australian Government to inform the development of the National Eating Disorder Research and Translation Strategy 2021-2031. Three databases were searched for studies published between 2009 and 2021, published in English, and comprising high-level evidence studies (meta-analyses, systematic reviews, moderately sized randomised controlled studies, moderately sized controlled-cohort studies, or population studies). Data pertaining to risk factors for eating disorders were synthesised and outlined in the current paper.A total of 284 studies were included. The findings were divided into nine main categories: (1) genetics, (2) gastrointestinal microbiota and autoimmune reactions, (3) childhood and early adolescent exposures, (4) personality traits and comorbid mental health conditions, (5) gender, (6) socio-economic status, (7) ethnic minority, (8) body image and social influence, and (9) elite sports. A substantial amount of research exists supporting the role of inherited genetic risk in the development of eating disorders, with biological risk factors, such as the role of gut microbiota in dysregulation of appetite, an area of emerging evidence. Abuse, trauma and childhood obesity are strongly linked to eating disorders, however less conclusive evidence exists regarding developmental factors such as role of in-utero exposure to hormones. Comorbidities between eating disorders and mental health disorders, including personality and mood disorders, have been found to increase the severity of eating disorder symptomatology. Higher education attainment, body image-related factors, and use of appearance-focused social media are also associated with increased risk of eating disorder symptoms.Eating disorders are associated with multiple risk factors. An extensive amount of research has been conducted in the field; however, further studies are required to assess the causal nature of the risk factors identified in the current review. This will assist in understanding the sequelae of eating disorder development and in turn allow for enhancement of existing interventions and ultimately improved outcomes for individuals.",Journal of eating disorders,2023,Sarah Barakat; SiÃ¢n A McLean; Emma Bryant; Anvi Le; Peta Marks; ; Stephen Touyz; Sarah Maguire
37914097,Priming of microglia with dysfunctional gut microbiota impairs hippocampal neurogenesis and fosters stress vulnerability of mice.,"Mental disorders may be involved in neuroinflammatory processes that are triggered by gut microbiota. How gut microbiota influence microglia-mediated sensitivity to stress remains unclear. Here we explored in an animal model of depression whether disruption of the gut microbiome primes hippocampal microglia, thereby impairing neurogenesis and sensitizing to stress.Male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) for 4Â weeks, and effects on gut microbiota were assessed using 16S rRNA sequencing. Fecal microbiota was transplanted from control or CUMS mice into naÃ¯ve animals. The depression-like behaviors of recipients were evaluated in a forced swimming test and sucrose preference test. The morphology and phenotype of microglia in the hippocampus of recipients were examined using immunohistochemistry, quantitative PCR, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The recipients were treated with lipopolysaccharide or chronic stress exposure, and effects were evaluated on behavior, microglial responses and hippocampal neurogenesis. Finally, we explored the ability of minocycline to reverse the effects of CUMS on hippocampal neurogenesis and stress sensitivity in recipients.CUMS altered the gut microbiome, leading to higher relative abundance of some bacteria (Helicobacter, Bacteroides, and Desulfovibrio) and lower relative abundance of some bacteria (Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Akkermansia). Fecal microbiota transplantation from CUMS mice to naÃ¯ve animals induced microglial priming in the dentate gyrus of recipients. This microglia showed hyper-ramified morphology, and became more sensitive to LPS challenge or chronic stress, which characterized by more significant morphological changes and inflammatory responses, as well as impaired hippocampal neurogenesis and increased depressive-like behaviors. Giving minocycline to recipients reversed these effects of fecal transplantation.These findings suggest that gut microbiota from stressed animals can induce microglial priming in the dentate gyrus, which is associated with a hyper-immune response to stress and impaired hippocampal neurogenesis. Remodeling the gut microbiome or inhibiting microglial priming may be strategies to reduce sensitivity to stress.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2024,Hui He; Haili He; Li Mo; Zili You; Jinqiang Zhang
38260914,"Rosacea, microbiome and probiotics: the gut-skin axis.","Rosacea is an inflammatory skin disease involving diverse symptoms with a variable clinical progress which can severely impact the patient's quality of life as well as their mental health. The pathophysiological model of rosacea involves an unbalanced immune system predisposed to excessive inflammation, in addition to vascular and nervous alterations, being certain cutaneous microorganisms' triggers of the symptoms onset. The gut-skin axis explains a bidirectional interaction between skin and gut microbiota in some inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, or rosacea. The introduction and consolidation of the next-generation sequencing in recent years has provided unprecedented information about the microbiome. However, the characterization of the gut and skin microbiota and the impact of the gut-skin axis in patients with rosacea has been little explored, in contrast to other inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis or psoriasis. Furthermore, the clinical evolution of patients with rosacea is not always adequate and it is common for them to present a sustained symptomatology with frequent flare-ups. In this context, probiotic supplementation could improve the clinical evolution of these patients as happens in other pathologies. Through this review we aim to establish and compile the basics and directions of current knowledge to understand the mechanisms by which the microbiome influences the pathogenesis of rosacea, and how modulation of the skin and gut microbiota could benefit these patients.",Frontiers in microbiology,2023,Pedro SÃ¡nchez-Pellicer; Cristina Eguren-Michelena; Juan GarcÃ­a-GavÃ­n; Mar Llamas-Velasco; Laura Navarro-Moratalla; Eva NÃºÃ±ez-Delegido; Juan AgÃ¼era-Santos; Vicente Navarro-LÃ³pez
37892465,The Gut-Brain Axis in Schizophrenia: The Implications of the Gut Microbiome and SCFA Production.,"Schizophrenia, a severe mental illness affecting about 1% of the population, manifests during young adulthood, leading to abnormal mental function and behavior. Its multifactorial etiology involves genetic factors, experiences of adversity, infection, and gene-environment interactions. Emerging research indicates that maternal infection or stress during pregnancy may also increase schizophrenia risk in offspring. Recent research on the gut-brain axis highlights the gut microbiome's potential influence on central nervous system (CNS) function and mental health, including schizophrenia. The gut microbiota, located in the digestive system, has a significant role to play in human physiology, affecting immune system development, vitamin synthesis, and protection against pathogenic bacteria. Disruptions to the gut microbiota, caused by diet, medication use, environmental pollutants, and stress, may lead to imbalances with far-reaching effects on CNS function and mental health. Of interest are short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), metabolic byproducts produced by gut microbes during fermentation. SCFAs can cross the blood-brain barrier, influencing CNS activity, including microglia and cytokine modulation. The dysregulation of neurotransmitters produced by gut microbes may contribute to CNS disorders, including schizophrenia. This review explores the potential relationship between SCFAs, the gut microbiome, and schizophrenia. Our aim is to deepen the understanding of the gut-brain axis in schizophrenia and to elucidate its implications for future research and therapeutic approaches.",Nutrients,2023,Songhyun Ju; Yoonhwa Shin; Sunhee Han; Juhui Kwon; Tae Gyu Choi; Insug Kang; Sung Soo Kim
36738999,High-cholesterol diet promotes depression- and anxiety-like behaviors in mice by impact gut microbe and neuroinflammation.,"Neuropsychiatric disorders, including anxiety and depression, are one of the most common mental illnesses worldwide. A growing body of evidence shows that there is a complex relationship between dietary patterns and mental health. In our study, C57BL/6J mice were divided into three groups: control diet group (CON, 10Â %Â kcal fat), high-cholesterol diet model group (HCD, 42.0Â %Â kcal fatÂ +Â 1.25Â %Â kcal Cholesterol), and chronic restraint stress group (CRS, 10Â %Â kcal fat) which as a positive control group for the depression model. Six weeks later, depressive- and anxiety-like behavior were evaluated for using the OFT, SPT and TST. Glucose intolerance and liver fat were detected by IGTT and liver lipid kit. The expression of peripheral and central inflammation was detected by LEGEND plex kits. 5-HT (also named 5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) and related receptors expression were monitored by ELISA, RT-PCR and Western blot. Meantime, gut microbe of stool samples was performed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Similar to CRS model, short-term HCD intervention induced anxiety and depression-like behavior behavioral abnormalities in mice. HCD consumption resulted in significantly increased body weight, liver fat (LDL-C, TC, TG), peripheral inflammation (IL-1Î², MCP-1, IL-17A) and neuroinflammation (MCP-1). The concentration of 5-HT increased in the hippocampus, meanwhile, the expression of 5-HT receptor HTR2A was distinct in different regions of the brain tissue. More importantly, we found that compared with the CON diet, HCD induced the decrease of intestinal flora diversity, especially the decrease the relative abundance of Akkermansia_muciniphila, which was statistically significant. Further, Pearson correlation analysis showed that Akkermansia_muciniphila was significantly negatively correlated with the concentration of MCP-1, IL-17A in serum and 5-HT in hippocampus. Therefore, we speculated that the disorder of neuroinflammation induced by HCD consumption promotes depression- and anxiety-like behaviors in mice through the gut microbe.",Journal of affective disorders,2023,Lili Zou; Yaling Tian; Yuanfei Wang; Dongliang Chen; Xiaomin Lu; Ze Zeng; Zumin Chen; Chenli Lin; Yinji Liang
37925207,Food4healthKG: Knowledge graphs for food recommendations based on gut microbiota and mental health.,"Food is increasingly acknowledged as a powerful means to promote and maintain mental health. The introduction of the gut-brain axis has been instrumental in understanding the impact of food on mental health. It is widely reported that food can significantly influence gut microbiota metabolism, thereby playing a pivotal role in maintaining mental health. However, the vast amount of heterogeneous data published in recent research lacks systematic integration and application development. To remedy this, we construct a comprehensive knowledge graph, named Food4healthKG, focusing on food, gut microbiota, and mental diseases. The constructed workflow includes the integration of numerous heterogeneous data, entity linking to a normalized format, and the well-designed representation of the acquired knowledge. To illustrate the availability of Food4healthKG, we design two case studies: the knowledge query and the food recommendation based on Food4healthKG. Furthermore, we propose two evaluation methods to validate the quality of the results obtained from Food4healthKG. The results demonstrate the system's effectiveness in practical applications, particularly in providing convincing food recommendations based on gut microbiota and mental health.

38123016,The many faces of microbiota-gut-brain axis in autism spectrum disorder.,"The gut-brain axis is gaining more attention in neurodevelopmental disorders, especially autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Many factors can influence microbiota in early life, including host genetics and perinatal events (infections, mode of birth/delivery, medications, nutritional supply, and environmental stressors). The gut microbiome can influence blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, drug bioavailability, and social behaviors. Developing microbiota-based interventions such as probiotics, gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota transplantation, or metabolite supplementation may offer an exciting approach to treating ASD. This review highlights that RNA sequencing, metabolomics, and transcriptomics data are needed to understand how microbial modulators can influence ASD pathophysiology. Due to the substantial clinical heterogeneity of ASD, medical caretakers may be unlikely to develop a broad and effective general gut microbiota modulator. However, dietary modulation followed by administration of microbiota modulators is a promising option for treating ASD-related behavioral and gastrointestinal symptoms. Future work should focus on the accuracy of biomarker tests and developing specific psychobiotic agents tailored towards the gut microbiota seen in ASD patients, which may include developing individualized treatment options.",Life sciences,2024,Cinara L GonÃ§alves; Tejaswini Doifode; Victoria L Rezende; Maiara A Costa; J Marc Rhoads; Cesar A Soutullo

Due to the complex clinical manifestations and prolonged course,TAO seriously affect the physical and mental health of patients.The pathogenesis of TAO has not been fully elucidated and the treatment lacks specificity. Therefore, in-depth research on the pathogenesis of TAO is to find effective treatments. In recent years, studies have suggested that there is gut microbiota disorder in TAO, and the risk factors of TAO can promote gut microbiota disorder. Disordered gut microbiota can participate in the occurrence and development of TAO via influencing T cell differentiation, mimicking autoantigens, and influencing host non-coding RNA expression. Modulating the gut microbiota also has therapeutic effects on TAO and is a promising therapeutic approach.",Zhong nan da xue xue bao. Yi xue ban = Journal of Central South University.

37989444,Gut microbiota-mediated ursodeoxycholic acids regulate the inflammation of microglia through TGR5 signaling after MCAO.,"Ischemic stroke has been demonstrated to cause an imbalance of gut microbiota. However, the change in gut microbiota-mediated bile acids (BAs) metabolites remains unclear. Here, we observed a decrease in gut microbiota-mediated BAs, especially ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), in the serum of stroke patients as well as in the intestine, serum and brain of stroke mice. Restoration of UDCA could decrease the area of infarction and improve the neurological function and cognitive function in mice in association with inhibition of NLRP3-related pro-inflammatory cytokines through TGR5/PKA pathway. Furthermore, knocking out TGR5 and inhibiting PKA activity reduce the protective effect of UDCA. Taken together, our results suggest that microbiota-mediated UDCA plays an important role in alleviating inflammatory responses and might be a promising therapeutic target in ischemic stroke.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2024,Feng Zhang; Yiting Deng; Huidi Wang; Jingxiang Fu; Guangyan Wu; Zhuo Duan; Xiru Zhang; Yijia Cai; Hongwei Zhou; Jia Yin; Yan He
37759312,The role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis and treatment of postpartum depression.,"Postpartum depression (PPD) is a common complication of pregnancy in women, and its pathogenesis mainly involves disturbances of the neuroendocrine regulation, immune system, neurotransmitters, hormone secretion, and the gut microbiome. Gut microbes play essential physiological and pathological roles in the gut-brain axis' pathways which are involved in various central nervous system (CNS) and psychiatric disorders, including PPD. Numerous studies have identified the fundamental role of the gut-brain axis in the pathogenesis and treatment of PPD patients and also correlates with other pathogenic mechanisms of PPD. Disturbances in gut microbes are associated with the disruption of multiple signaling pathways and systems that ultimately lead to PPD development. This review aimed to elucidate the potential connections between gut microbes and the established PPD network, and this might serve as a guide for the development of new efficient diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic strategies in the management of PPD.",Annals of general psychiatry,2023,Sheng Zhang; Baili Lu; Gang Wang

37557965,The interactions between host genome and gut microbiome increase the risk of psychiatric disorders: Mendelian randomization and biological annotation.,"The correlation between human gut microbiota and psychiatric diseases has long been recognized. Based on the heritability of the microbiome, genome-wide association studies on human genome and gut microbiome (mbGWAS) have revealed important host-microbiome interactions. However, establishing causal relationships between specific gut microbiome features and psychological conditions remains challenging due to insufficient sample sizes of previous studies of mbGWAS.Cross-cohort meta-analysis (via METAL) and multi-trait analysis (via MTAG) were used to enhance the statistical power of mbGWAS for identifying genetic variants and genes. Using two large mbGWAS studies (7,738 and 5,959 participants respectively) and12 disease-specific studies from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC), we performed bidirectional two-sample mendelian randomization (MR) analyses between microbial features and psychiatric diseases (up to 500,199 individuals). Additionally, we conducted downstream gene- and gene-set-based analyses to investigate the shared biology linking gut microbiota and psychiatric diseases.METAL and MTAG conducted in mbGWAS could boost power for gene prioritization and MR analysis. Increases in the number of lead SNPs and mapped genes were witnessed in 13/15 species and 5/10 genera after using METAL, and MTAG analysis gained an increase in sample size equivalent to expanding the original samples from 7% to 63%. Following METAL use, we identified a positive association between Bacteroides faecis and ADHD (OR, 1.09; 95Â %CI, 1.02-1.16; PÂ =Â 0.008). Bacteroides eggerthii and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron were observed to be positively associated with PTSD (OR, 1.11; 95Â %CI, 1.03-1.20; PÂ =Â 0.007; OR, 1.11; 95Â %CI, 1.01-1.23; PÂ =Â 0.03). These findings remained stable across statistical models and sensitivity analyses. No genetic liabilities to psychiatric diseases may alter the abundance of gut microorganisms.Using biological annotation, we identified that those genes contributing to microbiomes (e.g., GRIN2A and RBFOX1) are expressed and enriched in human brain tissues.Our statistical genetics strategy helps to enhance the power of mbGWAS, and our genetic findings offer new insights into biological pleiotropy and causal relationship between microbiota and psychiatric diseases.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2023,Liling Xiao; Siyi Liu; Yulu Wu; Yunqi Huang; Shiwan Tao; Yunjia Liu; Yiguo Tang; Min Xie; Qianshu Ma; Yubing Yin; Minhan Dai; Mengting Zhang; Elyse Llamocca; Hongsheng Gui; Qiang Wang

38868440,Schizophrenia and obesity: May the gut microbiota serve as a link for the pathogenesis?,"Schizophrenia (SZ) places a tremendous burden on public health as one of the leading causes of disability and death. SZ patients are more prone to developing obesity than the general population from the clinical practice. The development of obesity frequently causes poor psychiatric outcomes in SZ patients. In turn, maternal obesity during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of SZ in offspring, suggesting that these two disorders may have shared neuropathological mechanisms. The gut microbiota is well known to serve as a major regulator of bidirectional interactions between the central nervous systemÂ and the gastrointestinal tract. It also plays a critical role in maintaining physical and mental health in humans. Recent studies have shown that the dysbiosis of gut microbiota is intimately associated with the onset of SZ and obesity through shared pathophysiological mechanisms, particularly the stimulation of immune inflammation. Therefore, gut microbiota may serve as a common biological basis for the etiology in both SZ and obesity, and the perturbed gut-brain axis may therefore account for the high prevalence of obesity in patients with SZ. On the basis of these findings, this review provides updated perspectives and intervention approaches on the etiology, prevention, and management of obesity in SZ patients by summarizing the recent findings on the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of SZ and obesity, highlighting the role of gut-derived inflammation.",iMeta,2023,Hui Wu; Yaxi Liu; Jie Wang; Shengyun Chen; Liwei Xie; Xiaoli Wu
37004759,Gut-derived bacterial LPS attenuates incubation of methamphetamine craving via modulating microglia.,"The microbiota-gut-brain axis plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders, and the compositions of gut microbiota are altered by addictive drugs. However, the role of gut microbiota in the incubation of methamphetamine (METH) craving remains poorly understood.16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed to assess the richness and diversity of gut microbiota in METH self-administration model. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed to evaluate the integrity of intestinal barrier. Immunofluorescence and three-dimensional reconstruction were performed to assess the morphologic changes of microglia. Serum levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were determined using the rat enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to assess transcript levels of dopamine receptor, glutamate ionotropic AMPA receptor 3 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor.METH self-administration induced gut microbiota dysbiosis, intestinal barrier damage and microglia activation in the nucleus accumbens core (NAcc), which was partially recovered after prolonged withdrawal. Microbiota depletion via antibiotic treatment increased LPS levels and induced a marked change in the microglial morphology in the NAcc, as indicated by the decreases in the lengths and numbers of microglial branches. Depleting the gut microbiota also prevented the incubation of METH craving and increased the population of Klebsiella oxytoca. Furthermore, Klebsiella oxytoca treatment or exogenous administration of the gram-negative bacterial cell wall component LPS increased serum and central LPS levels, induced microglial morphological changes and reduced the dopamine receptor transcription in the NAcc. Both treatments and NAcc microinjections of gut-derived bacterial LPS significantly decreased METH craving after prolonged withdrawal.These data suggest that LPS from gut gram-negative bacteria may enter circulating blood, activate microglia in the brain and consequently decrease METH craving after withdrawal, which may have important implications for novel strategies to prevent METH addiction and relapse.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2023,Zhoulong Yu; Wenjun Chen; Libo Zhang; Yun Chen; Wenxi Chen; Shiqiu Meng; Lin Lu; Ying Han; Jie Shi
37845499,Emerging role of the host microbiome in neuropsychiatric disorders: overview and future directions.,"The human body harbors a diverse ecosystem of microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi, collectively known as the microbiota. Current research is increasingly focusing on the potential association between the microbiota and various neuropsychiatric disorders. The microbiota resides in various parts of the body, such as the oral cavity, nasal passages, lungs, gut, skin, bladder, and vagina. The gut microbiota in the gastrointestinal tract has received particular attention due to its high abundance and its potential role in psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. However, the microbiota presents in other body tissues, though less abundant, also plays crucial role in immune system and human homeostasis, thus influencing the development and progression of neuropsychiatric disorders. For example, oral microbiota imbalance and associated periodontitis might increase the risk for neuropsychiatric disorders. Additionally, studies using the postmortem brain samples have detected the widespread presence of oral bacteria in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. This article provides an overview of the emerging role of the host microbiota in neuropsychiatric disorders and discusses future directions, such as underlying biological mechanisms, reliable biomarkers associated with the host microbiota, and microbiota-targeted interventions, for research in this field.",Molecular psychiatry,2023,Kenji Hashimoto
37867494,"Exploring the gut microbiota: lifestyle choices, disease associations, and personal genomics.","The gut microbiota is a rich and dynamic ecosystem that actively interacts with the human body, playing a significant role in the state of health and disease of the host. Diet, exercise, mental health, and other factors have exhibited the ability to influence the gut bacterial composition, leading to changes that can prevent and improve, or favor and worsen, both intestinal and extra-intestinal conditions. Altered gut microbial states, or 'dysbiosis', associated with conditions and diseases are often characterized by shifts in bacterial abundance and diversity, including an impaired <i>Firmicutes</i> to <i>Bacteroidetes</i> ratio. By understanding the effect of lifestyle on the gut microbiota, personalized advice can be generated to suit each individual profile and foster the adoption of lifestyle changes that can both prevent and ameliorate dysbiosis. The delivery of effective and reliable advice, however, depends not only on the available research and current understanding of the topic, but also on the methods used to assess individuals and to discover the associations, which can introduce bias at multiple stages. The aim of this review is to summarize how human gut microbial variability is defined and what lifestyle choices and diseases have shown association with gut bacterial composition. Furthermore, popular methods to investigate the human gut microbiota are outlined, with a focus on the possible bias caused by the lack of use of standardized methods.

37174495,"Gut Microbiota and Behavioural Issues in Production, Performance, and Companion Animals: A Systematic Review.","The literature has identified poor nutrition as the leading factor in the manifestation of many behavioural issues in animals, including aggression, hyperalertness, and stereotypies. Literature focused on all species of interest consistently reported that although there were no significant differences in the richness of specific bacterial taxa in the microbiota of individual subjects with abnormal behaviour (termed alpha diversity), there was variability in species diversity between these subjects compared to controls (termed beta diversity). As seen in humans with mental disorders, animals exhibiting abnormal behaviour often have an enrichment of pro-inflammatory and lactic acid-producing bacteria and a reduction in butyrate-producing bacteria. It is evident from the literature that an association exists between gut microbiota diversity (and by extension, the concurrent production of microbial metabolites) and abnormal behavioural phenotypes across various species, including pigs, dogs, and horses. Similar microbiota population changes are also evident in human mental health patients. However, there are insufficient data to identify this association as a cause or effect. This review provides testable hypotheses for future research to establish causal relationships between gut microbiota and behavioural issues in animals, offering promising potential for the development of novel therapeutic and/or preventative interventions aimed at restoring a healthy gut-brain-immune axis to mitigate behavioural issues and, in turn, improve health, performance, and production in animals.",Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,2023,Bonnie Homer; Jackson Judd; Manijeh Mohammadi Dehcheshmeh; Esmaeil Ebrahimie; Darren J Trott
37108739,Circadian Disruption and Mental Health: The Chronotherapeutic Potential of Microbiome-Based and Dietary Strategies.,"Mental illness is alarmingly on the rise, and circadian disruptions linked to a modern lifestyle may largely explain this trend. Impaired circadian rhythms are associated with mental disorders. The evening chronotype, which is linked to circadian misalignment, is a risk factor for severe psychiatric symptoms and psychiatric metabolic comorbidities. Resynchronization of circadian rhythms commonly improves psychiatric symptoms. Furthermore, evidence indicates that preventing circadian misalignment may help reduce the risk of psychiatric disorders and the impact of neuro-immuno-metabolic disturbances in psychiatry. The gut microbiota exhibits diurnal rhythmicity, as largely governed by meal timing, which regulates the host's circadian rhythms. Temporal circadian regulation of feeding has emerged as a promising chronotherapeutic strategy to prevent and/or help with the treatment of mental illnesses, largely through the modulation of gut microbiota. Here, we provide an overview of the link between circadian disruption and mental illness. We summarize the connection between gut microbiota and circadian rhythms, supporting the idea that gut microbiota modulation may aid in preventing circadian misalignment and in the resynchronization of disrupted circadian rhythms. We describe diurnal microbiome rhythmicity and its related factors, highlighting the role of meal timing. Lastly, we emphasize the necessity and rationale for further research to develop effective and safe microbiome and dietary strategies based on chrononutrition to combat mental illness.",International journal of molecular sciences,2023,Pilar CodoÃ±er-Franch; Marie Gombert; JosÃ© MartÃ­nez-Raga; MarÃ­a Carmen Cenit

Gut microbiomes were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and gut metabolomes were analyzed by a mass spectrometry approach. Based on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), patients were categorized into two groups: the insomnia group (PSQI score â¥ 9, n = 20) and the non-insomnia group (PSQI score < 9, n = 20).The insomnia group showed a lower alpha diversity in the Chao1 and Shannon indices than the non-insomnia group after the false discovery rate (FDR) correction. The relative abundance of genus Bacteroides showed a positive correlation with PSQI scores in the non-insomnia group. The concentrations of glucosamine and N-methylglutamate were significantly higher in the insomnia group than in the non-insomnia group.Our findings suggest that specific taxa could affect the sleep quality among patients with depression and anxiety disorders. Further studies are needed to elucidate the impact of sleep on specific gut microbiota and metabolomes in depression and anxiety disorders.",PloS one,2023,Arisa Tanaka; Kenji Sanada; Katsuma Miyaho; Tomoyuki Tachibana; Shunya Kurokawa; Chiharu Ishii; Yoshihiro Noda; Shinichiro Nakajima; Shinji Fukuda; Masaru Mimura; Taishiro Kishimoto; Akira Iwanami
38011787,Cryptotanshinone regulates gut microbiota and PI3K-AKT pathway in rats to alleviate CUMS induced depressive symptoms.,"Cryptotanshinone (CPT), a bioactive compound derived from the traditional Chinese herb Salvia miltiorrhiza, exhibits promising antidepressant properties. Employing a rat model subjected to Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress (CUMS), behavioral analyses (open field experiment, elevated cross maze experiment, sugar water preference experiment, forced swimming experiment) and inflammatory factor assessments were conducted to assess the efficacy of CPT in alleviating depressive symptoms and inflammatory responses induced by CUMS. Moreover, 16Â S rDNA analysis revealed alterations in the gut microbiota of rats exposed to both CUMS and CPT administration. Notably, CPT administration was found to mitigate harmful bacterial shifts associated with depression. Preliminary exploration of the molecular mechanism underlying CPT's antidepressant effects via transcriptomics analysis and molecular docking indicated that CPT might exert its influence by regulating the PI3K-AKT pathway. This study sheds light on the potential therapeutic role of CPT in managing depressive disorders, offering a comprehensive understanding of its impact on behavior, inflammation, gut microbiota, and molecular pathways.",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2023,Li-Hua Bian; Si-Qi Wang; Wen-Jing Li; Jie Li; Yi Yin; Fang-Fu Ye; Jian-You Guo
37468912,Altered gut microbiota-host bile acid metabolism in IBS-D patients with liver depression and spleen deficiency pattern.,"Dysregulation of gut microbiota-host bile acid (BA) co-metabolism is a critical pathogenic factor of diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), instructed by pattern differentiation, is effective in treating IBS-D, in which liver depression and spleen deficiency (LDSD) is the most prevalent pattern. Still, it is unclear the linkage between the LDSD pattern and the BA metabolic phenotype.This study aimed to uncover the biological basis of the LDSD pattern from the BA metabolic perspective.Patients with IBS-D completed questionnaires regarding the irritable bowel severity scoring system (IBS-SSS), stool frequency, Stool Bristol scale, and Self-Rating Scales of mental health. Fasting blood and morning feces were collected to analyze the gut metagenome and BA-related indices/metabolites.IBS-D patients with LDSD had a higher incidence of BA overexcretion (41% vs. 23% non-LDSD) with significant elevations in fecal total BAs and serum BA precursor 7Î±-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one levels. Compared to controls or non-LDSD patients, LDSD patients had a featured fecal BA profile, with higher proportions of deoxycholic acid (DCA), 7-ketodeoxycholic acid, and lithocholic acid. It is consistent with the BA-metabolizing genomic changes in the LDSD gut microbiota characterized by overabundances of 7-dehydroxylating bacteria and BA-inducible genes (baiCD/E/H). The score of bowel symptoms (stool frequency and abdominal pain) showing greater severity in the LDSD pattern were positively correlated with bai-expressing bacterial abundances and fecal DCA levels separately.We clarified a differed BA metabolic phenotype in IBS patients with LDSD, which closely correlates with the severity of bowel symptoms. It demonstrates that gut microbiota and host co-metabolism of BAs would provide crucial insight into the biology of the LDSD pattern and its internal relationship with IBS progression.",Chinese medicine,2023,Liqing Du; Zhaozhou Zhang; Lixiang Zhai; Shujun Xu; Wei Yang; Chunhua Huang; Chengyuan Lin; Linda L D Zhong; Zhaoxiang Bian; Ling Zhao
37548294,Challenges and priorities for researching the gut microbiota in individuals living with anorexia nervosa.,"The gut microbiota is implicated in several symptoms and biological pathways relevant to anorexia nervosa (AN). Investigations into the role of the gut microbiota in AN are growing, with a specific interest in the changes that occur in response to treatment. Findings suggest that microbial species may be associated with some of the symptoms common in AN, such as depression and gastrointestinal disturbances (GID). Therefore, researchers believe the gut microbiota may have therapeutic relevance. Whilst research in this field is rapidly expanding, the unique considerations relevant to conducting gut microbiota research in individuals with AN must be addressed.We provide an overview of the published literature investigating the relationship between the gut microbiota and symptoms and behaviors present in AN, discuss important challenges in gut microbiota research, and offer recommendations for addressing these. We conclude by summarizing research design priorities for the field to move forward.Several ways exist to reduce participant burden and accommodate challenges when researching the gut microbiota in individuals with AN.Recommendations from this article are foreseen to encourage scientific rigor and thoughtful protocol planning for microbiota research in AN, including ways to reduce participant burden. Employing such methods will contribute to a better understanding of the role of the gut microbiota in AN pathophysiology and treatment.The field of gut microbiota research is rapidly expanding, including the role of the gut microbiota in anorexia nervosa. Thoughtful planning of future research will ensure appropriate data collection for meaningful interpretation while providing a positive experience for the participant. We present current challenges, recommendations for research design and priorities to facilitate the advancement of research in this field.",The International journal of eating disorders,2023,Madeline L West; Susan Hart; Amy Loughman; Felice N Jacka; Heidi M Staudacher; Afrouz Abbaspour; Andrea Phillipou; Anu Ruusunen; Tetyana Rocks
38010793,Multi-omics analyses demonstrate the modulating role of gut microbiota on the associations of unbalanced dietary intake with gastrointestinal symptoms in children with autism spectrum disorder.,"Our previous work revealed that unbalanced dietary intake was an important independent factor associated with constipation and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Growing evidence has shown the alterations in the gut microbiota and gut microbiota-derived metabolites in ASD. However, how the altered microbiota might affect the associations between unbalanced diets and GI symptoms in ASD remains unknown. We analyzed microbiome and metabolomics data in 90 ASD and 90 typically developing (TD) children based on 16S rRNA and untargeted metabolomics, together with dietary intake and GI symptoms assessment. We found that there existed 11 altered gut microbiota (FDR-corrected P-value <0.05) and 397 altered metabolites (P-value <0.05) in children with ASD compared with TD children. Among the 11 altered microbiota, the <i>Turicibacter</i>, <i>Coprococcus 1</i>, and <i>Lachnospiraceae FCS020 group</i> were positively correlated with constipation (FDR-corrected P-value <0.25). The Eggerthellaceae was positively correlated with total GI symptoms (FDR-corrected P-value <0.25). More importantly, three increased microbiota including <i>Turicibacter</i>, <i>Coprococcus 1</i>, and Eggerthellaceae positively modulated the associations of unbalanced dietary intake with constipation and total GI symptoms, and the decreased <i>Clostridium sp. BR31</i> negatively modulated their associations in ASD children (P-value <0.05). Together, the altered microbiota strengthens the relationship between unbalanced dietary intake and GI symptoms. Among the altered metabolites, ten metabolites derived from microbiota (<i>Turicibacter</i>, <i>Coprococcus 1</i>, Eggerthellaceae, and <i>Clostridium sp. BR31</i>) were screened out, enriched in eight metabolic pathways, and were identified to correlate with constipation and total GI symptoms in ASD children (FDR-corrected P-value <0.25). These metabolomics findings further support the modulating role of gut microbiota on the associations of unbalanced dietary intake with GI symptoms. Collectively, our research provides insights into the relationship between diet, the gut microbiota, and GI symptoms in children with ASD.",Gut microbes,2023,Hailin Li; Churui Liu; Saijun Huang; Xin Wang; Muqing Cao; Tingfeng Gu; Xiaoxuan Ou; Shuolin Pan; Zongyu Lin; Xiaotong Wang; Yanna Zhu; Jin Jing
37943628,Gut microbiota and child behavior in early puberty: does child sex play a role?,"A growing number of studies have indicated relations between the gut microbiota and mental health. However, to date, there is a scarcity of microbiota studies in community samples in early puberty. The current preregistered study (https://osf.io/wu2vt) investigated gut microbiota composition in relation to sex in low-risk children and explored behavioral associations with gut microbiota composition and metabolites in the same samples, together with the potential role of sex. Fecal microbiota composition was analyzed in 12-year-old children (<i>N</i>â=â137) by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and quantitative PCR. Modest sex differences were observed in beta diversity. Generalized linear models showed consistent behavioral relations to both relative and absolute abundances of individual taxa, including positive associations between Parasutterella and mother-reported internalizing behavior, and negative associations between Odoribacter and mother-reported externalizing behavior. Additionally, Prevotella 9 was positively related to mother-reported externalizing behavior, confirming earlier findings on the same cohort at 5 years of age. Sex-related differences were found in behavioral relations to Ruminiclostridium 5, Alistipes, Streptococcus, Ruminiclostridium 9, Ruminococcaceae UCG-5, and Dialister, for relative abundances, as well as to Family XIII AD3011 group and an unidentified bacterium within the Tenericutes, for absolute abundances. Limited behavioral relations were observed regarding alpha diversity and fecal metabolites. Our findings describe links between the gut microbiota and child behavior, together with differences between child sexes in these relations, in low-risk early pubertal children. Importantly, this study confirmed earlier findings in this cohort of positive relations between Prevotella 9 and externalizing behavior at age 10 years. Results also show the merit of including absolute abundances in microbiota studies.",Gut microbes,2023,Yangwenshan Ou; Eline Rots; Clara Belzer; Hauke Smidt; Carolina de Weerth
38139446,A Pilot Interaction Analysis of Gut Microbiota and Peripheral Markers of Aging in Severe Psychiatric Disorders: A Role for <i>Lachnoclostridium</i>?,"Excessive predominance of pathological species in the gut microbiota could increase the production of inflammatory mediators at the gut level and, via modification of the gut-blood barrier, at the systemic level. This pro-inflammatory state could, in turn, increase biological aging that is generally proxied by telomere shortening. In this study, we present findings from a secondary interaction analysis of gut microbiota, aging, and inflammatory marker data from a cohort of patients with different diagnoses of severe mental disorders. We analyzed 15 controls, 35 patients with schizophrenia (SCZ), and 31 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) recruited among those attending a community mental health center (50 males and 31 females, mean and median age 46.8 and 46.3 years, respectively). We performed 16S rRNA sequencing as well as measurement of telomere length via quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. We applied statistical modeling with logistic regression to test for interaction between gut microbiota and these markers. Our results showed statistically significant interactions between telomere length and gut microbiota pointing to the genus <i>Lachnostridium</i>, which remained significantly associated with a reduced likelihood of MDD even after adjustment for a series of covariates. Although exploratory, these findings show that specific gut microbiota signatures overexpressing <i>Lachnoclostridium</i> and interacting with biological aging could modulate the liability for MDD.",International journal of molecular sciences,2023,Mirko Manchia; Pasquale Paribello; Claudia Pisanu; Donatella Congiu; Athos Antoniades; Paris Vogazianos; Federica Tozzi; Federica Pinna; Aristos Aristodimou; Paola Caria; Tinuccia Dettori; Daniela Virginia Frau; Cristina Cocco; Barbara Noli; Concetta Panebianco; Valerio Pazienza; Bernardo Carpiniello; Alessio Squassina
37604976,Transmission of Alzheimer's disease-associated microbiota dysbiosis and its impact on cognitive function: evidence from mice and patients.,"Spouses of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients are at a higher risk of developing incidental dementia. However, the causes and underlying mechanism of this clinical observation remain largely unknown. One possible explanation is linked to microbiota dysbiosis, a condition that has been associated with AD. However, it remains unclear whether gut microbiota dysbiosis can be transmitted from AD individuals to non-AD individuals and contribute to the development of AD pathogenesis and cognitive impairment. We, therefore, set out to perform both animal studies and clinical investigation by co-housing wild-type mice and AD transgenic mice, analyzing microbiota via 16S rRNA gene sequencing, measuring short-chain fatty acid amounts, and employing behavioral test, mass spectrometry, site-mutations and other methods. The present study revealed that co-housing between wild-type mice and AD transgenic mice or administrating feces of AD transgenic mice to wild-type mice resulted in AD-associated gut microbiota dysbiosis, Tau phosphorylation, and cognitive impairment in the wild-type mice. Gavage with Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium restored these changes in the wild-type mice. The oral and gut microbiota of AD patient partners resembled that of AD patients but differed from healthy controls, indicating the transmission of microbiota. The underlying mechanism of these findings includes that the butyric acid-mediated acetylation of GSK3Î² at lysine 15 regulated its phosphorylation at serine 9, consequently impacting Tau phosphorylation. Pending confirmative studies, these results provide insight into a potential link between the transmission of AD-associated microbiota dysbiosis and development of cognitive impairment, which underscore the need for further research in this area.",Molecular psychiatry,2023,Yiying Zhang; Yuan Shen; Ning Liufu; Ling Liu; Wei Li; Zhongyong Shi; Hailin Zheng; Xinchun Mei; Chih-Yu Chen; Zengliang Jiang; Shabnamsadat Abtahi; Yuanlin Dong; Feng Liang; Yujiang Shi; Leo L Cheng; Guang Yang; Jing X Kang; Jeremy E Wilkinson; Zhongcong Xie
37007475,Influence of mental health medication on microbiota in the elderly population in the Valencian region.,"Spain has an aging population; 19.93% of the Spanish population is over 65. Aging is accompanied by several health issues, including mental health disorders and changes in the gut microbiota. The gut-brain axis is a bidirectional network linking the central nervous system with gastrointestinal tract functions, and therefore, the gut microbiota can influence an individual's mental health. Furthermore, aging-related physiological changes affect the gut microbiota, with differences in taxa and their associated metabolic functions between younger and older people. Here, we took a case-control approach to study the interplay between gut microbiota and mental health of elderly people. Fecal and saliva samples from 101 healthy volunteers over 65 were collected, of which 28 (EE|MH group) reported using antidepressants or medication for anxiety or insomnia at the time of sampling. The rest of the volunteers (EE|NOMH group) were the control group. 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metagenomic sequencing were applied to determine the differences between intestinal and oral microbiota. Significant differences in genera were found, specifically eight in the gut microbiota, and five in the oral microbiota. Functional analysis of fecal samples showed differences in five orthologous genes related to tryptophan metabolism, the precursor of serotonin and melatonin, and in six categories related to serine metabolism, a precursor of tryptophan. Moreover, we found 29 metabolic pathways with significant inter-group differences, including pathways regulating longevity, the dopaminergic synapse, the serotoninergic synapse, and two amino acids.",Frontiers in microbiology,2023,Nicole Pesantes; Ana BarberÃ¡; BenjamÃ­ PÃ©rez-Rocher; Alejandro Artacho; Sergio LuÃ­s Vargas; AndrÃ©s Moya; Susana Ruiz-Ruiz

37852343,"Major depressive disorder as a neuro-immune disorder: Origin, mechanisms, and therapeutic opportunities.","Notwithstanding advances in understanding the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD), no single mechanism can explain all facets of this disorder. An expanding body of evidence indicates a putative role for the inflammatory response. Several meta-analyses showed an increase in systemic peripheral inflammatory markers in individuals with MDD. Numerous conditions and circumstances in the modern world may promote chronic systemic inflammation through mechanisms, including alterations in the gut microbiota. Peripheral cytokines may reach the brain and contribute to neuroinflammation through cellular, humoral, and neural pathways. On the other hand, antidepressant drugs may decrease peripheral levels of inflammatory markers. Anti-inflammatory drugs and nutritional strategies that reduce inflammation also could improve depressive symptoms. The present study provides a critical review of recent advances in the role of inflammation in the pathophysiology of MDD. Furthermore, this review discusses the role of glial cells and the main drivers of changes associated with neuroinflammation.

37659269,Disordered gut microbiota and changes in short-chain fatty acids and inflammatory processes in stress-vulnerable mice.,"Long-term exposure to chronic stress increases the incidence of depression. However, chronic stress is an associated risk factor in only a subset of individuals. Inflammation has been identified as a putative mechanism promoting stress vulnerability. Because of the gut microbiota's potential role as a source of inflammatory substances, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) may exert their influence on inflammation, emotional states, and cognition via the gut-brain axis. In this study, Classic behavioral tests were used to categorize C57BL/6Â J mice into a CUMS-vulnerable and a CUMS-resilient group after they were exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). We compared the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences retrieved from fecal samples between control, CUMS-vulnerable, and CUMS-resilient mice. SCFAs in fecal samples were detected by liquid chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Hippocampal cytokine production and TLR4/MYD88/NF-ÎºB inflammatory pathway activation were evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and western blotting. Then, we supplemented SCFAs in CUMS mice. we observed depression-like behavior and the expression of TLR4/MYD88/NF-ÎºB inflammatory pathway in hippocampus of SCFAs supplementation mice. Susceptible mice to CUMS showed more severe symptoms of depression and anxiety, Î± diversity was significantly different, as well as higher expression of interleukin (IL)-1Î² and TLR4/MYD88/NF-ÎºB inflammatory pathway components in the hippocampus. SCFA levels in the feces were significantly higher in CUMS-resilient mice than in control mice. Depressive behavior was reversed in CUMS-SCFAs group, and the protein level of TLR4/MYD88/NF-ÎºB in hippocampus was decreased. Overall, these results provide new light on the possible involvement of the microbiome in the gut-brain axis development in depressive disorder and provide a theoretical basis for identifying novel therapeutic targets.",Journal of neuroimmunology,2023,Wenjuan Han; Yaxin Zheng; Lan Wang; Cuixia An

This study aimed to examine the influence of maternal overweight, obesity and/or gestational diabetes on the offspring behavior at 3.5Â years of age and its association with the gut microbiota already established at 18Â months of life.156 children born to overweight (OV, nâ=â45), obese (OB, nâ=â40) and normoweight (NW, nâ=â71) pregnant women participating in the PREOBE study were included in the current analysis. Stool samples were collected at 18Â months of life and gut microbiome was obtained by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Behavioral problems were evaluated at 3.5Â years by using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). ANOVA, Chi-Square Test, ANCOVA, Spearman's correlation, logistic regression model and generalized linear model (GLM) were performed.At 3.5Â years of age, Children born to OV/OB mothers showed higher scores in behavioral problems than those born to NW mothers. Additionally, offspring born to OB mothers who developed gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) presented higher scores in attention/deficit hyperactivity and externalizing problems than those born to GDM OV/NW mothers. Fusicatenibacter abundance found at 18Â months of age was associated to lower scores in total, internalizing and pervasive developmental problems, while an unidentified genus within Clostridiales and Flavonifractor families abundance showed a positive correlation with anxiety/depression and somatic complaints, respectively. On the other hand, children born to mothers with higher BMI who were breastfed presented elevated anxiety, internalizing problems, externalizing problems and total problems scores; likewise, their gut microbiota composition at 18Â months of age showed positive correlation with behavioral problems at 3.5Â years: Actinobacteria abundance and somatic complaints and between Fusobacteria abundance and withdrawn behavior and pervasive developmental problems.Our findings suggests that OV/OB and/or GDM during pregnancy is associated with higher behavioral problems scores in children at 3.5Â years old.

However, the scale and heterogeneous nature of multi-modal data makes integration and inference a non-trivial task. We developed a deep-learning-based framework, multi-omics variational autoencoders (MOVE), to integrate such data and applied it to a cohort of 789 people with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes with deep multi-omics phenotyping from the DIRECT consortium. Using in silico perturbations, we identified drug-omics associations across the multi-modal datasets for the 20 most prevalent drugs given to people with type 2 diabetes with substantially higher sensitivity than univariate statistical tests. From these, we among others, identified novel associations between metformin and the gut microbiota as well as opposite molecular responses for the two statins, simvastatin and atorvastatin.

Researchers have studied the causes of metabolic abnormalities caused by clozapine from multiple perspectives, but the reasons remain unclear.Characterize the gut microbiota of people with schizophrenia taking clozapine, exploring the association between gut microbiota and glucose lipid metabolic markers in schizophrenia patients taking clozapine.Sixty-one long-term inpatients with schizophrenia in clozapine monotherapy were selected as study subjects. We got four subgroups by sex and the presence of metabolic syndrome.16s analysis technology was applied at the genus level to determine the classification of gut microbiota. Then we compared the characteristics of gut microbiota and the association of gut microbiota with glucose lipid metabolic markers in each group.We found differences in the diversity of gut microbiota among groups. The association between gut microbiota and glucose lipid metabolic markers was complicated. Gender was an important differentiating factor. <i>Oscillibacter</i> has a low abundance. However, it was the only genus associated with glycemic or lipids in each group. Among metabolic syndromes, <i>Gemmiger</i> was positively correlated with most lipids in females but negatively correlated in males, showing gender differences. In female non-metabolic syndromes, <i>Bifidobacterium</i> lost its probiotic character; instead, showing pathogenicity, which has strong positive correlations with fasting blood glucose and low-density lipoprotein but negative correlations with Apolipoprotein A1.

The biological mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of BD remain incompletely understood, but it seems that there is a complex picture of genetic and environmental factors implicated. Nowadays, gut microbiota is in the spotlight of new research related to this kind of psychiatric disorder, as it can be consistently related to several pathophysiological events observed in BD. In the context of the so-called microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis, it is shown to have a strong influence on host neuromodulation and endocrine functions (i.e., controlling the synthesis of neurotransmitters like serotonin or mediating the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis), as well as in modulation of host immune responses, critically regulating intestinal, systemic and brain inflammation (neuroinflammation). The present review aims to elucidate pathophysiological mechanisms derived from the MGB axis disruption and possible therapeutic approaches mainly focusing on gut microbiota in the complex network of BD. Understanding the mechanisms of gut microbiota and its bidirectional communication with the immune and other systems can shed light on the discovery of new therapies for improving the clinical management of these patients. Besides, the effect of psychiatric drugs on gut microbiota currently used in BD patients, together with new therapeutical approaches targeting this ecosystem (dietary patterns, probiotics, prebiotics, and other novelties) will also be contemplated.",Molecular psychiatry,2023,Miguel A Ortega; Miguel Angel Ãlvarez-Mon; Cielo GarcÃ­a-Montero; Ãscar Fraile-MartÃ­nez; Jorge Monserrat; Lucia Martinez-Rozas; Roberto RodrÃ­guez-JimÃ©nez; Melchor Ãlvarez-Mon; Guillermo Lahera
37741061,The role of the gut-microbiota-brain axis via the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve in chronic inflammatory pain and comorbid spatial working memory impairment in complete Freund's adjuvant mice.,"Chronic inflammatory pain (CIP) is a common public medical problem, often accompanied by memory impairment. However, the mechanisms underlying CIP and comorbid memory impairment remain elusive. This study aimed to examine the role of the gut-microbiota-brain axis in CIP and comorbid memory impairment in mice treated with complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). 16S rRNA analysis showed the altered diversity of gut microbiota from day 1 to day 14 after CFA injection. Interestingly, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from healthy naive mice ameliorated comorbidities, such as mechanical allodynia, thermal hyperalgesia, spatial working memory impairment, neuroinflammation, and abnormal composition of gut microbiota in the CFA mice. Additionally, subdiaphragmatic vagotomy (SDV) blocked the onset of these comorbidities. Interestingly, the relative abundance of the bacterial genus or species was also correlated with these comorbidities after FMT or SDV. Therefore, our results suggest that the gut-microbiota-brain axis via the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve is crucial for the development of CIP and comorbid spatial working memory impairment in CFA mice.",Journal of psychiatric research,2023,Caibao Yue; Weiwei Luan; Hanwen Gu; Di Qiu; Xin Ding; Panmiao Liu; Xingming Wang; Kenji Hashimoto; Jian-Jun Yang
37064156,Association between gut microbiota and hepatocellular carcinoma from 2011 to 2022: Bibliometric analysis and global trends.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a primary malignant tumor responsible for approximately 90% of all liver cancers in humans, making it one of the leading public health problems worldwide. The gut microbiota is a complex microbial ecosystem that can influence tumor formation, metastasis, and resistance to treatment. Therefore, understanding the potential mechanisms of gut microbiota pathogenesis is critical for the prevention and treatment of HCC.A search was conducted in the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database for English literature studies on the relationship between gut microbiota and HCC from 2011 to 2022. Bibliometric analysis tools such as VOSviewer, CiteSpace, and R Studio were used to analyze global trends and research hotspots in this field.A total of 739 eligible publications, comprising of 383 articles and 356 reviews, were analyzed. Over the past 11 years, there has been a rapid increase in the annual number of publications and average citation levels, especially in the last five years. The majority of published articles on this topic originated from China (n=257, 34.78%), followed by the United States of America (n=203, 27.47%), and Italy (n=85, 11.50%). American scholars demonstrated high productivity, prominence, and academic environment influence in the research of this subject. Furthermore, the University of California, San Diego published the most papers (n=24) and had the highest average citation value (value=152.17) in the study of the relationship between gut microbiota and HCC. Schnabl B from the USA and Ohtani N from Japan were the authors with the highest number of publications and average citation value, respectively.In recent years, research on the gut microbiota's role in HCC has made rapid progress. Through a review of published literature, it has been found that the gut microbiota is crucial in the pathogenesis of HCC and in oncotherapy.",Frontiers in oncology,2023,Zhitao Chen; Chenchen Ding; Yangjun Gu; Yahui He; Bing Chen; Shusen Zheng; Qiyong Li
38436218,Roles of Diet-Associated Gut Microbial Metabolites on Brain Health: Cell-to-Cell Interactions between Gut Bacteria and the Central Nervous System.,"Gut microbiota have crucial effects on brain function via the gut-brain axis. Growing evidence suggests that this interaction is mediated by signaling molecules derived from dietary components metabolized by the intestinal microbiota. Although recent studies have provided a substantial understanding of the cell-specific effects of gut microbial molecules in gut microbiome-brain research, further validation is needed. This review presents recent findings on gut microbiota-derived dietary metabolites that enter the systemic circulation and influence the cell-to-cell interactions between gut microbes and cells in the central nervous system (CNS), particularly microglia, astrocytes, and neuronal cells, ultimately affecting cognitive function, mood, and behavior. Specifically, this review highlights the roles of metabolites produced by the gut microbiota via dietary component transformation, including short-chain fatty acids, tryptophan metabolites, and bile acid metabolites, in promoting the function and maturation of brain cells and suppressing inflammatory signals in the CNS. We also discuss future directions for gut microbiome-brain research, focusing on diet-induced microbial metabolite-based therapies as possible novel approaches to mental health treatment.","Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2024,Chong-Su Kim

The 16S RNA method was used to analyze the intestinal microflora and the characteristics of serum SCFAs detection by ELISA kit, as well as the intestinal flora, SCFAs content and their correlation with MDD clinical indicators.The abundance of <i>Akkermansia</i>, <i>Megamonas</i>, <i>Prevotellaceae NK3B31 group</i>, and butyrate-producing bacteria, <i>Lachnospira</i>, <i>Subdoligranulum</i>, <i>Blautia</i>, and <i>Dialister</i>, and acetate-producing bacteria, <i>Streptococcus</i>, in the gut microbiota of the MDD group was lower than that in the control (C) group. The abundance of <i>Parasutterella</i> in the MDD group was higher than that in the C group. <i>Dialister</i> negatively correlated with all measured clinical symptoms (<i>r</i> < 0, <i>P</i> < 0.05). The serum SCFA content in the MDD group was higher than that in the C group, and the content positively correlated with the Hamilton anxiety scale scores (<i>r</i> = 0.584, <i>P</i> < 0.05).The results demonstrated that the MDD group differed from the C group in terms of gut microbiota and SCFAs in the serum and that the change in certain intestinal bacteria might participate in the pathogenic mechanism of MDD.",Frontiers in psychology,2023,Shuhan Yu; Lan Wang; Xinyang Jing; Yujing Wang; Cuixia An

However, the role of gut microbiota and microbiome-derived metabolites in resilience versus susceptibility in rodents exposed to stress remains unclear.Adult male rats were exposed to inescapable electric stress under the learned helplessness (LH) paradigm. The composition of gut microbiota and metabolites in the brain and blood from control (no stress) rats, LH resilient rats, and LH susceptible rats were examined.At the genus level, the relative abundances of Asaccharobacter, Eisenbergiella, and Klebsiella in LH susceptible rats were significantly higher than that of LH resilient rats. At the species level, the relative abundances of several microbiome were significantly altered between LH susceptible rats and LH resilient rats. Furthermore, there were several metabolites in the brain and blood altered between LH susceptible rats and LH resilient rats. A network analysis showed correlations between the abundance of several microbiome and metabolites in the brain (or blood).Detailed roles of microbiome and metabolites are unclear.These findings suggest that abnormal compositions of the gut microbiota and metabolites might contribute to susceptibility versus resilience in rats subjected to inescapable electric foot shock.",Journal of affective disorders,2023,Xingming Wang; Akifumi Eguchi; Yuko Fujita; Xiayun Wan; Lijia Chang; Yong Yang; Jiajing Shan; Youge Qu; Li Ma; Yukihiko Shirayama; Chisato Mori; Jianjun Yang; Kenji Hashimoto
36990371,"Outrunning a bad diet: Interactions between exercise and a Western-style diet for adolescent mental health, metabolism and microbes.","Adolescence is a period of biological, psychological and social changes, and the peak time for the emergence of mental health problems. During this life stage, brain plasticity including hippocampal neurogenesis is increased, which is crucial for cognitive functions and regulation of emotional responses. The hippocampus is especially susceptible to environmental and lifestyle influences, mediated by changes in physiological systems, resulting in enhanced brain plasticity but also an elevated risk for developing mental health problems. Indeed, adolescence is accompanied by increased activation of the maturing hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, sensitivity to metabolic changes due to increased nutritional needs and hormonal changes, and gut microbiota maturation. Importantly, dietary habits and levels of physical activity significantly impact these systems.Â In this review, the interactions between exercise and Western-style diets, which are high in fat and sugar, on adolescent stress susceptibility, metabolism and the gut microbiota are explored. We provide an overview of current knowledge on implications of these interactions for hippocampal function and adolescent mental health, and speculate on potential mechanisms which require further investigation.",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,2023,Minke H C Nota; Sarah Nicolas; Olivia F O'Leary; Yvonne M Nolan
37049591,Dysbiosis of the Gut Microbiota and Kynurenine (Kyn) Pathway Activity as Potential Biomarkers in Patients with Major Depressive Disorder.,"With increasing attention paid to the concept of the microbiota-gut-brain axis, mounting evidence reveals that the gut microbiota is involved in a variety of neurological and psychiatric diseases. However, gut microbiota changes in major depressive disorder (MDD) patients and their association with disease mechanisms remain undefined. Fifty MDD patients and sixty healthy controls were recruited from the Shanghai Healthy Mental Center, China. Fecal samples were collected, and the compositional characteristics of the intestinal flora were determined in MDD patients by MiSeq sequencing. Venous blood was collected for the detection of plasma indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (Ido), kynurenine (Kyn) and tryptophan (Trp) levels. Stool samples of bacterial 16S sequencing was carried out. A total of 2,705,809 optimized sequences were obtained, with an average of 54,116 per sample. More unique OTUs were observed at the family, genus and species levels in the control group compared with the MDD cases. Further analysis showed significant changes in the Î±- and Î²-diversities and relative abundance levels of gut microbial entities in MDD patients, as well as elevated amounts of Ido and Kyn indicating Kyn pathway activation, KEGG bacterial 16S function prediction analysis shows a variety of amino acids and metabolic (including Ido, Trp and Kyn) changes in the body of patients with MDD. These may result in increased neurotoxic metabolites and reduced generation of serotonin in the disease process. These changed factors may potentially be utilized as biomarkers for MDD in the future, playing more important roles in the disease course.",Nutrients,2023,Ping Lin; Dan Li; Yun Shi; Qingtian Li; Xiaokui Guo; Ke Dong; Qing Chen; Xiaoyan Lou; Zhenhua Li; Ping Li; Weifeng Jin; Shuzi Chen; Yang Sun; Jing Sun; Xunjia Cheng

37485660,Flavonoids from Seabuckthorn (<i>Hippophae rhamnoides</i> L.) restore CUMS-induced depressive disorder and regulate the gut microbiota in mice.,"Seabuckthorn (<i>Hippophae rhamnoides</i> L.), which is enriched with flavonoids, including isorhamnetin, quercetin and kaempferol, is a representative example of ""medicine food homology"" targeting several diseases. Major depressive disorders seriously threaten mental health worldwide and may even lead to death. Chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depressive-like symptoms in mice are usually considered as the highest similarity to the situation in humans. Herein, we determined the potential functions of the flavonoid-enriched fraction from Seabuckthorn, which was named SBF, in treating major depressive disorder in mice. In the CUMS-induced mouse model, the intake of SBF reversed their depressive behaviors and relieved the CUMS-disturbed levels of neurotrophins, neurotransmitters, stress-related hormones, and inflammation-related cytokines. Additionally, the treatment of depressive mice with SBF showed ability to regulate the gut microbiota, especially in decreasing the abundance of <i>Lactobacillaceae</i>, while increasing the abundance of <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> at the family level. The results suggest the beneficial effects of Seabuckthorn flavonoids in functioning as a health food supplement to treat major depressive disorders.",Food & function,2023,Chen-Xi Xia; Alex Xiong Gao; Yue Zhu; Tina Ting-Xia Dong; Karl Wah-Keung Tsim
37127945,A systematic review on gut-brain axis aberrations in bipolar disorder and methods of balancing the gut microbiota.,"Bipolar disorder (BD) is a mood disorder that affects millions worldwide. Up to half of the diagnosed patients are reported to not receive adequate treatment. This study aims to assess the relationship between the gut-brain axis and BD and to discuss and compare the efficacy of varying methods of balancing gut microbiotas in BD.Using PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar from November 2021 to February 2022, we found 5310 studies on gut microbiota and its relation to BD. Using our inclusion criteria, 5283 studies were excluded. A total of 27 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. Also, 12 articles that met our criteria and eligibility criteria reported on 613 BD patients.Most studies analyzed found an overall difference in gut microbiota composition in bipolar patients compared to healthy controls, though the alterations found were not consistent. Differences in Lactobacillus, Faecalibacterium, and Ruminococcus abundance in BD compared to controls were found to be the most consistent across a few of the studies, but their effects on the gut-brain axis conflicted. Probiotic supplementation was found to lower patient rehospitalizations and significantly improve depressive symptoms and cognitive impairments among patients with BD.Multiple studies included in this review point toward a possible link between BD and the gut microbiota. Probiotic supplements and other gut-balancing therapies could serve as effective adjunctive methods for the treatment of BD. Notable limitations of the studies included for analysis were small sample sizes and majority observational study designs. Furthermore, the microbiota aberrations found in patients with BD were not consistent across multiple studies. Despite these limitations, our findings demonstrate the need for further research regarding the relationship between aberrant gut microbiota profiles and BD, as well as the effectiveness of gut balancing methods as adjunctive treatments.",Brain and behavior,2023,Crystal Obi-Azuike; Ruona Ebiai; Taneil Gibson; Ariana Hernandez; Asma Khan; Gibson Anugwom; Alexsandra Urhi; Sakshi Prasad; Sara Ait Souabni; Funso Oladunjoye

Polycystic ovarian syndrome is a heterogeneous disorder, both in the sense that many different factors may play a role in its manifestation and that multiple systems throughout the body can be affected. Polycystic ovarian syndrome has been linked to an increased prevalence of various psychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety. Despite the socioeconomic effect that these disorders may have on patients with PCOS and society as a whole, this association is largely lacking in research. There are currently several theories regarding the link between PCOS and mental health. Some suggest that the overactive hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axes in PCOS patients may alter the hormonal profile and contribute to the development of psychiatric disorders. Other studies speculate that abnormal levels of neurotransmitters and neuronal signaling may play a role. Recently, more research has begun to focus on the gut-brain axis, addressing the nutritional needs of PCOS patients. Studies show that dietary factors such as probiotics and micronutrient supplementation may significantly improve psychiatric symptoms in PCOS patients while helping regulate neurotransmitter levels in the body. In this review, we examine different theories regarding the association between PCOS and psychiatric disorders and point out different areas of research that are needed to broaden our understanding of this association.",F&S reports,2023,Karis I Sarkisian; Lananh Ho; Jane Yang; Rachel Mandelbaum; Frank Z Stanczyk

The intervention comprised 1.2 g/d of ginger (4 capsules per day totaling 84 mg/d of active gingerols/shogaols) for 14 d following a 1-wk run-in period. Primary outcomes were gastrointestinal community composition, alpha and beta diversity, and differential abundance, measured using 16S rRNA gene sequencing of fecal samples. Secondary outcomes were gastrointestinal symptoms, bowel function, depression, anxiety, stress, fatigue, quality of life, and adverse events.Fifty-one participants were enrolled and analyzed (71% female; mean age 25 Â± 3 y; ginger: n = 29, placebo: n = 22). There was a greater increase in relative abundance of phylum, Actinobacteria, observed following ginger supplementation compared to placebo (U: 145.0; z: -2.1; P = 0.033). Ginger was associated with a greater abundance of the genera Parabacteroides, Bacillus, Ruminococcaceae incertae sedis, unclassified Bacilli, families Defluviitaleaceae, Morganellaceae, and Bacillaceae as well as lower abundance of the genus Blautia and family Sphingomonadaceae (P < 0.05). An improvement in indigestion symptoms was observed with ginger supplementation (U: 196.0; z: -2.4; P = 0.015). No differences between ginger and placebo groups were found for alpha and beta diversity or other secondary outcomes. No moderate or severe adverse events were reported.Supplementation with ginger root powder was safe and altered aspects of gastrointestinal bacteria composition; however, it did not change alpha- or beta diversity, bowel function, gastrointestinal symptoms, mood, or quality of life in healthy adults. These results provide further understanding regarding the mechanisms of action of ginger supplementation.

38026003,The importance of the intestinal microbiota in humans and dogs in the neonatal period.,"The neonatal period represents a critical stage for the establishment and development of the gut microbiota, which profoundly influences the future health trajectory of individuals. This review examines the importance of intestinal microbiota in humans and dogs, aiming to elucidate the distinct characteristics and variations in the composition between these two species. In humans, the intestinal microbiota contributes to several crucial physiological processes, including digestion, nutrient absorption, immune system development, and modulation of host metabolism. Dysbiosis, an imbalance or disruption of the gut microbial community, has been linked to various disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, and even neurological conditions. Furthermore, recent research has unveiled the profound influence of the gut-brain axis, emphasizing the bidirectional communication between the gut microbiota and the central nervous system, impacting cognitive function and mental health. Similarly, alterations in the canine intestinal microbiota have been associated with gastrointestinal disorders, including chronic enteropathy, such as inflammatory bowel disease, food allergies, and ulcerative histiocytic colitis. However, our understanding of the intricacies and functional significance of the intestinal microbiota in dogs remains limited. Understanding the complex dynamics of the intestinal microbiota in both humans and dogs is crucial for devising effective strategies to promote health and manage disease. Moreover, exploring the similarities and differences in the gut microbial composition between these two species can facilitate translational research, potentially leading to innovative therapeutic interventions and strategies to enhance the well-being of both humans and dogs.",Animal reproduction,2023,Samara Beretta; Maricy Apparicio; Gilson HÃ©lio Toniollo; Marita Vedovelli Cardozo
37630649,Microbiota in Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Endometriosis: Birds of a Feather Flock Together-A Review.,"Endometriosis and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are chronic conditions affecting up to 10% of the global population, imposing significant burdens on healthcare systems and patient quality of life. Interestingly, around 20% of endometriosis patients also present with symptoms indicative of IBS. The pathogenesis of both these multifactorial conditions remains to be fully elucidated, but connections to gut microbiota are becoming more apparent. Emerging research underscores significant differences in the gut microbiota composition between healthy individuals and those suffering from either endometriosis or IBS. Intestinal dysbiosis appears pivotal in both conditions, exerting an influence via similar mechanisms. It impacts intestinal permeability, triggers inflammatory reactions, and initiates immune responses. Furthermore, it is entwined in a bidirectional relationship with the brain, as part of the gut-brain axis, whereby dysbiosis influences and is influenced by mental health and pain perception. Recent years have witnessed the development of microbiota-focused therapies, such as low FODMAP diets, prebiotics, probiotics, antibiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation, designed to tackle dysbiosis and relieve symptoms. While promising, these treatments present inconsistent data, highlighting the need for further research. This review explores the evidence of gut dysbiosis in IBS and endometriosis, underscoring the similar role of microbiota in both conditions.

37414494,Neuroinflammation through the vagus nerve-dependent gut-microbiota-brain axis in treatment-resistant depression.,"Neuroinflammation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder (MDD), including treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Patients with TRD have higher levels of inflammatory biomarkers compared with responders to antidepressants. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the gut-microbiota-brain axis via the vagus nerve plays a key role in neuroinflammation. Preclinical and clinical data suggest that fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from MDD patients or rodents with depression-like behaviors cause depression-like behaviors in rodents through systemic inflammation. Importantly, subdiaphragmatic vagotomy blocked these depression-like phenotypes and systemic inflammation in rodents after FMT of depression-related microbes. Subdiaphragmatic vagotomy also blocked the antidepressant-like effects of serotonergic antidepressants in rodents. Preclinical findings suggest that the new antidepressant, (R)-ketamine (or arketamine), may restore the altered composition of gut microbiota in rodents with depression-like behaviors, contributing to the beneficial effects of arketamine. In this chapter, the author reviews the role of the vagus nerve-dependent gut-microbiota-brain axis in depression (including TRD), and also discuss the potential of FMT, vagus nerve stimulation, and arketamine for the treatment of TRD.",Progress in brain research,2023,Kenji Hashimoto

Primary tumor locations found to impact prognosis and response to therapy. The important role of gut microbiota in the progression and treatment of CRC has led to many attempts of alleviating chemotherapy-induced adverse effects using microecologics. However, the underlying mechanism of the difference in the prognosis of different primary tumor locations and the synergistic effect of prebiotics on chemotherapy need to be further elucidated. This study aims to explore the differences in tumor microbiota and examine the effectiveness of xylooligosaccharides (XOS) on gut microbiota, adverse effects, and bioavailability of chemotherapy drugs in CRC patients at different primary tumor locations.This is a double-blinded, randomized, parallel controlled clinical trial. Participants with left-sided CRC (LSCRC, n = 50) and right-sided CC (RSCC, n = 50) will randomly allocated to prebiotic group (n = 25) or control group (n = 25) and will receive either a daily XOS (3 g/day) or placebo, respectively, for 12 weeks. The primary outcomes will be the differences in the mucosa microbiota composition at different tumor locations and differences in gut microbiota composition, adverse effects, and blood concentration of capecitabine posttreatment. The secondary outcomes will include other blood indicators, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) concentration, quality of life, and mental health.This study will reveal the potential benefits of prebiotic for improving the gut microbiota composition, alleviating the adverse effects, and improving the efficacy of chemotherapy in patients with CRC. In addition, this study will provide data on the different distribution of tumor microbiota and the different changes of gut microbiota during treatment in LSCRC and RSCC, which may provide novel insights into personalized cancer treatment strategies based on primary tumor locations and gut microbiota in the future.Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ( www.chictr.org.cn ): ChiCTR2100046237.

37396336,Sex-specific effects of voluntary wheel running on behavior and the gut microbiota-immune-brain axis in mice.,"Physical exercise has been positioned as a promising strategy to prevent and/or alleviate anxiety and depression, but the biological processes associated with its effects on mental health have yet to be entirely determined. Although the prevalence of depression and anxiety in women is about twice that of men, very few studies have examined whether physical exercise could affect mental health differently according to sex. This study examined, in singly-housed mice, the sex-specific effects of voluntary exercise on depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors as well as on different markers along the gut microbiota-immune-brain axis. Male and female C57BL/6N mice had voluntary access to running wheels in their home-cages for 24 days or were left undisturbed in identical home-cages without running wheels. Behaviors were then examined in the open field, splash, elevated plus maze, and tail suspension tests. Gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, microglia activation-related genes, and tight junction proteins was determined in the jejunum and the hippocampus, while microbiota composition and predicted function were verified in cecum contents. Voluntary exercise reduced anxiety-like behaviors and altered grooming patterns in males exclusively. Although the exercise intervention resulted in changes to brain inflammatory activity and to cecal microbiota composition and inferred function in both sexes, reductions in the jejunal expression of pro-inflammatory markers were observed in females only. These findings support the view that voluntary exercise, even when performed during a short period, is beneficial for mental and intestinal health and that its sex-specific effects on behavior could be, at least in part, related to some components of the gut microbiota-immune-brain axis.","Brain, behavior, & immunity - health",2023,ZoÃ« A P Williams; Joanna Kasia Szyszkowicz; Natasha Osborne; Bshaier Allehyany; Christophe Nadon; Maryann Chinonye Udechukwu; Ana Santos; Marie-Claude Audet
36943505,Ketogenic diet for mood disorders from animal models to clinical application.,"Mood disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD) are often resistant to current pharmacological treatment. Therefore, various alternative therapeutic approaches including diets are, therefore, under investigation. Ketogenic diet (KD) is effective for treatment-resistant epilepsy and metabolic diseases, however, only a few clinical studies suggest its beneficial effect also for mental disorders. Animal models are a useful tool to uncover the underlying mechanisms of therapeutic effects. Women have a twice-higher prevalence of mood disorders but very little is known about sex differences in nutritional psychiatry. In this review, we aim to summarize current knowledge of the sex-specific effects of KD in mood disorders. Ketone bodies improve mitochondrial functions and suppress oxidative stress, inducing neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects which are both beneficial for mental health. Limited data also suggest KD-induced improvement of monoaminergic circuits and hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis-the key pathophysiological pathways of mood disorders. Gut microbiome is an important mediator of the beneficial and detrimental effects of diet on brain functioning and mental health. Gut microbiota composition is affected in mood disorders but its role in the therapeutic effects of different diets, including KD, remains poorly understood. Still little is known about sex differences in the effects of KD on mental health as well as on metabolism and body weight. Some animal studies used both sexes but did not find differences in behavior, body weight loss or gut microbiota composition. More studies, both on a preclinical and clinical level, are needed to better understand sex-specific effects of KD on mental health.","Journal of neural transmission (Vienna, Austria : 1996)",2023,Ilya V Smolensky; Kilian Zajac-Bakri; Peter Gass; Dragos Inta
37088645,Understanding the impact of radical changes in diet and the gut microbiota on brain function and structure: rationale and design of the EMBRACE study.,"Bariatric surgery leads to profound changes in gut microbiota and dietary patterns, both of which may interact to impact gut-brain communication. Though cognitive function improves postsurgery, there is a large variability in outcomes. How bariatric surgery-induced modifications in the gut microbiota and dietary patterns influence the variability in cognitive function is still unclear.To elucidate the associations between bariatric surgery-induced changes in dietary and gut microbiota patterns with cognition and brain structure.University hospital.A total of 120 adult patients (â¥30 years) scheduled to undergo a primary bariatric surgery along with 60 age-, sex-, and body mass index-matched patients on the surgery waitlist will undergo assessments 3-months presurgery and 6- and 12-month postsurgery (or an equivalent time for the waitlist group). Additionally, 60 age-and sex-matched nonbariatric surgery eligible individuals will complete the presurgical assessments only. Evaluations will include sociodemographic and health behavior questionnaires, physiological assessments (anthropometrics, blood-, urine-, and fecal-based measures), neuropsychological cognitive tests, and structural magnetic resonance imaging. Cluster analyses of the dietary and gut microbiota changes will define the various dietary patterns and microbiota profiles, then using repeated measures mixed models, their associations with global cognitive and structural brain alterations will be explored.The coordinating study site (Centre intÃ©grÃ© universitaire de santÃ© et de services sociaux du Nord-de-l'Ãle-de-MontrÃ©al, QC, Canada), provided the primary ethical approval (Research Ethics Board#: MP-32-2022-2412).The insights generated from this study can be used to develop individually-targeted neurodegenerative disease prevention strategies, as well as providing critical mechanistic information.",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,2023,Tair Ben-Porat; Angela Alberga; Marie-Claude Audet; Sylvie Belleville; Tamara R Cohen; Pierre Y Garneau; Kim L Lavoie; Patrick Marion; Samira Mellah; Radu Pescarus; Elham Rahme; Sylvia Santosa; Anne-Sophie Studer; Dajana Vuckovic; Robbie Woods; Reyhaneh Yousefi; Simon L Bacon; 
38260072,Alterations in gut microbiota caused by major depressive disorder or a low FODMAP diet and where they overlap.,"Beneficial changes in microbiota observed in individuals with a major depressive disorder (MDD) may be initiated with a low fermentable oligosaccharide, disaccharide, monosaccharide, and polyol (FODMAP) elimination diet. Academic Search Ultimate, APA PsychINFO, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Scopus and Web of Science were searched for original research documenting differences in microbiota in MDD or changes with a low FODMAP diet in adults (age 18âyears +). Studies with fecal microbiota, 16âs RNA sequencing and QIIME pipelines were included. Studies using antibiotics, probiotics, and medications such as antidepressants were excluded. Additionally, studies based on a single gender were excluded as gender impacts microbiota changes in MDD. Four studies addressed differences in microbiota with MDD and another four assessed shifts occurring with a low FODMAP diet. The abundance of <i>Bacteroidetes</i>, <i>Bacteroidaceae</i> and <i>Bacteroides</i> were lower in individuals with MDD but increased with a low FODMAP diet. Abundance of <i>Ruminoccaceae</i> was lower and <i>Bilophila</i> was higher with both a low FODMAP diet and MDD. These results provide preliminary evidence that a low FODMAP diet might drive changes in microbiota that also benefit people with MDD. Further research to assess whether a low FODMAP diet can treat MDD through modification of targeted microbiota is warranted.",Frontiers in nutrition,2023,Simone O'Neill; Michelle Minehan; Catherine R Knight-Agarwal; David B Pyne
37498481,The Role of Gut Microbiota in Blood-Brain Barrier Disruption after Stroke.,"Growing evidence has proved that alterations in the gut microbiota have been linked to neurological disorders including stroke. Structural and functional disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is observed after stroke. In this context, there is pioneering evidence supporting that gut microbiota may be involved in the pathogenesis of stroke by regulating the BBB function. However, only a few experimental studies have been performed on stroke models to observe the BBB by altering the structure of gut microbiota, which warrant further exploration. Therefore, in order to provide a novel mechanism for stroke and highlight new insights into BBB modification as a stroke intervention, this review summarizes existing evidence of the relationship between gut microbiota and BBB integrity and discusses the mechanisms of gut microbiota on BBB dysfunction and its role in stroke.",Molecular neurobiology,2023,Meiqin Zeng; Meichang Peng; Jianhao Liang; Haitao Sun
37978477,Intricate role of intestinal microbe and metabolite in schizophrenia.,"The brain-gut axis has gained increasing attention due to its contribution to the etiology of various central nervous system disorders. This study aims to elucidate the hypothesis that schizophrenia is associated with disturbances in intestinal microflora and imbalance in intestinal metabolites. By exploring the intricate relationship between the gut and the brain, with the goal of offering fresh perspectives and valuable insights into the potential contribution of intestinal microbial and metabolites dysbiosis to the etiology of schizophrenia.In this study, we used a 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene sequence-based approach and an untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolic profiling approach to measure the gut microbiome and microbial metabolites from 44 healthy controls, 41 acute patients, and 39 remission patients, to evaluate whether microbial dysbiosis and microbial metabolite biomarkers were linked with the severity of schizophrenic symptoms.Here, we identified 20 dominant disturbances in the gut microbial composition of patients compared with healthy controls, with 3 orders, 4 families, 9 genera, and 4 species. Several unique bacterial taxa associated with schizophrenia severity. Compared with healthy controls, 145 unusual microflora metabolites were detected in the acute and remission groups, which were mainly involved in environmental information processing, metabolism, organismal systems, and human diseases in the Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway. The Sankey diagram showed that 4 abnormal intestinal and 4 anomalous intestinal microbial metabolites were associated with psychiatric clinical symptoms.These findings suggest a possible interactive influence of the gut microbiota and their metabolites on the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.",BMC psychiatry,2023,Li Shi; Peijun Ju; Xiaojing Meng; Zhongxian Wang; Lihui Yao; Mingming Zheng; Xialong Cheng; Jingwei Li; Tao Yu; Qingrong Xia; Junwei Yan; Cuizhen Zhu; Xulai Zhang

Long-term methods such as exercise and low-fat diets can help regulate this health issue, but 93.3 million Americans continue to struggle. Our research investigates if lifestyle changes can affect urinary inflammation markers and psychological aspects through the modification of gut microbiome composition. <b>Methods:</b> Our study included 16 healthy controls with normal BMI as a comparison group and 22 overweight/obese (OW/OB) adolescents. We collected demographic, clinical, psychological, stool, and urine sample data at enrollment and six months after implementing lifestyle modifications. Bacterial genomic data and inflammatory markers in these samples were analyzed. <b>Results:</b> The lifestyle interventions were associated with decreased inflammation and enhanced mental health among overweight teens. We observed differences in bacterial community compositions between healthy participants and those who underwent treatment, including exercise and dietary habit adjustments, although there was no significant change in bacterial species richness. Mental health correlated with gut microbiota compositions without any demographic influences. The research also uncovered connections between inflammatory markers, psychological factors, and gut microbiota phyla through carbohydrate metabolism alterations. <b>Conclusion</b>: Our findings demonstrate that lifestyle modifications are associated with improved mental health and a reduction in inflammation in overweight adolescents by adjusting the gut microbiota composition.",Nutrients,2023,Md Saimul Islam; Shyanne Page-Hefley; Anne P Hernandez; Luke Whelchel; Chiquito Crasto; Whitney Viator; Treyce Money; Babafela Awosile; Noel Howard; Tetyana L Vasylyeva
37995075,Microbiota Alters and Its Correlation with Molecular Regulation Underlying Depression in PCOS Patients.,"Depression is one of the complications in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) that leads to considerable mental health. Accumulating evidence suggests that human gut microbiomes are associated with the progression of PCOS and depression. However, whether microbiota influences depression development in PCOS patients is still uncharacterized. In this study, we employed metagenomic sequencing and transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) to profile the composition of the fecal microbiota and gene expression of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in depressed women with PCOS (PCOS-DP, nâ=â27) in comparison to mentally healthy women with PCOS (PCOS, nâ=â18) and compared with healthy control (HC, nâ=â27) and patients with major depressive disorder (MDD, nâ=â29). Gut microbiota assessment revealed distinct patterns in the relative abundance in the PCOS-DP compared to HC, MDD, and PCOS groups. Several gut microbes exhibited uniquely and significantly higher abundance in the PCOS-DP compared to PCOS patients, inducing EC Ruminococcus torques, Coprococcus comes, Megasphaera elsdenii, Acidaminococcus intestini, and Barnesiella viscericola. Bacteroides eggerthii was a potential gut microbial biomarker for the PCOS-DP. RNA-seq profiling identified that 35 and 37 genes were significantly elevated and downregulated in the PCOS-DP, respectively. The enhanced differential expressed genes (DEGs) in the PCOS-DP were enriched in pathways involved in signal transduction and endocrine and metabolic diseases, whereas several lipid metabolism pathways were downregulated. Intriguingly, genes correlated with the gut microbiota were found to be significantly enriched in pathways of neurodegenerative diseases and the immune system, suggesting that changes in the microbiota may have a systemic impact on the expression of neurodegenerative diseases and immune genes. Gut microbe-related DEGs of CREB3L3 and CCDC173 were possible molecular biomarkers and therapeutic targets of women with PCOS-DP. Our multi-omics data indicate shifts in the gut microbiome and host gene regulation in PCOS patients with depression, which is of possible etiological and diagnostic importance.",Molecular neurobiology,2023,Liying Yu; Xiaoyu Chen; Xuefeng Bai; Jingping Fang; Ming Sui
36969812,"Demonstrating a link between diet, gut microbiota and brain: <sup>14</sup>C radioactivity identified in the brain following gut microbial fermentation of <sup>14</sup>C-radiolabeled tyrosine in a pig model.","There is a need to better understand the relationship between the diet, the gut microbiota and mental health. Metabolites produced when the human gut microbiota metabolize amino acids may enter the bloodstream and have systemic effects. We hypothesize that fermentation of amino acids by a resistant protein-primed gut microbiota could yield potentially toxic metabolites and disturb the availability of neurotransmitter precursors to the brain. However, these mechanisms are challenging to investigate <i>via</i> typical <i>in vitro</i> and clinical methods.We developed a novel workflow using <sup>14</sup>C radiolabeling to investigate complex nutrient-disease relationships. The first three steps of the workflow are reported here. Î±-Linolenic acid (ALA) was used as a model nutrient to confirm the efficacy of the workflow, and tyrosine (Tyr) was the test nutrient. <sup>14</sup>C-Tyr was administered to male weanling pigs fed a high resistant protein diet, which primed the gut microbiota for fermenting protein. The hypotheses were; (1) that expected biodistribution of <sup>14</sup>C-ALA would be observed, and (2) that radioactivity from <sup>14</sup>C-Tyr, representing Tyr and other amino acids released from resistant protein following gut microbial fermentation, would be bioavailable to the brain.Radioactivity from the <sup>14</sup>C-ALA was detected in tissues reflecting normal utilization of this essential fatty acid. Radioactivity from the <sup>14</sup>C-Tyr was detected in the brain (0.15% of original dose).Metabolites of gut-fermented protein and specifically amino acid precursors to neurotransmitters such as tyrosine, are potentially able to affect brain function. By extension, resistant proteins in the diet reaching the gut microbiota, also have potential to release metabolites that can potentially affect brain function. The high specificity of detection of <sup>14</sup>C radioactivity demonstrates that the proposed workflow can similarly be applied to understand other key diet and health paradigms.",Frontiers in nutrition,2023,Margaret Murray; Christopher K Barlow; Scott Blundell; Mark Buecking; Anne Gibbon; Bernd Goeckener; Lisa M Kaminskas; Patricia Leitner; Sophie Selby-Pham; Andrew Sinclair; Habtewold D Waktola; Gary Williamson; Louise E Bennett
37511699,Pharmacomicrobiomics of Antidepressants in Depression: A Systematic Review.,"This systematic review evaluated the animal and human evidence for pharmacomicrobiomics (PMx) interactions of antidepressant medications. Studies of gut microbiota effects on functional and behavioral effects of antidepressants in human and animal models were identified from PubMed up to December 2022. Risk of bias was assessed, and results are presented as a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines. A total of 28 (21 animal, 7 human) studies were included in the review. The reviewed papers converged on three themes: (1) Antidepressants can alter the composition and metabolites of gut microbiota, (2) gut microbiota can alter the bioavailability of certain antidepressants, and (3) gut microbiota may modulate the clinical or modeled mood modifying effects of antidepressants. The majority (n = 22) of studies had at least moderate levels of bias present. While strong evidence is still lacking to understand the clinical role of antidepressant PMx in human health, there is evidence for interactions among antidepressants, microbiota changes, microbiota metabolite changes, and behavior. Well-controlled studies of the mediating and moderating effects of baseline and treatment-emergent changes in microbiota on therapeutic and adverse responses to antidepressants are needed to better establish a potential role of PMx in personalizing antidepressant treatment selection and response prediction.",Journal of personalized medicine,2023,Lisa C Brown; William V Bobo; Cory A Gall; Daniel J MÃ¼ller; Chad A Bousman

To effectively treat these conditions, a comprehensive understanding of all etiological factors is needed. This study investigated fecal microbial features associated with mental health outcomes (symptoms of anxiety, depression, or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)) in a Spanish cohort in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. Microbial communities from stool samples were profiled in 198 individuals who completed validated, self-report questionnaires. 16S ribosomal RNA gene V3-4 amplicon sequencing was performed. Microbial diversity and community structure were analyzed, together with relative taxonomic abundance. In our cohort of N=198, 17.17% reported depressive symptoms, 37.37% state anxiety symptoms, 40.90% trait anxiety symptoms, and 8.08% PTSD symptoms, with high levels of comorbidity. Individuals with trait anxiety had lower Simpson's diversity. <i>Fusicatenibacter saccharivorans</i> was reduced in individuals with comorbid PTSD + depression + state and trait anxiety symptoms, whilst an expansion of Proteobacteria and depletion of Synergistetes phyla were noted in individuals with depressive symptoms. The relative abundance of <i>Anaerostipes</i> was positively correlated with childhood trauma, and higher levels of <i>Turicibacter sanguinis</i> and lower levels of Lentisphaerae were found in individuals who experienced life-threatening traumas. COVID-19 infection and vaccination influenced the overall microbial composition and were associated with distinct relative taxonomic abundance profiles. These findings will help lay the foundation for future studies to identify microbial role players in symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD and provide future therapeutic targets to improve mental health outcomes.",Gut microbes,2023,Stefanie Malan-MÃ¼ller; Mireia Valles-Colomer; TomÃ¡s Palomo; Juan C Leza

37804926,Possible role of tryptophan metabolism along the microbiota-gut-brain axis on cognitive & behavioral aspects in Phenylketonuria.,"Cognitive and psychiatricÂ disorders are well documented across the lifetime of patients with inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs). Gut microbiota impacts behavior and cognitive functions through the gut-brain axis (GBA). According to recent research, a broad spectrum of GBA disorders may be influenced by a perturbed Tryptophan (Trp) metabolism and are associated with alterations in composition or function of the gut microbiota. Furthermore, early-life diets may influence children's neurodevelopment and cognitive deficits in adulthood. In Phenylketonuria (PKU), since the main therapeutic intervention is based on a life-long restrictive diet, important alterations of gut microbiota have been observed. Studies on PKU highlight the impact of alterations of gut microbiota on the central nervous system (CNS), also investigating the involvement of metabolic pathways, such as Trp and kynurenine (KYN) metabolisms, involved in numerous neurodegenerative disorders. An alteration of Trp metabolism with an imbalance of the KYN pathway towards the production of neurotoxic metabolites implicated in numerous neurodegenerative and inflammatory diseases has been observed in PKU patients supplemented with Phe-free amino acid medical foods (AA-MF). The present review investigates the possible link between gut microbiota and the brain in IEMs, focusing on Trp metabolism in PKU. Considering the evidence collected, cognitive and behavioral well-being should always be monitored in routine IEMs clinical management. Further studies are required to evaluate the possible impact of Trp metabolism, through gut microbiota, on cognitive and behavioral functions in IEMs, to identify innovative dietetic strategies and improve quality of life and mental health of these patients.",Pharmacological research,2023,Sara Parolisi; Chiara Montanari; Elisa Borghi; Chiara Cazzorla; Juri Zuvadelli; Martina Tosi; Rita Barone; Giulia Bensi; Cristina Bonfanti; Carlo Dionisi Vici; Giacomo Biasucci; Alberto Burlina; Maria T Carbone; Elvira Verduci;

However, available data directly linking GM to HTN based on sex differences are limited.This study investigated the GM characteristics in HTN subjects in Northwestern China, and evaluate the associations of GM with blood pressure levels based on sex differences. A total of 87 HTN subjects and 45 controls were recruited with demographic and clinical characteristics documented. Fecal samples were collected for 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metagenomic sequencing.GM diversity was observed higher in females compared to males, and principal coordinate analysis showed an obvious segregation of females and males. Four predominant phyla of fecal GM included Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. LEfSe analysis indicated that phylum unidentified_Bacteria was enriched in HTN females, while Leuconostocaceae, Weissella and Weissella_cibaria were enriched in control females (Pâ<â0.05). Functionally, ROC analysis revealed that Cellular Processes (0.796, 95% CI 0.620â~â0.916), Human Diseases (0.773, 95% CI 0.595â~â0.900), Signal transduction (0.806, 95% CI 0.631â~â0.922) and Two-component system (0.806, 95% CI 0.631â~â0.922) could differentiate HTN females as effective functional classifiers, which were also positively correlated with systolic blood pressure levels.This work provides evidence of fecal GM characteristics in HTN females and males in a northwestern Chinese population, further supporting the notion that GM dysbiosis may participate in the pathogenesis of HTN, and the role of sex differences should be considered.

37881577,Repeated Social Defeat Stress Induces an Inflammatory Gut Milieu by Altering the Mucosal Barrier Integrity and Gut Microbiota Homeostasis.,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition triggered by exposure to traumatic events in an individual's life. Patients with PTSD are also at a higher risk for comorbidities. However, it is not well understood how PTSD affects human health and/or promotes the risk for comorbidities. Nevertheless, patients with PTSD harbor a proinflammatory milieu and dysbiotic gut microbiota. Gut barrier integrity helps to maintain normal gut homeostasis and its dysregulation promotes gut dysbiosis and inflammation.We used a mouse model of repeated social defeat stress (RSDS), a preclinical model of PTSD. Behavioral studies, metagenomics analysis of the microbiome, gut permeability assay (on mouse colon, using an Ussing chamber), immunoblotting, and immunohistochemical analyses were performed. Polarized intestinal epithelial cells and 3-dimensional crypt cultures were used for mechanistic analysis.The RSDS mice harbor a heightened proinflammatory gut environment and microbiota dysbiosis. The RSDS mice further showed significant dysregulation of gut barrier functions, including transepithelial electrical resistance, mucin homeostasis, and antimicrobial responses. RSDS mice also showed a specific increase in intestinal expression of claudin-2, a tight junction protein, and epinephrine, a stress-induced neurotransmitter. Treating intestinal epithelial cells or 3-dimensional cultured crypts with norepinephrine or intestinal luminal contents (fecal contents) upregulated claudin-2 expression and inhibited transepithelial electrical resistance.Traumatic stress induces dysregulation of gut barrier functions, which may underlie the observed gut microbiota changes and proinflammatory gut milieu, all of which may have an interdependent effect on the health and increased risk of comorbidities in patients with PTSD.",Biological psychiatry global open science,2023,Santosh K Yadav; Rizwan Ahmad; Cassandra M Moshfegh; Jagadesan Sankarasubramanian; Vineet Joshi; Safwan K Elkhatib; Yashpal Singh Chhonker; Daryl J Murry; Geoffrey A Talmon; Chittibabu Guda; Adam J Case; Amar B Singh
37371676,Using the Microbiome as a Regenerative Medicine Strategy for Autoimmune Diseases.,"Autoimmune (AI) diseases, which present in a multitude of systemic manifestations, have been connected to many underlying factors. These factors include the environment, genetics, individual microbiomes, and diet. An individual's gut microbiota is an integral aspect of human functioning, as it is intimately integrated into the metabolic, mechanical, immunological, and neurologic pathways of the body. The microbiota dynamically changes throughout our lifetimes and is individually unique. While the gut microbiome is ever-adaptive, gut dysbiosis can exert a significant influence on physical and mental health. Gut dysbiosis is a common factor in various AI, and diets with elevated fat and sugar content have been linked to gut microbiome alterations, contributing to increased systemic inflammation. Additionally, multiple AI's have increased levels of certain inflammatory markers such as TNF-a, IL-6, and IL-17 that have been shown to contribute to arthropathy and are also linked to increased levels of gut dysbiosis. While chronic inflammation has been shown to affect many physiologic systems, this review explores the connection between gut microbiota, bone metabolism, and the skeletal and joint destruction associated with various AI, including psoriatic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, irritable bowel disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. This review aims to define the mechanisms of microbiome crosstalk between the cells of bone and cartilage, as well as to investigate the potential bidirectional connections between AI, bony and cartilaginous tissue, and the gut microbiome. By doing this, the review also introduces the concept of altering an individual's specific gut microbiota as a form of regenerative medicine and potential tailored therapy for joint destruction seen in AI. We hope to show multiple, specific ways to target the microbiome through diet changes, rebalancing microbial diversity, or decreasing specific microbes associated with increased gut permeability, leading to reduced systemic inflammation contributing to joint pathology. Additionally, we plan to show that diet alterations can promote beneficial changes in the gut microbiota, supporting the body's own endogenous processes to decrease inflammation and increase healing. This concept of microbial alteration falls under the definition of regenerative medicine and should be included accordingly. By implementing microbial alterations in regenerative medicine, this current study could lend increasing support to the current research on the associations of the gut microbiota, bone metabolism, and AI-related musculoskeletal pathology.",Biomedicines,2023,Kaitlin L Williams; Ryan Enslow; Shreyas Suresh; Camille Beaton; Mitchell Hodge; Amanda E Brooks

Growing studies suggest that resident gut microbiota contributes to the development and progression of AD. Meanwhile, acupuncture is reported to treat gastrointestinal and neurodegenerative disorders <i>via</i> the gut-brain axis. Therefore, our aim is to confirm the adjunctive therapeutic effects of acupuncture for AD, and explore the relationship between clinical efficacy and shifts of gut microbiota.This is a randomized, participant-masked, sham-controlled trial. One hundred and sixty participants with mild AD will be randomly assigned (1:1) to either active acupuncture or non-penetrating sham acupuncture (three times weekly for 14âweeks) added to donepezil treatment (5âmg per day for 28âweeks). The primary efficacy outcome is the change from baseline to week 28 in the Alzheimer's disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog12). Secondary efficacy outcomes include other assessments of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Alzheimer's disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL), and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Gut microbiota will be measured using 16S rRNA tag sequencing.This rigorous trial will provide high-quality evidence on the efficacy of acupuncture as adjunctive treatment for mild AD, and identify the possible mechanisms of acupuncture from gut microbiota.[https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05078944], ClinicalTrials.gov [NCT05078944].

37709081,Maternal exposure of mice to glyphosate induces depression- and anxiety-like behavior in the offspring via alterations of the gut-brain axis.,"The past decade has been characterized by increased awareness and de-stigmatization of mental health issues, in particular the most common neuropsychiatric disorders depression and anxiety. Further, with growing understanding of neurodevelopmental disorders such as attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder, the number of diagnosed patients has increased. The pathogenesis of these behavioral disorders is multifactorial and early-life exposure to environmental chemicals has been proposed to be a relevant risk factor that might mediate these effects by disturbances on the gut-brain-axis. However, for glyphosate, the most widely used pesticide worldwide, there are only limited and inconsistent findings that link chronic low-dose exposure in particular during early life to neurobehavioral disorders. Here, we explored the impact of maternal oral glyphosate exposure (0.5 and 50Â mg/kg body weight/day) during pregnancy and the lactational period on offspring's behavior, brain gene expression and gut microbiota using a cross-generational mouse model. Behavioral analyses revealed a depression- and anxiety-like behavior as well as social deficits most notably in adult female offspring of glyphosate-exposed dams. Furthermore, the expression of tryptophan hydroxylase 2, an enzyme discussed to be linked to behavioral problems, was reduced in the hippocampus of female offspring and correlated to a glyphosate-induced DNA hypermethylation of the gene. Moreover, maternal glyphosate exposure significantly altered the gut microbiota in the female offspring including a decreased abundance of Akkermansia and increased abundance of Alistipes and Blautia, bacteria involved in tryptophan metabolism and associated with depression- and anxiety-like disorders. Our results suggest that glyphosate might influence the gut-brain axis crosstalk following in-utero and lactational exposure. This study underlines the importance of understanding the impact of exposure to pesticides on the gut-brain axis and further emphasizes the need for microbiome analyses to be compulsorily included in health risk assessments of pesticides.",The Science of the total environment,2023,Lisa Buchenauer; Sven-Bastiaan Haange; Mario Bauer; Ulrike E Rolle-Kampczyk; Marita Wagner; Johanna Stucke; Elena Elter; Beate Fink; Maren Vass; Martin von Bergen; Angela Schulz; Ana C Zenclussen; Kristin M Junge; Gabriele I Stangl; Tobias Polte

37836654,Protective Application of Chinese Herbal Compounds and Formulae in Intestinal Inflammation in Humans and Animals.,"Intestinal inflammation is a chronic gastrointestinal disorder with uncertain pathophysiology and causation that has significantly impacted both the physical and mental health of both people and animals. An increasing body of research has demonstrated the critical role of cellular signaling pathways in initiating and managing intestinal inflammation. This review focuses on the interactions of three cellular signaling pathways (TLR4/NF-ÎºB, PI3K-AKT, MAPKs) with immunity and gut microbiota to explain the possible pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation. Traditional medicinal drugs frequently have drawbacks and negative side effects. This paper also summarizes the pharmacological mechanism and application of Chinese herbal compounds (Berberine, Sanguinarine, Astragalus polysaccharide, Curcumin, and Cannabinoids) and formulae (Wumei Wan, Gegen-Qinlian decoction, Banxia xiexin decoction) against intestinal inflammation. We show that the herbal compounds and formulae may influence the interactions among cell signaling pathways, immune function, and gut microbiota in humans and animals, exerting their immunomodulatory capacity and anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects. This demonstrates their strong potential to improve gut inflammation. We aim to promote herbal medicine and apply it to multispecies animals to achieve better health.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,Yang Yang; Gang Xiao; Pi Cheng; Jianguo Zeng; Yisong Liu

However, the specific mechanisms that link gut microbiota to PD remain unexplored. Given the critical roles of blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction and mitochondrial dysfunction in the development of PD, we aimed to evaluate the interactions among the gut microbiota, BBB, and mitochondrial resistance to oxidation and inflammation in PD. We investigated the effects of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) on the physiopathology of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated mice. The aim was to explore the role of fecal microbiota from PD patients and healthy human controls in neuroinflammation, BBB components, and mitochondrial antioxidative capacity via the AMPK/SOD2 pathway. Compared to control mice, MPTP-treated mice exhibited elevated levels of Desulfovibrio, whereas mice given FMT from PD patients exhibited enriched levels of Akkermansia and mice given FMT from healthy humans showed no significant alterations in gut microbiota. Strikingly, FMT from PD patients to MPTP-treated mice significantly aggravated motor impairments, dopaminergic neurodegeneration, nigrostriatal glial activation and colonic inflammation, and inhibited the AMPK/SOD2 signaling pathway. However, FMT from healthy human controls greatly improved the aforementioned MPTP-caused effects. Surprisingly, the MPTP-treated mice displayed a significant loss in nigrostriatal pericytes, which was restored by FMT from healthy human controls. Our findings demonstrate that FMT from healthy human controls can correct gut dysbacteriosis and ameliorate neurodegeneration in the MPTP-induced PD mouse model by suppressing microgliosis and astrogliosis, ameliorating mitochondrial impairments via the AMPK/SOD2 pathway, and restoring the loss of nigrostriatal pericytes and BBB integrity.

37218177,Impact of probiotic on anxiety and depression symptoms in pregnant and lactating women and microbiota of infants: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Probiotics are non-invasive therapies composed of live bacteria and yeast. Administration of prebiotics improved the health status of pregnant and lactating women, as well as newborns. This review aimed to appraise the evidence concerning the effectiveness of probiotics on the mental health of pregnant women, lactating mother and the microbiota of the newborn.This systematic review and meta-analysis ascertained quantitative studies published in Medline (PubMed), Clinical Key, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Cochrane Library, and Google scholar. Two authors independently screened and extracted the data from the primary studies that analysed the efficacy of probiotics on the mental health of pregnant and lactating women and the microbiota of the newborn. We adopted Cochrane Collaboration guidelines and reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement. The qualities of included trials were assessed by Cochrane collaboration's risk of bias tool (ROB-2).Sixteen trials comprised 946 pregnant women, 524 were lactating mothers, and 1678 were infants. The sample size of primary studies ranged from 36 to 433. Probiotics were administered as interventions, using either a single strain of Bifidobacterium or Lactobacillus or a double-strain combination of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. Probiotics supplementation reduced anxiety in pregnant (nâ=â676, standardised mean difference (SMD)â=â0.01; 95% confidence interval (CI)â=â-0.28,0.30, Pâ=â0.04, I<sup>2</sup>â=â70) and lactating women (nâ=â514, SMDâ=â-0.17; 95% CIâ=â-1.62,1.27, Pâ=â0.98, I<sup>2</sup>â=â0). Similarly, probiotics decreased depression in pregnant (nâ=â298, SMDâ=â0.05; 95% CIâ=â-0.24,0.35, Pâ=â0.20, I<sup>2</sup>â=â40) and lactating women (nâ=â518, SMDâ=â-0.10; 95% CIâ=â-1.29,-1.05, Pâ=â0.11, I<sup>2</sup>â=â60%). Similarly, probiotics supplementation improved the gut microbiota and reduced the duration of crying, abdominal distension, abdominal colic and diarrhoea.Non-invasive probiotic therapies are more useful to pregnant and lactating women and newborns.The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022372126).",Journal of global health,2023,Kurvatteppa Halemani; Asha P Shetty; Latha Thimmappa; Alwin Issac; Sanjay Dhiraaj; K Radha; Prabhaker Mishra; Edlin Glane Mathias
37927130,<i>Lactobacillus reuteri</i> ATG-F4 Alleviates Chronic Stress-induced Anhedonia by Modulating the Prefrontal Serotonergic System.,"Mental health is influenced by the gut-brain axis; for example, gut dysbiosis has been observed in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Gut microbial changes by fecal microbiota transplantation or probiotics treatment reportedly modulates depressive symptoms. However, it remains unclear how gut dysbiosis contributes to mental dysfunction, and how correction of the gut microbiota alleviates neuropsychiatric disorders. Our previous study showed that chronic consumption of <i>Lactobacillus reuteri</i> ATG-F4 (F4) induced neurometabolic alterations in healthy mice. Here, we investigated whether F4 exerted therapeutic effects on depressive-like behavior by influencing the central nervous system. Using chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) to induce anhedonia, a key symptom of MDD, we found that chronic F4 consumption alleviated CUS-induced anhedonic behaviors, accompanied by biochemical changes in the gut, serum, and brain. Serum and brain metabolite concentrations involved in tryptophan metabolism were regulated by CUS and F4. F4 consumption reduced the elevated levels of serotonin (5-HT) in the brain observed in the CUS group. Additionally, the increased expression of <i>Htr1a</i>, a subtype of the 5-HT receptor, in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of stressed mice was restored to levels observed in stress-naÃ¯ve mice following F4 supplementation. We further demonstrated the role of <i>Htr1a</i> using AAV-shRNA to downregulate <i>Htr1a</i> in the mPFC of CUS mice, effectively reversing CUS-induced anhedonic behavior. Together, our findings suggest F4 as a potential therapeutic approach for relieving some depressive symptoms and highlight the involvement of the tryptophan metabolism in mitigating CUS-induced depressive-like behaviors through the action of this bacterium.",Experimental neurobiology,2023,Jiyun Lee; Eum-Ji Kim; Gun-Seok Park; Jeongseop Kim; Tae-Eun Kim; Yoo Jin Lee; Juyi Park; Jihee Kang; Ja Wook Koo; Tae-Yong Choi
37232729,The Effect of Probiotic Supplementation on the Gut-Brain Axis in Psychiatric Patients.,"The pathophysiology of several psychiatric diseases may entail disturbances in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and metabolic pathways. Variations in how these effects present themselves may be connected to individual variances in clinical symptoms and treatment responses, such as the observation that a significant fraction of participants do not respond to current antipsychotic drugs. A bidirectional signaling pathway between the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract is known as the microbiota-gut-brain axis. The large and small intestines contain more than 100 trillion microbial cells, contributing to the intestinal ecosystem's incredible complexity. Interactions between the microbiota and intestinal epithelium can alter brain physiology and affect mood and behavior. There has recently been a focus on how these relationships impact mental health. According to evidence, intestinal microbiota may play a role in neurological and mental illnesses. Intestinal metabolites of microbial origin, such as short-chain fatty acids, tryptophan metabolites, and bacterial components that might stimulate the host's immune system, are mentioned in this review. We aim to shed some on the growing role of gut microbiota in inducing/manipulating several psychiatric disorders, which may pave the way for novel microbiota-based therapies.",Current issues in molecular biology,2023,Hussein Sabit; Areej Kassab; Donia Alaa; Shaza Mohamed; Shaimaa Abdel-Ghany; Mohamed Mansy; Osama A Said; Mona A Khalifa; Halah Hafiz; Asmaa M Abushady
37228982,Gut-brain axis: altered microbiome and depression - review.,"The concept of a 'gut-brain axis' was recently developed when the complex communications between the brain and the gut became evident. The interaction may affect emotions, motivation, mood, and higher cognitive functions as well as gut homeostasis. Human microbe symbiosis's merits are now acknowledged to transcend human mental health. Research has recently indicated that the gut-brain axis plays a vital role in brain health maintenance. The term 'gut-brain axis' can only partially capture the intricacy of these interactions. Dysbiosis of the gut commensals has been seen in patients with psychiatric diseases, such as depression. Major depressive disorder is caused by complicated interactions between the individual gene and the environment. In a forced swimming test, P. Zheng <i>et al.</i> discovered that germ-free mice with no gut microbiota had a shorter immobility duration than healthy mice. More radical effects were expressed on the use of probiotics rather than prebiotics and postbiotics in reducing the symptoms of depression in patients with major depressive disorder. One of prime importance can be given to exploring more microbiota to investigate the better therapeutic effects of probiotics, prebiotics, and postbiotics.",Annals of medicine and surgery (2012),2023,Anmol Mohan; Swathi Godugu; Saumya S Joshi; Kenisha B Shah; Srija C Vanka; Hania Shakil; Dhanush P; Swathi Veliginti; Prajwal S Sure; Jyothsna Goranti
38068763,Analysis of the Efficacy of Diet and Short-Term Probiotic Intervention on Depressive Symptoms in Patients after Bariatric Surgery: A Randomized Double-Blind Placebo Controlled Pilot Study.,"(1) Background: studies have shown that some patients experience mental deterioration after bariatric surgery. (2) Methods: We examined whether the use of probiotics and improved eating habits can improve the mental health of people who suffered from mood disorders after bariatric surgery. We also analyzed patients' mental states, eating habits and microbiota. (3) Results: Depressive symptoms were observed in 45% of 200 bariatric patients. After 5 weeks, we noted an improvement in patients' mental functioning (reduction in BDI and HRSD), but it was not related to the probiotic used. The consumption of vegetables and whole grain cereals increased (DQI-I adequacy), the consumption of simple sugars and SFA decreased (moderation DQI-I), and the consumption of monounsaturated fatty acids increased it. In the feces of patients after RYGB, there was a significantly higher abundance of two members of the Muribaculaceae family, namely Veillonella and Roseburia, while those after SG had more Christensenellaceae R-7 group, Subdoligranulum, Oscillibacter, and UCG-005. (4) Conclusions: the noted differences in the composition of the gut microbiota (RYGB vs. SG) may be one of the determinants of the proper functioning of the gut-brain microbiota axis, although there is currently a need for further research into this topic using a larger group of patients and different probiotic doses.",Nutrients,2023,Natalia Komorniak; Mariusz Kaczmarczyk; Igor Åoniewski; Alexandra Martynova-Van Kley; Armen Nalian; MichaÅ WroÅski; Krzysztof Kaseja; Bartosz Kowalewski; Marcin Folwarski; Ewa Stachowska
37095530,"Positive mood-related gut microbiota in a long-term closed environment: a multiomics study based on the ""Lunar Palace 365"" experiment.","Psychological health risk is one of the most severe and complex risks in manned deep-space exploration and long-term closed environments. Recently, with the in-depth research of the microbiota-gut-brain axis, gut microbiota has been considered a new approach to maintain and improve psychological health. However, the correlation between gut microbiota and psychological changes inside long-term closed environments is still poorly understood. Herein, we used the ""Lunar Palace 365"" mission, a 1-year-long isolation study in the Lunar Palace 1 (a closed manned Bioregenerative Life Support System facility with excellent performance), to investigate the correlation between gut microbiota and psychological changes, in order to find some new potential psychobiotics to maintain and improve the psychological health of crew members.We report some altered gut microbiota that were associated with psychological changes in the long-term closed environment. Four potential psychobiotics (Bacteroides uniformis, Roseburia inulinivorans, Eubacterium rectale, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii) were identified. On the basis of metagenomic, metaproteomic, and metabolomic analyses, the four potential psychobiotics improved mood mainly through three pathways related to nervous system functions: first, by fermenting dietary fibers, they may produce short-chain fatty acids, such as butyric and propionic acids; second, they may regulate amino acid metabolism pathways of aspartic acid, glutamic acid, tryptophan, etc. (e.g., converting glutamic acid to gamma-aminobutyric acid; converting tryptophan to serotonin, kynurenic acid, or tryptamine); and third, they may regulate other pathways, such as taurine and cortisol metabolism. Furthermore, the results of animal experiments confirmed the positive regulatory effect and mechanism of these potential psychobiotics on mood.These observations reveal that gut microbiota contributed to a robust effect on the maintenance and improvement of mental health in a long-term closed environment. Our findings represent a key step towards a better understanding the role of the gut microbiome in mammalian mental health during space flight and provide a basis for future efforts to develop microbiota-based countermeasures that mitigate risks to crew mental health during future long-term human space expeditions on the moon or Mars. This study also provides an essential reference for future applications of psychobiotics to neuropsychiatric treatments.

38007616,Fiber intake and fiber intervention in depression and anxiety: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies and randomized controlled trials.,"Dietary fibers hold potential to influence depressive and anxiety outcomes by modulating the microbiota-gut-brain axis, which is increasingly recognized as an underlying factor in mental health maintenance.Evidence for the effects of fibers on depressive and anxiety outcomes remains unclear. To this end, a systematic literature review and a meta-analysis were conducted that included observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs).The PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and PsychINFO databases were searched for eligible studies.Study screening and risk-of-bias assessment were conducted by 2 independent reviewers.Meta-analyses via random effects models were performed to examine the (1) association between fiber intake and depressive and anxiety outcomes in observational studies, and (2) effect of fiber intervention on depressive and anxiety outcomes compared with placebo in RCTs. A total of 181â405 participants were included in 23 observational studies. In cross-sectional studies, an inverse association was observed between fiber intake and depressive (Cohen's d effect size [d]: -0.11; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.16, -0.05) and anxiety (d = -0.25; 95%CI, -0.38, -0.12) outcomes. In longitudinal studies, there was an inverse association between fiber intake and depressive outcomes (d = -0.07; 95%CI, -0.11, -0.04). In total, 740 participants were included in 10 RCTs, all of whom used fiber supplements. Of note, only 1 RCT included individuals with a clinical diagnosis of depression. No difference was found between fiber supplementation and placebo for depressive (d = -0.47; 95%CI, -1.26, 0.31) or anxiety (d = -0.30; 95%CI, -0.67, 0.07) outcomes.Although observational data suggest a potential benefit for higher fiber intake for depressive and anxiety outcomes, evidence from current RCTs does not support fiber supplementation for improving depressive or anxiety outcomes.

37485386,Prebiotics for depression: how does the gut microbiota play a role?,"Depression, a mood disorder characterized by persistent feelings of sadness and aversion to activity that can interfere with daily life, is a condition of great concern. Prebiotics, which are non-digestible substances selectively utilized by host microorganisms for health benefits, have gained attention for their potential to improve overall wellness and alleviate various disorders including depression. This study aims to review clinical trials utilizing carbohydrate-type prebiotics such as inulin-type fructans, galactooligosaccharides (GOS), human milk oligosaccharides, resistant starch, prebiotic phytochemicals including epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), chlorogenic acids, resveratrol, and prebiotic lipids (n-3 polysaturated fatty acids) to determine their effects on depression. Our findings suggest that GOS at a daily dosage of 5âg and eicosapentaenoic acid at or less than 1âg can effectively mitigate depressive symptoms. While EGCG exhibits potential antidepressant properties, a higher dosage of 3âg/d may be necessary to elicit significant effects. The plausible mechanisms underlying the impact of prebiotics on depression include the synthesis of neurotransmitters, production of short-chain fatty acids, and regulation of inflammation.",Frontiers in nutrition,2023,Yongde Yang; Bi Zhou; Sheng Zhang; Liang Si; Xiaobo Liu; Fu Li

Î± and Î² diversity and the relative abundance of gut microbiota were analysed as outcome indices. Data analysis was performed using Review Manager (5.4.1) and R.Chao1 and Shannon index levels in AD were significantly lower compared with healthy controls (HCs), and the Chao1 index was significantly lower in MCI compared with HCs. There was a significant difference in Î² diversity of gut microbiomes in patients (SCD, MCI, AD) compared with HCs. The relative abundance of Firmicutes at the phylum level was significantly lower in patients with AD and MCI than HCs. However, the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes at the phylum level was significantly higher in patients with MCI than HCs. There was an increasing trend for Enterobacteriaceae and a decreasing trend for Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae and Lactobacillus during AD; Lactobacillus showed a decreasing trend early in SCD.Our results indicated that there were gut microbiological abnormalities in AD, even as early as the SCD stage.

The pooled analyses showed that children with ASD had significantly lower levels of oxytocin (mean differences, MDâ=â-45.691, 95% confidence interval, CI: -61.667, -29.717), iron (MDâ=â-3.203, 95% CI: -4.891, -1.514), and zinc (MDâ=â-6.707, 95% CI: -12.691, -0.722), lower relative abundance of <i>Bifidobacterium</i> (MDâ=â-1.321, 95% CI: -2.403, -0.238) and <i>Parabacteroides</i> (MDâ=â-0.081, 95% CI: -0.148, -0.013), higher levels of c-reactive protein, CRP (MDâ=â0.401, 95% CI: 0.036, 0.772), and GABA (MDâ=â0.115, 95% CI: 0.045, 0.186), and higher relative abundance of <i>Bacteroides</i> (MDâ=â1.386, 95% CI: 0.717, 2.055) and <i>Clostridium</i> (MDâ=â0.281, 95% CI: 0.035, 0.526) when compared with controls. The results of the overall analyses were stable after performing the sensitivity analyses. Additionally, no substantial publication bias was observed among the studies.Children with ASD have significantly higher levels of CRP and GABA, lower levels of oxytocin, iron, and zinc, lower relative abundance of <i>Bifidobacterium</i> and <i>Parabacteroides</i>, and higher relative abundance of <i>Faecalibacterium</i>, <i>Bacteroides,</i> and <i>Clostridium</i> when compared with controls.

37071196,Development of the gut microbiota in the first 14Â years of life and its relations to internalizing and externalizing difficulties and social anxiety during puberty.,"Relations between the gut microbiota and host mental health have been suggested by a growing number of case-control and cross-sectional studies, while supporting evidence is limited in large community samples followed during an extended period. Therefore, the current preregistered study ( https://osf.io/8ymav , September 7, 2022) described child gut microbiota development in the first 14Â years of life and explored its relations to internalizing and externalizing difficulties and social anxiety in puberty, a period of high relevance for the development of mental health problems. Fecal microbiota composition was analysed by 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing in a total of 1003 samples from 193 children. Through a clustering method, four distinct microbial clusters were newly identified in puberty. Most children within three of these clusters remained in the same clusters from the age of 12 to 14Â years, suggesting stability in microbial development and transition during this period. These three clusters were compositionally similar to enterotypes (i.e., a robust classification of the gut microbiota based on its composition across different populations) enriched in Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Ruminococcus, respectively. Two Prevotella 9-predominated clusters, including one reported by us earlier in middle childhood and the other one in puberty, were associated with more externalizing behavior at age 14. One Faecalibacterium-depleted pubertal cluster was related to more social anxiety at age 14. This finding was confirmed by a negative cross-sectional relation between Faecalibacterium and social anxiety in the 14-year-olds. The findings of this study continue to map gut microbiota development in a relatively large community sample followed from birth onwards, importantly extending our knowledge to puberty. Results indicate that Prevotella 9 and Faecalibacterium may be relevant microbial taxa in relation to externalizing behavior and social anxiety, respectively. These correlational findings need validations from other similar cohort studies, as well as well-designed mechanistic pre-clinical investigations before inferring cause and effect.",European child & adolescent psychiatry,2024,Yangwenshan Ou; Clara Belzer; Hauke Smidt; Carolina de Weerth
37343494,Gut microbes influence the development of central nervous system disorders through epigenetic inheritance.,"Central nervous system (CNS) disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and Alzheimer's disease (AD), affect quality of life of patients and pose significant economic and social burdens worldwide. Due to their obscure and complex pathogeneses, current therapies for these diseases have limited efficacy. Over the past decade, the gut microbiome has been shown to exhibit direct and indirect influences on the structure and function of the CNS, affecting multiple pathological pathways. In addition to the direct interactions between the gut microbiota and CNS, the gut microbiota and their metabolites can regulate epigenetic processes, including DNA methylation, histone modification, and regulation of non-coding RNAs. In this review, we discuss the tripartite relationship among gut microbiota, epigenetic inheritance, and CNS disorders. We suggest that gut microbes and their metabolites influence the pathogenesis of CNS disorders at the epigenetic level, which may inform the development of effective therapeutic strategies for CNS disorders.",Microbiological research,2023,Tianyou Liu; Dongru Du; Rui Zhao; Qinglian Xie; Zaiquan Dong

Komagataella pastoris KM71H is a yeast with probiotic properties and antidepressant-like effects in animal models of depression. Hence, we evaluated the antidepressant-like effects of K. pastoris KM71H in a model of antibiotic-induced intestinal dysbiosis in male Swiss mice. The mice received clindamycin (200 Î¼g, intraperitoneal) and, after 24 h, were treated with K. pastoris KM71H at a dose of 8 log CFU/animal by intragastric administration (ig) or PBS (vehicle, ig) for 14 consecutive days. Afterward, the animals were subjected to behavioral tests and biochemical analyses. Our results showed that K. pastoris KM71H administration decreased the immobility time in the tail suspension test and increased grooming activity duration in the splash test in antibiotic-treated mice, thereby characterizing its antidepressant-like effect. We observed that these effects of K. pastoris KM71H were accompanied by the modulation of the intestinal microbiota, preservation of intestinal barrier integrity, and restoration of the mRNA levels of occludin, zonula occludens-1, zonula occludens-2, and toll-like receptor-4 in the small intestine, and interleukin-1Î² in the hippocampi of mice.

37657622,Strain-level structure of gut microbiome showed potential association with cognitive function in major depressive disorder: A pilot study.,"Although the association between gut microbiota and the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder (MDD) has been well studied, it is unclear whether gut microbiota affects cognitive function in patients with MDD. In this study, we explored the association between gut microbiota and cognitive function in MDD and its possible mechanisms.We enrolled 57 patients with MDD and 30 healthy controls (HCs) and used 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis and shotgun metagenomic sequencing analysis to determine gut microbial composition.The richness and diversity of gut microbiota in patients with MDD were the same as those in HCs, but there were differences in the abundance of Bifidobacterium and Blautia. Compared with HCs, two strains (bin_32 and bin_55) were significantly increased, and one strain (bin_31) was significantly decreased in patients with MDD based on the strain-level meta-analysis. Time to complete the Stroop-C had significant negative correlations with bin_31 and bin_32. Bin_55 had significant negative correlations with time to complete the Stroop-C, time to complete the Stroop-CW, and repeated animal words in 60Â s but significant positive correlations with correct answers in 120Â s on the Stroop-CW.This study only tested the cognitive function of MDD in a small sample, which may have caused some bias.Based on our strain-level analysis, we found that gut microbiota may be associated with the pathogenesis of MDD and may have potential effects on cognitive function.",Journal of affective disorders,2023,Zaiquan Dong; Qinglian Xie; Yanling Yuan; Xiaoling Shen; Yanni Hao; Jin Li; Haizhen Xu; Weihong Kuang
36804416,A snapshot of gut microbiota data from murine models of Autism Spectrum Disorder: Still a blurred picture.,"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in social communication and interaction and repetitive/stereotyped behaviors. In recent years, the role of microbiota-gut-brain axis in ASD pathogenesis received growing attention, appearing as an attractive therapeutic target. We provide a comprehensive overview of changes in microbiota composition in ASD murine models so far identified, and summarize the therapeutic approaches targeting the microbiota on ASD-like neurobehavioral profile. Although alterations in microbiota composition have been observed in both genetic and environmental murine models of ASD, a clear microbiota profile shared by different ASD murine models has not been identified. We documented substantial discrepancies among studies (often within the same model), likely due to several confounding factors (from sex and age of animals to housing conditions). Despite these limitations, ASD animal models (under standardized conditions) remain a useful tool to evaluate (i) the beneficial effects of manipulations of gut microbiota on behavioral abnormalities; (ii) underlying neurobiological mechanisms related to gut-brain axis; and (iii) to identify optimal time windows for therapeutic interventions.",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,2023,A M Tartaglione; V Pazienza; G Calamandrei; L Ricceri
37569349,Microbial Reprogramming in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorders: A Review of Gut-Brain Communication and Emerging Evidence.,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a debilitating mental health disorder characterized by intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors (compulsions). Dysbiosis, an imbalance in the gut microbial composition, has been associated with various health conditions, including mental health disorders, autism, and inflammatory diseases. While the exact mechanisms underlying OCD remain unclear, this review presents a growing body of evidence suggesting a potential link between dysbiosis and the multifaceted etiology of OCD, interacting with genetic, neurobiological, immunological, and environmental factors. This review highlights the emerging evidence implicating the gut microbiota in the pathophysiology of OCD and its potential as a target for novel therapeutic approaches. We propose a model that positions dysbiosis as the central unifying element in the neurochemical, immunological, genetic, and environmental factors leading to OCD. The potential and challenges of microbial reprogramming strategies, such as probiotics and fecal transplants in OCD therapeutics, are discussed. This review raises awareness of the importance of adopting a holistic approach that considers the interplay between the gut and the brain to develop interventions that account for the multifaceted nature of OCD and contribute to the advancement of more personalized approaches.",International journal of molecular sciences,2023,Ghizlane Bendriss; Ross MacDonald; Clare McVeigh
38525261,"Impact of dietary fiber on gut microbiota composition, function and gut-brain-modules in healthy adults - a systematic review protocol.","The gut microbiota has been extensively implicated in health and disease. The functional outputs of the gut microbiota, such as microbial metabolites, are considered particularly important in this regard. Significant associations exist between alterations in the relative abundance of specific microbial taxa and mental health disorders. Dietary fiber has the potential to alter gut microbiota composition and function, modifying bacterial enzymatic function and the production of metabolites. As many taxa of microorganisms have enzymes capable of producing or degrading neurochemicals i.e. neuroactive gut brain modules, new predictive tools can be applied to existing datasets such as those harvested from dietary fiber interventions. We endeavor to perform a systematic review in order to identify studies reporting compositional gut microbiota alterations after interventions with dietary fiber in healthy individuals. We aim to also extract from the selected studies publicly available microbial genomic sequence datasets for reanalysis with a consistent bioinformatics pipeline, with the ultimate intention of identifying altered gut brain modules following dietary fiber interventions.Interventional trials and randomized controlled studies that are originally published, including cross-over and non-crossover design and involving healthy adult humans will be included. A systematic search of PubMed/MEDLINE and EMBASE, two electronic databases, will be completed.Various types of dietary fiber have an impact on the gut microbiota composition, with some promoting the growth of particular taxa while others are reduced in relative abundance. Our search focuses on the impact of this food component on the microbiota of healthy individuals. Compositional gut microbial changes have been reported and our review will compile and update these observations after reanalysis of their datasets with a consistent bioinformatic pipeline. From this it may be possible to predict more detailed functional consequences in terms of neuroactive gut brain modules, of the compositional alterations in gut microbial taxa.",HRB open research,2023,David Antoine Lachmansingh; Benjamin Valderrama; Thomaz Bastiaanssen; John Cryan; Gerard Clarke; Aonghus Lavelle
38003647,Unveiling the Connection between Microbiota and Depressive Disorder through Machine Learning.,"In the last few years, investigation of the gut-brain axis and the connection between the gut microbiota and the human nervous system and mental health has become one of the most popular topics. Correlations between the taxonomic and functional changes in gut microbiota and major depressive disorder have been shown in several studies. Machine learning provides a promising approach to analyze large-scale metagenomic data and identify biomarkers associated with depression. In this work, machine learning algorithms, such as random forest, elastic net, and You Only Look Once (YOLO), were utilized to detect significant features in microbiome samples and classify individuals based on their disorder status. The analysis was conducted on metagenomic data obtained during the study of gut microbiota of healthy people and patients with major depressive disorder. The YOLO method showed the greatest effectiveness in the analysis of the metagenomic samples and confirmed the experimental results on the critical importance of a reduction in the amount of <i>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</i> for the manifestation of depression. These findings could contribute to a better understanding of the role of the gut microbiota in major depressive disorder and potentially lead the way for novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",International journal of molecular sciences,2023,Irina Y Angelova; Alexey S Kovtun; Olga V Averina; Tatiana A Koshenko; Valery N Danilenko
37304433,Altered gut microbiota profile in patients with perimenopausal panic disorder.,"Females in the perimenopausal period are susceptible to mood disorders. Perimenopausal panic disorder (PPD) is characterized by repeated and unpredictable panic attacks during perimenopause, and it impacts the patient's physical and mental health and social function. Pharmacotherapy is limited in the clinic, and its pathological mechanism is unclear. Recent studies have demonstrated that gut microbiota is strongly linked to emotion; however, the relation between PPD and microbiota is limitedly known.This study aimed to discover specific microbiota in PPD patients and the intrinsic connection between them. Gut microbiota was analyzed in PPD patients (<i>n</i> = 40) and healthy controls (<i>n</i> = 40) by 16S rRNA sequencing.The results showed reduced Î±-diversity (richness) in the gut microbiota of PPD patients. Î²-diversity indicated that PPD and healthy controls had different intestinal microbiota compositions. At the genus level, 30 species of microbiota abundance had significantly different between the PPD and healthy controls. In addition, HAMA, PDSS, and PASS scales were collected in two groups. It was found that Bacteroides and Alistipes were positively correlated with PASS, PDSS, and HAMA.Bacteroides and Alistipes dysbiosis dominate imbalanced microbiota in PPD patients. This microbial alteration may be a potential pathogenesis and physio-pathological feature of PPD. The distinct gut microbiota can be a potential diagnostic marker and a new therapeutic target for PPD.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2023,Shen Lin; Hongjin Wang; Jingjing Qiu; Minghong Li; Ebin Gao; Xiaofeng Wu; Yunxiang Xu; Guizhen Chen
37879416,Depression-like phenotypes in mice with hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury: A role of gut-microbiota-liver-brain axis via vagus nerve.,"Depression is a frequent symptom in patients with chronic liver disease; however, the mechanisms underlying this association remain unclear. Dysbiosis of gut microbiota plays a critical role in depression through the gut-brain axis via the vagus nerve. In this study, we investigated whether the gut-microbiota-liver-brain axis plays a role in depression-like phenotypes in mice with hepatic ischemia/reperfusion (HI/R) injury via the vagus nerve. Behavioral tests for depression-like behaviors were performed 7Â days after sham or HI/R injury surgery. Mice with HI/R injury exhibited splenomegaly, systemic inflammation, depression-like behaviors, reduced expression of synaptic proteins in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), abnormal composition of gut microbiota, and altered blood metabolites and lipids. Furthermore, there were positive or negative correlations between the relative abundance of microbiome and behavioral data or blood metabolites (or lipids). Moreover, subdiaphragmatic vagotomy significantly blocked these changes in mice with HI/R injury. Notably, depression-like phenotypes in mice with HI/R injury were ameliorated after subsequent single injection of the new antidepressant arketamine. The current findings suggest that HI/R injury induces depression-like phenotypes in mice through the gut-microbiota-liver-brain axis via the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve. Furthermore, arketamine may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of depression in patients with chronic liver disease.",Journal of affective disorders,2024,Yong Yang; Akifumi Eguchi; Xiayun Wan; Chisato Mori; Kenji Hashimoto
37400971,Maternal microbiome disturbance induces deficits in the offspring's behaviors: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Recent evidence has suggested that changes in maternal gut microbiota in early life may generate neurobiological consequences associated with psychiatric-related abnormalities. However, the number of studies on humans investigating this problem is limited, and preclinical findings sometimes conflict. Therefore, we run a meta-analysis to examine whether maternal microbiota disturbance (MMD) during neurodevelopment might affect the offspring during adulthood. We found thirteen studies, from a set of 459 records selected by strategy registered on PROSPERO (#289224), to target preclinical studies that evaluated the behavioral outcomes of the rodents generated by dams submitted to perinatal enteric microbiota perturbation. The analysis revealed a significant effect size (SMDâ=â-0.51, 95% CIâ=â-0.79 to -0.22, <i>p</i>â<â.001, T2â=â0.54, I2â=â79.85%), indicating that MMD might provoke behavioral impairments in the adult offspring. The MMD also induces a significant effect size for the reduction of the sociability behavior (SMDâ=â-0.63, 95% CIâ=â-1.18 toâ-0.07, <i>p</i>â=â0.011, T2â=â0.30, I2â=â76.11%) and obsessive-compulsive-like behavior (SMDâ=â-0.68, 95% CIâ=â-0.01 to -1.36, <i>p</i>â=â0.009, T2â=â0.25, I2â=â62.82%) parameters. The effect size was not significant or inconclusive for memory and anxiety-like behavior, or inconclusive for schizophrenia-like and depressive-like behavior. Therefore, experimental perinatal MMD is vertically transmitted to the offspring, negatively impacting behavioral parameters related to psychiatric disorders.",Gut microbes,2023,Lucas Hassib; Cilene Lino de Oliveira; Guilherme Araujo Rouvier; Alexandre Kanashiro; Francisco Silveira GuimarÃ£es; Frederico RogÃ©rio Ferreira
39295905,The butyrate-producing and spore-forming bacterial genus <i>Coprococcus</i> as a potential biomarker for neurological disorders.,"The host-intestinal microbiome interaction has gained much scientific attention in the past two decades, boosted by advances in DNA sequencing and cultivation techniques. An accumulating amount of evidence shows that gut microbes play crucial roles in gut homeostasis, immune system education, and are associated with quality-of-life indicators. Beneficial health factors are associated with the digestion of dietary fibres in the colon and the subsequent production of short-chain fatty acids, including acetate, propionate, and butyrate. <i>Coprococcus</i> is a butyrate-producing genus in the phylum Firmicutes, and its abundance is inversely correlated with several neuropsychological and neurodegenerative disorders. Case-control studies provide strong evidence of decreased abundance of <i>Coprococcus</i> spp. in depressed individuals. The species <i>Coprococcus eutactus</i> has the unique capacity to use two separate pathways for butyrate synthesis and has been found to be depleted in children with delayed language development and adults with Parkinson's disease. The combined literature on <i>Coprococcus</i> and the gut microbiota-brain axis points towards enhanced butyrate production and reduced colonisation of pathogenic clades as factors explaining its association with health effects. The genus <i>Coprococcus</i> is a promising candidate for a mental health biomarker and an interesting lead for novel dietary-based preventive therapies for specific neurological disorders.","Gut microbiome (Cambridge, England)",2023,Fleur Notting; Walter Pirovano; Wilbert Sybesma; Remco Kort

36786865,Arketamine for cognitive impairment in psychiatric disorders.,"Cognitive impairment has been observed in patients with various psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, major depressive disorder (MDD), and bipolar disorder (BD). Although modern therapeutic drugs can improve certain symptoms (i.e., psychosis, depression) in these patients, these drugs have not been found to improve cognitive impairment. The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist (R,S)-ketamine has attracted attention as a rapidly acting antidepressant. In addition to its robust antidepressant effects, (R,S)-ketamine has been suggested to improve cognitive impairment in patients with MDD and BD, despite causing cognitive impairment in healthy control subjects. (R,S)-ketamine is a racemic mixture of equal amounts of (R)-ketamine (or arketamine) and (S)-ketamine (or esketamine). Arketamine has been found to have more potent antidepressant-like actions than esketamine in rodents. Interestingly, arketamine, but not esketamine, has been suggested to improve phencyclidine-induced cognitive deficits in mice. Furthermore, arketamine has been suggested to ameliorate cognitive deficits in rodent offspring after maternal immune activation. In the current article, it is proposed that arketamine has therapeutic potential for treating cognitive impairment in patients with psychiatric disorders. Additionally, the potential role of the gut-microbiome-brain axis in cognitive impairment in psychiatric disorders is discussed.",European archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience,2023,Kenji Hashimoto
37686747,Influence of Food Type on Human Psychological-Behavioral Responses and Crime Reduction.,"The purpose of this narrative review is to emphasize the importance of food consumption and meal selection on mental health and brain function, including psychological and behavioral reactions such as mood, loving relationships, violence, and criminal activity. Additionally, by being aware of the link between food and mental health, the community can be encouraged to make informed food choices in order to avoid unfavorable outcomes like criminality. Food behaviors are shifting significantly over the world. There are also significant changes in mood, sadness, happiness, and violence, as well as the spread of the variety and severity of mental diseases that lead to violent acts. Food intake and meal selection have evolved over the last ten years as the variety and accessibility of food options have become easier and more diverse. These modifications might have both beneficial and bad consequences. This article examines the relationship between food intake and its impact on marital satisfaction. The goal of this review is to support or refute the claim that food influences mood, love, or criminal behavior, or vice versa. Various diets can have an impact on one's mental health and brain, influencing psychological reactions and behavioral responses such as mood, loving relationships, violence, and even criminal activity. Food insecurity has been demonstrated in various studies to have a negative impact on health and psychological well-being, leading to despair, loss of happiness, marital conflict, and violence. For example, herbal extracts and flavonoids have the potential to improve gut microbiota and treat mood disorders. Understanding how the gut-brain axis communicates might help guide interventions for mood and cognitive function. Since the root of most diseases and behaviors is significantly related to the type of food consumed, this research addresses this issue in order to reduce the cost of treatment and prevention of crime and delinquency at the community level by consciously choosing the food consumed by the society. In other words, prevention is always better than cure.",Nutrients,2023,Masoud Heidari; Yalda Khodadadi Jokar; Shirin Madani; Sharifeh Shahi; Mohammad Sharif Shahi; Mohammad Goli
37150361,Gut microbiota maturity mediates the protective effect of siblings on food allergy.,"The mechanisms underlying the protective effect of older siblings on allergic disease remain unclear but may relate to the infant gut microbiota.We sought to investigate whether having older siblings decreases the risk of IgE-mediated food allergy by accelerating the maturation of the infant gut microbiota.In a birth cohort assembled using an unselected antenatal sampling frame (nÂ = 1074), fecal samples were collected at 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year, and food allergy status at 1 year was determined by skin prick test and in-hospital food challenge. We used 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to derive amplicon sequence variants. Among a random subcohort (nÂ = 323), microbiota-by-age z scores at each time point were calculated using fecal amplicon sequence variants to represent the gut microbiota maturation over the first year of life.A greater number of siblings was associated with a higher microbiota-by-age z score at age 1 year (Î²âÂ = 0.15 per an additional sibling; 95% CI, 0.05-0.24; PÂ = .003), which was in turn associated with decreased odds of food allergy (odds ratio, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.33-0.61; PÂ < .001). Microbiota-by-age z scores mediated 63% of the protective effect of siblings. Analogous associations were not observed at younger ages.The protective effect of older siblings on the risk of developing IgE-mediated food allergy during infancy is substantially mediated by advanced maturation of the gut microbiota at age 1 year.",The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,2023,Yuan Gao; Jakob Stokholm; Martin O'Hely; Anne-Louise Ponsonby; Mimi L K Tang; Sarath Ranganathan; Richard Saffery; Leonard C Harrison; Fiona Collier; Lawrence Gray; David Burgner; John Molloy; Peter D Sly; Susanne Brix; Hanne FrÃ¸kiÃ¦r; Peter Vuillermin; 
36875518,Disrupted diurnal oscillations of the gut microbiota in patients with alcohol dependence.,"Patients with alcohol dependence (AD) can exhibit gut dysbacteria. Dysbacteria may co-occur with disruptions of circadian rhythmicity of the gut flora, which can aggravate AD. Herein, this study aimed to investigate diurnal oscillations of the gut microbiota in AD patients.Thirty-two patients with AD, based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, and 20 healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. Demographic and clinical data were collected by self-report questionnaires. Fecal samples at 7:00 AM, 11:00 AM, 3:00 PM, and 7:00 PM were collected from each subject. 16S rDNA sequencing was conducted. Wilcoxon and Kruskal-Wallis tests were performed to characterize alterations and oscillations of the gut microbiota.We found that Î²-diversity of the gut microbiota in AD patients oscillated diurnally compared with healthy subjects (p = 0.01). Additionally, 0.66% of operational taxonomic units oscillated diurnally in AD patients versus 1.68% in healthy subjects. At different taxonomic levels, bacterial abundance oscillated diurnally in both groups, such as Pseudomonas and Prevotella pallens (all p < 0.05). Î²-diversity of the gut microbiota in AD patients with high daily alcohol consumption, high-level cravings, short AD durations, and mild withdrawal symptoms oscillated diurnally compared with other AD patients (all p < 0.05).The gut microbiota in AD patients exhibits disruptions of diurnal oscillation, which may provide novel insights into mechanisms of AD and the development of therapeutic strategies.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2023,Kangqing Zhao; Zhaojun Ni; Ying Qin; Ran Zhu; Zhoulong Yu; Yundong Ma; Wenhao Chen; Qiqing Sun; Zhong Wang; Yanjing Liu; Jingwen Zhao; Wenjuan Peng; Sifan Hu; Jie Shi; Lin Lu; Hongqiang Sun

37049619,Characteristics of the Gut Microbiome and Serum Metabolome in Patients with Functional Constipation.,"Functional constipation (FC) is a gastrointestinal disorder with high incidence, and it seriously affects patients' physical and mental health. Several studies have shown that the gut microbiome is associated with FC, but these studies have produced inconsistent findings, with few reflecting the relationship between the gut microbiome and metabolites. This study used 16S rRNA microbial genomics and non-target metabolome based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to analyze the gut microbiota composition and serum metabolic profiles of 30 FC patients and 28 healthy individuals. We found that patients with FC and healthy individuals have different gut microbiota structures and serum metabolic profiles. FC patients had more Bacteroides and butyrate-producing bacteria (Roseburia, Faecaliberium, Butyriccoccus). The upstream products of host arginine biosynthesis (2-oxoglutaric acid, <i>L</i>-glutamic acid, <i>N</i>-acetylornithine, and <i>L</i>-ornithine) were significantly reduced in FC patients' serum metabolites. In summary, our study describes the gut microbiome and serum metabolome of patients with functional constipation. It reveals that functional constipation may be associated with increased Bacteroidetes and downregulation of upstream products of host arginine biosynthesis, which may be potential markers for diagnosing functional constipation.",Nutrients,2023,Jialiang Wang; Linlin Wang; Qiangqing Yu; Nan Tang; Chunxia Mei; Hao Zhang; Gang Wang; Jian Lu; Wei Chen
36650644,Sex difference in prebiotics on gut and blood-brain barrier dysfunction underlying stress-induced anxiety and depression.,"Most of the previous studies have demonstrated the potential antidepressive and anxiolytic role of prebiotic supplement in male subjects, yet few have females enrolled. Herein, we explored whether prebiotics administration during chronic stress prevented depression-like and anxiety-like behavior in a sex-specific manner and the mechanism of behavioral differences caused by sex.Female and male C57 BL/J mice on normal diet were supplemented with or without a combination of fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) and galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) during 3- and 4-week chronic restraint stress (CRS) treatment, respectively. C57 BL/J mice on normal diet without CRS were used as controls. Behavior consequences, gut microbiota, dysfunction of gut and brain-blood barriers, and inflammatory profiles were measured.In the 3rd week, FOSâ+âGOS administration attenuated stress-induced anxiety-like behavior in female, but not in male mice, and the anxiolytic effects in males were observed until the 4th week. However, protective effects of prebiotics on CRS-induced depression were not observed. Changes in the gene expression of tight junction proteins in the distal colon and hippocampus, and decreased number of colon goblet cells following CRS were restored by prebiotics only in females. In both female and male mice, prebiotics alleviated stress-induced BBB dysfunction and elevation in pro-inflammatory cytokines levels, and modulated gut microbiota caused by stress. Furthermore, correlation analysis revealed that anxiety-like behaviors were significantly correlated with levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and gene expression of tight junction proteins in the hippocampus of female mice, and the abundance of specific gut microbes was also correlated with anxiety-like behaviors, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and gene expression of tight junction proteins in the hippocampus of female mice.Female mice were more vulnerable to stress and prebiotics than males. The gut microbiota, gut and blood-brain barrier, and inflammatory response may mediate the protective effects of prebiotics on anxiety-like behaviors in female mice.",CNS neuroscience & therapeutics,2023,Jiajun Jiang; Yaoyang Fu; Anying Tang; Xingle Gao; Danhua Zhang; Yuting Shen; Tingting Mou; Shaohua Hu; Jingfang Gao; Jianbo Lai
37209162,Bacillus licheniformis prevents and reduces anxiety-like and depression-like behaviours.,"As common mental disorders, depression and anxiety impact people all around the world. Recent studies have found that the gut microbiome plays an important role in mental health. It is becoming possible to treat mental disorders by regulating the composition of the gut microbiota. Bacillus licheniformis is a probiotic used to treat gut diseases through balancing the gut microbiome during lasting years. Considering the role of gut microbiota in the gut-brain axis, this study used chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model rats to explore whether Bacillus licheniformis can prevent and treat depression and anxiety. We found that B. licheniformis reduced the depressive-like and anxiety-like behaviours of the rats during the CUMS process. Meanwhile, B. licheniformis changed the gut microbiota composition; increased the short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the colon, decreased kynurenine, norepinephrine, and glutamate levels; and increased the tryptophan, dopamine, epinephrine, and Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain. After correlation analysis, we found Parabacteroides, Anaerostipes, Ruminococcus-2, and Blautia showed significant correlation with neurotransmitters and SCFAs, indicating the gut microbiome plays an important role in B. licheniformis reducing depressive-like behaviours. Therefore, this study suggested B. licheniformis may prevent depressive-like and anxiety-like behaviours while regulating the gut microbiota composition and increasing the SCFA levels in the colon to alter the levels of the neurotransmitters in the brain. KEY POINTS: â¢ B. licheniformis reduced depressive-like and anxiety-like behaviours induced by the chronic unpredictable mild stress. â¢ GABA levels in the brain are assonated with B. licheniformis regulating depressive-like and anxiety-like behaviours. â¢ Gut microbiota composition alteration followed by metabolic changes may play a role in the GABA levels increase.",Applied microbiology and biotechnology,2023,Siyuan Feng; Chen Meng; Yiyuan Liu; Yue Yi; Axin Liang; Yingyu Zhang; Zikai Hao
37193253,Anxiety Disorders and Gut Dysbiosis in Primary SjÃ¶gren's Syndrome-Mediated Dry Eye Patients.,"Primary SjÃ¶gren's syndrome (pSS), a disease that is associated with a high prevalence of psychological disorders, has become increasingly important. Interactions between the gut microbiota and ocular conditions have been identified in pSS. As mental intervention is frequently needed, this study aims to investigate the relationship between anxiety disorders and the gut microbiome in patients with pSS-mediated dry eye.Demographics and self-administered questionnaires were obtained. Faecal samples were evaluated using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing.The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-A) cut-off point of â¥ 8 points showed a sensitivity and specificity of 76.5% and 80.0%, respectively. In all participants, we found that the prevalence of anxiety disorder was 30.4%. Dry eye discomfort could promote an anxious state, and conversely, anxiety could threaten tear film and increase the risk of pSS activity. There was a certain correlation between anxiety disorder and gut dysbiosis. Prevotella was associated with dry eye severity (<i>p</i> <0.001). Bacteroidetes (<i>p</i> =0.046) and Odoribacter (<i>p</i> =0.001) were correlated with pSS activity.There is a bidirectional relationship between anxiety disorder and the gut microbiota in pSS-mediated dry eye. Alterations in certain classes of gut microbiota are associated with pSS activity and dry eye severity. Main gut microbiota alterations that have a facilitating impact on anxiety are emerging in pSS-mediated dry eye. Future studies are needed to explore specific therapeutic targets for improving mental health in pSS-mediated dry eye by microbiota intervention.",International journal of general medicine,2023,Yiting Zhang; Meiqi Gan; Yuqin He; Tingting Liu; Mei Xu
37576972,Profiles and diagnostic value of intestinal microbiota in schizophrenia patients with metabolic syndrome.,"It is widely thought that the intestinal microbiota plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders. However, the gut microbiota composition and characteristics of schizophrenia patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS) have been largely understudied. Herein, we investigated the association between the metabolic status of mainland Chinese schizophrenia patients with MetS and the intestinal microbiome.Fecal microbiota communities from 115 male schizophrenia patients (57 with MetS and 58 without MetS) were assessed by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. We assessed the variations of gut microbiome between both groups and explored potential associations between intestinal microbiota and parameters of MetS. In addition, the Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) based on the KEGG database was used to predict the function of intestinal microbiota. We also conducted Decision Tree Analysis to develop a diagnostic model for the MetS in patients with schizophrenia based on the composition of intestinal microbiota.The fecal microbial diversity significantly differed between groups with or without MetS (Î±-diversity (Shannon index and Simpson index): p=0.0155, p=0.0089; Î²-diversity: p=0.001). Moreover, the microbial composition was significantly different between the two groups, involving five phyla and 38 genera (p<0.05). In addition, a significant correlation was observed between the metabolic-related parameters and abundance of altered microbiota including HDL-c (r2Â =Â 0.203, p=0.0005), GLU (r2Â =Â 0.286, p=0.0005) and WC (r2Â =Â 0.061, p=0.037). Furthermore, KEGG pathway analysis showed that 16 signaling pathways were significantly enriched between the two groups (p<0.05). Importantly, our diagnostic model based on five microorganisms established by decision tree analysis could effectively distinguish between patients with and without MetS (AUC = 0.94).Our study established the compositional and functional characteristics of intestinal microbiota in schizophrenia patients with MetS. These new findings provide novel insights into a better understanding of this disease and provide the theoretical basis for implementing new interventional therapies in clinical practice.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2023,Mengjuan Xing; Hui Gao; Lili Yao; Li Wang; Chengfang Zhang; Liping Zhu; Donghong Cui
37764088,Altered Gut Microbiota Composition Is Associated with Difficulty in Explicit Emotion Regulation in Young Children.,"Executive function (EF) consists of explicit emotion regulation (EER) and cognitive control (CC). Childhood EER in particular predicts mental and physical health in adulthood. Identifying factors affecting EER development has implications for lifelong physical and mental health. Gut microbiota (GM) has attracted attention as a potential biomarker for risk of physical and mental problems in adulthood. Furthermore, GM is related to brain function/structure, which plays a crucial role in emotional processing. However, little is known about how GM compositions are associated with the development of emotion regulation in early childhood. Therefore, in this study, we examined 257 children aged 3-4 to investigate links between GM and risk to EF. EF was measured using the Mother-Reported Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Preschool version. GM composition (alpha/beta diversity and genus abundance) was evaluated using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and compared between EF-risk and non-risk groups. Our results show that children with EER-risk (an index of inhibitory self-control) had a higher abundance of the genera <i>Actinomyces</i> and <i>Sutterella</i>. Although we have not established a direct link between GM and CC risk, our findings indicate that GM of preschoolers is closely associated with emotional processing and that EERrisk children have more inflammation-related bacteria.",Microorganisms,2023,Hideaki Fujihara; Michiko Matsunaga; Eriko Ueda; Takamasa Kajiwara; Aya K Takeda; Satoshi Watanabe; Kairi Baba; Keisuke Hagihara; Masako Myowa
36760344,Alteration of faecal microbiota balance related to long-term deep meditation.,"Advancements in research have confirmed that gut microbiota can influence health through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Meditation, as an inner mental exercise, can positively impact the regulation of an individual's physical and mental health. However, few studies have comprehensively investigated faecal microbiota following long-term (several years) deep meditation. Therefore, we propose that long-term meditation may regulate gut microbiota homeostasis and, in turn, affect physical and mental health.To investigate the effects of long-term deep meditation on the gut microbiome structure.To examine the intestinal flora, 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed on faecal samples of 56 Tibetan Buddhist monks and neighbouring residents. Based on the sequencing data, linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) was employed to identify differential intestinal microbial communities between the two groups. Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) analysis was used to predict the function of faecal microbiota. In addition, we evaluated biochemical indices in the plasma.The Î±-diversity indices of the meditation and control groups differed significantly. At the genus level, <i>Prevotella</i> and <i>Bacteroides</i> were significantly enriched in the meditation group. According to the LEfSe analysis, two beneficial bacterial genera (<i>Megamonas</i> and <i>Faecalibacterium</i>) were significantly enriched in the meditation group. Functional predictive analysis further showed that several pathways-including glycan biosynthesis, metabolism and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis-were significantly enriched in the meditation group. Moreover, plasma levels of clinical risk factors were significantly decreased in the meditation group, including total cholesterol and apolipoprotein B.Long-term traditional Tibetan Buddhist meditation may positively impact physical and mental health. We confirmed that the gut microbiota composition differed between the monks and control subjects. The microbiota enriched in monks was associated with a reduced risk of anxiety, depression and cardiovascular disease and could enhance immune function. Overall, these results suggest that meditation plays a positive role in psychosomatic conditions and well-being.",General psychiatry,2023,Ying Sun; Peijun Ju; Ting Xue; Usman Ali; Donghong Cui; Jinghong Chen
37664615,Biglycan regulated colorectal cancer progress by modulating enteric neuron-derived IL-10 and abundance of <i>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</i>.,"Biglycan (BGN) is a proteoglycan with branch chains and highly expressed in enteric neurons in the tumor tissue of colorectal cancer (CRC), which is negatively associated with survival rates in patients with CRC. However, how the proteoglycan promotes the progress of CRC through interacting with bacteria and regulating the immune response of enteric neurons remains largely unknown. In the present study, we found that biglycan deficiency changed tumor distribution in a colitis-associated colon cancer model. Furthermore, we revealed that BGN deficiency inhibits tumor growth in an allograft tumor model and the migration of cancer cell by upregulating interleukin-10 expression in enteric neurons. Significantly, we demonstrated that biglycan deficiency enriched the abundance of <i>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</i> through competing with it for chondroitin sulfate to inhibit CRC progress. Our work provided new insights into the interaction between host proteoglycan and gut microbiota as well as the role of enteric neurons in the tumor microenvironment.",iScience,2023,Yuyu Xu; Fei Wang; Kai Mi; Xinyuan Wang; Danlei Wang; Qing Zhao; Jingjing Wang; Zhi Liu; Qingqing Zhang; Yang Liu; Xuemei Zhang; Xingyin Liu
37023596,Different roles of microbiota and genetics in the prediction of treatment response in major depressive disorder.,"The roles of gut microbiota and susceptibility genes in patients with major depression disorder (MDD) are not well understood. Examining the microbiome and host genetics might be helpful for clinical decision-making. Patients with MDD were recruited in this study and subsequently treated for eight weeks. We identified the differences between the population with a response after two weeks and those with a response after eight weeks. The factors that were significantly correlated with efficacy were used to predict the treatment response. The differences in the importance of microbiota and genetics in prediction were analyzed. Our study identified rs58010457 as a potentially key locus affecting the treatment effect. Different microbiota and enriched pathways might play different roles in the response after two and eight weeks. We found that the area under the curve (AUC) value was greater than 0.8 for both random forest models. The contribution of different components to the AUC was evaluated by removing genetic information, microbiota abundance, and pathway data. The gut microbiome was an important predictor of the response after eight weeks, while genetics was an important predictor of the response after two weeks. These results suggested a dynamic effect of interaction among genetics and gut microbes on treatment. Furthermore, these results provide new guidance for clinical decisions: in cases of inadequate treatment effects after two weeks, the composition of the intestinal flora can be improved by diet therapy, which could ultimately affect the efficacy.",Journal of psychiatric research,2023,Ke Han; Lei Ji; Qinglian Xie; Liangjie Liu; Xi Wu; Lin He; Yi Shi; Rong Zhang; Guang He; Zaiquan Dong; Tao Yu
37808915,Characterization of gut microbiota profile in Iranian patients with bipolar disorder compared to healthy controls.,"The human gut microbiota plays a crucial role in mental health through the gut-brain axis, impacting central nervous system functions, behavior, mood, and anxiety. Consequently, it is implicated in the development of neuropsychiatric disorders. This study aimed to assess and compare the gut microbiota profiles and populations of individuals with bipolar disorder and healthy individuals in Iran.Fecal samples were collected from 60 participants, including 30 bipolar patients (BPs) and 30 healthy controls (HCs), following rigorous entry criteria. Real-time quantitative PCR was utilized to evaluate the abundance of 10 bacterial genera/species and five bacterial phyla.Notably, <i>Actinobacteria</i> and <i>Lactobacillus</i> exhibited the greatest fold change in BPs compared to HCs at the phylum and genus level, respectively, among the bacteria with significant population differences. <i>Ruminococcus</i> emerged as the most abundant genus in both groups, while <i>Proteobacteria</i> and <i>Bacteroidetes</i> showed the highest abundance in BPs and HCs, respectively, at the phylum level. Importantly, our investigation revealed a lower <i>Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes</i> ratio, potentially serving as a health indicator, in HCs compared to BPs.This study marks the first examination of an Iranian population and provides compelling evidence of significant differences in gut microbiota composition between BPs and HCs, suggesting a potential link between brain functions and the gut microbial profile and population.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2023,Nassir Rashnaei; Abbas Akhavan Sepahi; Seyed Davar Siadat; Esmaeil Shahsavand-Ananloo; Golnaz Bahramali
37951975,"Effect of inulin supplementation on clinical symptoms, inflammatory and oxidative stress markers in women with migraine: study protocol for a randomized clinical trial.","Migraine is a complex, chronic, and debilitating multifactorial disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of headache and related symptoms. It typically begins in early ages and is more prevalent in women than in men. Recently, the gut-brain axis has emerged as a new candidate that may be linked to neurological diseases. We hypothesize that selective modulation of the intestinal microbiota, oxidative stress, and inflammation through inulin supplementation may improve clinical outcomes in these patients. Therefore, this study aims to examine the effects of high-performance inulin supplementation on clinical symptoms, mental health, quality of life (QOL), intestinal permeability, and inflammatory and oxidative stress factors in women with migraine.This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial involving 80 women with migraine who meet the inclusion criteria (aged between 20 and 50 years with a diagnosis of migraine by a neurologist based on the ICDH-3). Participants will be assigned to receive a daily dose of 10 g of inulin for 12 weeks (intervention group, nâ=â40) or 10 g of maltodextrin as a placebo for the same duration (control group, nâ=â40). The primary outcome will measure the variations in the frequency of headache experienced by the patients. Secondary outcomes will encompass serum levels of zonulin, high-sensitive C-reactive protein, total antioxidant capacity, total oxidant status, nitric oxide, mental status, QOL, duration, and severity of migraine attacks.This clinical trial aims to evaluate the effect of inulin supplementation on inflammatory status, oxidative stress, intestinal permeability, clinical symptoms, mental health, and QOL in women with migraine. The findings of this trial could contribute to the identification of mechanistic action and evidence-based clinical guidelines that address gut microbiota manipulation to maximize health benefits in the management of clinical outcomes in migraine patients.Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials ( www.irct.ir ) (ID: IRCT20121216011763N58).

38222911,The functional roles of short chain fatty acids as postbiotics in human gut: future perspectives.,"The significance of gut microbiome and their metabolites (postbiotics) on human health could be a promising approach to treat various diseases that includes inflammatory bowel diseases, colon cancer, and many neurological disorders. Probiotics with potential mental health benefits (psychobiotics) can alter the gut-brain axis via immunological, humoral, neuronal, and metabolic pathways. Recently, probiotic bacteria like <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Bifidobacterium</i> have been demonstrated for SCFAs production, which play a crucial role in a variety of diseases. These acids could enhance the production of mucins, antimicrobial proteins (bacteriocins and peptides), cytokines (Interleukin 10 and 18) and neurotransmitters (serotonin) in the intestine to main the gut microbiota, intestinal barrier system and other immune functions. In this review, we discuss about two mechanisms such as (i) SCFAs mediated intestinal barrier system, and (ii) SCFAs mediated gut-brain axis to elucidate the therapeutic options for the treatment/prevention of various diseases.",Food science and biotechnology,2024,Mangala Lakshmi Ragavan; S Hemalatha
37624502,The association between greenery type and gut microbiome in schizophrenia: did all greenspaces play the equivalent role?,"In recent years, attention has been focused on the benefit of greenspace on mental health, and it is suggested this link may vary with the type of greenspace. More and more studies have emphasized the influence of the gut microbiome on schizophrenia (SCZ). However, the effects of greenspaces on the gut microbiota in SCZ and the effect of different types of greenspaces on the gut microbiota remain unclear. We aim to examine if there were variations in the effects of various greenspace types on the gut microbiome in SCZ. Besides, we sink to explore important taxonomic compositions associated with different greenspace types. We recruited 243 objects with schizophrenia from Anhui Mental Health Center and collected fecal samples for 16Sr RNA gene sequencing. Three types of greenery coverage were calculated with different circular buffers (800, 1500, and 3000Â m) corresponding to individual addresses. The association between greenspace and microbiome composition was analyzed with permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA). We conducted the linear regression to capture specific gut microbiome taxa associated with greenery coverage. Tree coverage was consistently associated with microbial composition in both 1500Â m (R<sup>2</sup>â=â0.007, Pâ=â0.030) and 3000Â m (R<sup>2</sup>â=â0.007, Pâ=â0.039). In contrast, there was no association with grass cover in any of the buffer zones. In the regression analysis, higher tree coverage was significantly correlated with the relative abundance of several taxa. Among them, tree coverage was positively associated with increased Bifidobacterium longum (Î²â=â1.069, Pâ=â0.004), which was the dominant composition in the gut microbiota. The relationship between greenspace and gut microbiome in SCZ differed by the type of greenspace. Besides, ""tree coverage"" may present a dominant effect on the important taxonomic composition. Our findings might provide instructive evidence for the design of urban greenspace to optimize health and well-being in SCZ as well as the whole people.",Environmental science and pollution research international,2023,Ning Wei; Shusi Wang; Xuanxuan Li; Rubing Pan; Weizhuo Yi; Jian Song; Li Liu; Jintao Liu; Jiajun Yuan; Rong Song; Jian Cheng; Hong Su

37954149,Reproducible microbiome composition signatures of anxiety and depressive symptoms.,"The gut microbiome is a significant contributor to mental health, with growing evidence linking its composition to anxiety and depressive disorders. Gut microbiome composition is associated with signs of anxiety and depression both in clinically diagnosed mood disorders and subclinically in the general population and may be influenced by dietary fibre intake and the presence of chronic pain. We provide an update of current evidence on the role of gut microbiome composition in depressive and anxiety disorders or symptoms by reviewing available studies. Analysing data from three independent cohorts (osteoarthritis 1 (OA1); nÂ =Â 46, osteoarthritis 2 (OA2); nÂ =Â 58, and healthy controls (CON); nÂ =Â 67), we identified microbial composition signatures of anxiety and depressive symptoms at genus level and cross-validated our findings performing meta-analyses of our results with results from previously published studies. The genera <i>Bifidobacterium</i> (fixed-effect beta (95% CI) =Â -0.22 (-0.34, -0.10), pÂ =Â 3.90e-04) and <i>Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group</i> (fixed-effect beta (95% CI) =Â -0.09 (-0.13, -0.05), pÂ =Â 2.53e-06) were found to be the best predictors of anxiety and depressive symptoms, respectively, across our three cohorts and published literature taking into account demographic and lifestyle covariates, such as fibre intake. The association with anxiety was robust in accounting for heterogeneity between cohorts and supports previous observations of the potential prophylactic effect of <i>Bifidobacterium</i> against anxiety symptoms.",Computational and structural biotechnology journal,2023,Afroditi Kouraki; Anthony Kelly; Amrita Vijay; Sameer Gohir; Stuart Astbury; Vasileios Georgopoulos; Bonnie Millar; David Andrew Walsh; Eamonn Ferguson; Cristina Menni; Ana M Valdes
37794974,A personalized diet intervention improves depression symptoms and changes microbiota and metabolite profiles among community-dwelling older adults.,"The impact of diet on mental well-being and gut microorganisms in humans is well recognized. However, research on the connections between food nutrients, gut microbiota, and mental health remains limited. To address this, the present study aimed to assess the effects of a personalized diet, based on individual needs and aligned with the Mediterranean diet principles, on depression symptoms, quality of life, nutritional intake, and gut microbiota changes among older adults living in the community.The intervention involved regular visits from a registered dietitian, who provided tailored dietary recommendations. During the 6-month study, participants completed questionnaires to evaluate their depression levels, quality of life, and dietary habits. Additionally, they provided stool samples for analysis of gut microbiota and metabolites.The results demonstrated that the personalized dietary intervention reduced depression symptoms and improved the quality of life among older adults. Furthermore, significant changes in the intake of certain nutrients, such as folate, lutein, zeaxanthin, EPA, and DHA, were observed following the intervention. Moreover, the intervention was associated with increased diversity in the gut microbiome and reduced total short-chain fatty acids, the main metabolites produced by gut microorganisms. The study also revealed correlations between food nutrients, gut microbiota, and mental health parameters.In conclusion, this research highlights the potential advantages of personalized dietary interventions in managing depression and enhancing overall well-being among older populations. It also sheds light on the role of gut microbiota and its metabolites in these effects. The findings offer valuable insights into the significance of nutrition and gut health for mental well-being in older adults.",Frontiers in nutrition,2023,Faiga Magzal; Silvia Turroni; Marco Fabbrini; Monica Barone; Adi Vitman Schorr; Ariella Ofran; Snait Tamir
37213508,Global research trends and focus on the link between colorectal cancer and gut flora: a bibliometric analysis from 2001 to 2021.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a highly prevalent cancer, and the global healthcare system bears a significant burden due to its incidence. Modulating the gut microbiota is a promising approach to enhance the efficacy of CRC treatment and reduce its adverse effects. The causal relationship between specific microorganisms' presence and CRC development has been widely validated. However, few studies have investigated this relationship using bibliometric methods. Therefore, this study analyzed the research hotspots and trends in human gut microbiology and CRC over the last two decades from a bibliometric perspective. The study aims to provide novel insights into basic and clinical research in this field.The articles and reviews on gut microbiota in CRC were obtained from the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC) on November 2, 2022. CiteSpace and VOSviewer were used to conduct the bibliometric and knowledge-map analysis.A total of 2,707 publications were obtained, with a rapid increase in the number of publications since 2015. The United States and China are the main contributors in this field and have established a network of partnerships in several countries. 414 academic journals have published articles on this topic. The author with the highest number of publications is Jun Yu from the Chinese University of Hong Kong. In addition to ""intestinal flora"" and ""colorectal cancer,"" high frequency terms in the keyword co-occurrence network analysis included inflammatory bowel disease, <i>Fusobacterium nucleatum</i>, inflammation, long-chain fatty acids, ulcerative colitis, bile acids, and resistant starch. Analysis of keyword trends using burst testing revealed that biomarkers, abnormal crypt foci, bifidobacteria, Î²-glucuronidase, short-chain fatty acids, bile acids, and DNA methylation are at the forefront of research in this area.The findings of this study provide a bibliometric analysis and visualization of the key research areas in gut microbiota and CRC over the past 20âyears. The results suggest that the role of gut microbiota in CRC and its underlying mechanisms should be closely monitored, particularly in the areas of biomarkers, metabolic pathways, and DNA methylation, which may emerge as hot topics in this field.",Frontiers in microbiology,2023,Yonglong Chang; Qinling Ou; Xuhui Zhou; Jinhui Liu; Sifang Zhang
36877601,The role of vitamin D in depression and anxiety disorders: a review of the literature.,"Prevalence of mental health disorders continue to increase worldwide. Over the past decades, suboptimal vitamin D (VD) levels and gut dysbiosis have been associated with neurological dysfunction and psychiatric disorders.In this review, we examined the available literature on VD and mental health disorders, particularly depression and anxiety, in both clinical and pre-clinical studies.Our extensive review failed to find a link between VD deficiency, depression, and anxiety-related behavior in preclinical animal models. However, strong evidence suggests that VD supplementation may alleviate symptoms in chronically stressed rodents, with some promising evidence from clinical studies. Further, fecal microbiota transplantations suggest a potential role of gut microbiota in neuropsychiatric disorders, although the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. It has been postulated that serotonin, primarily produced by gut bacteria, may be a crucial factor. Hence, whether VD has the ability to impact gut microbiota and modulate serotonin synthesis warrants further investigation.Taken together, literature has suggested that VD may serve as a key regulator in the gut-brain axis to modulate gut microbiota and alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety. The inconsistent results of VD supplementation in clinical studies, particularly among VD deficient participants, suggests that current intake recommendations may need to be re-evaluated for individuals at-risk (i.e. prior to diagnosis) of developing depression and/or anxiety.",Nutritional neuroscience,2024,Karisa Renteria; Hien Nguyen; Gar Yee Koh

37432210,"The Influence of Topinambur and Inulin Preventive Supplementation on Microbiota, Anxious Behavior, Cognitive Functions and Neurogenesis in Mice Exposed to the Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress.","Daily living and functioning under stress can lead to mental health problems such as anxiety or depression. Over the past decades, a number of studies have been conducted to determine the relationship between the central nervous system (CNS), intestinal flora and bidirectional communication along the gut brain axis (GBA) in the maintaining of homeostasis. One of the most important factors regulating GBA functioning in exposure to stress may be a proper diet enriched in the supplementation with pre-, pro-and synbiotics. In the present study, we examined whether a 10-week oral preventive supplementation with natural prebiotics: topinambur powder (TPB) and chicory root inulin (INU) influenced an anxiety, depressive behavior and cognition in mice exposed to the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). Additionally, a fluoxetine (FLU) has been used as a reference antidepressive drug. Furthermore, we assessed the effect of TPB, INU and FLU administration on neurogenesis in mice exposed to CUMS and finally analyzed fecal microbiota for possible changes after TPB and INU supplementation in CUMS induced mice. Results obtained from the behavioral studies (elevated plaze maze, forced swim and Morris water maze test) indicated, that 10 week supplementation with TPB (250 mg/kg) and INU (66 mg/kg), similarly to FLU (12 mg/kg), significantly mitigated an anxiety and stress as well as protected learning and memory functions in the CUMS induced mice compared to the control stressed group. Additionally, TPB and INU CUMS mice showed significantly higher level of neurogenesis in comparison to control CUMS group. Interestingly, results obtained from the fecal microbiota analysis showed a beneficial effect of TPB and INU supplementation against CUMS-induced intestinal dysbiosis in mice. In conclusion, the obtained results showed that a long-term, preventive supplementation with TPB or INU alleviates the negative effects such as anxiety, cognitive disorders or dysbiosis in mice exposed to chronic unpredictable stress.",Nutrients,2023,Joanna Szala-Rycaj; Aleksandra Szewczyk; MirosÅaw Zagaja; Agnieszka Kaczmarczyk-Ziemba; Maciej Maj; Marta Andres-Mach
37574818,Ameliorative effect of Lactobacillus plantarum CCFM8661 on oleic acid-induced acne: integrated gut microbiota link to acne pathogenesis.,"Acne vulgaris is an inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous unit of the skin that has serious adverse effects on the physical and mental health of patients. Probiotics are extensively employed in dermatology and could be an alternative option for acne therapy. Here, we evaluated the effect of oral ingestion of live and inactivated Lactobacillus plantarum CCFM8661 on oleic acid-induced acne using a mouse model.Results indicated that live L. plantarum CCFM8661 suppressed skin inflammation and serum hormone (insulin and testosterone) production in acne mice. Parallelly, live L. plantarum CCFM8661 effectively reduced the formation of skin lipids (triglycerides and non-esterified free fatty acids), and normalized the expression of skin lipid metabolism-related genes (PPAR-Î³, SREBP-1c, ACCÎ±, FASN, PPAR-Î±, ACOX1, HSL and ATGL). In comparison, inactivated L. plantarum CCFM8661 had no effect on skin inflammation or serum hormone secretion, but decreased skin triglycerides and normalized the expression of skin lipid metabolism-related genes (PPAR-Î³, SREBP-1c, FASN and ATGL) in acne mice. Both live and inactivated L. plantarum CCFM8661 raised the richness of gut microbiota, reduced the ratio of Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes and decreased the relative abundance of Staphylococcus in the feces of acne mice.Oral ingestion of L. plantarum CCFM8661, particularly live cells, could alleviate acne by suppressing skin inflammation, normalizing the metabolism of hormones and skin lipids, which may be achieved by improving the gut microbial ecosystem.

36801431,"Proton Pump Inhibitor Use, Fatigue, and Health-Related Quality of Life in Kidney Transplant Recipients: Results From the TransplantLines Biobank and Cohort Study.","Prior studies report that the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) can adversely affect gut microbiota and gastrointestinal uptake of micronutrients, in particular iron and magnesium, and are used frequently by kidney transplant recipients. Altered gut microbiota, iron deficiency, and magnesium deficiency have been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic fatigue. Therefore, we hypothesized that PPI use may be an important and underappreciated cause of fatigue and reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in this population.Cross-sectional study.Kidney transplant recipients (â¥1 year after transplantation) enrolled in the TransplantLines Biobank and Cohort Study.PPI use, PPI type, PPI dosage, and duration of PPI use.Fatigue and HRQoL, assessed using the validated Checklist Individual Strength 20 Revised questionnaire and Short Form-36 questionnaire.Logistic and linear regression.We included 937 kidney transplant recipients (mean age 56Â±13 years, 39% female) at a median of 3 (1-10) years after transplantation. PPI use was associated with fatigue severity (regression coefficient 4.02, 95% CI, 2.18 to 5.85, P<0.001), a higher risk of severe fatigue (OR 2.05, 95% CI, 1.48 to 2.84, P<0.001), lower physical HRQoL (regression coefficient-8.54, 95% CI,Â -11.54 to-5.54, P<0.001), and lower mental HRQoL (regression coefficient-4.66, 95% CI,Â -7.15 to-2.17, P<0.001). These associations were independent of potential confounders including age, time since transplantation, history of upper gastrointestinal disease, antiplatelet therapy, and the total number of medications. They were present among all individually assessed PPI types and were dose dependent. Duration of PPI exposure was only associated with fatigue severity.Residual confounding and inability to assess causal relationships.PPI use is independently associated with fatigue and lower HRQoL among kidney transplant recipients. PPI use might be an easily accessible target for alleviating fatigue and improving HRQoL among kidney transplant recipients. Further studies examining the effect of PPI exposure in this population are warranted.In this observational study, we investigated the association of proton pump inhibitors with fatigue and health-related quality of life among kidney transplant recipients. Our data showed that proton pump inhibitors were independently associated with fatigue severity, severe fatigue, and lower physical and mental health-related quality of life. These associations were present among all individually assessed proton pump inhibitor types and were dose dependent.

35711028,The Immune System and Depression: From Epidemiological to Clinical Evidence.,"Depression is a frequent mental disorder with a substantial contribution to years lived with disability worldwide. In the search for new treatment targets, the immune system's contribution to the pathogenesis of depression has received increased attention as immune activation has been associated with depression in various epidemiological and case-control studies. Epidemiological studies have shown that immune exposures such as severe infections and autoimmune disorders increase the risk of depression. Furthermore, immune system activation has been indicated in case-control studies of depression revealing higher levels of key pro-inflammatory cytokines among patients with depression than healthy controls, particularly in blood and to some extent in the cerebrospinal fluid. Moreover, brain imaging studies indicate increased microglial activity during depression, and gut microbiota studies have documented alterations of gut microbiota composition to be associated with depression. Based on findings from animal and human studies, several immune-mediated molecular mechanisms have been suggested to underlie the association between increased immunological activity and depression. However, the research is challenged by the heterogeneity of the depression diagnosis and - to some extent - the precision of currently available technology for immune biomarker quantification, particularly regarding the assessment of low-grade neuroinflammation. Nonetheless, an enhanced understanding of the complex interactions between the immune system and the brain in the context of depression could pave the way for precision medicine approaches with immune-modulating treatment as a promising additional option in the treatment of depression.",Current topics in behavioral neurosciences,2023,Nina Vindegaard SÃ¸rensen; Michael Eriksen Benros
36937822,Bone fragility during the COVID-19 pandemic: the role of macro- and micronutrients.,"Bone fragility is the susceptibility to fracture due to poor bone strength. This condition is usually associated with aging, comorbidities, disability, poor quality of life, and increased mortality. International guidelines for the management of patients with bone fragility include a nutritional approach, mainly aiming at optimal protein, calcium, and vitamin D intakes. Several biomechanical features of the skeleton, such as bone mineral density (BMD), trabecular and cortical microarchitecture, seem to be positively influenced by micro- and macronutrient intake. Patients with major fragility fractures are usually poor consumers of dairy products, fruit, and vegetables as well as of nutrients modulating gut microbiota. The COVID-19 pandemic has further aggravated the health status of patients with skeletal fragility, also in terms of unhealthy dietary patterns that might adversely affect bone health. In this narrative review, we discuss the role of macro- and micronutrients in patients with bone fragility during the COVID-19 pandemic.",Therapeutic advances in musculoskeletal disease,2023,Antimo Moretti; Sara Liguori; Marco Paoletta; Silvia Migliaccio; Giuseppe Toro; Francesca Gimigliano; Giovanni Iolascon
37156128,Comparison of gut microbiome profile in patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls - A plausible non-invasive biomarker?,"The human gut microbiome regulates brain function through the microbiome-gut-brain axis and is implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the relationship between the gut microbiome and the pathogenesis of schizophrenia (SCZ) is poorly defined, and very few studies have examined the effect of antipsychotic treatment response. We aim to study the differences in the gut microbiota among drug-naÃ¯ve (DN SCZ) and risperidone-treated SCZ patients (RISP SCZ), compared to healthy controls (HCs). We recruited a total of 60 participants, from the clinical services of a large neuropsychiatric hospital, which included DN SCZ, RISP SCZ and HCs (nÂ =Â 20 each). Fecal samples were analyzed using 16s rRNA sequencing in this cross-sectional study. No significant differences were found in taxa richness (alpha diversity) but microbial composition differed between SCZ patients (both DN and RISP) and HCs (PERMANOVA, pÂ =Â 0.02). Linear Discriminant Analysis Effect Size (LEfSe) and Random Forest model identified the top six genera, which significantly differed in abundance between the study groups. A specific genus-level microbial panel of Ruminococcus, UCG005, Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 and Bifidobacterium could discriminate SCZ patients from HCs with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.79, HCs vs DN SCZ (AUC: 0.68), HCs vs RISP SCZ (AUC: 0.93) and DN SCZ vs RISP SCZ (AUC: 0.87). Our study identified distinct microbial signatures that could aid in the differentiation of DN SCZ, RISP SCZ, and HCs. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the role of the gut microbiome in SCZ pathophysiology and suggest potential targeted interventions.",Journal of psychiatric research,2023,Kuppan Gokulakrishnan; Joyappa Nikhil; Biju Viswanath; Chinnasamy Thirumoorthy; Sandhya Narasimhan; Bharanidharan Devarajan; Ebin Joseph; Arul Kevin Daniel David; Sapna Sharma; Kavitha Vasudevan; Vanteemar S Sreeraj; Bharath Holla; Venkataram Shivakumar; Monojit Debnath; Ganesan Venkatasubramanian; Shivarama Varambally
36693863,Data-independent acquisition boosts quantitative metaproteomics for deep characterization of gut microbiota.,"Metaproteomics can provide valuable insights into the functions of human gut microbiota (GM), but is challenging due to the extreme complexity and heterogeneity of GM. Data-independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry (MS) has been an emerging quantitative technique in conventional proteomics, but is still at the early stage of development in the field of metaproteomics. Herein, we applied library-free DIA (directDIA)-based metaproteomics and compared the directDIA with other MS-based quantification techniques for metaproteomics on simulated microbial communities and feces samples spiked with bacteria with known ratios, demonstrating the superior performance of directDIA by a comprehensive consideration of proteome coverage in identification as well as accuracy and precision in quantification. We characterized human GM in two cohorts of clinical fecal samples of pancreatic cancer (PC) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). About 70,000 microbial proteins were quantified in each cohort and annotated to profile the taxonomic and functional characteristics of GM in different diseases. Our work demonstrated the utility of directDIA in quantitative metaproteomics for investigating intestinal microbiota and its related disease pathogenesis.",NPJ biofilms and microbiomes,2023,Jinzhi Zhao; Yi Yang; Hua Xu; Jianxujie Zheng; Chengpin Shen; Tian Chen; Tao Wang; Bing Wang; Jia Yi; Dan Zhao; Enhui Wu; Qin Qin; Li Xia; Liang Qiao
37956855,"Role of the gut-brain axis via the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve in stress resilience of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine in mice exposed to chronic restrain stress.","3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is the most widely used illicit substance worldwide. Nevertheless, recent observational studies demonstrated that lifetime MDMA use among U.S. adults was associated with a lower risk of depression and suicide thoughts. We recently reported that the gut-brain axis may contribute to MDMA-induced stress resilience in mice. To further explore this, we investigated the effects of subdiaphragmatic vagotomy (SDV) in modulating the stress resilience effects of MDMA in mice subjected to chronic restrain stress (CRS). Pretreatment with MDMA (10Â mg/kg/day for 14Â days) blocked anhedonia-like behavior and reduced expression of synaptic proteins and brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of CRS-exposed mice. Interestingly, SDV blocked the beneficial effects of MDMA on these alterations in CRS-exposed mice. Analysis of gut microbiome revealed alterations in four measures of Î±-diversity between the sham + MDMA + CRS group and the SDVÂ +Â MDMA + CRS group. Moreover, specific microbes differed between the vehicle + CRS group and the MDMA + CRS group, and further differences in microbial composition were observed among all four groups. Untargeted metabolomics analysis showed that SDV prevented the increase in plasma levels of three compounds [lactic acid, 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2,2,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidinol, 8-acetyl-7-hydroxyvumaline] observed in the sham + MDMA + CRS group. Interestingly, positive correlations were found between the plasma levels of two of these compounds and the abundance of several microbes across all groups. In conclusion, our data suggest that the gut-brain axis via the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve might contribute to the stress resilience of MDMA.",Neurobiology of disease,2023,Youge Qu; Akifumi Eguchi; Li Ma; Xiayun Wan; Chisato Mori; Kenji Hashimoto
37995475,Guardians of Rest? Investigating the gut microbiota in central hypersomnolence disorders.,"In recent years, there has been an increased interest in elucidating the influence of the gut microbiota on sleep physiology. The gut microbiota affects the central nervous system by modulating neuronal pathways through the neuroendocrine and immune system, the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, and various metabolic pathways. The gut microbiota can also influence circadian rhythms. In this study, we observed the gut microbiota composition of patients suffering from narcolepsy type 1, narcolepsy type 2, and idiopathic hypersomnia. We did not observe any changes in the alpha diversity of the gut microbiota among patient groups and healthy controls. We observed changes in beta diversity in accordance with Jaccard dissimilarities between the control group and groups of patients suffering from narcolepsy type 1 and idiopathic hypersomnia. Our results indicate that both these patient groups differ from controls relative to the presence of rare bacterial taxa. However, after adjustment for various confounding factors such as BMI, age, and gender, there were no statistical differences among the groups. This indicates that the divergence in beta diversity in the narcolepsy type 1 and idiopathic hypersomnia groups did not arise due to sleep disturbances. This study implies that using metabolomics and proteomics approaches to study the role of microbiota in sleep disorders might prove beneficial.",Sleep medicine,2024,Janet Jezkova; Karel Sonka; Jakub Kreisinger; Petra Prochazkova; Helena Tlaskalova-Hogenova; Sona Nevsimalova; Jitka Buskova; Radana Merkova; Tereza Dvorakova; Iva Prihodova; Simona Dostalova; Radka Roubalova
37377497,Insights into the potential benefits of triphala polyphenols toward the promotion of resilience against stress-induced depression and cognitive impairment.,"In response to environmental challenges, stress is a common reaction, but dysregulation of the stress response can lead to neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression and cognitive impairment. Particularly, there is ample evidence that overexposure to mental stress can have lasting detrimental consequences for psychological health, cognitive function, and ultimately well-being. In fact, some individuals are resilient to the same stressor. A major benefit of enhancing stress resilience in at-risk groups is that it may help prevent the onset of stress-induced mental health problems. A potential therapeutic strategy for maintaining a healthy life is to address stress-induced health problems with botanicals or dietary supplements such as polyphenols. Triphala, also known as Zhe Busong decoction in Tibetan, is a well-recognized <i>Ayurvedic</i> polyherbal medicine comprising dried fruits from three different plant species. As a promising food-sourced phytotherapy, triphala polyphenols have been used throughout history to treat a variety of medical conditions, including brain health maintenance. Nevertheless, a comprehensive review is still lacking. Here, the primary objective of this review article is to provide an overview of the classification, safety, and pharmacokinetics of triphala polyphenols, as well as recommendations for the development of triphala polyphenols as a novel therapeutic strategy for promoting resilience in susceptible individuals. Additionally, we summarize recent advances demonstrating that triphala polyphenols are beneficial to cognitive and psychological resilience by regulating 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) receptors, gut microbiota, and antioxidant-related signaling pathways. Overall, scientific exploration of triphala polyphenols is warranted to understand their therapeutic efficacy. In addition to providing novel insights into the mechanisms of triphala polyphenols for promoting stress resilience, blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability and systemic bioavailability of triphala polyphenols also need to be improved by the research community. Moreover, well-designed clinical trials are needed to increase the scientific validity of triphala polyphenols' beneficial effects for preventing and treating cognitive impairment and psychological dysfunction.",Current research in food science,2023,Wenjun Wang; Olufola Oladoyin Ige; Yi Ding; Mengshan He; Pan Long; Shaohui Wang; Yi Zhang; Xudong Wen
36624505,Safety and feasibility of faecal microbiota transplant for major depressive disorder: study protocol for a pilot randomised controlled trial.,"Mental disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD), are a leading cause of non-fatal burden of disease globally. Current conventional treatments for depression have significant limitations, and there have been few new treatments in decades. The microbiota-gut-brain-axis is now recognised as playing a role in mental and brain health, and promising preclinical and clinical data suggest Faecal Microbiota Transplants (FMT) may be efficacious for treating a range of mental illnesses. However, there are no existing published studies in humans evaluating the efficacy of FMT for MDD.This protocol describes an 8-week, triple-blind, 2:1 parallel group, randomised controlled pilot trial (n = 15), of enema-delivered FMT treatment (n = 10) compared with a placebo enema (n = 5) in adults with moderate-to-severe MDD. There will be a further 26-week follow-up to monitor longer-term safety. Participants will receive four FMT or placebo enemas over four consecutive days. The primary aims of the study are to evaluate feasibility and safety of FMT as an adjunctive treatment for MDD in adults. Changes in gut microbiota will be assessed as a secondary outcome. Other data will be collected, including changes in depression and anxiety symptoms, and safety parameters.Modification of the microbiota-gut-brain axis via FMT is a promising potential treatment for MDD, but there are no published rigorous clinical trials evaluating its use. If this study finds that our FMT strategy is safe and feasible, a larger fully powered RCT is planned. Further high-quality research in this field is urgently needed to address unmet need.Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN12621000932864.",Pilot and feasibility studies,2023,Jessica E Green; Amelia J McGuinness; Michael Berk; David Castle; Eugene Athan; Christopher Hair; Philip Strandwitz; Amy Loughman; Andrew A Nierenberg; John F Cryan; Mohammadreza Mohebbi; Felice Jacka
36881113,Mesenchymal stem-cell-derived microvesicles ameliorate MPTP-induced neurotoxicity in mice: a role of the gut-microbiota-brain axis.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Increasing evidence suggests the role of the gut-microbiota-brain axis in the pathogenesis of PD. Mesenchymal stem-cell-derived microvesicles (MSC-MVs) have emerged as a therapeutic potential for neurological disorders over the last years.The objective of this study was to investigate whether MSC-MVs could improve PD-like neurotoxicity in mice after administration of MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine).MPTP-induced reductions in the dopamine transporter and tyrosine hydroxylase expressions in the striatum and substantia nigra (SNr) were attenuated after a subsequent single administration of MSC-MVs. Increases in the phosphorylated Î±-synuclein (p-Î±-Syn)/Î±-Syn ratio in the striatum, SNr, and colon after MPTP injection were also attenuated after MSC-MVs injection. Furthermore, MSC-MVs restored MPTP-induced abnormalities of the gut microbiota composition. Interestingly, positive correlations between the genus Dubosiella and the p-Î±-Syn/Î±-Syn ratio were observed in the brain and colon, suggesting their roles in the gut-microbiota-brain communication. Moreover, MSC-MVs attenuated MPTP-induced reduction of the metabolite, 3,6-dihydroxy-2-[3-methoxy-4-(sulfooxy)phenyl]-7-(sulfinooxy)-3,4-dihydro-2H-1-benzopyran-5-olate, in the blood. Interestingly, a negative correlation between this compound and the p-Î±-Syn/Î±-Syn ratio was observed in the brain and colon.These data suggest that MSC-MVs could ameliorate MPTP-induced neurotoxicity in the brain and colon via the gut-microbiota-brain axis. Therefore, MSC-MVs would have a new therapeutic potential for neurological disorders such as PD.",Psychopharmacology,2023,Yaoyu Pu; Qiuhong Wu; Qiuping Zhang; Tianwen Huang; Ji Wen; Long Wei; Kenji Hashimoto; Yi Liu

36871911,The effect of exercise on suicidal ideation and behaviors: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Although exercise may positively impact those with mental or other medical illnesses, there is a lack of understanding on how it influences suicidal ideation or risk.We conducted a PRISMA 2020-compliant systematic review searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, and PsycINFO from inception to June 21, 2022. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating exercise and suicidal ideation in subjects with mental or physical conditions were included. Random-effects meta-analysis was conducted. The primary outcome was suicidal ideation. We assessed bias of studies with risk of bias 2 tool.We identified 17 RCTs encompassing 1021 participants. Depression was the most included condition (71Â %, kÂ =Â 12). Mean follow up was 10.0Â weeks (SDÂ =Â 5.2). Post-intervention suicidal ideation (SMDÂ =Â -1.09, CI -3.08-0.90, pÂ =Â 0.20, kÂ =Â 5) was not significantly different between exercise and control groups. Suicide attempts were significantly reduced in participants randomized to exercise interventions as compared to inactive controls (ORÂ =Â 0.23, CI 0.09-0.67, pÂ =Â 0.04, kÂ =Â 2). Fourteen studies (82Â %) were at high risk of bias.This meta-analysis is limited by few, underpowered and heterogenous studies.Overall, our meta-analysis did not find a significant decrease in suicidal ideation or mortality between exercise and control groups. However, exercise did significantly decrease suicide attempts. Results should be considered preliminary, and more and larger studies assessing suicidality in RCTs testing exercise are needed.",Journal of affective disorders,2023,Nicholas Fabiano; Arnav Gupta; Jess G Fiedorowicz; Joseph Firth; Brendon Stubbs; Davy Vancampfort; Felipe B Schuch; Lucas J Carr; Marco Solmi

37354486,Blood-borne extracellular vesicles of bacteria and intestinal cells in patients with psychotic disorders.,"Human cells and bacteria secrete extracellular vesicles (EV) which play a role in intercellular communication. EV from the host intestinal epithelium are involved in the regulation of bacterial gene expression and growth. Bacterial EV (bactEV) produced in the intestine can pass to various tissues where they deliver biomolecules to many kinds of cells, including neurons. Emerging data indicate that gut microbiota is altered in patients with psychotic disorders. We hypothesized that the amount and content of blood-borne EV from intestinal cells and bactEV in psychotic patients would differ from healthy controls.We analyzed for human intestinal proteins by proteomics, for bactEV by metaproteomic analysis, and by measuring the level of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in blood-borne EV from patients with psychotic disorders (<i>n</i>â=â25), tested twice, in the acute phase of psychosis and after improvement, with age- and sex-matched healthy controls (<i>n</i>â=â25).Patients with psychotic disorders had lower LPS levels in their EV compared to healthy controls (<i>p</i>â=â.027). Metaproteome analyses confirmed LPS finding and identified Firmicute<i>s</i> and Bacteroidetes as dominating phyla. Total amounts of human intestine proteins in EV isolated from blood was lower in patients compared to controls (<i>p</i>â=â.02).Our results suggest that bactEV and host intestinal EV are decreased in patients with psychosis and that this topic is worthy of further investigation given potential pathophysiological implications. Possible mechanisms involve dysregulation of the gut microbiota by host EV, altered translocation of bactEV to systemic circulation where bactEV can interact with both the brain and the immune system.",Nordic journal of psychiatry,2023,Mette Elise Tunset; Hanne Haslene-Hox; Tim Van Den Bossche; Susan Maleki; Arne Vaaler; Daniel Kondziella
37233680,Positive Effects of Probiotic Therapy in Patients with Post-Infectious Fatigue.,"Post-infectious fatigue is a common complication that can lead to decreased physical efficiency, depression, and impaired quality of life. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota has been proposed as a contributing factor, as the gut-brain axis plays an important role in regulating physical and mental health. This pilot study aimed to investigate the severity of fatigue and depression, as well as the quality of life of 70 patients with post-infectious fatigue who received a multi-strain probiotic preparation or placebo in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients completed questionnaires to assess their fatigue (fatigue severity scale (FSS)), mood (Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II)), and quality of life (short form-36 (SF-36)) at baseline and after 3 and 6 months of treatment. Routine laboratory parameters were also assessed, including immune-mediated changes in tryptophan and phenylalanine metabolism. The intervention was effective in improving fatigue, mood, and quality of life in both the probiotic and placebo groups, with greater improvements seen in the probiotic group. FSS and BDI-II scores declined significantly under treatment with both probiotics and placebo, but patients who received probiotics had significantly lower FSS (<i>p</i> < 0.001) and BDI-II (<i>p</i> < 0.001) scores after 6 months. Quality of life scores improved significantly in patients who received probiotics (<i>p</i> < 0.001), while patients taking a placebo only saw improvements in the ""Physical limitation"" and ""Energy/Fatigue"" subcategories. After 6 months neopterin was higher in patients receiving placebo, while no longitudinal changes in interferon-gamma mediated biochemical pathways were observed. These findings suggest that probiotics may be a promising intervention for improving the health of patients with post-infectious fatigue, potentially through modulating the gut-brain axis.",Metabolites,2023,Katharina Obermoser; Natascha Brigo; Andrea Schroll; Pablo Monfort-Lanzas; Johanna M Gostner; Sabine Engl; Simon Geisler; Miriam Knoll; Harald Schennach; GÃ¼nter Weiss; Dietmar Fuchs; Rosa Bellmann-Weiler; Katharina Kurz
36517709,Porphyra haitanensis Polysaccharides Attenuates Blood Lipid via Gut-Liver Axis in Diet-Induced High-Fat Mesocricetus auratus through Multiple Integrated Omics.,"Hyperlipidemia is currently a global public health problem severely affecting people's physical and mental health, as well as their quality of life.The present study is aimed at revealing the mechanism of Porphyra haitanensis polysaccharide (PHP) in decreasing blood lipids by acting through gut-liver axis in Mesocricetus auratus fed a high-fat diet. PHP significantly prevented increases in serum total cholesterol, triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and alleviated damage to liver cells induced by a high-fat diet M. auratus, in a dose-dependent manner. PHP promotes proliferation of Muribaculaceae and Faecalibaculum, thereby enhancing the production of butyric acid both in the colon and liver, particularly high-dose PHP (HPHP). Low-dose PHP (LPHP) promotes the expression of phosphatidylcholine metabolites and fatty acid transport genes, and inhibits the expression of genes involved in fat degradation (Abhd5), adipogenesis (Me1), fatty acid synthesis (Fasn and Pnpla3), and fatty acid chain elongation (Elovl6) in the liver. However, HPHP inhibits the expression of triglyceride metabolites and promotes the expression of fatty acid transporter (CD36), fatty acid oxidation (Acacb), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARg)Â genes in the liver.PHP regulates lipid metabolism through the gut microbiota, and the gut-liver axis plays an important role in its hypolipidemic effects.",Molecular nutrition & food research,2023,Hongliang Zeng; Peilin Chen; Zhiyun Wang; Xiaoke Hu; Yi Zhang; Baodong Zheng
36804535,Beneficial effects of arketamine on the reduced bone mineral density in susceptible mice after chronic social defeat stress: Role of the gut-microbiota-bone-brain axis.,"Patients with depression exhibit reduced bone mineral density (BMD). We previously reported that the new antidepressant arketamine improved the reduced BMD seen in chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) susceptible mice and ovariectomized mice. Considering the role of the gut microbiota in maintaining bone health, the current study investigated whether the gut microbiota, along with metabolites derived from the microbiome, play a role in the beneficial actions of arketamine with respect to the anhedonia-like behavior and reduced BMD seen in CSDS susceptible mice. A single administration of arketamine (10Â mg/kg) ameliorated anhedonia-like behavior and decreased femoral neck cortical (and total) BMD in CSDS susceptible mice. There was a negative correlation between anhedonia-like behavior and BMD. Furthermore, significant differences in the abundance of microbiota (and plasma metabolites) were found between the CSDSÂ +Â saline and CSDSÂ +Â arketamine groups. Correlations were observed between the abundance of certain microbiota (and plasma metabolites) and cortical (and total) BMD. These data suggest that, in addition to its anti-anhedonia effect, arketamine might ameliorate the reduced cortical (and total) BMD seen in CSDS susceptible mice through the gut-microbiota-bone-brain axis. Therefore, arketamine could serve as a drug therapy for depressed patients with low BMD.

37291666,A comprehensive look at the psychoneuroimmunoendocrinology of spinal cord injury and its progression: mechanisms and clinical opportunities.,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating and disabling medical condition generally caused by a traumatic event (primary injury). This initial trauma is accompanied by a set of biological mechanisms directed to ameliorate neural damage but also exacerbate initial damage (secondary injury). The alterations that occur in the spinal cord have not only local but also systemic consequences and virtually all organs and tissues of the body incur important changes after SCI, explaining the progression and detrimental consequences related to this condition. Psychoneuroimmunoendocrinology (PNIE) is a growing area of research aiming to integrate and explore the interactions among the different systems that compose the human organism, considering the mind and the body as a whole. The initial traumatic event and the consequent neurological disruption trigger immune, endocrine, and multisystem dysfunction, which in turn affect the patient's psyche and well-being. In the present review, we will explore the most important local and systemic consequences of SCI from a PNIE perspective, defining the changes occurring in each system and how all these mechanisms are interconnected.

36900437,Fermented Wheat Germ Alleviates Depression-like Behavior in Rats with Chronic and Unpredictable Mild Stress.,"Depression is a chronic mental illness with devastating effects on a person's physical and mental health. Studies have reported that food fermentation with probiotics can enrich the nutritional values of food and produce functional microorganisms that can alleviate depression and anxiety. Wheat germ is an inexpensive raw material that is rich in bioactive ingredients. For example, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is reported to have antidepressant effects. Several studies concluded that <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> is a GABA-producing bacteria and can alleviate depression. Herein, fermented wheat germs (FWGs) were used to treat stress-induced depression. FWG was prepared by fermenting wheat germs with <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i>. The chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model was established in rats, and these rats were treated with FWG for four weeks to evaluate the effects of FWG in relieving depression. In addition, the study also analyzed the potential anti-depressive mechanism of FWG based on behavioral changes, physiological and biochemical index changes, and intestinal flora changes in depressed rats. The results demonstrated that FWG improved depression-like behaviors and increased neurotransmitter levels in the hippocampus of CUMS model rats. In addition, FWG effectively altered the gut microbiota structure and remodeled the gut microbiota in CUMS rats, restored neurotransmitter levels in depressed rats through the brain-gut axis, and restored amino acid metabolic functions. In conclusion, we suggest that FWG has antidepressant effects, and its potential mechanism may act by restoring the disordered brain-gut axis.","Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,Zheyuan Hu; Penghui Zhao; Aimei Liao; Long Pan; Jie Zhang; Yuqi Dong; Jihong Huang; Weiwei He; Xingqi Ou
36462169,Elevated Systemic Levels of Markers Reflecting Intestinal Barrier Dysfunction and Inflammasome Activation Are Correlated in Severe Mental Illness.,"Gut microbiota alterations have been reported in severe mental illness (SMI) but fewer studies have probed for signs of gut barrier disruption and inflammation. We hypothesized that gut leakage of microbial products due to intestinal inflammation could contribute to systemic inflammasome activation in SMI.We measured plasma levels of the chemokine CCL25 and soluble mucosal vascular addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (sMAdCAM-1) as markers of T cell homing, adhesion and inflammation in the gut, lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) and intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) as markers of bacterial translocation and gut barrier dysfunction, in a large SMI cohort (n = 567) including schizophrenia (SCZ, n = 389) and affective disorder (AFF, n = 178), relative to healthy controls (HC, n = 418). We assessed associations with plasma IL-18 and IL-18BPa and leukocyte mRNA expression of NLRP3 and NLRC4 as markers of inflammasome activation.Our main findings were: (1) higher levels of sMAdCAM-1 (P = .002), I-FABP (P = 7.6E-11), CCL25 (P = 9.6E-05) and LBP (P = 2.6E-04) in SMI compared to HC in age, sex, BMI, CRP and freezer storage time adjusted analysis; (2) the highest levels of sMAdCAM-1 and CCL25 (both P = 2.6E-04) were observed in SCZ and I-FABP (P = 2.5E-10) and LBP (3) in AFF; and (3), I-FABP correlated with IL-18BPa levels and LBP correlated with NLRC4.Our findings support that intestinal barrier inflammation and dysfunction in SMI could contribute to systemic inflammation through inflammasome activation.",Schizophrenia bulletin,2023,SÃ¸ren B Jensen; Mashhood A Sheikh; Ibrahim A Akkouh; Attila Szabo; Kevin S O'Connell; Tove Lekva; John A Engh; Ingrid Agartz; TorbjÃ¸rn ElvsÃ¥shagen; Monica B E G Ormerod; Melissa A Weibell; Erik Johnsen; Rune A Kroken; Ingrid Melle; Ole K Drange; Terje NÃ¦rland; Arne E Vaaler; Lars T Westlye; PÃ¥l Aukrust; Srdjan Djurovic; Nils Eiel Steen; Ole A Andreassen; Thor Ueland

A genetic variant of the upstream regulatory region of the <i>SLC6A4</i> gene encoding SERT, the so-called short (s) allele, in comparison with the long (l) allele, results in the decreased function of this transporter, altered serotonergic regulation, an increased risk of psychiatric pathology and type-2 diabetes and obesity, especially in older women. Aged female mice with the complete (<i>Sert</i><sup>-/-</sup>: KO) or partial (<i>Sert</i><sup>+/-</sup>: HET) loss of SERT exhibit more pronounced negative effects following their exposure to a Western diet in comparison to wild-type (<i>Sert</i><sup>+/+</sup>: WT) animals. <b>Aims.</b> We hypothesized that these effects might be mediated by an altered gut microbiota, which has been shown to influence serotonin metabolism. We performed V4 16S rRNA sequencing of the gut microbiota in 12-month-old WT, KO and HET female mice that were housed on a control or Western diet for three weeks. <b>Results.</b> The relative abundance of 11 genera was increased, and the abundance of 6 genera was decreased in the Western-diet-housed mice compared to the controls. There were correlations between the abundance of <i>Streptococcus</i> and <i>Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014</i> and the expression of the pro-inflammatory marker Toll-like-Receptor 4 (<i>Tlr4</i>) in the dorsal raphe, as well as the expression of the mitochondrial activity marker perixome-proliferator-activated-receptor-cofactor-1b (<i>Ppargc1b</i>) in the prefrontal cortex. Although there was no significant impact of genotype on the microbiota in animals fed with the Control diet, there were significant interactions between diet and genotype. Following FDR correction, the Western diet increased the relative abundance of <i>Intestinimonas</i> and <i>Atopostipes</i> in the KO animals, which was not observed in the other groups. <i>Erysipelatoclostridium</i> abundance was increased by the Western diet in the WT group but not in HET or KO animals. <b>Conclusions.</b> The enhanced effects of a challenge with a Western diet in SERT-deficient mice include the altered representation of several gut genera, such as <i>Intestinimonas</i>, <i>Atopostipes</i> and <i>Erysipelatoclostridium</i>, which are also implicated in serotonergic and lipid metabolism. The manipulation of these genera may prove useful in individuals with the short SERT allele.",Nutrients,2023,Mirjam Bloemendaal; Ekaterina Veniaminova; Daniel C Anthony; Anna Gorlova; Priscilla Vlaming; Adel Khairetdinova; Raymond Cespuglio; Klaus Peter Lesch; Alejandro Arias Vasquez; Tatyana Strekalova
38132705,Association of homelessness and diet on the gut microbiome: a United States-Veteran Microbiome Project (US-VMP) study.,"Military veterans account for 8% of homeless individuals living in the United States. To highlight associations between history of homelessness and the gut microbiome, we compared the gut microbiome of veterans who reported having a previous experience of homelessness to those from individuals who reported never having experienced a period of homelessness. Moreover, we examined the impact of the cumulative exposure of prior and current homelessness to understand possible associations between these experiences and the gut microbiome. Microbiome samples underwent genomic sequencing and were analyzed based on alpha diversity, beta diversity, and taxonomic differences. Additionally, demographic information, dietary data, and mental health history were collected. A lifetime history of homelessness was found to be associated with alcohol use disorder, substance use disorder, and healthy eating index compared to those without such a history. In terms of differences in gut microbiota, beta diversity was significantly different between veterans who had experienced homelessness and veterans who had never been homeless (<i>P</i> = 0.047, weighted UniFrac), while alpha diversity was similar. The microbial community differences were, in part, driven by a lower relative abundance of <i>Akkermansia</i> in veterans who had experienced homelessness (mean; range [in percentages], 1.07; 0-33.9) compared to veterans who had never been homeless (2.02; 0-36.8) (<i>P</i> = 0.014, ancom-bc2). Additional research is required to facilitate understanding regarding the complex associations between homelessness, the gut microbiome, and mental and physical health conditions, with a focus on increasing understanding regarding the longitudinal impact of housing instability throughout the lifespan.IMPORTANCEAlthough there are known stressors related to homelessness as well as chronic health conditions experienced by those without stable housing, there has been limited work evaluating the associations between microbial community composition and homelessness. We analyzed, for the first time, bacterial gut microbiome associations among those with experiences of homelessness on alpha diversity, beta diversity, and taxonomic differences. Additionally, we characterized the influences of diet, demographic characteristics, military service history, and mental health conditions on the microbiome of veterans with and without any lifetime history of homelessness. Future longitudinal research to evaluate the complex relationships between homelessness, the gut microbiome, and mental health outcomes is recommended. Ultimately, differences in the gut microbiome of individuals experiencing and not experiencing homelessness could assist in identification of treatment targets to improve health outcomes.",mSystems,2024,Andrew J Hoisington; Kelly A Stearns-Yoder; Christopher E Stamper; Ryan Holliday; Diana P Brostow; Molly E Penzenik; Jeri E Forster; Teodor T Postolache; Christopher A Lowry; Lisa A Brenner
36710917,Metagenomic data reveals microbiome characteristics of culture-negative brain abscess samples.,"A brain abscess is a focal collection of pus in the brain parenchyma surrounded by a well-vascularized collagenous capsule in response to an infection. The microbiome of brain abscesses has been shown to be polymicrobial, dominated by uncultivable and anaerobic organisms of odontogenic origin. The data provided in this article includes the sequences of bacterial 16S rRNA gene from three culture-negative brain abscess samples suspected to have poly-microbial aetiology based on Sanger sequencing. DNA was extracted from brain abscess samples, and targeted-metagenomics sequencing was done by amplifying the full-length bacterial 16S rRNA followed by a nested PCR for V3-V4 regions using universal and specific primers. The barcoded amplicons were sequenced on Illumina MiSeq V2 instrument to generate 0.5M, 250bp paired-end reads/sample. The total sequencing reads were 455966, 345746, and 438658 for samples P32, P49, and P8, respectively. Bioinformatics tools such as FLASH, VSEARCH, and QIIME1 were used to process the reads generated for Operational Taxonomic Unit analysis (OTU). Bacterial species belonging to phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Fusobacteria were abundant in samples P49 and P8, which are mainly anaerobic and microaerophilic bacteria. These are typical of the human oral/gut microbiota and are implicated in brain abscess formation. Sample P32 showed the abundance of bacterial species belonging to phyla Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, which are commonly found in the environment. Raw data files are available at the Sequence Read Archive (SRA), National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), and data information can be found at the BioProject, PRJNA785100 under the accession numbers SRX13271109, SRX13271110, SRX13295897. The data shows the microbiome constitution, including several anaerobic and unculturable bacterial species from culture-negative brain abscess samples. This dataset will be useful for future research on comparative genomics and management of patients with culture-negative brain abscesses.",Data in brief,2023,Daisy Vanitha John; Meera Purushottam
37181872,Autism spectrum disorder research: knowledge mapping of progress and focus between 2011 and 2022.,"In recent years, a large number of studies have focused on autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The present study used bibliometric analysis to describe the state of ASD research over the past decade and identify its trends and research fronts.Studies on ASD published from 2011 to 2022 were obtained from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC). Bibliometrix, CiteSpace, and VOSviewer were used for bibliometric analysis.A total of 57,108 studies were included in the systematic search, and articles were published in more than 6,000 journals. The number of publications increased by 181.7% (2,623 in 2011 and 7,390 in 2021). The articles in the field of genetics are widely cited in immunology, clinical research, and psychological research. Keywords co-occurrence analysis revealed that ""causative mechanisms,"" ""clinical features,"" and ""intervention features"" were the three main clusters of ASD research. Over the past decade, genetic variants associated with ASD have gained increasing attention, and immune dysbiosis and gut microbiota are the new development frontiers after 2015.This study uses a bibliometric approach to visualize and quantitatively describe autism research over the last decade. Neuroscience, genetics, brain imaging studies, and gut microbiome studies improve our understanding of autism. In addition, the microbe-gut-brain axis may be an exciting research direction for ASD in the future. Therefore, through visual analysis of autism literature, this paper shows the development process, research hotspots, and cutting-edge trends in this field to provide theoretical reference for the development of autism in the future.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2023,Miaomiao Jiang; Tianlan Lu; Kang Yang; Xianjing Li; Liyang Zhao; Dai Zhang; Jun Li; Lifang Wang
37502424,"Effects of human probiotics on memory and psychological and physical measures in community-dwelling older adults with normal and mildly impaired cognition: results of a bi-center, double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled clinical trial (CleverAge biota).","This study presents results of our randomized clinical trial studying the effect of human probiotics on memory and psychological and physical measures following our study protocol registered at clinicaltrials.gov NCT05051501 and described in detail in our previous paper.Community dwelling participants aged between 55 and 80â years were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of 10<sup>6</sup> colony-forming units of human <i>Streptococcus thermophilus</i> GH, <i>Streptococcus salivarius</i> GH NEXARS, Lactobacilus plantarum GH, and <i>Pediococcus pentosaceus</i> GH or placebo. A cross-over design allowed each group to receive probiotics and placebo for 3â months each in reverse order. A small subset of participants was examined online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. After 6â months a small number of volunteers were additionally assessed after 2â months without any intervention. Primary outcome measures included changes in cognitive functions assessed using brief tests and a neuropsychological battery and changes in mood assessed using validated questionnaires. Secondary outcome measures included changes in self-report and subjective measures using depression and anxiety questionnaires, seven visual analog scales of subjective feelings (memory, digestion, etc.), and physical performance.At baseline, the probiotic-placebo group A (<i>n</i>â=â40, age 69âÂ±â7âyears, education 16âÂ±â3âyears, 63% females, body mass index 28.5âÂ±â6, subjective memory complaint in 43%) did not differ from the placebo-probiotic group B (<i>n</i>â=â32) in any of the sociodemographic characteristics and evaluated measures including cognitive status. At follow-up visits after 3, 6, and 8â months, no cross-sectional differences in any of the measures were found between the groups except worse sentence recall of the ALBA test after 3â months of probiotic use. Score changes were not observed for all cognitive tests but one in any group between visits 1 and 3 and between visits 3 and 6. The only change was observed for the TMT B test after the first three months but no change was observed after the second three months.The treatment with human probiotics and prebiotics did not improve cognitive, affective, or physical measures in community-dwelling individuals with normal or mildly impaired cognitive functions.clinicaltrials.gov, identifier NCT05051501.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2023,Ales Bartos; Josefina Weinerova; Sofia Diondet
37627638,Multi-Omics Approach Reveals Prebiotic and Potential Antioxidant Effects of Essential Oils from the Mediterranean Diet on Cardiometabolic Disorder Using Humanized Gnotobiotic Mice.,"Essential oils sourced from herbs commonly used in the Mediterranean diet have demonstrated advantageous attributes as nutraceuticals and prebiotics within a model of severe cardiometabolic disorder. The primary objective of this study was to assess the influences exerted by essential oils derived from thyme (<i>Thymus vulgaris</i>) and oregano (<i>Origanum vulgare</i>) via a comprehensive multi-omics approach within a gnotobiotic murine model featuring colonic microbiota acquired from patients diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD) and type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Our findings demonstrated prebiotic and potential antioxidant effects elicited by these essential oils. We observed a substantial increase in the relative abundance of the <i>Lactobacillus</i> genus in the gut microbiota, accompanied by higher levels of short-chain fatty acids and a reduction in trimethylamine N-oxide levels and protein oxidation in the plasma. Moreover, functional enrichment analysis of the cardiac tissue proteome unveiled an over-representation of pathways related to mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, and cardiac contraction. These findings provide compelling evidence of the prebiotic and antioxidant actions of thyme- and oregano-derived essential oils, which extend to cardiac function. These results encourage further investigation into the promising utility of essential oils derived from herbs commonly used in the Mediterranean diet as potential nutraceutical interventions for mitigating chronic diseases linked to CAD and T2DM.","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,MarÃ­a JosÃ© SÃ¡nchez-Quintero; JosuÃ© Delgado; Laura MartÃ­n Chaves; Dina Medina-Vera; Mora Murri; VÃ­ctor M Becerra-MuÃ±oz; Mario EstÃ©vez; MarÃ­a G Crespo-Leiro; Guillermo Paz LÃ³pez; AndrÃ©s GonzÃ¡lez-JimÃ©nez; Juan A G Ranea; MarÃ­a Isabel Queipo-OrtuÃ±o; Isaac Plaza-Andrades; Jorge RodrÃ­guez-CapitÃ¡n; Francisco Javier PavÃ³n-MorÃ³n; Manuel F JimÃ©nez-Navarro
37469436,"Exopolysaccharide is the potential effector of <i>Lactobacillus fermentum</i> PS150, a hypnotic psychobiotic strain.","Psychobiotics are a class of probiotics that confer beneficial effects on the mental health of the host. We have previously reported hypnotic effects of a psychobiotic strain, <i>Lactobacillus fermentum</i> PS150 (PS150), which significantly shortens sleep latency in experimental mice, and effectively ameliorate sleep disturbances caused by either caffeine consumption or a novel environment. In the present study, we discovered a <i>L. fermentum</i> strain, GR1009, isolated from the same source of PS150, and found that GR1009 is phenotypically distinct but genetically similar to PS150. Compared with PS150, GR1009 have no significant hypnotic effects in the pentobarbital-induced sleep test in mice. In addition, we found that heat-killed PS150 exhibited hypnotic effects and altered the gut microbiota in a manner similar to live bacteria, suggesting that a heat-stable effector, such as exopolysaccharide (EPS), could be responsible for these effects. Our comparative genomics analysis also revealed distinct genetic characteristics in EPS biosynthesis between GR1009 and PS150. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy imaging showed a sheet-like EPS structure in PS150, while GR1009 displayed no apparent EPS structure. Using the phenol-sulfate assay, we found that the sugar content value of the crude extract containing EPS (C-EPS) from PS150 was approximately five times higher than that of GR1009, indicating that GR1009 has a lower EPS production activity than PS150. Through the pentobarbital-induced sleep test, we confirmed the hypnotic effects of the C-EPS isolated from PS150, as evidenced by a significant reduction in sleep latency and recovery time following oral administration in mice. In summary, we utilized a comparative approach to delineate differences between PS150 and GR1009 and proposed that EPS may serve as a key factor that mediates the observed hypnotic effect.",Frontiers in microbiology,2023,Chin-Lin Huang; Hsu-Feng Chu; Chien-Chen Wu; Fu-Sheng Deng; Pei-Jun Wen; Shao-Ping Chien; Chi-Hsein Chao; Ying-Tsong Chen; Mei-Kuang Lu; Ying-Chieh Tsai
37400661,Isoalantolactone relieves depression-like behaviors in mice after chronic social defeat stress via the gut-brain axis.,"The management of depression continues to be challenging despite the variety of available antidepressants. Herbal medicines are used in many cultures but lack stringent testing to understand their efficacy and mechanism of action. Isoalantolactone (LAT) from Elecampane (Inula helenium) improved the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS)-induced anhedonia-like phenotype in mice comparable to fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).Compare the effects of LAT and fluoxetine on depression-like behaviors in mice exposed to CSDS.The CSDS-induced decrease in protein expression of postsynaptic density (PSD95), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and glutamate receptor subunit-1 (GluA1) in the prefrontal cortex was restored by LAT. LAT showed robust anti-inflammatory activity and can lessen the increase in IL-6 and TNF-Î± caused by CSDS. CSDS altered the gut microbiota at the taxonomic level, resulting in significant changes in Î±- and Î²-diversity. LAT treatment reestablished the bacterial abundance and diversity and increased the production of butyric acid in the gut that was inhibited by CSDS. The levels of butyric acid were negatively correlated with the abundance of Bacteroidetes, and positively correlated with those of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes across all treatment groups.The current data suggest that, similar to fluoxetine, LAT show antidepressant-like effects in mice exposed to CSDS through the modulation of the gut-brain axis.",Psychopharmacology,2023,Siming Wang; Qihan Cai; Lu Xu; Yanan Sun; Mengmeng Wang; Yu Wang; Lili Zhang; Keqing Li; Zhiyu Ni
37294054,EphB6 deficiency in intestinal neurons promotes tumor growth in colorectal cancer by neurotransmitter GABA signaling.,"EphB6 belongs to the receptor tyrosine kinase, whose low expression is associated with shorter survival of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. But the role and mechanism of EphB6 in the progression of CRC need further study. In addition, EphB6 was mainly expressed in intestinal neurons. But how EphB6 is involved in functions of intestinal neurons has not been known. In our study, we constructed a mouse xenograft model of CRC by injecting CMT93 cells into the rectum of EphB6-deficient mice. We found that the deletion of EphB6 in mice promoted tumor growth of CMT93 cells in a xenograft model of CRC, which was independent of changes in the gut microbiota. Interestingly, inhibition of intestinal neurons by injecting botulinum toxin A into rectum of EphB6-deficient mice could eliminate the promotive effect of EphB6 deficiency on tumor growth in the xenograft model of CRC. Mechanically, the deletion of EphB6 in mice promoted the tumor growth in CRC by increasing GABA in the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, EphB6 deficiency in mice increased the expression of synaptosomal-associated protein 25 in the intestinal myenteric plexus, which mediated the release of GABA. Our study concluded that EphB6 knockout in mice promotes tumor growth of CMT93 cells in a xenograft model of CRC by modulating GABA release. Our study found a new regulating mechanism of EphB6 on the tumor progression in CRC that is dependent on intestinal neurons.",Carcinogenesis,2023,Hao Yu; Xiao-Kang Qin; Kai-Wen Yin; Zi-Ming Li; En-De Ni; Jian-Ming Yang; Xun-Hua Liu; Ai-Jun Zhou; Shu-Ji Li; Tian-Ming Gao; Ying Li; Jian-Ming Li
38170072,Global scientific trends in healthy aging in the early 21st century: A data-driven scientometric and visualized analysis.,"According to the World Health Organization (WHO), healthy aging is the process of developing and maintaining the functional capacity for health in old age. A rapidly growing number of research studies on healthy aging have been conducted worldwide. The purpose of this research work is to explore global scientific landscape of healthy aging research over the last 22 years.Scientific publications on healthy aging from January 1, 2000 to October 11, 2022 were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) on October 11, 2022. A total of 6420 publications were included in the scientometric analysis. VOSviewer (1.6.18) was used to conduct scientometric and visualized analysis.The publication growth rate was 35.68 from 2000 to 2021. The United States of America (USA) led in both productivity and citations. <i>PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</i> was prominent in terms of both the highest citation count and the highest average citation count. The National Institute on Aging (NIA) and Evans, Michele K. were the most influential organization and author, respectively. Research hotspots in healthy aging were identified based on the co-occurrence analysis of keywords: (1) physical activity and mental health of older adults; (2) diseases impacting the health and lifespan of older adults; and (3) neuroscience. Our analysis indicates that gut microbiota, loneliness, frailty, mitochondria and resilience were the emerging themes in healthy aging research.The quantity of annual publications on healthy aging has rapidly increased over the past 22 years, especially during 2018-2021.

36989335,Treatment response to supplemental nutrients for ADHD is independent of diet quality: the MADDY Study RCT.,"The 8-week Micronutrients for ADHD in Youth (MADDY) randomized controlled trial (<i>N</i>â=â126, age 6-12) of broad-spectrum multinutrients for ADHD with emotional dysregulation found 3 times as many responders with multinutrients (54%) compared to placebo (18%) by Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I). Our primary aim for this analysis tests the hypothesis that those with poor overall diet quality at baseline benefit more. The second aim is to explore whether specific components of diet quality moderate treatment response.124 children (69 multinutrients, 55 placebo) had diet quality assessed using the Healthy Eating Index-2015 (HEI-2015). For each potential moderator, the outcome CGI-I at week 8 (RCT-end), was modeled two ways: (1) as a dichotomous variable: responder/non-responder, with responders defined by a rating of 1 or 2 'very much' or 'much improved,' all else equals non-responder using logistic regression, and (2) as a dimensional improvement outcome from 1â=âvery much improved to 7â=âvery much worse, using linear regression.HEI-2015 total score did not moderate treatment response [odds ratioâ=â1.00 (95% CI: 0.90,1.10), <i>p</i>â=â0.984] or improvement [Î²â=â-0.01 (95% CI: -0.06,0.04), <i>p</i>â=â0.648]. However, total vegetable intake moderated level of improvement in exploratory analysis [Î²â=â-0.48 (95% CI: -0.82, -0.13), <i>p</i>â=â0.007]: those with higher baseline vegetable intake showed greater benefit from multinutrients compared to placebo.Multinutrients may benefit children with ADHD and irritability regardless of overall diet quality. The finding that higher baseline vegetable intake may improve response to multinutrients deserves further exploration, including dietary effect on gut microbiota and absorption of multinutrients and parental factors.",Nutritional neuroscience,2024,Lisa M Robinette; Irene E Hatsu; Jeanette M Johnstone; Alisha M Bruton; Brenda M Y Leung; L Eugene Arnold
38406183,"Gut microbiota, nutrition, and mental health.","The human brain remains one of the greatest challenges for modern medicine, yet it is one of the most integral and sometimes overlooked aspects of medicine. The human brain consists of roughly 100 billion neurons, 100 trillion neuronal connections and consumes about 20-25% of the body's energy. Emerging evidence highlights that insufficient or inadequate nutrition is linked to an increased risk of brain health, mental health, and psychological functioning compromise. A core component of this relationship includes the intricate dynamics of the brain-gut-microbiota (BGM) system, which is a progressively recognized factor in the sphere of mental/brain health. The bidirectional relationship between the brain, gut, and gut microbiota along the BGM system not only affects nutrient absorption and utilization, but also it exerts substantial influence on cognitive processes, mood regulation, neuroplasticity, and other indices of mental/brain health. Neuroplasticity is the brain's capacity for adaptation and neural regeneration in response to stimuli. Understanding neuroplasticity and considering interventions that enhance the remarkable ability of the brain to change through experience constitutes a burgeoning area of research that has substantial potential for improving well-being, resilience, and overall brain health through optimal nutrition and lifestyle interventions. The nexus of lifestyle interventions and both academic and clinical perspectives of nutritional neuroscience emerges as a potent tool to enhance patient outcomes, proactively mitigate mental/brain health challenges, and improve the management and treatment of existing mental/brain health conditions by championing health-promoting dietary patterns, rectifying nutritional deficiencies, and seamlessly integrating nutrition-centered strategies into clinical care.",Frontiers in nutrition,2024,Gia Merlo; Gabrielle Bachtel; Steven G Sugden
38278378,Fermented foods: Harnessing their potential to modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis for mental health.,"Over the past two decades, whole food supplementation strategies have been leveraged to target mental health. In addition, there has been increasing attention on the ability of gut microbes, so called psychobiotics, to positively impact behaviour though the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Fermented foods offer themselves as a combined whole food microbiota modulating intervention. Indeed, they contain potentially beneficial microbes, microbial metabolites and other bioactives, which are being harnessed to target the microbiota-gut-brain axis for positive benefits. This review highlights the diverse nature of fermented foods in terms of the raw materials used and type of fermentation employed, and summarises their potential to shape composition of the gut microbiota, the gut to brain communication pathways including the immune system and, ultimately, modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Throughout, we identify knowledge gaps and challenges faced in designing human studies for investigating the mental health-promoting potential of individual fermented foods or components thereof. Importantly, we also suggest solutions that can advance understanding of the therapeutic merit of fermented foods to modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis.",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,2024,Ramya Balasubramanian; Elizabeth Schneider; Eoin Gunnigle; Paul D Cotter; John F Cryan
38972900,Humid heat environment causes anxiety-like disorder via impairing gut microbiota and bile acid metabolism in mice.,"Climate and environmental changes threaten human mental health, but the impacts of specific environmental conditions on neuropsychiatric disorders remain largely unclear. Here, we show the impact of a humid heat environment on the brain and the gut microbiota using a conditioned housing male mouse model. We demonstrate that a humid heat environment can cause anxiety-like behaviour in male mice. Microbial 16âS rRNA sequencing analysis reveals that a humid heat environment caused gut microbiota dysbiosis (e.g., decreased abundance of Lactobacillus murinus), and metabolomics reveals an increase in serum levels of secondary bile acids (e.g., lithocholic acid). Moreover, increased neuroinflammation is indicated by the elevated expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the serum and cortex, activated PI3K/AKT/NF-ÎºB signalling and a microglial response in the cortex. Strikingly, transplantation of the microbiota from mice reared in a humid heat environment readily recapitulates these abnormalities in germ-free mice, and these abnormalities are markedly reversed by Lactobacillus murinus administration. Human samples collected during the humid heat season also show a decrease in Lactobacillus murinus abundance and an increase in the serum lithocholic acid concentration. In conclusion, gut microbiota dysbiosis induced by a humid heat environment drives the progression of anxiety disorders by impairing bile acid metabolism and enhancing neuroinflammation, and probiotic administration is a potential therapeutic strategy for these disorders.",Nature communications,2024,Huandi Weng; Li Deng; Tianyuan Wang; Huachong Xu; Jialin Wu; Qinji Zhou; Lingtai Yu; Boli Chen; Li'an Huang; Yibo Qu; Libing Zhou; Xiaoyin Chen
38582087,Gut bacteria-driven homovanillic acid alleviates depression by modulating synaptic integrity.,"The gut-brain axis is implicated in depression development, yet its underlying mechanism remains unclear. We observed depleted gut bacterial species, including Bifidobacterium longum and Roseburia intestinalis, and the neurotransmitter homovanillic acid (HVA) in individuals with depression and mouse depression models. Although R.Â intestinalis does not directly produce HVA, it enhances B.Â longum abundance, leading to HVA generation. This highlights a synergistic interaction among gut microbiota in regulating intestinal neurotransmitter production. Administering HVA, B.Â longum, or R.Â intestinalis to mouse models with chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) and corticosterone (CORT)-induced depression significantly improved depressive symptoms. Mechanistically, HVA inhibited synaptic autophagic death by preventing excessive degradation of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) and SQSTM1/p62 proteins, protecting hippocampal neurons' presynaptic membrane. These findings underscore the role of the gut microbial metabolism in modulating synaptic integrity and provide insights into potential novel treatment strategies for depression.",Cell metabolism,2024,Mingliang Zhao; Zhenxing Ren; Aihua Zhao; Yajun Tang; Junliang Kuang; Mengci Li; Tianlu Chen; Shouli Wang; Jieyi Wang; Huiheng Zhang; Jijun Wang; Tianhong Zhang; Jiahui Zeng; Xiaohua Liu; Guoxiang Xie; Penghong Liu; Ning Sun; Tianhao Bao; Tongtong Nie; Jingchao Lin; Ping Liu; Yuanyi Zheng; Xiaojiao Zheng; Tiemin Liu; Wei Jia
38417224,Integrated multi-omics analysis reveals gut microbiota dysbiosis and systemic disturbance in major depressive disorder.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) involves systemic changes in peripheral blood and gut microbiota, but the current understanding is incomplete. Herein, we conducted a multi-omics analysis of fecal and blood samples obtained from an observational cohort including MDD patients (n = 99) and healthy control (HC, n = 50). 16S rRNA sequencing of gut microbiota showed structural alterations in MDD, as characterized by increased Enterococcus. Metagenomics sequencing of gut microbiota showed substantial functional alterations including upregulation in the superpathway of the glyoxylate cycle and fatty acid degradation and downregulation in various metabolic pathways in MDD. Plasma metabolomics revealed decreased amino acids and bile acids, together with increased sphingolipids and cholesterol esters in MDD. Notably, metabolites involved in arginine and proline metabolism were decreased while sphingolipid metabolic pathway were increased. Mass cytometry analysis of blood immune cell subtypes showed rises in proinflammatory immune subsets and declines in anti-inflammatory immune subsets in MDD. Furthermore, our findings revealed disease severity-related factors of MDD. Interestingly, we classified MDD into two immune subtypes that were highly correlated with disease relapse. Moreover, we established discriminative signatures that differentiate MDD from HC. These findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the MDD pathogenesis and provide valuable resources for the discovery of biomarkers.",Psychiatry research,2024,Zuoquan Xie; Jingjing Huang; Guangqiang Sun; Shen He; Zhiyu Luo; Linna Zhang; Liang Li; Min Yao; Chen Du; Wenjuan Yu; Yuan Feng; Dabing Yang; Jing Zhang; Changrong Ge; Huafang Li; Meiyu Geng
38421082,Unraveling the gut-brain connection: The association of microbiota-linked structural brain biomarkers with behavior and mental health.,"The gut microbiota can influence human behavior. However, due to the massive multiple-testing problem, research into the relationship between microbiome ecosystems and the human brain faces drawbacks. This problem arises when attempting to correlate thousands of gut bacteria with thousands of brain voxels.We performed brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans on 133 participants and applied machine-learning algorithms (Ridge regressions) combined with permutation tests. Using this approach, we were able to correlate specific gut bacterial families with brain MRI signals, circumventing the difficulties of massive multiple testing while considering sex, age, and body mass index as confounding factors.The relative abundance (RA) of the Selenomonadaceae, Clostridiaceae, and Veillonellaceae families in the gut was associated with altered cerebellar, visual, and frontal T2-mapping and diffusion tensor imaging measures. Conversely, decreased relative abundance of the Eubacteriaceae family was also linked to T2-mapping values in the cerebellum. Significantly, the brain regions associated with the gut microbiome were also correlated with depressive symptoms and attentional deficits.Our analytical strategy offers a promising approach for identifying potential brain biomarkers influenced by gut microbiota. By gathering a deeper understanding of the microbiota-brain connection, we can gain insights into the underlying mechanisms and potentially develop targeted interventions to mitigate the detrimental effects of dysbiosis on brain function and mental health.",Psychiatry and clinical neurosciences,2024,Oren Contreras-Rodriguez; Gerard Blasco; Carles BiarnÃ©s; Josep Puig; Maria Arnoriaga-RodrÃ­guez; ClÃ udia Coll-Martinez; Jordi Gich; LluÃ­s RamiÃ³-TorrentÃ ; Anna Motger-AlbertÃ­; Vicente PÃ©rez-Brocal; AndrÃ©s Moya; Joaquim Radua; JosÃ© Manuel FernÃ¡ndez-Real
37962812,Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis and Antidepressant Treatment.,"In the treatment of depressive disorders, conventional antidepressant therapy has been the mainstay of clinical management, along with well-established nonpharmacological interventions such as various kinds of psychotherapy. Over the last 2 decades, there has been considerable interest in the role of the gastrointestinal system and its microbiota on brain function, behavior, and mental health. Components of what is referred to as the microbiota-gut-brain axis have been uncovered, and further research has elicited functional capabilities such as ""gut-brain modules."" Some studies have found associations with compositional alterations of gut microbiota in patients with depressive disorders and individuals experiencing symptoms of depression. Regarding the pathogenesis and neurobiology of depression itself, there appears to be a multifactorial contribution, in addition to the theories involving deficits in catecholaminergic and monoamine neurotransmission. Interestingly, there is evidence to suggest that antidepressants may play a role in modulating the gut microbiota, thereby possibly having an impact on the microbiota-gut-brain axis in this manner. The development of prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics has led to studies investigating not only their impact on the microbiota but also their therapeutic value in mental health. These psychobiotics have the potential to be used as therapeutic adjuncts in the treatment of depression. Regarding future directions, and in an attempt to further understand the role of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in depression, more studies such as those involving fecal microbiota transplantation will be required. In addition to recent findings, it is also suggested that more research will have to be undertaken to elicit whether specific strains of gut organisms are linked to depression. In terms of further investigation of the therapeutic potential of prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics as adjuncts to antidepressant treatment, we also expect there to be more research targeting specific microorganisms, as well as a strong focus on the effects of specific prebiotic fibers from an individualized (personalized) point of view.",Current topics in behavioral neurosciences,2024,David Antoine Lachmansingh; Aonghus Lavelle; John F Cryan; Gerard Clarke

38803488,"Gut microbiota, inflammatory proteins and COVID-19: a Mendelian randomisation study.","The human gut microbiota has been identified as a potentially important factor influencing the development of COVID-19. It is believed that the disease primarily affects the organism through inflammatory pathways. With the aim of improving early diagnosis and targeted therapy, it is crucial to identify the specific gut microbiota associated with COVID-19 and to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying processes. The present study sought to investigate the potential causal relationship between the gut microbiota and COVID-19, and to determine the extent to which inflammatory proteins act as mediators in this relationship.Bidirectional mendelian randomization (MR) and Two-step mediated MR analyses were applied to examine causative associations among 196 gut microbiota, 91 inflammatory proteins and COVID-19. The main analytical method used in the MR was the random effects inverse variance weighted (IVW) method. This was complemented by the Bayesian weighted Mendelian randomization (BWMR) method, which was utilized to test the hypothesis of MR. In order for the results to be deemed reliable, statistical significance was required for both methods. Validation was then carried out using an external dataset, and further meta-analyses were conducted to authenticate that the association was reliable.Results of our research indicated that seven gut microbiota were actively associated to the COVID-19 risk. Five inflammatory proteins were associated with COVID-19 risk, of which three were positively and two were negatively identified with COVID-19. Further validation was carried out using sensitivity analyses. Mediated MR results revealed that CCL2 was a possible mediator of causality of family Bifidobacteriaceae and order Bifidobacteriales with COVID-19, mediating at a ratio of 12.73%.Suggesting a genetic causation between specific gut microbiota and COVID-19, our present research emphasizes the underlying mediating role of CCL2, an inflammatory factor, and contributes to a deeper understanding of the mechanism of action underlying COVID-19.",Frontiers in immunology,2024,Yuling Chen; Chang Chen

38891970,Human Gut Microbiota for Diagnosis and Treatment of Depression.,"Nowadays, depressive disorder is spreading rapidly all over the world. Therefore, attention to the studies of the pathogenesis of the disease in order to find novel ways of early diagnosis and treatment is increasing among the scientific and medical communities. Special attention is drawn to a biomarker and therapeutic strategy through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. It is known that the symbiotic interactions between the gut microbes and the host can affect mental health. The review analyzes the mechanisms and ways of action of the gut microbiota on the pathophysiology of depression. The possibility of using knowledge about the taxonomic composition and metabolic profile of the microbiota of patients with depression to select gene compositions (metagenomic signature) as biomarkers of the disease is evaluated. The use of in silico technologies (machine learning) for the diagnosis of depression based on the biomarkers of the gut microbiota is given. Alternative approaches to the treatment of depression are being considered by balancing the microbial composition through dietary modifications and the use of additives, namely probiotics, postbiotics (including vesicles) and prebiotics as psychobiotics, and fecal transplantation. The bacterium <i>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</i> is under consideration as a promising new-generation probiotic and auxiliary diagnostic biomarker of depression.

38576868,Bipolar disorder and the gut microbiota: a bibliometric analysis.,"Previous studies have explored the relationship between bipolar disorder and gut microbiota. However, there has been no bibliometric analysis to summarize and analyze these publications. Our objective was to perform a bibliometric analysis to investigate the current status and frontiers of the publications in the field of the association between bipolar disorder and the gut microbiota.We retrieved publications concerning the interplay between the gut microbiota and bipolar disorder from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC). The analysis was executed using WoSCC's literature analysis tool and VOSviewer 1.6.16.In total, we identified 177 publications originating from 362 institutions across 39 countries/regions, and these articles were disseminated in 104 different journals. The most productive institutions, authors, countries/regions, and journals were Zhejiang University contributing 18 publications, Shaohua Hu authoring 12 publications, China with 53 publications, and <i>Frontiers in Psychiatry</i> with 11 publications. The first high-cited document was published in the Journal of Psychiatric Research in 2017, and authored by Evans. In this article, they found gut microbiome composition was associated with BD and its illness severity, and they concluded that targeting the gut microbiota may be helpful to develop the effective treatment for bipolar disorder. The top 5 keywords with the highest frequency except for bipolar disorder and gut microbiota were as follows: depression, inflammation, probiotic, gut-brain axis, and anxiety.In conclusion, this is the first bibliometric analysis to explore the publications in the field of the association between bipolar disorder and the gut microbiota. The main research hotspots regarding this field were the characteristics, abundance, and diversity of gut microbiome in bipolar disorder, the role of treatment and gut microbiome in bipolar disorder, microbiome-brain connections in bipolar disorder, and interventions for bipolar disorder based on microbiota composition modification.

Kefir has been shown to have many beneficial health effects; however, its effect on PCOS is unknown. This study aimed to examine the effect of kefir on the intestinal microbiota and health outcomes in PCOS. In this intervention study, 17 women with PCOS consumed 250âmL/day of kefir (containing <i>Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens</i> subsp. <i>kefiranofaciens</i>, <i>Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens</i> subsp. <i>kefirgranum</i>, <i>Lactobacillus kefiri</i>, <i>Lactobacillus acidophilus</i>, <i>Lactobacillus parakefiri</i>, <i>Lactobacillus bulgaricus</i>, <i>Lactobacillus reuteri</i>, <i>Lactobacillus casei</i>, <i>Lactobacillus fermentum</i>, <i>Lactobacillus helveticus</i>, <i>Lactococcus lactis</i>, <i>Leuconostoc mesentereoides</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium bifidum</i>, <i>Streptococcus thermophilus</i>, <i>Kluyveromyces marxianus</i>, <i>Kluyveromyces lactis</i>, <i>Acetobacter pasteurianus</i>, and <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) for 8âweeks. Food consumption and physical activity records, anthropometrical measurements, quality of life, and fecal and blood samples were taken at the study's beginning and end. Quality of life in mental health (58.8âÂ±â15.08; 64.0âÂ±â15.23, respectively) and physical function (95.00 and 100.00, respectively) categories showed a significant increase after kefir intervention (<i>p</i>â<â.05). Additionally, Interleukin-6 (IL-6), one of the inflammatory cytokines, significantly decreased (174.00 and 109.10âng/L, respectively) (<i>p</i>â<â.05). The intestinal barrier permeability was evaluated with zonulin, and no significant change was observed. Gut microbiota analysis showed that while the relative abundance of the class Bacilli and genus <i>Lactococcus</i> significantly increased, the genus <i>Holdemania</i> decreased with kefir consumption (<i>p</i>â<â.05).

38735387,Association of intestinal anti-inflammatory drug target genes with psychiatric Disorders: A Mendelian randomization study.,"Psychiatric disorders present a substantial global public health burden with limited drug options. The gut-brain axis connects inflammatory bowel diseases and psychiatric disorders, which often have comorbidities. While some evidence hints at anti-inflammatory drugs aiding in treating psychiatric conditions, the specific effects of intestinal anti-inflammatory drugs remain unclear.This study investigates the causal effect of intestinal anti-inflammatory drug targets on psychiatric disorders. We hypothesize that these drug targets may offer new insights into the treatment and prevention of such disorders. Additionally, we explore gut microbiota's mediating role between drug target genes and psychiatric disorders.We performed two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) using summary data from existing expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and protein QTL in the brain, along with public genome-wide association studies of disease. We also explored gut microbiota's mediating effect. The statistics encompassed six psychiatric disorders involving 9,725-500,199 individuals. Colocalization analysis enhanced the MR evidence.We uncovered a causal link between TPMT (a target of olsalazine) expression in the amygdala and bipolar disorder (BD) risk (odds ratio [OR]Â =Â 1.08; PÂ =Â 4.29Â ÃÂ 10<sup>-4</sup>). This association was observed even when the sigmoid colon and whole blood eQTL were considered as exposures. Colocalization analysis revealed a shared genetic variant (rs11751561) between TPMT expression and BD, with a posterior probability of 61.6Â %. Interestingly, this causal effect was influenced by a decrease in the gut microbiota abundance of the genus Roseburia (effect proportionÂ =Â 10.05Â %). Moreover, elevated ACAT1 expression was associated with higher obsessive-compulsive disorder risk (ORÂ =Â 1.62; PÂ =Â 3.64Â ÃÂ 10<sup>-4</sup>; posterior probabilityÂ =Â 3.1Â %).These findings provide novel targets for the treatment of psychiatric disorders, underscore the potential of repurposing olsalazine, and emphasize the importance of TPMT and ACAT1 in future drug development.",Journal of advanced research,2024,Guorui Zhao; Zhe Lu; Yundan Liao; Yaoyao Sun; Yuyanan Zhang; Zhewei Kang; Xiaoyang Feng; Junyuan Sun; Weihua Yue

Composing the microbiota-gut-brain axis, the gut microbiota and its metabolites regulate the central nervous system through neural, endocrine and immune pathways to ensure the normal functioning of the organism, tuning individuals' health and disease status. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), the main bioactive metabolites of the gut microbiota, are involved in several neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression. SCFAs have essential effects on each component of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in depression. In the present review, the roles of major SCFAs (acetate, propionate and butyrate) in the pathophysiology of depression are summarised with respect to chronic cerebral hypoperfusion, neuroinflammation, host epigenome and neuroendocrine alterations.

Prebiotics, non-digestible food ingredients that beneficially affect the host by selectively stimulating the growth and/or activity of beneficial microorganisms, have emerged as a key modulator of this complex microbial community. This review article explores the evolution of the prebiotic concept, delineates various types of prebiotics, including fructans, galactooligosaccharides, xylooligosaccharides, chitooligosaccharides, lactulose, resistant starch, and polyphenols, and elucidates their impact on the gut microbiota composition. We delve into the mechanisms through which prebiotics exert their effects, particularly focusing on producing short-chain fatty acids and modulating the gut microbiota towards a health-promoting composition. The implications of prebiotics on human health are extensively reviewed, focusing on conditions such as obesity, inflammatory bowel disease, immune function, and mental health. The review further discusses the emerging concept of synbiotics-combinations of prebiotics and probiotics that synergistically enhance gut health-and highlights the market potential of prebiotics in response to a growing demand for functional foods.

38426291,The microbiota-gut-brain axisÂ in Huntington's disease: pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic targets.,"Huntington's disease (HD) is a currently incurable neurogenerative disorder and is typically characterized by progressive movement disorder (including chorea), cognitive deficits (culminating in dementia), psychiatric abnormalities (the most common of which is depression), and peripheral symptoms (including gastrointestinal dysfunction). There are currently no approved disease-modifying therapies available for HD, with death usually occurring approximately 10-25âyears after onset, but some therapies hold promising potential. HD subjects are often burdened by chronic diarrhea, constipation, esophageal and gastric inflammation, and a susceptibility to diabetes. Our understanding of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in HD is in its infancy and growing evidence from preclinical and clinical studies suggests a role of gut microbial population imbalance (gut dysbiosis) in HD pathophysiology. The gut and the brain can communicate through the enteric nervous system, immune system, vagus nerve, and microbiota-derived-metabolites including short-chain fatty acids, bile acids, and branched-chain amino acids. This review summarizes supporting evidence demonstrating the alterations in bacterial and fungal composition that may be associated with HD. We focus on mechanisms through which gut dysbiosis may compromise brain and gut health, thus triggering neuroinflammatory responses, and further highlight outcomes of attempts to modulate the gut microbiota as promising therapeutic strategies for HD. Ultimately, we discuss the dearth of data and the need for more longitudinal and translational studies in this nascent field. We suggest future directions to improve our understanding of the association between gut microbes and the pathogenesis of HD, and other 'brain and body disorders'.",The FEBS journal,2024,Millicent N Ekwudo; Carolina Gubert; Anthony J Hannan

The incidence of ALS increases from the age of 40 and peaks between the ages of 65 and 70. Most patients die of respiratory muscle paralysis or lung infections within three to five years of the appearance of symptoms, dealing a huge blow to patients and their families. With aging populations, improved diagnostic methods and changes in reporting criteria, the incidence of ALS is likely to show an upward trend in the coming decades. Despite extensive researches have been done, the cause and pathogenesis of ALS remains unclear. In recent decades, large quantities of studies focusing on gut microbiota have shown that gut microbiota and its metabolites seem to change the evolvement of ALS through the brain-gut-microbiota axis, and in turn, the progression of ALS will exacerbate the imbalance of gut microbiota, thereby forming a vicious cycle. This suggests that further exploration and identification of the function of gut microbiota in ALS may be crucial to break the bottleneck in the diagnosis and treatment of this disease. Hence, the current review summarizes and discusses the latest research advancement and future directions of ALS and brain-gut-microbiota axis, so as to help relevant researchers gain correlative information instantly.",Aging and disease,2024,Shilan Chen; Xinhong Cai; Lin Lao; Yuxuan Wang; Huanxing Su; Haitao Sun

Accumulating evidence suggests that dietary patterns may influence mental health through the modulation of the gut microbiota and its effects on host immune activity. Thus, targeting the gut microbiota via dietary intake could serve as both a preventative and therapeutic strategy in improving perinatal mental health.Here, we present a protocol for a prospective cohort study that primarily aims to determine if diet quality during pregnancy is protective against postpartum depression severity. Secondary objectives will examine if microbiota- and blood-based inflammatory markers may be associated with the relationship between prenatal diet quality and postpartum depression severity, as well as with associations between additional dietary and mental health outcomes.Dietary patterns and mental health symptoms will be documented in 100 pregnant women at 4 time points during pregnancy and postpartum. Participants will also provide stool and blood samples at the same time points to determine microbiota composition and predicted function and inflammatory factors, respectively. Stool microbiota will be analyzed using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing and bioinformatics tools (QIIME 2/PICRUSt2). Inflammatory factors will be determined using high-sensitivity antibody-based immunoassays. Statistical analyses will include linear mixed models and hierarchical linear mixed effect models.The study was approved by the Research Ethics Boards of the Royal Ottawa Health Care Group (#2022002) and of the University of Ottawa (#H-06-22-8013).

38960582,Integrated metagenomic and metabolomic analysis reveals distinctive stage-specific gut-microbiome-derived metabolites in intracranial aneurysms.,"Our study aimed to explore the influence of gut microbiota and their metabolites on intracranial aneurysms (IA) progression and pinpoint-related metabolic biomarkers derived from the gut microbiome.We recruited 358 patients with unruptured IA (UIA) and 161 with ruptured IA (RIA) from two distinct geographical regions for conducting an integrated analysis of plasma metabolomics and faecal metagenomics. Machine learning algorithms were employed to develop a classifier model, subsequently validated in an independent cohort. Mouse models of IA were established to verify the potential role of the specific metabolite identified.Distinct shifts in taxonomic and functional profiles of gut microbiota and their related metabolites were observed in different IA stages. Notably, tryptophan metabolites, particularly indoxyl sulfate (IS), were significantly higher in plasma of RIA. Meanwhile, upregulated tryptophanase expression and indole-producing microbiota were observed in gut microbiome of RIA. A model harnessing gut-microbiome-derived tryptophan metabolites demonstrated remarkable efficacy in distinguishing RIA from UIA patients in the validation cohort (AUC=0.97). Gut microbiota depletion by antibiotics decreased plasma IS concentration, reduced IA formation and rupture in mice, and downregulated matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression in aneurysmal walls with elastin degradation reduction. Supplement of IS reversed the effect of gut microbiota depletion.Our investigation highlights the potential of gut-microbiome-derived tryptophan metabolites as biomarkers for distinguishing RIA from UIA patients.

Open-field tests were conducted at baseline, end of SD (day 7), and after 14 days of saline or multi-probiotic gavage (day 21). Metagenomic sequencing was conducted on fecal samples, and serum metabolites were measured by untargeted liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry. At day 7, anxiety-like behaviors, including significant decreases in total movement distance (<i>P</i> = 0.0002) and staying time in the central zone (<i>P</i> = 0.021), were observed. In addition, increased levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; <i>P</i> = 0.028) and decreased levels of uridine (<i>P</i> = 0.018) and tryptophan (<i>P</i> = 0.01) were detected in rats after 7 days of SD. After SD, the richness of the gut bacterial community increased, and the levels of <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i>, <i>Muribaculum intestinale</i>, and <i>Bacteroides caecimuris</i> decreased. The changes in the host metabolism and gut microbiota composition were strongly associated with the anxiety-like behaviors caused by SD. In addition, multi-probiotic supplementation for 14 days modestly improved the anxiety-like behaviors in SD rats but significantly reduced the serum level of LPS (<i>P</i> = 0.045). In conclusion, SD induces changes in the gut microbiota and serum metabolites, which may contribute to the development of chronic inflammatory responses and affect the gut-brain axis, causing anxiety-like behaviors. Probiotic supplementation significantly reduces serum LPS, which may alleviate the influence of chronic inflammation.The disturbance in the gut microbiome and serum metabolome induced by SD may be involved in anxiety-like behaviors. Probiotic supplementation decreases serum levels of LPS, but this reduction may be insufficient for alleviating SD-induced anxiety-like behaviors.",Microbiology spectrum,2024,Nana Zhang; Xuefeng Gao; Donghao Li; Lijuan Xu; Guanzhou Zhou; Mengqi Xu; Lihua Peng; Gang Sun; Fei Pan; Yan Li; Rongrong Ren; Ruolan Huang; Yunsheng Yang; Zikai Wang
38908788,Gut microbiota dynamics and association with chronic kidney disease: A longitudinal study within the PREDIMED-Plus trial.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) represents a global health concern, disproportionately affecting the elderly with heightened cardiovascular risk. The emerging focus on the gut microbiota's role in CKD pathophysiology represents a pivotal area in nephrology; however, the evidence on this topic is limited. This observational prospective study, in the framework of the PREDIMED-Plus trial, investigates associations between gut microbiota composition and the 1-year trajectory of CKD in 343 participants aged 55-75Â years with high cardiovascular risk.Kidney function was assessed at baseline and at 1-year of follow-up through the estimated glomerular filtration rate based on cystatin C (eGFR-CysC) and CKD defined by eGFR-CysC <60Â mL/min/1.73Â m<sup>2</sup>. Participants were grouped based on their 1-year CKD trajectory: Group 1 maintained normal status or improved from CKD to normal, while Group 2 maintained CKD or worsened from normal to CKD. Fecal microbiota composition was assessed through 16S sequencing.We observed differences in gut microbiota composition between CKD trajectory groups. Notably, the baseline relative abundance of Lachnoclostridium and Lachnospira, both butyrate-producing genera, was lower in participants maintaining or progressing to CKD. Longitudinally, a decrease in Lachnospira abundance was associated with CKD progression. The improved Chao1 index after 1-year follow-up suggests a link between enhanced microbial richness and stable/better kidney function.The findings underscore the potential of gut microbiota analysis in non-invasively monitoring CKD, especially in older populations, and hint at future interventions targeting gut microbiota to manage CKD progression. Further research is needed for causal relationships and generalizability.",Life sciences,2024,Alessandro Atzeni; AndrÃ©s DÃ­az-LÃ³pez; AdriÃ¡n HernÃ¡ndez Cacho; Nancy Babio; JesÃºs F GarcÃ­a-GavilÃ¡n; Isabel Cornejo-Pareja; Clara Belzer; Montserrat FitÃ³; Francisco J Tinahones; Jordi Salas-SalvadÃ³
39375584,"Animal and plant protein intake association with mental health, tryptophan metabolites pathways, and gut microbiota in healthy women: a cross-sectional study.","Mental health is affected by tryptophane (TRP) metabolism regulation. Diet-influenced gut microbiome regulates TRP metabolism. Thus, the present study aimed to explore the relationship between type of dietary protein intake, gut microbiota, TRP metabolites homeostasis, and mental well-being in healthy women. 91 healthy females aged 18-50 were recruited based on the study protocol. Validate and reliable questionnaires assessed dietary intake and mental health. Biochemical tests and gut microbiota composition were analyzed following the manufacturer's instructions for each enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA) kit and Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) methods respectively. Regression methods were used to estimate the considered associations. The results show that in the fully adjusted model, plant protein consumption was partially inversely associated with depression risk (ORâ=â0.27; 95% CI: 0.06, 1.09; Pâ=â0.06). Higher dietary animal protein intake was marginally associated with psychological distress (ORâ=â2.59; 95% CI: 0.91, 7.34; Pâ=â0.07). KYN to serotonin ratio was inversely associated with animal protein consumption (Ãâ=â1.10; 95% CI: -0.13, 2.33; Pâ=â0.07).

38302874,Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction: associations with gut microbiota and genes expression of intestinal serotonergic pathway.,"Pediatric chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (PIPO) is a rare disease characterized by symptoms and radiological signs suggestive of intestinal obstruction, in the absence of lumen-occluding lesions. It results from an extremely severe impairment of propulsive motility. The intestinal endocrine system (IES) jointly with the enteric nervous system (ENS) regulates secreto-motor functions via different hormones and bioactive messengers/neurotransmitters. The neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) (or serotonin) is linked to intestinal peristalsis and secretory reflexes. Gut microbiota and its interplay with ENS affect 5-HT synthesis, release, and the subsequent serotonin receptor activation. To date, the interplay between 5-HT and gut microbiota in PIPO remains largely unclear. This study aimed to assess correlations between mucosa associated microbiota (MAM), intestinal serotonin-related genes expression in PIPO. To this purpose, biopsies of the colon, ileum and duodenum have been collected from 7 PIPO patients, and 7 age-/sex-matched healthy controls. After DNA extraction, the MAM was assessed by next generation sequencing (NGS) of the V3-V4 region of the bacterial RNA 16Â S, on an Illumina Miseq platform. The expression of genes implicated in serotoninergic pathway (TPH1, SLC6A4, 5-HTR3 and 5-HTR4) was established by qPCR, and correlations with MAM and clinical parameters of PIPO have been evaluated.Our results revealed that PIPO patients exhibit a MAM with a different composition and with dysbiosis, i.e. with a lower biodiversity and fewer less connected species with a greater number of non-synergistic relationships, compared to controls. qPCR results revealed modifications in the expression of serotonin-related intestinal genes in PIPO patients, when compared to controls. Correlation analysis do not reveal any kind of connection.For the first time, we report in PIPO patients a specific MAM associated to underlying pathology and an altered intestinal serotonin pathway. A possible dysfunction of the serotonin pathway, possibly related to or triggered by an altered microbiota, may contribute to dysmotility in PIPO patients. The results of our pilot study provide the basis for new biomarkers and innovative therapies targeting the microbiota or serotonin pathways in PIPO patients.",BMC microbiology,2024,Giulia Radocchia; Massimiliano Marazzato; Karim Ben Harbi; Elena Capuzzo; Fabrizio Pantanella; Roberto De Giorgio; Matteo Guarino; Anna Costanzini; Letizia Zenzeri; Pasquale Parisi; Alessandro Ferretti; Enrico Felici; Anna Teresa Palamara; Giovanni Di Nardo; Serena Schippa
38508549,Along the microbiota-gut-brain axis: Use of plant polysaccharides to improve mental disorders.,"With the development of gut microbiota-specific interventions for mental disorders, the interactions between plant polysaccharides and microbiota in the intestinal and their consequent effects are becoming increasingly important. In this review, we discussed the role of plant polysaccharides in improving various mental disorders via the microbiota-gut-brain axis. The chemical and structural characteristics and metabolites of these plant polysaccharides were summarised. Plant polysaccharides and their metabolites have great potential for reshaping gut microbiota profiles through gut microbiota-dependent fermentation. Along the microbiota-gut-brain axis, the consequent pharmacological processes that lead to the elimination of the symptoms of mental disorders include 1) regulation of the central monoamine neurotransmitters, amino acid transmitters and cholinergic signalling system; 2) alleviation of central and peripheral inflammation mainly through the NLRP3/NF-ÎºB-related signalling pathway; 3) inhibition of neuronal apoptosis; and 4) enhancement of antioxidant activities. According to this review, monosaccharide glucose and structure -4-Î±-Glcp-(1â are the most potent compositions of the most reported plant polysaccharides. However, the causal structure-activity relationship remains to be extensively explored. Moreover, mechanistic elucidation, safety verification, and additional rigorous human studies are expected to advance plant polysaccharide-based product development targeting the microbiota-gut-brain axis for people with mental disorders.",International journal of biological macromolecules,2024,Jiayu Gao; Ying Liang; Pu Liu
39417049,Challenges in integrating traditional Chinese medicine and gut microbiota research for insomnia treatment.,"The gut microbiome is an extensive variety of bacteria with a range of metabolic capabilities that can be pathogenic, beneficial, or opportunistic. Changes in the gut microbiota's composition can affect the link between gut integrity and host health as well as cause disruptions to numerous neurological systems. The second most prevalent mental health problem, insomnia has a negative social and economic impact. Currently, it is becoming increasingly obvious how crucial it is to preserve the delicate balance of gut microbiota to treat illness-related symptoms like insomnia. Although traditional Chinese medicine has proposed an effective strategy against insomnia through gut microbiota alteration in animal models, studies in human models are limited. This decreases the predictive value of the studies in terms of human outcomes. This editorial places an emphasis on cultural sensitivity rather than scientific reasoning that promotes the use of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). We aim to emphasize the concern that promoting TCM could divert resources from conventional medical research, leading to suboptimal care.",World journal of clinical cases,2024,Maham Bilal; Abdulqadir J Nashwan
38700338,Association between gut microbiota dysbiosis and poor functional outcomes in acute ischemic stroke patients with COVID-19 infection.,"Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients with active COVID-19 infection often have more severe symptoms and worse recovery. COVID-19 infection can cause gut microbiota dysbiosis, which is also a risk factor for poor outcomes in AIS patients. However, the association between gut microbiota and functional outcomes among AIS patients with COVID-19 infection has not been fully clarified yet. In this study, we performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize the gut microbial community among AIS patients with acute COVID-19 infection, AIS patients with post-acute COVID-19 infection, and AIS patients without COVID-19 infection. We found that AIS patients with acute COVID-19 experienced poorer recovery and significant gut dysbiosis, characterized by higher levels of <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> and lower levels of <i>Ruminococcaceae</i> and <i>Lachnospiraceae</i>. Furthermore, a shorter time window (less than 28 days) between COVID-19 infection and stroke was identified as a risk factor for poor functional outcomes in AIS patients with COVID-19, and the enrichment of <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> was indicated as a mediator in the relationship between infection time window and poor stroke outcomes. Our findings highlight the importance of early intervention after COVID-19 infection, especially by regulating the gut microbiota, which plays a role in the prognosis of AIS patients with COVID-19 infection.IMPORTANCEThe gut microbiota plays an important role in the association between respiratory system and cerebrovascular system through the gut-lung axis and gut-brain axis. However, the specific connection between gut bacteria and the functional outcomes of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients with COVID-19 is not fully understood yet. In our study, we observed a significant decrease in bacterial diversity and shifts in the abundance of key bacterial families in AIS patients with acute COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, we identified that the time window was a critical influence factor for stroke outcomes, and the enrichment of <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> acted as a mediator in the relationship between the infection time window and poor stroke outcomes. Our research provides a new perspective on the complex interplay among AIS, COVID-19 infection, and gut microbiota dysbiosis. Moreover, recognizing <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> as a potential mediator of poor stroke prognosis offers a novel avenue for future exploration and therapeutic interventions.",mSystems,2024,Jiaying Chen; Xuxuan Gao; Jingru Liang; Qiheng Wu; Linlin Shen; Yifeng Zheng; Yu Ma; Yuping Peng; Yan He; Jia Yin
38975363,"Dissecting the association between gut microbiota, body mass index and specific depressive symptoms: a mediation Mendelian randomisation study.","Observational studies highlight the association between gut microbiota (GM) composition and depression; however, evidence for the causal relationship between GM and specific depressive symptoms remains lacking.We aimed to evaluate the causal relationship between GM and specific depressive symptoms as well as the mediating role of body mass index (BMI).We performed a two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis using genetic variants associated with GM and specific depressive symptoms from genome-wide association studies. The mediating role of BMI was subsequently explored using mediation analysis via two-step MR.MR evidence suggested the <i>Bifidobacterium</i> genus (Î²=-0.03; 95%âCI -0.05 to -0.02; p<0.001âand Î²=-0.03; 95%âCI -0.05 to -0.02; p<0.001) and Actinobacteria phylum (Î²=-0.04; 95%âCI -0.06 to -0.02; p<0.001âand Î²=-0.03; 95%âCI -0.05 to -0.03; p=0.001) had protective effects on both anhedonia and depressed mood. The Actinobacteria phylum also had protective effects on appetite changes (Î²=-0.04; 95%âCI -0.06 to -0.01; p=0.005), while the Family XI had an antiprotective effect (Î²=0.03; 95%âCI 0.01 to 0.04; p<0.001). The Bifidobacteriaceae family (Î²=-0.01; 95%âCI -0.02 to -0.01; p=0.001) and Actinobacteria phylum (Î²=-0.02; 95%âCI -0.03 to -0.01; p=0.001) showed protective effects against suicidality. The two-step MR analysis revealed that BMI also acted as a mediating moderator between the Actinobacteria phylum and appetite changes (mediated proportion, 34.42%) and that BMI partially mediated the effect of the <i>Bifidobacterium</i> genus (14.14% and 8.05%) and Actinobacteria phylum (13.10% and 8.31%) on both anhedonia and depressed mood.These findings suggest a potential therapeutic effect of Actinobacteria and <i>Bifidobacterium</i> on both depression and obesity.

38901183,Diverse mechanisms by which chemical pollutant exposure alters gut microbiota metabolism and inflammation.,"The human gut microbiome, the host, and the environment are inextricably linked across the life course with significant health impacts. Consisting of trillions of bacteria, fungi, viruses, and other micro-organisms, microbiota living within our gut are particularly dynamic and responsible for digestion and metabolism of diverse classes of ingested chemical pollutants. Exposure to chemical pollutants not only in early life but throughout growth and into adulthood can alter human hosts' ability to absorb and metabolize xenobiotics, nutrients, and other components critical to health and longevity. Inflammation is a common mechanism underlying multiple environmentally related chronic conditions, including cardiovascular disease, multiple cancer types, and mental health. While growing research supports complex interactions between pollutants and the gut microbiome, significant gaps exist. Few reviews provide descriptions of the complex mechanisms by which chemical pollutants interact with the host microbiome through either direct or indirect pathways to alter disease risk, with a particular focus on inflammatory pathways. This review focuses on examples of several classes of pollutants commonly ingested by humans, including (i) heavy metals, (ii) persistent organic pollutants (POPs), and (iii) nitrates. Digestive enzymes and gut microbes are the first line of absorption and metabolism of these chemicals, and gut microbes have been shown to alter compounds from a less to more toxic state influencing subsequent distribution and excretion. In addition, chemical pollutants may interact with or alter the selection of more harmful and less commensal microbiota, leading to gut dysbiosis, and changes in receptor-mediated signaling pathways that alter the integrity and function of the gut intestinal tract. Arsenic, cadmium, and lead (heavy metals), influence the microbiome directly by altering different classes of bacteria, and subsequently driving inflammation through metabolite production and different signaling pathways (LPS/TLR4 or proteoglycan/TLR2 pathways). POPs can alter gut microbial composition either directly or indirectly depending on their ability to activate key signaling pathways within the intestine (e.g., PCB-126 and AHR). Nitrates and nitrites' effect on the gut and host may depend on their ability to be transformed to secondary and tertiary metabolites by gut bacteria. Future research should continue to support foundational research both in vitro, in vivo, and longitudinal population-based research to better identify opportunities for prevention, gain additional mechanistic insights into the complex interactions between environmental pollutants and the microbiome and support additional translational science.",Environment international,2024,Menna Teffera; Alex C Veith; Sean Ronnekleiv-Kelly; Christopher A Bradfield; Maria Nikodemova; Lisa Tussing-Humphreys; Kristen Malecki
39375215,Association of the newly proposed dietary index for gut microbiota and depression: the mediation effect of phenotypic age and body mass index.,"Gut microbiota and depression have garnered attention. The dietary index for gut microbiota (DI-GM) is a newly proposed index that reflects the diversity of gut microbiota, yet its association with depression remains unstudied.Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were analyzed. Depression was assessed using Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Dietary recall data were used to calculate the DI-GM (including components beneficial and unfavorable to gut microbiota). Multivariable weighted logistic and linear regression were employed to investigate the association of DI-GM with depression and total PHQ-9 score. The potential mediating role of phenotypic age and body mass index (BMI) was explored. Secondary analyses included subgroup analyses, restricted cubic spline (RCS), and multiple imputation.A higher DI-GM and beneficial gut microbiota score were associated with a lower prevalence of depression (DI-GM: ORâ=â0.94, 95% CIâ=â0.89, 0.99; beneficial gut microbiota score: ORâ=â0.88, 95% CIâ=â0.82, 0.94) and lower total PHQ-9 score (DI-GM: Î²=-0.09, 95% CI=-0.14, -0.04; beneficial gut microbiota: Î²=-0.15, 95% CI=-0.21, -0.08). RCS indicated a non-linear relationship between DI-GM and depression. A significant mediating effect of phenotypic age (proportion of mediation: 19.81%, 95% CI: 12.86-63.00%) and BMI (proportion of mediation: 16.49%, 95% CI: 12.87-62.00%) was observed.The newly proposed DI-GM was negatively associated with the prevalence of depression and total PHQ-9 score.

Studies have reported conflicting results regarding changes in immune biomarkers and alterations in the abundance of bacterial taxa and microbial diversity in patients with PTSD.The purpose of this meta-analysis is to summarize existing studies examining gut microbiota characteristics and changes in immune biomarkers in patients with PTSD.Relevant studies were systematically searched in PubMed, Scopus, and Embase, published in English between January 1, 1960, and December 1, 2023. The outcomes included changes in abundance and diversity in gut microbiota (gut microbiota part) and changes in immune biomarkers (immune part).The meta-analysis included a total of 15 studies, with 9 focusing on changes in inflammatory biomarkers and 6 focusing on changes in gut microbiota composition in patients with PTSD. No differences were observed between groups for all inflammatory biomarkers (Pâ¥0.05). Two of the six studies found that people with PTSD had less alpha diversity. However, the overall Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) for the Shannon Diversity Index was not significant (SMD 0.27, 95% CI -0.62-0.609, p = 0.110). Regarding changes in abundance, in two of the studies, a significant decrease in Lachnospiraceae bacteria was observed.This meta-analysis provides a comprehensive overview of gut microbiota characteristics in PTSD, suggesting potential associations with immune dysregulation.

38582194,Evolution and the critical role of the microbiota in the reduced mental and physical health associated with low socioeconomic status (SES).,"The evolution of the gut-microbiota-brain axis in animals reveals that microbial inputs influence metabolism, the regulation of inflammation and the development of organs, including the brain. Inflammatory, neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders are more prevalent in people of low socioeconomic status (SES). Many aspects of low SES reduce exposure to the microbial inputs on which we are in a state of evolved dependence, whereas the lifestyle of wealthy citizens maintains these exposures. This partially explains the health deficit of low SES, so focussing on our evolutionary history and on environmental and lifestyle factors that distort microbial exposures might help to mitigate that deficit. But the human microbiota is complex and we have poor understanding of its functions at the microbial and mechanistic levels, and in the brain. Perhaps its composition is more flexible than the microbiota of animals that have restricted habitats and less diverse diets? These uncertainties are discussed in relation to the encouraging but frustrating results of attempts to treat psychiatric disorders by modulating the microbiota.",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,2024,Graham A W Rook
38318337,"Exploring the interplay between running exercises, microbial diversity, and tryptophan metabolism along the microbiota-gut-brain axis.","The emergent recognition of the gut-brain axis connection has shed light on the role of the microbiota in modulating the gut-brain axis's functions. Several microbial metabolites, such as serotonin, kynurenine, tryptamine, indole, and their derivatives originating from tryptophan metabolism have been implicated in influencing this axis. In our study, we aimed to investigate the impact of running exercises on microbial tryptophan metabolism using a mouse model. We conducted a multi-omics analysis to obtain a comprehensive insight into the changes in tryptophan metabolism along the microbiota-gut-brain axis induced by running exercises. The analyses integrated multiple components, such as tryptophan changes and metabolite levels in the gut, blood, hippocampus, and brainstem. Fecal microbiota analysis aimed to examine the composition and diversity of the gut microbiota, and taxon-function analysis explored the associations between specific microbial taxa and functional activities in tryptophan metabolism. Our findings revealed significant alterations in tryptophan metabolism across multiple sites, including the gut, blood, hippocampus, and brainstem. The outcomes indicate a shift in microbiota diversity and tryptophan metabolizing capabilities within the running group, linked to increased tryptophan transportation to the hippocampus and brainstem through circulation. Moreover, the symbiotic association between <i>Romboutsia</i> and <i>A. muciniphila</i> indicated their potential contribution to modifying the gut microenvironment and influencing tryptophan transport to the hippocampus and brainstem.

38422755,Gut microbiota disturbances in hospitalized older adults with malnutrition and clinical outcomes.,"Malnutrition is one of the most threatening conditions in geriatric populations. The gut microbiota has an important role in the host's metabolic and muscular health: however, its interplay with disease-related malnutrition is not well understood. We aimed to identify the association of malnutrition with the gut microbiota and predict clinical outcomes in hospitalized acutely ill older adults.We performed a secondary longitudinal analysis in 108 geriatric patients from a prospective cohort evaluated at admission and 72 h of hospitalization. We collected clinical, demographic, nutritional, and 16S rRNA gene-sequenced gut microbiota data. Microbiota diversity, overall composition, and differential abundance were calculated and compared between patients with and without malnutrition. Microbiota features associated with malnutrition were used to predict clinical outcomes.Patients with malnutrition (51%) had a different microbiota composition compared to those who were well-nourished during hospitalization (ANOSIM R = 0.079, P = 0.003). Patients with severe malnutrition showed poorer Î±-diversity at admission (Shannon P = 0.012, Simpson P = 0.018) and follow-up (Shannon P = 0.023, Chao1 P = 0.008). Differential abundance of Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group, Subdoligranulum, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were significantly lower and inversely associated with malnutrition, while Corynebacterium, Ruminococcaceae Incertae Sedis, and Fusobacterium were significantly increased and positively associated with malnutrition. Corynebacterium, Ruminococcaceae Incertae Sedis, and the overall composition were important predictors of critical care in patients with malnutrition during hospitalization.Older adults with malnutrition, especially in a severe stage, may be subject to substantial gut microbial disturbances during hospitalization.

Emerging research highlights the pivotal role of the gut microbiome in the development of diverse mental health conditions. This study aims to explore the causal effects and interactions of the gut microbiome, metabolites, immune cells, lipids, and inflammatory proteins on the risk of anorexia nervosa through mediation and multi-omics Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis.This study used data from the FinnGen genome-wide association study (GWAS) of AN (NÂ =Â 402,625), integrated with GWAS data on 473 of gut microbiota (NÂ =Â 5959), 233 metabolites (NÂ =Â 136,016), 731 immune cells (NÂ =Â 3757), 179 lipids (NÂ =Â 7174), and 91 inflammatory proteins (NÂ =Â 14,824). This study used the univariate MR (UVMR), mediation MR analysis, and sensitivity analysis to assess the potential causal associations between these biomarkers and AN.The inverse variance weighted (IVW) results suggest that 25 gut microbiota have causal effects on AN.

39458270,Depressive Symptoms and Gut Microbiota after Bowel Preparation and Colonoscopy: A Pre-Post Intervention Study.,"Mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) is essential for visualisation of the colon during colonoscopy. Previous studies have identified changes in gut microbiota composition after MBP and colonoscopy. Considering the gut microbiota is increasingly implicated in psychiatry, we explored the potential impact of this intervention on mood and the microbiota-gut-brain axis. We conducted a pre-post intervention study in adults, with timepoints of one week before and one month after MBP and colonoscopy. Our primary outcome was change in average Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale depression sub-scores. We examined changes in average anxiety, stress, and quality of life scores and gut microbiota composition using 16S rRNA sequencing. We further explored associations between changes in depressive symptoms and gut microbiota and conducted post hoc analyses to explore potential effect modifiers. Average depressive symptom scores decreased one month post-procedure compared to baseline (n = 59; adjusted Î² = -0.64; 95%CI: -1.18, -0.11). Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) appeared to moderate this relationship (Î² = 1.78; 95%CI: 0.292, 3.26); depressive symptoms increased in those with, and decreased in those without, IBS. Reduced alpha diversity, modest effects on beta-diversity, and increases in health-associated genera were observed one month post-procedure. Increases in the CLR-transformed abundances of <i>Ruminococcaceae UCG-009</i> were associated with improvements in depressive symptoms. There is preliminary evidence of a potential mental health effect of MBP and colonoscopy, particularly for those with IBS, which may be associated with changes to the gut microbiota. Further research is required to confirm these findings and their clinical relevance.",Microorganisms,2024,Amelia J McGuinness; Martin O'Hely; Douglas Stupart; David Watters; Samantha L Dawson; Christopher Hair; Michael Berk; Mohammadreza Mohebbi; Amy Loughman; Glenn Guest; Felice N Jacka
38892694,A Cross Talking between the Gut Microbiota and Metabolites of Participants in a Confined Environment.,"Certain workplaces, like deep-sea voyages, subject workers to chronic psychological stress and circadian rhythm disorders due to confined environments and frequent shifts. In this study, participants lived in a strictly controlled confined environment, and we analyzed the effects of a confined environment on gut microbiota and metabolites. The results showed that living in confined environments can significantly alter both the gut microbiota and the gut metabolome, particularly affecting lipid metabolism pathways like glycerophospholipid metabolism. There was a significant reduction in the abundance of <i>Faecalibacterium</i> and <i>Bacteroides</i>, while <i>Blautia</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, and <i>Collinsella</i> showed significant increases. An association analysis revealed a strong correlation between changes in the gut microbiota and the metabolome. Four upregulated lipid metabolites may serve as biomarkers for damage induced by confined environments, and certain gut microbiota alterations, such as those involving <i>Faecalibacterium</i> and <i>Bacteroides</i>, could be potential psychobiotics or therapeutic targets for enhancing mental health in a confined environment.",Nutrients,2024,Xin Song; Ziying Wang; Yongjun Xia; Zheng Chen; Guangqiang Wang; Yijin Yang; Beiwei Zhu; Lianzhong Ai; Haodan Xu; Chuan Wang
39335452,Prior Appendicectomy and Gut Microbiota Re-Establishment in Adults after Bowel Preparation and Colonoscopy.,"Emerging evidence suggests that the human vermiform appendix is not a vestigial organ but rather an immunological organ of biological relevance. It is hypothesised that the appendix acts as a bacterial 'safe house' for commensal gut bacteria and facilitates re-inoculation of the colon after disruption through the release of biofilms. To date, no studies have attempted to explore this potential mechanistic function of the appendix. We conducted a pre-post intervention study in adults (n = 59) exploring re-establishment of the gut microbiota in those with and without an appendix after colonic disruption via bowel preparation and colonoscopy. Gut microbiota composition was measured one week before and one month after bowel preparation and colonoscopy using 16S rRNA sequencing. We observed between group differences in gut microbiota composition between those with (n = 45) and without (n = 13) an appendix at baseline. These differences were no longer evident one-month post-procedure, suggesting that this procedure may have 'reset' any potential appendix-related differences between groups. Both groups experienced reductions in gut microbiota richness and shifts in beta diversity post-procedure, with greater changes in those without an appendix, and there were five bacterial genera whose re-establishment post-procedure appeared to be moderated by appendicectomy status. This small experimental study provides preliminary evidence of a potential differential re-establishment of the gut microbiota after disruption in those with and without an appendix, warranting further investigation into the potential role of the appendix as a microbial safe house.",Biomedicines,2024,Amelia J McGuinness; Martin O'Hely; Douglas Stupart; David Watters; Samantha L Dawson; Christopher Hair; Michael Berk; Mohammadreza Mohebbi; Amy Loughman; Glenn Guest; Felice N Jacka
39260135,Microbiota-gut-brain axis: Natural antidepressants molecular mechanism.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a severe mental health condition characterized by persistent depression, impaired cognition, and reduced activity. Increasing evidence suggests that gut microbiota (GM) imbalance is closely linked to the emergence and advancement of MDD, highlighting the potential significance of regulating the ""Microbiota-Gut-Brain"" (MGB) axis to impact the development of MDD. Natural products (NPs), characterized by broad biological activities, low toxicity, and multi-target characteristics, offer unique advantages in antidepressant treatment by regulating MGB axis.This review was aimed to explore the intricate relationship between the GM and the brain, as well as host responses, and investigated the mechanisms underlying the MGB axis in MDD development. It also explored the pharmacological mechanisms by which NPs modulate MGB axis to exert antidepressant effects and addressed current research limitations. Additionally, it proposed new strategies for future preclinical and clinical applications in the MDD domain.To study the effects and mechanism by which NPs exert antidepressant effects through mediating the MGB axis, data were collected from Web of Science, PubMed, ScienceDirect from initial establishment to March 2024. NPs were classified and summarized by their mechanisms of action.NPs, such as flavonoids,alkaloids,polysaccharides,saponins, terpenoids, can treat MDD by regulating the MGB axis. Its mechanism includes balancing GM, regulating metabolites and neurotransmitters such as SCAFs, 5-HT, BDNF, inhibiting neuroinflammation, improving neural plasticity, and increasing neurogenesis.NPs display good antidepressant effects, and have potential value for clinical application in the prevention and treatment of MDD by regulating the MGB axis. However, in-depth study of the mechanisms by which antidepressant medications affect MGB axis will also require considerable effort in clinical and preclinical research, which is essential for the development of effective antidepressant treatments.",Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,2024,Yitong Lu; Xiaowen Yu; Zhongling Wang; Linghui Kong; Zhenyuan Jiang; Ruirui Shang; Xia Zhong; Shimeng Lv; Guangheng Zhang; Haonan Gao; Ni Yang
39092201,Stress and the gut-brain axis: an inflammatory perspective.,"The gut-brain axis (GBA) plays a dominant role in maintaining homeostasis as well as contributes to mental health maintenance. The pathways that underpin the axis expand from macroscopic interactions with the nervous system, to the molecular signals that include microbial metabolites, tight junction protein expression, or cytokines released during inflammation. The dysfunctional GBA has been repeatedly linked to the occurrence of anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors development. The importance of the inflammatory aspects of the altered GBA has recently been highlighted in the literature. Here we summarize current reports on GBA signaling which involves the immune response within the intestinal and blood-brain barrier (BBB). We also emphasize the effect of stress response on altering barriers' permeability, and the therapeutic potential of microbiota restoration by probiotic administration or microbiota transplantation, based on the latest animal studies. Most research performed on various stress models showed an association between anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors, dysbiosis of gut microbiota, and disruption of intestinal permeability with simultaneous changes in BBB integrity. It could be postulated that under stress conditions impaired communication across BBB may therefore represent a significant mechanism allowing the gut microbiota to affect brain functions.",Frontiers in molecular neuroscience,2024,Julia Morys; Andrzej MaÅecki; Marta Nowacka-Chmielewska
39339804,Balancing the Oral-Gut-Brain Axis with Diet.,"<b>Background:</b> The oral microbiota is the second largest microbial community in humans. It contributes considerably to microbial diversity and health effects, much like the gut microbiota. Despite physical and chemical barriers separating the oral cavity from the gastrointestinal tract, bidirectional microbial transmission occurs between the two regions, influencing overall host health. <b>Method:</b> This review explores the intricate interplay of the oral-gut-brain axis, highlighting the pivotal role of the oral microbiota in systemic health and ageing, and how it can be influenced by diet. <b>Results:</b> Recent research suggests a relationship between oral diseases, such as periodontitis, and gastrointestinal problems, highlighting the broader significance of the oral-gut axis in systemic diseases, as well as the oral-gut-brain axis in neurological disorders and mental health. Diet influences microbial diversity in the oral cavity and the gut. While certain diets/dietary components improve both gut and oral health, others, such as fermentable carbohydrates, can promote oral pathogens while boosting gut health. <b>Conclusions:</b> Understanding these dynamics is key for promoting a healthy oral-gut-brain axis through dietary interventions that support microbial diversity and mitigate age-related health risks.",Nutrients,2024,Rebecca Kerstens; Yong Zhi Ng; Sven Pettersson; Anusha Jayaraman
38922485,Characterization of Gut Microbiota in Rats and Rhesus Monkeys After Methamphetamine Self-administration.,"Methamphetamine (MA) is one of the most abused drugs globally, but the mechanism of its addiction remains unclear. Several animal studies have shown that the gut microbiota (GM) influences addictive behaviors, but the pattern of GM changes during addiction in animals of different species remains unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the association between dynamic changes in GM and MA self-administration acquisitionÂ among two classical mammals, rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) and rats, MA self-administration models. Male Sprague-Dawley rats and male rhesus monkeys were subjected to classical MA self-administration training, and fecal samples were collected before and after MA self-administration training, respectively. 16S rRNA sequencing was used for GM analyses. We found that GM changes were more pronounced in rats than in rhesus monkeys, as evidenced by more GM taxa producing significant differences before and after MA self-administration training in rats than in monkeys. We also found that the expression of the genus Clostridia_vadinBB60_group significantly decreased after MA self-administration training in both rats and rhesus monkeys. Lactobacillus changes were significantly negatively correlated with total MA uptake in rats (Pearson Râ=ââ-â0.666, pâ=â0.035; Spearman Râ=ââ-â0.721, pâ=â0.023), whereas its change was also highly negatively correlated with total MA uptake in rhesus monkeys (Pearson Râ=ââ-â0.882, pâ=â0.118; Spearman Râ=ââ-â1.000, pâ=â0.083), although this was not significant. These findings suggest that MA causes significant alterations in GM in both rhesus monkeys and rats and that the genus Lactobacillus might be a common therapeutic target for MA uptake prevention across the species.",Molecular neurobiology,2024,Li He; Jia-Hui Zhou; Huan Li; Wen-Lei Zhang; Tie-Qiao Liu; Hai-Feng Jiang; Rong-Wei Zhai; Xiao-Jie Zhang
38815661,Gut microbiota composition links to variation in functional domains across psychiatric disorders.,"Changes in microbial composition are observed in various psychiatric disorders, but their specificity to certain symptoms or processes remains unclear. This study explores the associations between the gut microbiota composition and the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) domains of functioning, representing symptom domains, specifically focusing on stress-related and neurodevelopmental disorders in patients with and without psychiatric comorbidity.The gut microbiota was analyzed in 369 participants, comprising 272 individuals diagnosed with a mood disorder, anxiety disorder, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and/or substance use disorder, as well as 97 psychiatrically unaffected individuals. The RDoC domains were estimated using principal component analysis (PCA) with oblique rotation on a range of psychiatric, psychological, and personality measures. Associations between the gut microbiota and the functional domains were assessed using multiple linear regression and permanova, adjusted for age, sex, diet, smoking, medication use and comorbidity status.Four functional domains, aligning with RDoC's negative valence, social processes, cognitive systems, and arousal/regulatory systems domains, were identified. Significant associations were found between these domains and eight microbial genera, including associations of negative valence with the abundance of the genera Sellimonas, CHKCI001, Clostridium sensu stricto 1, Oscillibacter, and Flavonifractor; social processes with Sellimonas; cognitive systems with Sporobacter and Hungatella; and arousal/regulatory systems with Ruminococcus torques (all p<sub>FDR</sub>Â <Â 0.05).Our findings demonstrate associations between the gut microbiota and the domains of functioning across patients and unaffected individuals, potentially mediated by immune-related processes. These results open avenues for microbiota-focused personalized interventions, considering psychiatric comorbidity. However, further research is warranted to establish causality and elucidate mechanistic pathways.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2024,Danique Mulder; Babette Jakobi; Yingjie Shi; Peter Mulders; Josina D Kist; Rose M Collard; Janna N Vrijsen; Phillip van Eijndhoven; Indira Tendolkar; Mirjam Bloemendaal; Alejandro Arias Vasquez
38892525,Is the Mediterranean Low Fodmap Diet Effective in Managing Irritable Bowel Syndrome Symptoms and Gut Microbiota? An Innovative Research Protocol.,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms can be effectively managed with the low FODMAP diet. However, its efficacy in reducing inflammation is not yet proven. On the contrary, the Mediterranean diet has anti-inflammatory properties with proven efficacy in treating chronic low-grade inflammation-related diseases.To publicly share our protocol evaluating the efficacy of the Mediterranean low-FODMAP (MED-LFD) versus NICE recommendations (British National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) diet in managing IBS symptoms and quality of life.Participants meeting the Rome IV criteria will be randomly assigned to MED-LFD or NICE recommendations and they will be followed for six months. Efficacy, symptom relief, quality of life and mental health will be assessed using validated questionnaires. In addition, fecal samples will be analyzed to assess gut microbiota, and to measure branched and short-chain fatty acids, and volatile organic compounds (metabolic byproducts from bacteria). Expected results and discussion: By publicly sharing this clinical study protocol, we aim to improve research quality in the field of IBS management by allowing for peer review feedback, preventing data manipulation, reducing redundant research efforts, mitigating publication bias, and empowering patient decision-making. We expect that this protocol will show that MED-LFD can effectively alleviate IBS symptoms and it will provide pathophysiology insights on its efficacy. The new dietary pattern that combines the LFD and the MED approaches allows for the observation of the synergistic action of both diets, with the MED's anti-inflammatory and prebiotic properties enhancing the effects of the LFD while minimizing its limitations.

Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) concentrations were determined via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).The primary outcome of our study was changes in mental wellness, including neurotransmitters, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrena (HPA) axis hormones, and the psychological scales. The results showed that Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA) increased significantly and the HPA axis hormones were suppressed overall in the probiotic groups while 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) did not change significantly. However, there was no significant change in mood scale scores. The secondary outcome focused on the ability of 207-1 to regulate the body and lifestyle of healthy adults (e.g., sleep, diet, exercise, etc.). The PSQI scores in the probiotics groups significantly decreased, indicating improved sleep quality. Meanwhile, the probiotic groups had a slight increase in exercise consumption while dietary intake stabilized. By physical examination, the participants showed weight loss although no statistically significant difference was observed between the groups. Then, validated by gut microbiota, changes in the gut microbiota were observed under the effective intervention of 207-1 while short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) increased in the LD group, particularly acetic and propionic acids. There was a slight decrease in alpha-diversity in the HD group.Bifidobacterium breve 207-1 entered the organism and affected neurotransmitter and the HPA axis hormone levels via the microbiome-gut-brain axis. Meanwhile, 207-1 supplementation improved daily lifestyle behaviors in healthy adults, which may in turn lead to changes in their bodies (e.g. weight and lipid metabolism). However, this study did not find significant mood-modulating efficacy. The mechanism of the overall study is unclear, but we hypothesize that SCFAs may be the key pathway, and more experiments are needed for validation in the future.This trial was retrospectively registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry under the accession number ChiCTR2300069453 on March 16, 2023.",European journal of nutrition,2024,Jinxing Li; Yapeng Li; Jincheng Zhao; Liang Li; Yunyi Wang; Fei Chen; Yuchen Li; Ruyue Cheng; Fang He; Xiaolei Ze; Xi Shen
38889540,Treating chronic stress and chronic pain by manipulating gut microbiota with diet: can we kill two birds with one stone?,"<b>Background:</b> Chronic stress and chronic pain are closely linked by the capacity to exacerbate each other, sharing common roots in the brain and in the gut. The strict intersection between these two neurological diseases makes important to have a therapeutic strategy aimed at preventing both to maintain mental health in patients. Diet is an modifiable lifestyle factor associated with gut-brain axis diseases and there is growing interest in its use as adjuvant to main therapies. Several evidence attest the impact of specific diets or nutrients on chronic stress-related disorders and pain with a good degree of certainty. A daily adequate intake of foods containing micronutrients such as amino acids, minerals and vitamins, as well as the reduction in the consumption of processed food products can have a positive impact on microbiota and gut health. Many nutrients are endowed of prebiotic, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and neuroprotective potential which make them useful tools helping the management of chronic stress and pain in patients. Dietary regimes, as intermittent fasting or caloric restriction, are promising, although further studies are needed to optimize protocols according to patient's medical history, age and sex. Moreover, by supporting gut microbiota health with diet is possible to attenuate comorbidities such as obesity, gastrointestinal dysfunction and mood disorders, thus reducing healthcare costs related to chronic stress or pain.<b>Objective:</b> This review summarize the most recent evidence on the microbiota-mediated beneficial effects of macro- and micronutrients, dietary-related factors, specific nutritional regimens and dietary intervention on these pathological conditions.",Nutritional neuroscience,2024,Alessia Costa; Elena Lucarini
38479554,Social isolation induces intestinal barrier disorder and imbalances gut microbiota in mice.,"Social isolation, a known stressor, can have detrimental effects on both physical and mental health. Recent scientific attention has been drawn to the gut-brain axis, a bidirectional communication system between the central nervous system and gut microbiota, suggesting that gut microbes may influence brain function. This study aimed to explore the impact of social isolation on the intestinal barrier and gut microbiota. 40 male BALB/c mice were either individually housed or kept in groups for 8 and 15Â weeks. Socially isolated mice exhibited increased anxiety-like behavior, with significant differences between the 8-week and 15-week isolation groups (PÂ <Â 0.05). After 8Â weeks of isolation, there was a reduction in tight junction protein expression in the intestinal mechanical barrier. Furthermore, after 15Â weeks of isolation, both tight junction protein and mucin expression, key components of the intestinal chemical barrier, decreased. This was accompanied by a substantial increase in inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 mRNA, IL-10, and TNF-Î±) in colon tissue in the 15-week isolated group (PÂ <Â 0.05). Additionally, Illumina MiSequencing revealed significant alterations in the gut microbiota of socially isolated mice, including reduced Firmicutes and Bacteroides compared to the control group. Lactobacillus levels also decreased in the socially isolated mice.",Neuroscience letters,2024,Yue Wang; Hidayat Ullah; Ting Deng; Xinxiu Ren; Zinan Zhao; Yi Xin; Juanjuan Qiu
39237483,Temperament in Early Childhood Is Associated With Gut Microbiota Composition and Diversity.,"Temperament is a key predictor of human mental health and cognitive and emotional development. Although human fear behavior is reportedly associated with gut microbiome in infancy, infant gut microbiota changes dramatically during the first 5 years, when the diversity and composition of gut microbiome are established. This period is crucial for the development of the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in emotion regulation. Therefore, this study investigated the relationship between temperament and gut microbiota in 284 preschool children aged 3-4 years. Child temperament was assessed by maternal reports of the Children's Behavior Questionnaire. Gut microbiota (alpha/beta diversity and genera abundance) was evaluated using 16S rRNA sequencing of stool samples. A low abundance of anti-inflammatory bacteria (e.g., Faecalibacterium) and a high abundance of pro-inflammatory bacteria (e.g., Eggerthella, Flavonifractor) were associated with higher negative emotionality and stress response (i.e., negative affectivity, Î²Â =Â -0.17, pÂ =Â 0.004) and lower positive emotionality and reward-seeking (i.e., surgency/extraversion, Î²Â =Â 0.15, pÂ =Â 0.013). Additionally, gut microbiota diversity was associated with speed of response initiation (i.e., impulsivity, a specific aspect of surgency/extraversion, Î²Â =Â 0.16, pÂ =Â 0.008). This study provides insight into the biological mechanisms of temperament and takes important steps toward identifying predictive markers of psychological/emotional risk.",Developmental psychobiology,2024,Eriko Ueda; Michiko Matsunaga; Hideaki Fujihara; Takamasa Kajiwara; Aya K Takeda; Satoshi Watanabe; Keisuke Hagihara; Masako Myowa
38801922,The impact of depression-mediated gut microbiota composition on Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Mendelian study.,"This study uses a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to delineate the causal influence of gut microbiota on the occurrence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), concurrently assessing the potential mediating function of depression within this framework.Several two-sample MR methods were used to assess the causal repercussions of gut microbiota on the onset of both IBS and depression. Following this, gut microbiota and depression, which demonstrated notable causal associations, were integrated as exposure variables in a multivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR) framework to construct a model encompassing gut microbiota, depression, and IBS. Mediation effects were assessed by examining the indirect pathway of gut microbiota â depression â IBS.Two-sample MR analysis unveiled a statistically significant causal association (PÂ <Â 0.05) between specific bacterial group within the gut microbiota, notably p_Actinobacteria(ORÂ =Â 0.829225), c_Clostridia(ORÂ =Â 0.798897), s_Desulfovibrio_piger(ORÂ =Â 1.163912), g_Streptococcus(ORÂ =Â 1.132735), c_Actinobacteria(ORÂ =Â 0.829224), and the onset of IBS. In the MVMR analysis, the relationship between depression and IBS was significant across Model 3, Model 7, Model 8, and Model 13 (PÂ <Â 0.05). Assessment of mediation effects revealed that c_Clostridia and o_Clostridiales indirectly impacted IBS through depression, with masking effect ratios of 168.46Â % and 168.44Â %, respectively.These findings underscore a resilient causal association between the composition of gut microbiota and the initiation of IBS. Furthermore, depression serves as a mediator for particular groups of gut bacteria, thereby contributing to the development of IBS. These observations imply that interventions targeting mental health may potentially alleviate the risk of IBS onset attributable to adverse configurations of gut microbiota.",Journal of affective disorders,2024,Yi Huang; Endian Zheng; Mei Hu; Xinxin Yang; Qiaoli Lan; Yingcong Yu; Beibei Xu
38848976,Deciphering the gut microbiota's (Coprococcus and Subdoligranulum) impact on depression: Network pharmacology and molecular dynamics simulation.,"Depression, a prevalent mental health condition, significantly impacts global mental impairment rates. While antidepressants are commonly used, treatment-resistant depression (TRD) poses a challenge. Emerging research highlights the role of the gut microbiota in depression through the gut-brain axis. This study identifies key genes associated with depression influenced by specific gut microbiota, Coprococcus and Subdoligranulum. Using bioinformatics tools, potential targets were elucidated, and molecular docking studies were performed. Furthermore, gene expression analysis identified hub-genes related to depression, intersecting with metabolite targets. Protein-protein interaction analysis revealed pivotal targets such as PTGS2 and MMP9. Molecular docking demonstrated 3-Indolepropionic acid's superior affinity over (R)-3-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)lactate. Physicochemical properties and toxicity profiles were compared, suggesting favorable attributes for 3-Indolepropionic acid. Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed stability and interactions of compounds with target proteins. This comprehensive approach sheds light on the complex interplay between gut microbiota, genes, and depression, emphasizing the potential for microbiota-targeted interventions in mental health management.","Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior",2024,Sarvesh Sabarathinam

38892645,"Explorative Characterization of GI Complaints, General Physical and Mental Wellbeing, and Gut Microbiota in Trained Recreative and Competitive Athletes with or without Self-Reported Gastrointestinal Symptoms.","The current state of the literature lacks a clear characterization of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, gut microbiota composition, and general physical and mental wellbeing in well-trained athletes. Therefore, this study aimed to characterize differences in self-reported symptoms, gut microbiota composition, and wellbeing (i.e., sleep quality, mood, and physical (PHQ) and mental wellbeing) between athletes with and without GI symptoms. In addition, we assessed the potential impact of a 3-week multi-ingredient fermented whey supplement in the GI complaints group, without a control group, on the gut microbiota and self-reported GI symptoms and wellbeing. A total of 50 athletes (24.7 Â± 4.5 years) with GI issues (GI group at baseline, GI-B) and 21 athletes (25.4 Â± 5.3 years) without GI issues (non-GI group, NGI) were included. At baseline, there was a significant difference in the total gastrointestinal symptom rating scale (GSRS) score (24.1 Â± 8.48 vs. 30.3 Â± 8.82, <i>p</i> = 0.008) and a trend difference in PHQ (33.9 Â± 10.7 vs. 30.3 Â± 8.82, <i>p</i> = 0.081), but no differences (<i>p</i> > 0.05) were seen for other outcomes, including gut microbiota metrics, between groups. After 3-week supplementation, the GI group (GI-S) showed increased <i>Bifidobacterium</i> relative abundance (<i>p</i> < 0.05), reported a lower number of severe GI complaints (from 72% to 54%, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and PHQ declined (<i>p</i> = 0.010). In conclusion, well-trained athletes with GI complaints reported more severe GI symptoms than an athletic reference group, without showing clear differences in wellbeing or microbiota composition. Future controlled research should further investigate the impact of such multi-ingredient supplements on GI complaints and the associated changes in gut health-related markers.",Nutrients,2024,Floris C Wardenaar; Alex E Mohr; Carmen P Ortega-Santos; Jean Nyakayiru; Christine Kersch-Counet; Yat Chan; Anna-Marie Clear; Jonathan Kurka; Kinta D Schott; Ryan G N Seltzer
39063241,Opioid Use and Gut Dysbiosis in Cancer Pain Patients.,"Opioids are commonly used for the management of severe chronic cancer pain. Their well-known pharmacological effects on the gastrointestinal system, particularly opioid-induced constipation (OIC), are the most common limiting factors in the optimization of analgesia, and have led to the wide use of laxatives and/or peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonists (PAMORAs). A growing interest has been recently recorded in the possible effects of opioid treatment on the gut microbiota. Preclinical and clinical data, as presented in this review, showed that alterations of the gut microbiota play a role in modulating opioid-mediated analgesia and tolerability, including constipation. Moreover, due to the bidirectional crosstalk between gut bacteria and the central nervous system, gut dysbiosis may be crucial in modulating opioid reward and addictive behavior. The microbiota may also modulate pain regulation and tolerance, by activating microglial cells and inducing the release of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which sustain neuroinflammation. In the subset of cancer patients, the clinical meaning of opioid-induced gut dysbiosis, particularly its possible interference with the efficacy of chemotherapy and immunotherapy, is still unclear. Gut dysbiosis could be a new target for treatment in cancer patients. Restoring the physiological amount of specific gut bacteria may represent a promising therapeutic option for managing gastrointestinal symptoms and optimizing analgesia for cancer patients using opioids.",International journal of molecular sciences,2024,Flaminia Coluzzi; Maria Sole Scerpa; Chiara Loffredo; Marina Borro; Joseph V Pergolizzi; Jo Ann LeQuang; Elisa Alessandri; Maurizio Simmaco; Monica Rocco
38351227,Systematic identification of the role of gut microbiota in mental disorders: a TwinsUK cohort study.,"Mental disorders are complex disorders influenced by multiple genetic, environmental, and biological factors. Specific microbiota imbalances seem to affect mental health status. However, the mechanisms by which microbiota disturbances impact the presence of depression, stress, anxiety, and eating disorders remain poorly understood. Currently, there are no robust biomarkers identified. We proposed a novel pyramid-layer design to accurately identify microbial/metabolomic signatures underlying mental disorders in the TwinsUK registry. Monozygotic and dizygotic twins discordant for mental disorders were screened, in a pairwise manner, for differentially abundant bacterial genera and circulating metabolites. In addition, multivariate analyses were performed, accounting for individual-level confounders. Our pyramid-layer study design allowed us to overcome the limitations of cross-sectional study designs with significant confounder effects and resulted in an association of the abundance of genus Parabacteroides with the diagnosis of mental disorders. Future research should explore the potential role of Parabacteroides as a mediator of mental health status. Our results indicate the potential role of the microbiome as a modifier in mental disorders that might contribute to the development of novel methodologies to assess personal risk and intervention strategies.",Scientific reports,2024,Julie Delanote; Alejandro Correa Rojo; Philippa M Wells; Claire J Steves; GÃ¶khan Ertaylan
39337263,Prenatal Stress and Ethanol Exposure: Microbiota-Induced Immune Dysregulation and Psychiatric Risks.,"Changes in maternal gut microbiota due to stress and/or ethanol exposure can have lasting effects on offspring's health, particularly regarding immunity, inflammation response, and susceptibility to psychiatric disorders. The literature search for this review was conducted using PubMed and Scopus, employing keywords and phrases related to maternal stress, ethanol exposure, gut microbiota, microbiome, gut-brain axis, diet, dysbiosis, progesterone, placenta, prenatal development, immunity, inflammation, and depression to identify relevant studies in both preclinical and human research. Only a limited number of reviews were included to support the arguments. The search encompassed studies from the 1990s to the present. This review begins by exploring the role of microbiota in modulating host health and disease. It then examines how disturbances in maternal microbiota can affect the offspring's immune system. The analysis continues by investigating the interplay between stress and dysbiosis, focusing on how prenatal maternal stress influences both maternal and offspring microbiota and its implications for susceptibility to depression. The review also considers the impact of ethanol consumption on gut dysbiosis, with an emphasis on the effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on both maternal and offspring microbiota. Finally, it is suggested that maternal gut microbiota dysbiosis may be significantly exacerbated by the combined effects of stress and ethanol exposure, leading to immune system dysfunction and chronic inflammation, which could increase the risk of depression in the offspring. These interactions underscore the potential for novel mental health interventions that address the gut-brain axis, especially in relation to maternal and offspring health.",International journal of molecular sciences,2024,Rosana Camarini; Priscila Marianno; Maylin Hanampa-Maquera; Samuel Dos Santos Oliveira; Niels Olsen Saraiva CÃ¢mara
38613087,The Power of Psychobiotics in Depression: A Modern Approach through the Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis: A Literature Review.,"The microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis is a complex communication network linking the gut, microbiota, and brain, influencing various aspects of health and disease. Dysbiosis, a disturbance in the gut microbiome equilibrium, can significantly impact the MGB axis, leading to alterations in microbial composition and function. Emerging evidence highlights the connection between microbiota alterations and neurological and psychiatric disorders, including depression. This review explores the potential of psychobiotics in managing depressive disorders, emphasizing their role in restoring microbial balance and influencing the MGB axis. Psychobiotics exhibit positive effects on the intestinal barrier, immune response, cortisol levels, and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Studies suggest that probiotics may serve as an adjunct therapy for depression, especially in treatment-resistant cases. This review discusses key findings from studies on psychobiotics interventions, emphasizing their impact on the gut-brain axis and mental health. The increasing acceptance of the expanded concept of the MGB axis underscores the importance of microorganisms in mental well-being.

38776563,Microbiota-brain axis: Exploring the role of gut microbiota in psychiatric disorders - A comprehensive review.,"Mental illness is a hidden epidemic in modern science that has gradually spread worldwide. According to estimates from the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 10% of the world's population suffers from various mental diseases each year. Worldwide, financial and health burdens on society are increasing annually. Therefore, understanding the different factors that can influence mental illness is required to formulate novel and effective treatments and interventions to combat mental illness. Gut microbiota, consisting of diverse microbial communities residing in the gastrointestinal tract, exert profound effects on the central nervous system through the gut-brain axis. The gut-brain axis serves as a conduit for bidirectional communication between the two systems, enabling the gut microbiota to affect emotional and cognitive functions. Dysbiosis, or an imbalance in the gut microbiota, is associated with an increased susceptibility to mental health disorders and psychiatric illnesses. Gut microbiota is one of the most diverse and abundant groups of microbes that have been found to interact with the central nervous system and play important physiological functions in the human gut, thus greatly affecting the development of mental illnesses. The interaction between gut microbiota and mental health-related illnesses is a multifaceted and promising field of study. This review explores the mechanisms by which gut microbiota influences mental health, encompassing the modulation of neurotransmitter production, neuroinflammation, and integrity of the gut barrier.

39027446,Potential role of gut microbiota in major depressive disorder: A review.,"Interactions between the gut microbiota and host immunity are sophisticated, dynamic, and host-dependent. Scientists have recently conducted research showing that disturbances in the gut bacterial community can lead to a decrease in some metabolites and, consequently, to behaviors such as depression. Exposure to stressors dropped the relative abundance of bacteria in the genus <i>Bacteroides</i> while soaring the relative abundance of bacteria in the genus <i>Clostridium</i>, <i>Coprococcus</i>, <i>Dialister</i>, and Oscillibacter, <i>which</i> were also reduced in people with depression. Microbiota and innate immunity are in a bilateral relationship. The gut microbiota has been shown to induce the synthesis of antimicrobial proteins such as catalysidins, type C lectins, and defensins. Probiotic bacteria can modulate depressive behavior through GABA signaling. The gut microbiome produces essential metabolites such as neurotransmitters, tryptophan metabolites, and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that can act on the CNS. In the case of dysbiosis, due to mucin changes, the ratio of intestinal-derived molecules may change and contribute to depression. Psychotropics, including <i>Bifidobacterium longum</i> NCC3001, <i>Clostridium butyricum</i> CBM588, and <i>Lactobacillus acidophilus,</i> have mental health benefits, and can have a positive effect on the host-brain relationship, and have antidepressant effects.

38879123,"Associations between specific dietary patterns, gut microbiome composition, and incident subthreshold depression in Chinese young adults.","The interplay between influential factors and the incidence of subthreshold depression (SD) in young adults remains poorly understood.This study sought to understand the dietary habits, gut microbiota composition, etc. among individuals with SD in young adults and to investigate their association with SD occurrence.Employing a cross-sectional approach, 178 individuals with SD, aged 18-32Â years, were matched with 114 healthy counterparts. SD status was evaluated using the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Beck Depression Inventory 2nd version (BDI-II), the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scales of Depression (HAMD-17), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Metagenomic sequencing was utilized to identify fecal microbial profiles. Dietary patterns were discerned via factor analysis of a 25-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Logistic regression analysis and mediation analysis were performed to explore the potential links between gut microbiota, dietary patterns, and incident SD.Data on dietary habits were available for 292 participants (mean [SD] age, 22.1 [2.9] years; 216 [73.9Â %] female). Logistic regression analysis revealed that dietary patterns â  (odds ratio [OR], 0.34; 95Â % CI, 0.15-0.75) and IV (OR, 0.39; 95Â % CI, 0.17-0.86 and OR, 0.39; 95Â % CI, 0.18-0.84) were associated with reduced risk of SD.

39203714,"Effects of Dietary Fiber, Phenolic Compounds, and Fatty Acids on Mental Health: Possible Interactions with Genetic and Epigenetic Aspects.","Scientific evidence shows that dietary patterns are a key environmental determinant of mental health. Dietary constituents can modify epigenetic patterns and thus the gene expression of relevant genetic variants in various mental health conditions. In the present work, we describe some nutrigenomic effects of dietary fiber, phenolic compounds (plant secondary metabolites), and fatty acids on mental health outcomes, with emphasis on their possible interactions with genetic and epigenetic aspects. Prebiotics, through their effects on the gut microbiota, have been associated with modulation in the neuroendocrine response to stress and the facilitation of the processing of positive emotions. Some of the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms include the serotonin neurotransmitter system (<i>TPH1</i> gene) and the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (inhibition of histone deacetylases). The consumption of phenolic compounds exerts a positive role in neurocognitive domains. The evidence showing the involvement of genetic and epigenetic factors comes mainly from animal models, highlighting the role of epigenetic mechanisms through miRNAs and methyltransferases as well as the effect on the expression of apoptotic-related genes. Long-chain <i>n</i>-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA) have been mainly related to psychotic and mood disorders, but the genetic and epigenetic evidence is scarce. Studies on the genetic and epigenetic basis of these interactions need to be promoted to move towards a precision and personalized approach to medicine.",Nutrients,2024,Mariane Lutz; Pablo R Moya; SofÃ­a Gallorio; Ulises RÃ­os; Marcelo Arancibia

39426041,"Comparative analysis of gut microbiota in major depressive disorder and schizophrenia during hospitalisation - the case-control, post hoc study.","The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between gut microbiota and major depressive disorder (MDD) and schizophrenia (SCZ) by comparing 36 inpatients with these conditions to 29 healthy controls (HC) matched for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI). Individuals with SCZ exhibited greater microbiota richness compared to HC (FDR P(Q)=0.028). Taxonomically, while no significant differences were observed between the microbiota of MDD and SCZ patients in a head-to-head comparison, both patient groups differed significantly when compared to HC. Interestingly, besides common patterns (such as a higher abundance of Erysipelotrichaceae UCG-003 and Streptococcus, and a lower abundance of Lachnospiraceae ND3007 group), unique patterns were exhibited only in MDD (with a higher abundance of Anaerostipes, Q=0.004) or SCZ (with a higher abundance of Sutterella, Q=0.001, and a lower abundance of Clostridium sensu stricto 1, Q=0.002). The Random Forest algorithm identified Ruminococcus torques group, Lachnospiraceae UCG-001, and Erysipelotrichaceae UCG-003 as highly discriminative features for both SCZ and MDD, while Suturella and Holdemania were unique features for SZC, and Lachnospiraceae genus CAG-56 and Anaerostipes for MDD. Additionally, between 50â¯% and 60â¯% of the differentially abundant taxa were found among the top 10 influential features in the RF models. In conclusion, while no significant differences were found between the microbiota of MDD and SCZ patients, distinct microbial patterns were found in each group when compared to HC. The study did not confirm universal microbial biomarkers reported in other studies but showed that the observed differences concern the bacteria associated with inflammation, the production of short chain fatty acids (SCFA), and the synthesis of metabolites linked to mental health (lactic acid, gamma-aminobutyric acid - GABA). The application of machine learning holds promise for further understanding the complex relationship between microbiota and these psychiatric disorders. The observed results should be treated with caution due to the limitations of this study (mainly sample size), therefore further researches under standardized environmental conditions with consistent analytical and bioinformatics approaches are warranted.",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2024,Agata Misera; Mariusz Kaczmarczyk; Igor Åoniewski; PaweÅ LiÅkiewicz; Konrad PodsiadÅo; BÅaÅ¼ej Misiak; Karolina Skonieczna-Å»ydecka; Jerzy Samochowiec

38589422,Transplantation of gut microbiota derived from patients with schizophrenia induces schizophrenia-like behaviors and dysregulated brain transcript response in mice.,"Schizophrenia (SCZ), as a neurodevelopmental disorder and devastating disease, affects approximately 1% of the world population. Although numerous studies have attempted to elucidate the causes of SCZ occurrence, it is not clearly understood. Recently, the emerging roles of the gut microbiota in a range of brain disorders, including SCZ, have attracted much attention. While the molecular mechanism of gut microbiota in regulating the pathogenesis of SCZ is still lacking. Here, we first confirmed the difference of gut microbiome between SCZ patients and healthy controls, and then, we performed fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to clarify the roles of SCZ patients-derived microbiota in a specific pathogen free (SPF) mice model. 16âS rDNA sequencing confirmed that a significant difference of gut microbiome was present between two groups of FMT mice, which has a similar trend with the above human gut microbiome. Furthermore, we found that transplantation of fecal microbiota from SCZ patients into SPF mice was sufficient to induce schizophrenia-like (SCZ-like) symptoms, such as deficits in sociability and hyperactivity. Furthermore, the brains of mice colonized with SCZ microbiota displayed dysregulated transcript response and alternative splicing of SCZ-relevant genes. Moreover, 10 key genes were identified to be correlated with SCZ by an integrative transcriptome data analysis. Finally, 4 key genes were identified to be correlated with the 12 differential genera between two groups of FMT mice. Our results thus demonstrated that the gut microbiome might modify the transcriptomic profile in the brain, thereby modulating social behavior, and our present study can help better understand the link between gut microbiota and SCZ pathogenesis through the gut-brain axis.","Schizophrenia (Heidelberg, Germany)",2024,Nana Wei; Mingliang Ju; Xichen Su; Yan Zhang; Yonghe Huang; Xinyue Rao; Li Cui; Zhibing Lin; Yi Dong
38983862,Current landscape of fecal microbiota transplantation in treating depression.,"Depression, projected to be the predominant contributor to the global disease burden, is a complex condition with diverse symptoms including mood disturbances and cognitive impairments. Traditional treatments such as medication and psychotherapy often fall short, prompting the pursuit of alternative interventions. Recent research has highlighted the significant role of gut microbiota in mental health, influencing emotional and neural regulation. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), the infusion of fecal matter from a healthy donor into the gut of a patient, emerges as a promising strategy to ameliorate depressive symptoms by restoring gut microbial balance. The microbial-gut-brain (MGB) axis represents a critical pathway through which to potentially rectify dysbiosis and modulate neuropsychiatric outcomes. Preclinical studies reveal that FMT can enhance neurochemicals and reduce inflammatory markers, thereby alleviating depressive behaviors. Moreover, FMT has shown promise in clinical settings, improving gastrointestinal symptoms and overall quality of life in patients with depression. The review highlights the role of the gut-brain axis in depression and the need for further research to validate the long-term safety and efficacy of FMT, identify specific therapeutic microbial strains, and develop targeted microbial modulation strategies. Advancing our understanding of FMT could revolutionize depression treatment, shifting the paradigm toward microbiome-targeting therapies.",Frontiers in immunology,2024,Qi Zhang; Yajun Bi; Boyu Zhang; Qiong Jiang; Chao Kam Mou; Lelin Lei; Yibo Deng; Yutong Li; Jing Yu; Wei Liu; Jinzhu Zhao
39015337,Investigations of microbiota composition and neuroactive pathways in association with symptoms of stress and depression in a cohort of healthy women.,"Despite mounting evidence of gut-brain involvement in psychiatric conditions, functional data remain limited, and analyses of other microbial niches, such as the vaginal microbiota, are lacking in relation to mental health. This aim of this study was to investigate if the connections between the gut microbiome and mental health observed in populations with a clinical diagnosis of mental illness extend to healthy women experiencing stress and depressive symptoms. Additionally, this study examined the functional pathways of the gut microbiota according to the levels of psychological symptoms. Furthermore, the study aimed to explore potential correlations between the vaginal microbiome and mental health parameters in young women without psychiatric diagnoses.In this cross-sectional study, 160 healthy Danish women (aged 18-40 years) filled out questionnaires with validated scales measuring symptoms of stress and depression and frequency of dietary intake. Fecal and vaginal microbiota samples were collected at the beginning of the menstrual cycle and vaginal samples were also collected at cycle day 8-12 and 18-22. Shotgun metagenomic profiling of the gut and vaginal microbiome was performed. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) was used for functional profiling and 56 Gut Brain Modules were analyzed in the fecal samples.The relative abundance in the gut of the genera <i>Escherichia</i>, <i>Parabacteroides</i>, and <i>Shigella</i> was higher in women with elevated depressive symptoms. Women with high perceived stress showed a tendency of increased abundance of <i>Escherichia</i>, <i>Shigella</i>, and <i>Blautia</i>. Amongst others, the potentially pathogenic genera, Escherichia and Shigella correlate with alterations in the neuroactive pathways such as the glutamatergic, GABAeric, dopaminergic, and Kynurenine pathways. Vaginosis symptoms were more prevalent in women reporting high levels of stress and depressive symptoms.The findings of this study support the concept of a microbiota-associated effect on the neuroactive pathways even in healthy young women. This suggest, that targeting the gut microbiome could be a promising approach for future psychiatric interventions.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2024,Zahra Bashir; Luisa W Hugerth; Maria Christine Krog; Stefanie Prast-Nielsen; Gabriella Edfeldt; Fredrik Boulund; Simon RÃ¸nnow Schacht; Inge Tetens; Lars Engstrand; Ina Schuppe-Koistinen; Emma Fransson; Henriette Svarre Nielsen
39134099,Contrasting the pharmacokinetic performance and gut microbiota effects of an amorphous solid dispersion and lipid nanoemulsion for a poorly water-soluble anti-psychotic.,"Increasing attention is being afforded to understanding the bidirectional relationship that exists between oral drugs and the gut microbiota. Often overlooked, however, is the impact that pharmaceutical excipients exert on the gut microbiota. Subsequently, in this study, we contrasted the pharmacokinetic performance and gut microbiota interactions between two commonly employed formulations for poorly soluble compounds, namely 1) an amorphous solid dispersion (ASD) stabilised by poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) K-30, and 2) a lipid nanoemulsion (LNE) comprised of medium chain glycerides and lecithin. The poorly soluble antipsychotic, lurasidone, was formulated with ASD and LNE due to its rate-limiting dissolution, poor oral bioavailability, and significant food effect. Both the ASD and LNE were shown to facilitate lurasidone supersaturation within in vitro dissolution studies simulating the gastrointestinal environment. This translated into profound improvements in oral pharmacokinetics in rats, with the ASD and LNE exerting comparableÂ â¼Â 2.5-fold improvements in lurasidone bioavailability, compared to the pure drug. The oral formulations imparted contrasting effects on the gut microbiota, with the LNE depleting the richness and abundance of the microbial ecosystem, as evidenced through reductions in alpha diversity (Chao1 index) and operational taxonomical units (OTUs). In contrast, the ASD exerted a 'gut neutral' effect, whereby a mild enrichment of alpha diversity and OTUs was observed. Importantly, this suggests that ASDs are effective solubility-enhancing formulations that can be used without comprising the integrity of the gut microbiota - an integral consideration in the treatment of mental health disorders, such as schizophrenia, due to the role of the gut microbiota in regulating mood and cognition.",European journal of pharmaceutics and biopharmaceutics : official journal of Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Pharmazeutische Verfahrenstechnik e.V,2024,Tahlia R Meola; Srinivas Kamath; Aurelia S Elz; Clive A Prestidge; Anthony Wignall; Paul Joyce
38707924,The influence of the gut-brain axis on anxiety and depression: A review of the literature on the use of probiotics.,"This review aims to argue how using probiotics can improve anxiety and depressive behaviour without adverse effects, also exploring the impact of postbiotics on it. Specifically, probiotics have drawn more attention as effective alternative treatments, considering the rising cost of antidepressant and anti-anxiety drugs and the high risk of side effects. Depression and anxiety disorders are among the most common mental illnesses in the world's population, characterised by low mood, poor general interest, and cognitive or motor dysfunction. Thus, this study analysed published literature on anxiety, depression, and probiotic supplementation from PubMed and Scopus, focusing on the last twenty years. This study focused on the effect of probiotics on mental health as they have drawn more attention because of their extensive clinical applications and positive impact on various diseases. Numerous studies have demonstrated how the gut microbiota might be critical for mood regulation and how probiotics can affect host health by regulating the gut-brain axis. By comparing the different works analysed, it was possible to identify a strategy by which they are selected and employed and, at the same time, to assess how the effect of probiotics can be optimised using postbiotics, an innovation to improve mental well-being in humans.",Journal of traditional and complementary medicine,2024,Sara Ferrari; Simone MulÃ¨; Francesca Parini; Rebecca Galla; Sara Ruga; Giorgia Rosso; Arianna Brovero; Claudio Molinari; Francesca Uberti
38350463,Gut production of GABA by a probiotic formula: an in vitro study.,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of a probiotic formula on the production of neuroactive compounds in different parts of the colon in batch culture and in vitro gut simulator experiments. Thirteen lactic acid bacterial strains, belonging to the species Levilactobacillus brevis, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei, Ligilactobacillus salivarius, Streptococcus thermophilus, were characterised for their in vitro ability to produce neurotransmitters. L. brevis P30021 and L. plantarum P30025 were selected based on their capability to produce Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and acetylcholine in vitro. A probiotic formulation with potential psychobiotic activity was prepared and tested in a batch culture of human microbiota monitoring the formation of GABA and acetylcholine. Samples of the three colonic tracts were taken from the Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbiota (SHIMEÂ®) evaluating the production of GABA and other neurotransmitters by LC-MS. Short chain fatty acids (SCFA) by GC and microbiota composition by 16S rRNA gene sequencing were also determined. Probiotic supplementation led to the formation of GABA and acetylcholine with a decrease in glutamate concentrations in the in vitro batch fermentation. Production of GABA after the treatment with probiotics was confirmed in the SHIMEÂ® short-term experiment. No differences in short-chain fatty acids were observed up to 72Â h of fermentation. Different microbiota composition was found in the three different parts of the colon, with a higher abundance of Veillonellaceae in the ascending colon vessels. The probiotic-exposed microbiota showed higher levels of Bacteroides, a gut microbe associated with anti-inflammatory activities and a potential GABA producer. Results demonstrate the impact of the tested probiotic formula on gut microbiota structure and GABA production. In conclusion, the probiotic treatment changed the microbiota composition and increased neuroactive metabolites production, indicating promising potential as psychobiotics, even if further clinical evidence is needed to confirm the effectiveness of these probiotics in improving mental health.",Beneficial microbes,2024,M Casertano; C Fryganas; V Valentino; A D Troise; P Vitaglione; V Fogliano; D Ercolini
39021622,Baseline gut microbiota profiles affect treatment response in patients with depression.,"The role of the gut microbiota in the pathophysiology of depression has been explored in numerous studies, which have confirmed that the baseline gut microbial profiles of patients with depression differ from those of healthy individuals. The gut microbiome affects metabolic activity in the immune and central nervous systems and regulates intestinal ecology through the neuroendocrine system. Additionally, baseline changes in the gut microbiota differed among patients with depression who demonstrated varying treatment response. Currently, probiotics are an emerging treatment for depression; however, the efficacy of modulating the gut microbiota in the treatment of depression remains uncertain. Additionally, the mechanisms by which changes in the gut microbiota affect treatment response in patients with depression remain unclear. In this review, we aimed to summarize the differences in the baseline gut microbiota between the remission and non-remission groups after antidepressant therapy. Additionally, we summarized the possible mechanisms that may contribute to antidepressant resistance through the effects of the gut microbiome on the immune and nervous systems, various enzymes, bioaccumulation, and blood-brain barrier, and provide a basis for treating depression by targeting the gut microbiota.",Frontiers in microbiology,2024,Yingjing Xie; Hanwen Zhu; Yanling Yuan; Xuan Guan; Qinglian Xie; Zaiquan Dong
39203794,Effects of Physical Exercise on the Microbiota in Irritable Bowel Syndrome.,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a prevalent functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, and constipation. Recent studies have underscored the significant role of the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBS. Physical exercise, as a non-pharmacological intervention, has been proposed to alleviate IBS symptoms by modulating the gut microbiota. Aerobic exercise, such as running, swimming, and cycling, has been shown to enhance the diversity and abundance of beneficial gut bacteria, including Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. These bacteria produce short-chain fatty acids that possess anti-inflammatory properties and support gut barrier integrity. Studies involving IBS patients participating in structured aerobic exercise programs have reported significant improvements in their gut microbiota's composition and diversity, alongside an alleviation of symptoms like abdominal pain and bloating. Additionally, exercise positively influences mental health by reducing stress and improving mood, which can further relieve IBS symptoms via the gut-brain axis. Long-term exercise interventions provide sustained benefits, maintaining the gut microbiota's diversity and stability, supporting immune functions, and reducing systemic inflammation. However, exercise programs must be tailored to individual needs to avoid exacerbating IBS symptoms. Personalized exercise plans starting with low-to-moderate intensity and gradually increasing in intensity can maximize the benefits and minimize risks. This review examines the impact of various types and intensities of physical exercise on the gut microbiota in IBS patients, highlighting the need for further studies to explore optimal exercise protocols. Future research should include larger sample sizes, longer follow-up periods, and examine the synergistic effects of exercise and other lifestyle modifications. Integrating physical exercise into comprehensive IBS management plans can enhance symptom control and improve patients' quality of life.",Nutrients,2024,Chunpeng Li; Jianmin Li; Qiaorui Zhou; Can Wang; Jiahui Hu; Chang Liu
38565567,Gamma-aminobutyric acid as a potential postbiotic mediator in the gut-brain axis.,"Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) plays a crucial role in the central nervous system as an inhibitory neurotransmitter. Imbalances of this neurotransmitter are associated with neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, and psychological disorders, including anxiety, depression, and stress. Since GABA has long been believed to not cross the blood-brain barrier, the effects of circulating GABA on the brain are neglected. However, emerging evidence has demonstrated that changes in both circulating and brain levels of GABA are associated with changes in gut microbiota composition and that changes in GABA levels and microbiota composition play a role in modulating mental health. This recent research has raised the possibility that GABA may be a potent mediator of the gut-brain axis. This review article will cover up-to-date information about GABA-producing microorganisms isolated from human gut and food sources, explanation why those microorganisms produce GABA, food factors inducing gut-GABA production, evidence suggesting GABA as a mediator linking between gut microbiota and mental health, including anxiety, depression, stress, epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and novel information regarding homocarnosine-a predominant brain peptide that is a putative downstream mediator of GABA in regulating brain functions. This review will help us to understand how the gut microbiota and GABA-homocarnosine metabolism play a significant role in brain functions.

39065244,Gut Microbiota Composition Is Causally Linked to Multiple Sclerosis: A Mendelian Randomization Analysis.,"Accumulating evidence links the microbial communities inhabiting the gut to the pathophysiological processes underlying multiple sclerosis (MS). However, most studies on the microbiome in MS are correlative in nature, thus being at risk of confounding and reverse causality. Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses allow the estimation of the causal relationship between a risk factor and an outcome of interest using genetic variants as proxies for environmental exposures. Here, we performed a two-sample MR to assess the causality between the gut microbiome and MS. We extracted genetic instruments from summary statistics from three large genome-wide association studies (GWASs) on the gut microbiome (18,340, 8959, and 7738 subjects). The exposure data were derived from the latest GWAS on MS susceptibility (47,429 patients and 68,374 controls). We pinpointed several microbial strains whose abundance is linked with enhanced MS risk (<i>Actinobacteria</i> class, <i>Bifidobacteriaceae</i> family, <i>Lactobacillus</i> genus) or protection (<i>Prevotella</i> spp., <i>Lachnospiranaceae</i> genus, <i>Negativibacillus</i> genus). The largest risk effect was seen for <i>Ruminococcus Torques</i> (OR, 2.89, 95% C.I. 1.67-5, <i>p</i> = 1.51 Ã 10<sup>-4</sup>), while <i>Akkermansia municiphila</i> emerged as strongly protective (OR, 0.43, 95% C.I. 0.32-0.57, <i>p</i> = 1.37 Ã 10<sup>-8</sup>). Our findings support a causal relationship between the gut microbiome and MS susceptibility, reinforcing the relevance of the microbiome-gut-brain axis in disease etiology, opening wider perspectives on host-environmental interactions for MS prevention.",Microorganisms,2024,Valeria Zancan; Martina Nasello; Rachele Bigi; Roberta ReniÃ¨; Maria Chiara Buscarinu; Rosella Mechelli; Giovanni Ristori; Marco Salvetti; Gianmarco Bellucci
38903788,"Investigating the effects of radiation, T cell depletion, and bone marrow transplantation on murine gut microbiota.","Microbiome research has gained much attention in recent years as the importance of gut microbiota in regulating host health becomes increasingly evident. However, the impact of radiation on the microbiota in the murine bone marrow transplantation model is still poorly understood. In this paper, we present key findings from our study on how radiation, followed by bone marrow transplantation with or without T cell depletion, impacts the microbiota in the ileum and caecum. Our findings show that radiation has different effects on the microbiota of the two intestinal regions, with the caecum showing increased interindividual variation, suggesting an impaired ability of the host to regulate microbial symbionts, consistent with the Anna Karenina principle. Additionally, we observed changes in the ileum composition, including an increase in bacterial taxa that are important modulators of host health, such as <i>Akkermansia</i> and <i>Faecalibaculum</i>. In contrast, radiation in the caecum was associated with an increased abundance of several common commensal taxa in the gut, including <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> and <i>Bacteroides</i>. Finally, we found that high doses of radiation had more substantial effects on the caecal microbiota of the T-cell-depleted group than that of the non-T-cell-depleted group. Overall, our results contribute to a better understanding of the complex relationship between radiation and the gut microbiota in the context of bone marrow transplantation and highlight the importance of considering different intestinal regions when studying microbiome responses to environmental stressors.",Frontiers in microbiology,2024,Jakub Kreisinger; James Dooley; Kailash Singh; Dagmar ÄÃ­Å¾kovÃ¡; Lucie SchmiedovÃ¡; Barbora BendovÃ¡; Adrian Liston; Alena Moudra
38405047,Depression and the Aberrant Intestinal Microbiome.,"Depression is one of the most common mental health disorders affecting adults in the United States. The current treatment is the combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. Recently, the evidence linking gut microbiome dysregulation to the development of depression has grown. The pathophysiology is currently poorly understood, although leading hypotheses include involvement of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, a bidirectional relationship between the gut microbiome and the central nervous system, and production of signaling molecules by the gut microbiome. Available and emerging treatments of the aberrant microbiome include antidepressants, antibiotics, diet modification, probiotics, and fecal microbiota transplant.

38875919,Antibiotic exposure and depression incidence: A cohort study of the Korean population.,"Recent research highlights the crucial role of the gut-brain axis in understanding depression etiologies. While burgeoning studies suggest an association between disruptions in gut microbiota and the development of depression, limited longitudinal studies have investigated this link. To address this gap, we conducted a retrospective cohort study using National Health Insurance Service-Health Screening Cohort (NHIS-HEALS) data in South Korea, involving 199,144 individuals aged 40-79. We examined the impact of cumulative antibiotic exposure (2004-2008) on subsequent depression incidence (2009-2013) by conducting Cox proportional hazards regressions. Our findings show an increasing depression risk with extended antibiotic exposure after adjusting for comorbidities and behavioral covariates. A broader antibiotic spectrum was associated with a higher depression risk. These trends persisted after adjusting for the original antibiotic indications. In conclusion, our study highlights the duration-dependent association between antibiotic exposure and increased depression risk, offering insights into depression etiologies and relevant novel therapeutic tools, and advocating for heightened antibiotic stewardship considering their impact on mental health.",Psychiatry research,2024,Jaewon Lee; Sun Jae Park; Seulggie Choi; Jooyoung Chang; Young Jun Park; Seogsong Jeong; Joung Sik Son; Gyeongsil Lee; Joseph C Ahn; Jihoon Andrew Kim; Sang Min Park
39125364,Maternal Fiber Intake and Perinatal Depression and Anxiety.,"(1) Background: Dietary fiber can significantly alter gut microbiota composition. The role of the gut microbiome in the Gut-Brain Axis and modulation of neuropsychiatric disease is increasingly recognized. The role of antenatal diet, particularly fiber intake, in mitigating maternal mental health disorders remains unexplored. The objective of this review is to investigate the association between maternal fiber intake and perinatal depression and anxiety (PDA). (2) Methods: A literature review of PubMed and Google Scholar was conducted using appropriate keyword/MeSH terms for pregnancy, diet, fiber, and mental health. Observational and clinical trials published between 2015 and 2021 were included and data pertaining to dietary patterns (DP), food intake, mental health, and demographic data were extracted. The top three fiber-containing food groups (FG) per study were identified using a sum rank scoring system of fiber per 100 g and fiber per serving size. The consumption of these top three fiber FGs was then ranked for each dietary pattern/group. Mental health outcomes for each study were simplified into three categories of improved, no change, and worsened. The relationship between top three fiber FGs consumed within each DP and mental health outcomes was analyzed using Spearman's correlation. (3) Results: Thirteen of fifty-two studies met the inclusion criteria. Ten (76.9%) studies assessed DPs (seven examined depression only, two examined depression and anxiety, and one examined anxiety only). Seven (53.9%) studies reported at least one significant positive relationship between mental health outcomes and DPs while three reported at least one negative outcome. Three (23.1%) studies compared intake of different food groups between depressed and non-depressed groups. In studies of DPs, the average consumption ranking of the top three fiber FGs bore a significant inverse association with mental health outcomes [r = -0.419 (95%CI: -0.672--0.078)] <i>p</i> = 0.015. In studies comparing the intake of different FGs between depressed and non-depressed groups, the consumption of top-ranking fiber foods was higher in the non-depressed groups, but significantly higher in four of the ten high fiber FGs. (4) Conclusions: This study reframes findings from previously published studies of maternal diet and mental health outcomes to focus on fiber intake specifically, using a fiber ranking system. A significant correlation between lower intake of fiber and poorer mental health outcomes warrants further investigation in future studies.",Nutrients,2024,Neda Ebrahimi; Tiffany Turner; Faith Gallant; Abinaa Chandrakumar; Roshni Kohli; Rebecca Lester; Victoria Forte; Kieran Cooley

To address such dysbiosis, it seems reasonable to supplement ""what is missing"" during C-section procedure. This idea has prompted several clinical trials, including proof-of-concept, investigating interventions like vaginal microbial seeding, oral administration of maternal vaginal microbes and even oral administration of maternal fecal materials.

39187187,Is anxiety and depression transmissible? Depressed mother rats transmit anxiety- and depression-like phenotypes to cohabited rat pups through gut microbiota assimilation.,"This study is to investigate the role of gut microbiota transmission in the development of anxiety/depression in offspring exposed to maternal depression.Offspring rats were cohabitated with their depressed mother or father rats (which exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)) for 2, 4, and 6Â months, the anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, and interaction/caring activities between mother/father and their pups were detected. The gut microbiota composition and its relationship with behaviors were analyzed. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) was performed to establish the gut microbiota of depressed/normal mother rats in the offspring rats to further confirm the role of ""depressive gut microbiota"" transmission in mediating the anxiety/depression in the pups.Anxiety and depression phenotypes can be transmitted from depressed mother rats to their cohabited offspring. Frequent interactions and gut microbiota assimilation were observed between rat mothers and their pups. Remodeling of the gut microbiota in pups by FMT could induce or attenuate anxiety- and depression-like phenotypes depending on the origin of the fecal microbiota. By comparison, the pups cohabiting with depressed father rats exhibited milder anxiety and depression.These data together support that depressed mothers can transmit anxiety/depression to their pups through gut microbiota assimilation, which is related to frequent interactions. Our study reinforces the significance of mental health of mothers in preventing the occurrence of childhood anxiety and depression, and pointing out the possibility of remodeling intestinal microbiota as an effective therapeutic approach for treating anxiety/depression in children.",Journal of affective disorders,2024,Huiliang Zhang; Hui Wei; Xuan Qin; Haiyue Song; Mengzhe Yang; Lun Zhang; Yi Liu; Zhuoqun Wang; Yiren Zhang; Yiwen Lai; Jiayu Yang; Yu Chen; Zhongshan Chen; Ji Zeng; Xiaochuan Wang; Rong Liu

The utilisation of chemicals in food production, which results in residues in food, has emerged as a major concern nowadays. By exploring the intricate relationship between environmental pollutants and gut microbiota, the study reveals a dynamic bidirectional interplay, as modifying microbiota profile influences metabolic pathways and subsequent brain functions. This review will first provide an overview of potential exposomes and their effect to gut health. This paper is then emphasis the connection of gut brain function by analysing microbiome markers with neurotoxicity responses. We then take pesticide as example of exposome to elucidate their influence to biomarkers biosynthesis pathways and subsequent brain functions. The interconnection between neuroendocrine and neuromodulators elements and the gut-brain axis emerges as a pivotal factor in regulating mental health and brain development.

39339649,Nutraceutical Capsules LL1 and Silymarin Supplementation Act on Mood and Sleep Quality Perception by Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis: A Pilot Clinical Study.,"Stress, unhealthy lifestyle, and sleep disturbance worsen cognitive function in mood disorders, prompting a rise in the development of integrative health approaches. The recent investigations in the gut-brain axis field highlight the strong interplay among microbiota, inflammation, and mental health. Thus, this study aimed to investigate a new nutraceutical formulation comprising prebiotics, minerals, and silymarin's impact on microbiota, inflammation, mood, and sleep quality. The study evaluated the LL1 + silymarin capsule supplementation over 180 days in overweight adults. We analyzed the fecal gut microbiota using partial 16S rRNA sequences, measured cytokine expression via CBA, collected anthropometric data, quality of life, and sleep questionnaire responses, and obtained plasma samples for metabolic and hormonal analysis at baseline (T0) and 180 days (T180) post-supplementation. Our findings revealed significant reshaping in gut microbiota composition at the phylum, genus, and species levels, especially in the butyrate-producer bacteria post-supplementation. These changes in gut microbiota were linked to enhancements in sleep quality, mood perception, cytokine expression, and anthropometric measures which microbiota-derived short-chain fatty acids might enhance. The supplementation tested in this study seems to be able to improve microbiota composition, reflecting anthropometrics and inflammation, as well as sleep quality and mood improvement.",Nutrients,2024,Aline Boveto Santamarina; Victor Nehmi Filho; JÃ©ssica Alves de Freitas; Lucas Augusto MoysÃ©s Franco; Joyce Vanessa Fonseca; Roberta Cristina Martins; JosÃ© AntÃ´nio Orellana Turri; Bruna Fernanda Rio Branco da Silva; Arianne Fagotti GusmÃ£o; EloÃ­sa Helena Ribeiro Olivieri; JosÃ© Pinhata Otoch; Ana FlÃ¡via MarÃ§al Pessoa
39121711,The gut-microbiome in adult Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder - A Meta-analysis.,"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental condition that persists into adulthood in the majority of individuals. While the gut-microbiome seems to be relevant for ADHD, the few publications on gut-microbial alterations in ADHD are inconsistent, in the investigated phenotypes, sequencing method/region, preprocessing, statistical approaches, and findings. To identify gut-microbiome alterations in adult ADHD, robust across studies and statistical approaches, we harmonized bioinformatic pipelines and analyses of raw 16S rRNA sequencing data from four adult ADHD case-control studies (N<sub>ADHD</sub>=312, N<sub>NoADHD</sub>=305). We investigated diversity and differential abundance of selected genera (logistic regression and ANOVA-like Differential Expression tool), corrected for age and sex, and meta-analyzed the study results. Converging results were investigated for association with hyperactive/impulsive and inattentive symptoms across all participants. Beta diversity was associated with ADHD diagnosis but showed significant heterogeneity between cohorts, despite harmonized analyses. Several genera were robustly associated with adult ADHD; e.g., Ruminococcus_torques_group (LogOdds=0.17, p<sub>fdr</sub>=4.42 Ã 10<sup>-2</sup>), which was more abundant in adults with ADHD, and Eubacterium_xylanophilum_group (LogOdds= -0.12, p<sub>fdr</sub>=6.9 Ã 10<sup>-3</sup>), which was less abundant in ADHD. Ruminococcus_torques_group was further associated with hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms and Eisenbergiella with inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity (p<sub>fdr</sub><0.05). The literature points towards a role of these genera in inflammatory processes. Irreproducible results in the field of gut-microbiota research, due to between study heterogeneity and small sample sizes, stress the need for meta-analytic approaches and large sample sizes.

39195546,Alterations in Vagal Tone Are Associated with Changes in the Gut Microbiota of Adults with Anxiety and Depression Symptoms: Analysis of Fecal Metabolite Profiles.,"Accumulating evidence suggests that interactions between the brain and gut microbiota significantly impact brain function and mental health. In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether young, healthy adults without psychiatric diagnoses exhibit differences in metabolic stool and microbiota profiles based on depression/anxiety scores and heart rate variability (HRV) parameters. Untargeted nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabolomics was used to identify fecal metabolic profiles. Results were subjected to multivariate analysis through principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and the metabolites were identified through VIP score. Metabolites separating asymptomatic and symptomatic groups were acetate, valine, and glutamate, followed by sugar regions, glutamine, acetone, valerate, and acetoacetate. The main metabolites identified in high vagal tone (HVT) and low vagal tone (LVT) groups were acetate, valerate, and glutamate, followed by propionate and butyrate. In addition to the metabolites identified by the PLS-DA test, significant differences in aspartate, sarcosine, malate, and methionine were observed between the groups. Levels of acetoacetate were higher in both symptomatic and LVT groups. Valerate levels were significantly increased in the symptomatic group, while isovalerate, propionate, glutamate, and acetone levels were significantly increased in the LVT group. Furthermore, distinct abundance between groups was only confirmed for the Firmicutes phylum. Differences between participants with high and low vagal tone suggest that certain metabolites are involved in communication between the vagus nerve and the brain.",Metabolites,2024,Laura Pasqualette; Tatiana Kelly da Silva Fidalgo; Liana Bastos Freitas-Fernandes; Gabriela Guerra Leal Souza; LuÃ­s Aureliano Imbiriba; Leandro Araujo Lobo; Eliane Volchan; Regina Maria Cavalcanti Pilotto Domingues; Ana Paula Valente; Karla Rodrigues Miranda
39247907,Modifications in the Composition of the Gut Microbiota in Rats Induced by Chronic Sleep Deprivation: Potential Relation to Mental Disorders.,"Sleep deprivation(SD) has numerous negative effects on mental health. A growing body of research has confirmed the implication of gut microbiota in mental disorders. However, the specific modifications in mammalian gut microbiota following SD exhibit variations across different studies.Male specific-pathogen-free Wistar rats were given a modified multiple-platform exposure for 7 days of SD. Fecal samples were obtained from the control and SD groups both at baseline and after 7 days of SD. We utilized 16S rDNA gene sequencing to investigate the gut microbial composition and functional pathways in rats.Analysis of the microbiota composition revealed a significant change in gut microbial composition after chronic SD, especially at the phylum level. The relative abundances of <i>p_Firmicutes, g_Romboutsia</i>, and <i>g_Enterococcus</i> increased, whereas those of <i>p_Bacteroidetes, p_Verrucomicrobia, p_Fusobacteria, g_Akkermansia</i>, and <i>g_Cetobacterium</i> decreased in animals after chronic SD compared with controls or animals before SD. The ratio of <i>Firmicutes</i> to <i>Bacteroidetes</i> exhibited an increase following SD. The relative abundance of gut microbiota related to the functional pathways of GABAergic and glutamatergic synapses was observed to be diminished in rats following SD compared to pre-SD.Collectively, these findings suggest that chronic SD causes significant alterations in both the structural composition and functional pathways of the gut microbiome. Further researches are necessary to investigate the chronological and causal connections among SD, the gut microbiota and mental disorders.",Nature and science of sleep,2024,Li-Ming Zheng; Yan Li
38852801,Levilactobacillus brevis SG031 modulates mood-related behaviors and attenuates stress-related sleep disturbance and autonomic dysfunction via gut microbiota modulation in Wistar-Kyoto rats.,"The probiotic bacterium Levilactobacillus brevis (L. brevis) has been proposed as a potential solution to manage mood disorders and alleviate stress-related sleep disturbances. However, the underlying mechanisms of its effects have not been fully elucidated. The aim of this study was to explore the impact and potential mechanisms of L. brevis SG031 supplementation on anxiety/depression-like behaviors and stress-induced changes in sleep patterns and sleep-related autonomic function.Male Wistar-Kyoto rats were administered low, medium, or high doses of L. brevis SG031 or a vehicle for 4Â weeks, followed by behavioral tests to evaluate anxiety and depression. After an additional 2Â weeks of SG031 or vehicle administration, a cage-exchange paradigm was performed with 24-hour physiological signal measurements under different stress conditions. Fecal samples were collected to construct a 16S rRNA library and assess fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs).High-dose SG031 administration yielded reduced depression-like responses and enhanced social interaction in behavioral tests. It also exhibited a protective effect against stress-induced sleep disturbance characterized by decreased sleep time, increased awake time, and autonomic dysfunction during sleep. Fecal examination indicated that high-dose SG031 administration exerted beneficial effects on gut health by maintaining the gut microbial abundance, preserving stability of the microbial composition, and enriching the gut with SCFAs, which were associated with improvements in sleep and autonomic function.These findings collectively underscore the multifaceted potential of SG031 in addressing mental health and stress-related sleep challenges through the modulation of the gut microbiota.",Life sciences,2024,Chieh-Wen Chen; Hung-Chang Chen; Sheng-Chieh She; Chun-Ting Lai; Wei-Jen Chen; Terry B J Kuo; Cheryl C H Yang
38959253,Perturbations in gut microbiota composition in schizophrenia.,"Schizophrenia is a severe, complex and long-term psychiatric disorder with unclear etiology. Gut microbes influence the central nervous system via the gut-brain axis. Consequently, investigations of the relationship between gut microbes and schizophrenia are warranted. This study involved 29 patients with schizophrenia and 30 age-matched normal controls. After 16S rRNA gene sequencing and whole-genome shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we analyzed microbial diversity, composition, and function. According to 16S rRNA and metagenomic gene sequencing results, patients with schizophrenia had higher abundances of Clostridium and Megasphaera. Functional analysis showed that sphingolipid, phosphonates and phosphinates, as well as glutamine metabolism were associated with the occurrence and development of schizophrenia. Our data suggest that the gut microbiota exerts an effect on patients with schizophrenia, providing valuable insights into the potential regulation of in the context of this disorder.",PloS one,2024,YiMeng Wang; SiGuo Bi; XiaoLong Li; YuTao Zhong; DongDong Qi
38663221,Effects of antipsychotics on the gastrointestinal microbiota: A systematic review.,"Antipsychotics (APs) have been increasingly prescribed for psychiatric disorders from schizophrenia to disruptive behavioral conditions. These drugs have been associated with considerable side effects, such as weight gain, and increasing evidence has also indicated that its use impacts gut microbiota (GM), although this connection is still little understood. To assess APs effects on the GM of patients starting or ongoing treatment, a systematic review was carried out in PubMed and Scopus databases. Twelve articles were considered eligible for the review, which investigated the effects of risperidone (5 studies), quetiapine (3), amilsupride (1), olanzapine (1), and unspecified atypical drugs (2). Eleven reported changes in GM in response to APs, and associations between the abundance of bacterial groups and different metabolic parameters were described by most of them. However, the studies were noticeably heterogeneous considering design, methods, and results. In this way, the effects of APs on GM composition and diversity were inconclusive. Despite the uncertain interactions, a more comprehensive understanding on how microbiota is affected by APs may help to optimize treatment, potentially minimizing side effects and improving adherence to treatment.",Psychiatry research,2024,Marcela FranÃ§a Dias; Yago Jean de Almeida Nogueira; Marco AurÃ©lio Romano-Silva; DÃ©bora Marques de Miranda
39331265,Identification of hsa-miR-193a-5p-SURF4 axis related to the gut microbiota-metabolites- cytokines in lung cancer based on Mendelian randomization study and bioinformatics analysis.,"Lung cancer is a significant disease that affects people's physical and mental health. Currently, the treatment outcomes still do not meet clinical needs, and the causes of the disease are still unclear, therefore further exploration is needed.We analyzed the exposure factors of lung cancer, including gut microbiota, serum metabolites, and cytokines, through Mendelian randomization studies and bioinformatics analysis. We identified common SNPs and performed gene annotation, leading to the discovery of the key gene SURF4, which may affect the onset of lung cancer. We validated the oncogenic function and mechanism of SURF4 through public data analysis using GO and KEGG, and constructed a ceRNA network, revealing the lung cancer oncogenic pathway involving lncRNA/pseudogene-microRNA-SURF4.We first conducted a Mendelian randomization analysis on 418 gut microbiota, 1400 serum metabolites, and 41 cytokines in relation to lung cancer. We found that 16 gut microbiota, 29 serum metabolites, and 2 cytokines were closely associated with lung cancer. Further comparison of all differential SNPs revealed that rs550057 on chromosome 9 was a common SNP among these three exposure factors, indicating its crucial role in lung cancer formation. Through gene functional annotation using R language, we found that the expression of 15 genes, including SURF4, was influenced by rs550057. By querying these 15 genes from public databases for their differential expression and prognosis in lung cancer, we found significant differences in SURF4, MED22, and RPL7A. Furthermore, by querying the expression and correlation coefficients of upstream microRNAs of these three genes through the starBase website, we found that hsa-miR-193a-5p-SURF4 had the most significant effect on lung cancer. Through GO and KEGG analysis of SURF4-related genes, we identified the molecular pathways associated metabolic synthesis and microbial infection related to the promotion of lung cancer by SURF4. This validated the results of the previous Mendelian randomization study. Furthermore, we constructed a ceRNA network for SURF4 and identified two upstream differentially expressed pseudogenes and nine lncRNAs, confirming the functionality of the pseudogene/lncRNA-microRNA-SUFR4 pathway.In summary, we have elucidated the regulatory role of the pseudogene/lncRNA-microRNA-SUFR4 pathway in the progression of lung cancer, combining the research hotspots of gut microbiota-serum metabolites-cytokines. We have also confirmed the pathway and mechanism through SURF4 and its related genes promoting lung cancer formation. This may provide effective therapeutic methods for lung cancer and serve as a potential prognostic marker.",Discover oncology,2024,Jie Yu; Sibo Meng; Tiantian Xuan; Zhanmei Wang; Linli Qu; Fangli Cao; Jiaxin Li
39458509,Gut-Brain Axis and Psychopathology: Exploring the Impact of Diet with a Focus on the Low-FODMAP Approach.,"The gut-brain axis (GBA) is a bidirectional communication network connecting the central nervous system with the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, influencing both mental and physical health. Recent research has underscored the significant role of diet in modulating this axis, with attention to how specific dietary patterns can impact anxiety and depression, particularly when linked to disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBIs), like intestinal bowel syndrome (IBS).This narrative review examines the effects of specific diet regimens on the GBA and its potential role in managing psychopathology, focusing on anxiety and depression, IBS, and the low-FODMAP diet. We conducted a search on PubMed and MEDLINE by combining the following key terms: ""Gut-Brain Axis"", ""Irritable Bowel Syndrome"", ""Low FODMAP diet"", ""Mediterranean Diet"", ""Psychopathology"", ""Anxiety and Depression"", and ""Gut Microbiota"". We applied the following filters: ""Clinical Trials"", ""Randomized Controlled Trials"", ""Reviews"", ""Meta-Analyses"", and ""Systematic Reviews"". In total, 59 papers were included.Low-FODMAP diet, originally developed to alleviate GI symptoms in IBS, may also positively influence mental health by modulating the GBA and improving the gut microbiota (GM) composition. New insights suggest that combining the low-FODMAP diet with the Mediterranean diet could offer a synergistic effect, enhancing both GI and psychological therapeutic outcomes.Understanding the complex interactions between diet, the GM, and mental health opens new avenues for holistic approaches to managing psychopathology, particularly when linked to GI symptoms.",Nutrients,2024,Emanuela Ribichini; Giulia Scalese; Chiara Mocci; Carola Severi
39291634,"A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel trial to test the effect of inulin supplementation on migraine headache characteristics, quality of life and mental health symptoms in women with migraine.","Migraine is a complex neurovascular disorder characterized by recurrent headache attacks that are often accompanied by symptoms such as vomiting, nausea, and sensitivity to sound or light. Preventing migraine attacks is highly important. Recent research has indicated that alterations in gut microbiota may influence the underlying mechanisms of migraines. This study aimed to investigate the effects of inulin supplementation on migraine headache characteristics, quality of life (QOL), and mental health symptoms in women with migraines. In a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial, 80 women with migraines aged 20 to 50 years were randomly assigned to receive 10 g day<sup>-1</sup> of inulin or a placebo supplement for 12 weeks. Severity, frequency, and duration of migraine attacks, as well as depression, anxiety, stress, QOL, and headache impact test (HIT-6) scores, were examined at the start of the study and after 12 weeks of intervention. In this study, the primary outcome focused on the frequency of headache attacks, while secondary outcomes encompassed the duration and severity of headache attacks, QOL, and mental health. There was a significant reduction in severity (-1.95 <i>vs.</i> -0.84, <i>P</i> = 0.004), duration (-6.95 <i>vs.</i> -2.05, <i>P</i> = 0.023), frequency (-2.09 <i>vs.</i> -0.37, <i>P</i> < 0.001), and HIT-6 score (-10.30 <i>vs.</i> -6.52, <i>P</i> < 0.023) in the inulin group compared with the control. Inulin supplementation improved mental health symptoms, including depression (-4.47 <i>vs.</i> -1.45, <i>P</i> < 0.001), anxiety (-4.37 <i>vs.</i> -0.70, <i>P</i> < 0.001), and stress (-4.40 <i>vs.</i> -1.50, <i>P</i> < 0.001). However, no significant difference was observed between the two groups regarding changes in QOL score. This study provides evidence supporting the beneficial effects of inulin supplement on migraine symptoms and mental health status in women with migraines.

38332676,Repeated (<i>S</i>)-ketamine administration ameliorates the spatial working memory impairment in mice with chronic pain: role of the gut microbiota-brain axis.,"Chronic pain is commonly linked with diminished working memory. This study explores the impact of the anesthetic (<i>S</i>)-ketamine on spatial working memory in a chronic constriction injury (CCI) mouse model, focusing on gut microbiome. We found that multiple doses of (<i>S</i>)-ketamine, unlike a single dose, counteracted the reduced spontaneous alteration percentage (%SA) in the Y-maze spatial working memory test, without affecting mechanical or thermal pain sensitivity. Additionally, repeated (<i>S</i>)-ketamine treatments improved the abnormal composition of the gut microbiome (Î²-diversity), as indicated by fecal 16S rRNA analysis, and increased levels of butyrate, a key gut - brain axis mediator. Protein analysis showed that these treatments also corrected the upregulated histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) and downregulated brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampi of CCI mice. Remarkably, fecal microbiota transplantation from mice treated repeatedly with (<i>S</i>)-ketamine to CCI mice restored %SA and hippocampal BDNF levels in CCI mice. Butyrate supplementation alone also improved %SA, BDNF, and HDAC2 levels in CCI mice. Furthermore, the TrkB receptor antagonist ANA-12 negated the beneficial effects of repeated (<i>S</i>)-ketamine on spatial working memory impairment in CCI mice. These results indicate that repeated (<i>S</i>)-ketamine administration ameliorates spatial working memory impairment in CCI mice, mediated by a gut microbiota - brain axis, primarily through the enhancement of hippocampal BDNF - TrkB signaling by butyrate.",Gut microbes,2024,Yubin Jiang; Xingming Wang; Jiawei Chen; Yibao Zhang; Kenji Hashimoto; Jian-Jun Yang; Zhiqiang Zhou
38847603,Comparative analysis of pectin and prebiotics on human microbiota modulation in early life stages and adults.,"The gut microbiota is essential in human health, influencing various physiological processes ranging from digestion and metabolism to immune function and mental health. Dietary fiber pectins and prebiotics have emerged as key modulators of gut microbiota composition and function, offering potential therapeutic implications for promoting gut health and preventing intestinal inflammatory diseases. In this review, we explore the modulation of gut microbiota by dietary fiber pectins and prebiotics in infants and adults. We begin with an overview of the gut microbiota composition and function in different age groups, highlighting the factors in shaping microbial communities in both age groups, especially the effect of diet. We then delve into the impact of dietary fiber pectins and prebiotics on gut microbiota composition and function, examining their effects on digestive health, intestinal barrier integrity, immune function, metabolic health, and mental health across different life stages. We further compare how aging affects the gut function and immune system, and we discuss the main health outcomes associated with dietary fiber intake and prebiotics, including the impact on digestive health, improvement in immune function, improvement in cholesterol and glucose metabolism, weight management, mental health, and prevention of diseases. Finally, we highlight the challenges and future directions for research. By advancing the understanding of gut microbiota dynamics and translating scientific insights into clinical practice, it could harness the full potential of dietary fiber pectins and prebiotics to optimize gut health, improve overall well-being across the lifespan, and increase longevity.",Food & function,2024,Janaina Lombello Santos Donadio; JoÃ£o Paulo Fabi
38928361,A Narrative Review of Intestinal Microbiota's Impact on Migraine with Psychopathologies.,"Migraine is a common and debilitating neurological disorder characterized by the recurrent attack of pulsating headaches typically localized on one side of the head associated with other disabling symptoms, such as nausea, increased sensitivity to light, sound and smell and mood changes. Various clinical factors, including the excessive use of migraine medication, inadequate acute treatment and stressful events, can contribute to the worsening of the condition, which may evolve to chronic migraine, that is, a headache present on >15 days/month for at least 3 months. Chronic migraine is frequently associated with various comorbidities, including anxiety and mood disorders, particularly depression, which complicate the prognosis, response to treatment and overall clinical outcomes. Emerging research indicates a connection between alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota and mental health conditions, particularly anxiety and depression, which are considered disorders of the gut-brain axis. This underscores the potential of modulating the gut microbiota as a new avenue for managing these conditions. In this context, it is interesting to investigate whether migraine, particularly in its chronic form, exhibits a dysbiosis profile similar to that observed in individuals with anxiety and depression. This could pave the way for interventions aimed at modulating the gut microbiota for treating difficult-to-manage migraines.",International journal of molecular sciences,2024,Miriam Francavilla; Sara Facchetti; Chiara Demartini; Anna Maria Zanaboni; Chiara Amoroso; Sara Bottiroli; Cristina Tassorelli; Rosaria Greco
39267834,Changes in the gut microbiota of esophageal carcinoma patients based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"This study conducts a systematic review through meta-analysis, comparing the composition and diversity of the gut microbiome in patients with esophageal cancer and healthy individuals, and explores the relationship between risk factors and related factors of esophageal cancer.According to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), we comprehensively searched the databases of PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library. In addition, we applied the R programming language version 4.0.3 and Stata 15.1 software for data analysis. We also implemented the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), funnel plot analysis, Egger's test, and Begg's test to assess the risk of bias.In this study, a total of 328 studies were identified through the literature search. Among them, 117 duplicate studies were removed, and 202 studies were excluded based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Finally, 9 studies were included in the analysis, involving a total of 216 patients with esophageal carcinoma and 352 healthy controls. Four studies provided Chao1 index for quantitative consolidation (ES = 637.41, 95% CI: 549.16 to 725.66, p = 0.000, I<sup>2</sup> = 98.2%). Two studies [27, 29] reported ACE index (ES = 438.89, 95% CI: 362.42 to 515.35, p = 0.000, I<sup>2</sup> = 97%). Seven studies [26,27,29,30,32] reported the Shannon index for quantitative consolidation (ES = 4.38, 95% CI: 3.95 to 4.81, p = 0.000, I<sup>2</sup> = 99%). At the phylum level, the abundance of Bacteroidetes(ES = 37.8, 95% CI: 25.75 to 49.85, p = 0.000, I2 = 87.2%) and Proteobacteria(ES = 7.48, 95% CI: 5.02 to 8.85, p = 0.04, I<sup>2</sup> = 2.4%) have statistical difference between ESCC and HC. There was no significant difference between ESCC and HC in the abundance of genera(p>0.05).This observational meta-analysis revealed that changes in the GM were correlated with esophageal carcinoma, and variations in some advantageous GM might involve regional differences. Additionally, the study aims to facilitate early diagnosis of esophageal cancer and improve screening and diagnostic efficiency.",Frontiers in oncology,2024,Li Zhang; Delin Li; Yongsheng Zhang; Wenqi Hu; Haoyue Lv; Xiaodong Zhang; Hongyu Zhang
38974216,Vitamin-mediated interaction between the gut microbiome and mitochondria in depression: A systematic review-based integrated perspective.,"Depression is one of the world's most prevalent mental disorders and its treatment remains suboptimal. Depression is a systemic disease with highly complex biological mechanisms. Emerging evidence points towards the involvement of mitochondria, microbiome and vitamins in its pathophysiology. Mitochondrial energy production was shown to be lowered in patients with depression. Mitochondrial energy production depends on vitamins, which are available from food, but are also synthesized by the gut microbiota. Several studies reported altered vitamin levels as well as changes in the gut microbiome composition and its vitamin metabolism in patients with depression. Therefore, the question of a connection between mitochondria and gut microbiome and vitamins influencing the mental health arises. This review aims to systematically investigate a combination of the topics - depression, mitochondria, microbiome, and vitamins - to generate an overview of a novel yet extremely complex and interconnected research field. A systematic literature search yielded 34 articles, and the results were summarized and bundled to develop this new integrative perspective on mitochondrial function mediated by the microbiome and microbiome-derived vitamins in depression. Furthermore, by discussing the research gaps this review aims to encourage innovative research approaches to better understand the biology of depression, which could result in optimized therapeutic approaches.","Brain, behavior, & immunity - health",2024,Ellen Bisle; Suchithra Varadarajan; Iris-Tatjana Kolassa
38401573,A role of gut-brain axis on prophylactic actions of arketamine in male mice exposed to chronic restrain stress.,"The gut-brain axis, which includes gut microbiota and microbiome-derived metabolites, might be implicated in depression. We reported the sustained prophylactic effects of a new antidepressant arketamine in chronic restrain stress (CRS) model of depression. In this study, we investigated the role of gut-brain axis on the prophylactic effects of arketamine in the CRS (7Â days) model. Pretreatment with arketamine (10Â mg/kg, 1Â day prior to the CRS onset) significantly prevented CRS-induced body weight loss, increased immobility time of forced swimming test, decreased sucrose preference of sucrose preference test, and reduced expressions of synaptic proteins (GluA1 and PSD-95) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in the male mice. Gut microbiota analysis showed that pretreatment with arketamine might restore altered abundance of gut microbiota in CRS-exposed mice. An untargeted metabolomics analysis revealed four metabolites (e.g., L-leucine, N-acetyl-l-glutamine, 2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-[4-(dimethylamino)phenyl]acrylonitrile, L-threonine amide) that were altered between control and CRS group; however, there were found to be altered between the saline + CRS group and the arketamine + CRS group. Network analysis demonstrated correlations among synaptic proteins in the PFC and certain microbiota, and blood metabolites. These findings suggest that gut-brain axis, including its metabolites, might partially contribute to the persistent prophylactic effects of arketamine in the CRS model.","Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior",2024,Li Ma; Akifumi Eguchi; Guilin Liu; Youge Qu; Xiayun Wan; Rumi Murayama; Chisato Mori; Kenji Hashimoto
38722169,"Preface: Special issue: ""Ion channels and genetic epilepsy"".","This preface introduces the Journal of Neurochemistry Special Issue on Advances in Epilepsy Research. Epilepsy is a devastating disease characterized by recurrent seizures. Despite the addition of numerous therapeutics over the last few decades epilepsy patients resistant to standard of care treatments remains stubbornly high. This highlights a clear unmet clinical need and the importance of new research into this disease. One major advance over the last two decades has been the recognition that genetic factors play a significant role in the underlying pathogenesis of epilepsy. Much of our insights into the pathogenic mechanisms underlying genetic epilepsy has come from research into genes that encode ion channels. In this issue, there are up-to-date reviews discussing epilepsy caused by variation in HCN channels, voltage-dependent sodium channels, voltage-dependent calcium channels, and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. The reviews highlight our understanding of the genotype-phenotype relationships and the identification of precision medicine approaches. Complimenting this is a review on metabolic aspects modulating ion channels in genetic disease. This issue also has fundamental research manuscripts investigating how currently approved drugs may rescue NMDA receptor dysfunction and how inÂ vitro neuron cultures can be used to probe network scale deficits and drug impacts in SCN2A disease. Other primary data manuscripts include those focusing on metabolic therapies, gut microbiota, and new inÂ vivo screening tools for identifying novel anti-seizure drugs.

38756585,The gut-brain-axis: A positive relationship between gut microbial dysbiosis and glioblastoma brain tumour.,"The glioblastoma brain tumour (GBM) stands out as the most aggressive and resistant-to-treatment malignancy. Nevertheless, the gut-brain connection plays a pivotal role in influencing the growth and activation of the central nervous system. In this particular investigation, we aimed to assess and characterize the gut microbial ecosystem in GBM patients, both quantitatively and qualitatively. We collected faecal samples from 15 healthy volunteers and 25 GBM patients. To delve into the microbial content, we employed PCR-DGGE, targeting the V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene, and conducted qPCR to measure the levels of crucial intestinal bacteria. For a more in-depth analysis, high-throughput sequencing was performed on a selection of 20 random faecal samples (10 from healthy individuals and 10 from GBM patients), targeting the V3+V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Our findings from examining the richness and diversity of the gut microbiota unveiled that GBM patients exhibited significantly higher microbial diversity compared to healthy individuals. At the phylum level, Proteobacteria saw a significant increase, while <i>Firmicutes</i> experienced a noteworthy decrease in the GBM group. Moving down to the family level, we observed significantly elevated levels of <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i>, <i>Bacteroidaceae</i>, and <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> in GBM patients, while levels of <i>Veillonellaceae</i>, <i>Rikenellaceae</i>, and <i>Prevotellaceae</i> were notably lower. Delving into genera statistics, we noted a substantial increase in the abundance of <i>Parasutterella</i>, <i>Escherichia-Shigella</i>, and <i>Bacteroides</i>, alongside significantly lower levels of <i>Ruminococcus 2</i>, <i>Faecalibacterium</i>, and <i>Prevotella_9</i> in the GBM group compared to the control group. Furthermore, when examining specific species, we found a significant increase in <i>Bacteroides vulgatus</i> and <i>Escherichia coli</i> in the GBM group. These observations collectively indicate a marked dysbiosis in the gut microbial composition of GBM patients. Additionally, the GBM group exhibited notably higher levels of alpha diversity when compared to the control group. This increase in diversity suggests a significant bacterial overgrowth in the gut of GBM patients in contrast to the controls. As a result, this research opens up potential avenues to gain a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms, pathways, and potential treatments for GBM, stemming from the significant implications of gut microbial dysbiosis in these patients.",Heliyon,2024,Hafiz Muhammad Ishaq; Riffat Yasin; Imran Shair Mohammad; Yang Fan; Huan Li; Muhammad Shahzad; Jiru Xu

Psychiatric comorbidities, including depression and anxiety, are more prevalent in IBD patients than in healthy individuals. Evidence suggests that varying levels of neuroinflammation might underlie these states in IBD patients. Within this context, microglia are the crucial non-neural cells in the brain responsible for innate immune responses following inflammatory insults.

38606411,Markers of intestinal barrier damage in patients with chronic insomnia disorder.,"Insomnia disorder stands out as one of the prevalent clinical sleep and psychiatric disorders. Prior research has unequivocally demonstrated variations in the diversity and abundance of gut microbiota among individuals with insomnia disorder. These alterations may play a direct or indirect role in the onset and progression of insomnia disorder by compromising the integrity of the intestinal barrier. This study aims to evaluate the impairment of the intestinal barrier in individuals with insomnia disorder by scrutinizing the serum functionality of this barrier.45 patients with chronic insomnia disorder and 30 matched healthy volunteers were meticulously selected based on inclusion criteria. ELISA technology was employed to measure serum levels of diamine oxidase (DAO), D-lactic acid (D-LA), intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP), and endothelin (ET). Spearman correlation analysis was used to explore the relationship between intestinal mucosal markers and clinical characteristics. Data were analyzed using SPSS 26.0.Compared to the healthy control group, the insomnia disorder group exhibited significantly elevated scores on subjective mood and sleep scales (GAD-7, PHQ-9, HAMA, HAMD, PSQI, and ISI) (P < 0.05). Overnight PSG indicated a notable increase in bed time, total wake time, sleep onset latency, and wake after sleep onset in individuals with insomnia disorder. Additionally, there was a decrease in sleep efficiency and alterations in sleep structure (increased proportion of N1 and N3 stages, prolonged N1 stage) (P < 0.05). The chronic insomnia disorder group displayed significantly reduced concentrations of serum DAO, D-LA, I-FABP, and ET (P < 0.05). Furthermore, significant positive correlations were identified between intestinal epithelial barrier markers and sleep efficiency, while negative correlations were found with wake after sleep onset, total wake time, PSQI, HAMA, and HAMD. Additionally, D-LA levels were significantly positively correlated with ET concentrations.Individuals with chronic insomnia disorder manifest disruptions in sleep structure, heightened susceptibility to anxiety and depressive moods, and impaired intestinal barrier function. These findings suggest that the occurrence and development of insomnia disorder may be linked to the impairment of the intestinal barrier.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2024,Yixian Cai; Di Gong; Ting Xiang; Xiaotao Zhang; Jiyang Pan

However, little is known about the role of the gut microbiota in the development of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Here, to investigate the contribution of gut microbiota to the pathogenesis of OCD, we transplanted fecal microbiota from first-episode, drug-naive OCD patients or demographically matched healthy individuals into antibiotic-treated specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice and showed that colonization with OCD microbiota is sufficient to induce core behavioral deficits, including abnormal anxiety-like and compulsive-like behaviors. The fecal microbiota was analyzed using 16âS rRNA full-length sequencing, and the results demonstrated a clear separation of the fecal microbiota of mice colonized with OCD and control microbiota. Notably, microbiota from OCD-colonized mice resulted in injured neuronal morphology and function in the mPFC, with inflammation in the mPFC and colon. Unbiased metabolomic analyses of the serum and mPFC region revealed the accumulation of succinic acid (SA) in OCD-colonized mice. SA impeded neuronal activity and induced an inflammatory response in both the colon and mPFC, impacting intestinal permeability and brain function, which act as vital signal mediators in gut microbiota-brain-immune crosstalk. Manipulations of dimethyl malonate (DM) have been reported to exert neuroprotective effects by suppressing the oxidation of accumulated succinic acid, attenuating the downstream inflammatory response and neuronal damage, and can help to partly improve abnormal behavior and reduce neuroinflammation and intestinal inflammation in OCD-colonized mice. We propose that the gut microbiota likely regulates brain function and behaviors in mice via succinic acid signaling, which contributes to the pathophysiology of OCD through gut-brain crosstalk and may provide new insights into the treatment of this disorder.",Molecular psychiatry,2024,Ying-Dan Zhang; Dong-Dong Shi; Bing-Bing Liao; Yi Li; Sen Zhang; Jian Gao; Liang-Jun Lin; Zhen Wang
38792361,"The Potential Role of the Ketogenic Diet in Serious Mental Illness: Current Evidence, Safety, and Practical Advice.","The ketogenic diet (KD) is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet that mimics the physiological state of fasting. The potential therapeutic effects in many chronic conditions have led to the gaining popularity of the KD. The KD has been demonstrated to alleviate inflammation and oxidative stress, modulate the gut microbiota community, and improve metabolic health markers. The modification of these factors has been a potential therapeutic target in serious mental illness (SMI): bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia. The number of clinical trials assessing the effect of the KD on SMI is still limited. Preliminary research, predominantly case studies, suggests potential therapeutic effects, including weight gain reduction, improved carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, decrease in disease-related symptoms, increased energy and quality of life, and, in some cases, changes in pharmacotherapy (reduction in number or dosage of medication). However, these findings necessitate further investigation through larger-scale clinical trials. Initiation of the KD should occur in a hospital setting and with strict care of a physician and dietitian due to potential side effects of the diet and the possibility of exacerbating adverse effects of pharmacotherapy. An increasing number of ongoing studies examining the KD's effect on mental disorders highlights its potential role in the adjunctive treatment of SMI.",Journal of clinical medicine,2024,Joanna Rog; Zuzanna Wingralek; Katarzyna Nowak; Monika GrudzieÅ; Arkadiusz Grunwald; Agnieszka Banaszek; Hanna Karakula-Juchnowicz
38327077,Metagenomic Analysis Reveals Difference of Gut Microbiota in ADHD.,"Although ADHD is highly heritable, some environmental factors contribute to its development. Given the growing evidence that gut microbiota was involved in psychiatric disorders, we aimed to identify the characteristic composition of the gut microbiota in ADHD.We recruited 47 medication-naive children and adolescents with ADHD, and 60 healthy controls (HCs). We used shotgun metagenomics to measure the structure of the gut microbiota and analyzed the difference in bacterial taxa between ADHD and HCs.Significant differences were found between the ADHD and HC groups in both alpha diversity indices (Simpson index, <i>p</i>â=â.025 and Shannon index, <i>p</i>â=â.049) and beta diversity indices (Euclidean distance, Bray-Curtis distance, and JSD distance, <i>p</i>â<â2.2e-16). Nine representative species best explain the difference.Patients with ADHD showed significant differences in the composition of the gut microbiota compared with HCs. These results may help identify potential biomarkers of ADHD.",Journal of attention disorders,2024,Ning Wang; Haibin Wang; Yu Bai; Yilu Zhao; Xiangyu Zheng; Xuping Gao; Zifeng Zhang; Li Yang
39158758,The Antidepressant- and Anxiolytic-Like Effects of the Phosphodiesterase Type-5 Inhibitor Tadalafil are Associated with the Modulation of the Gut-Brain Axis During CNS Autoimmunity.,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a debilitating disease that severely affects the central nervous system (CNS). Apart from neurological symptoms, it is also characterized by neuropsychiatric comorbidities, such as anxiety and depression. Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE5Is) such as Sildenafil and Tadalafil have been shown to possess antidepressant-like effects, but the mechanisms underpinning such effects are not fully characterized. To address this question, we used the EAE model of MS, behavioral tests, immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, western blot, and 16Â S rRNA sequencing. Here, we showed that depressive-like behavior in Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice is due to neuroinflammation, reduced synaptic plasticity, dysfunction in glutamatergic neurotransmission, glucocorticoid receptor (GR) resistance, increased blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and immune cell infiltration to the CNS, as well as inflammation, increased intestinal permeability, and immune cell infiltration in the distal colon. Furthermore, 16Â S rRNA sequencing revealed that behavioral dysfunction in EAE mice is associated with changes in the gut microbiota, such as an increased abundance of Firmicutes and Saccharibacteria and a reduction in Proteobacteria, Parabacteroides, and Desulfovibrio. Moreover, we detected an increased abundance of Erysipelotrichaceae and Desulfovibrionaceae and a reduced abundance of Lactobacillus johnsonii. Surprisingly, we showed that Tadalafil likely exerts antidepressant-like effects by targeting all aforementioned disease aspects. In conclusion, our work demonstrated that anxiety- and depressive-like behavior in EAE is associated with a plethora of neuroimmune and gut microbiota-mediated mechanisms and that Tadalafil exerts antidepressant-like effects probably by targeting these mechanisms. Harnessing the knowledge of these mechanisms of action of Tadalafil is important to pave the way for future clinical trials with depressed patients.",Journal of neuroimmune pharmacology : the official journal of the Society on NeuroImmune Pharmacology,2024,Eduardo Duarte-Silva; Alice Chevrollier OriÃ¡; Ingrid Prata MendonÃ§a; Igor Henrique Rodrigues Paiva; Klyvia Leuthier Dos Santos; Amanda Juliana Sales; JosÃ© Roberto Botelho de Souza; Michael Maes; Sven Guenther Meuth; Christina Alves Peixoto

Some researches indicate that abnormalities in the gut microbiota can trigger certain psychiatric diseases. Microbiota-derived extracellular vesicles have the ability to transfer bioactive compounds into host cells, altering signaling and biological processes, ultimately influencing the mental health and illness of the host.

38331354,Depression-like phenotypes in mice following common bile duct ligation: Insights into the gut-liver-brain axis via the vagus nerve.,"Depression frequently occurs in patients with liver cirrhosis, yet the reasons for this correlation are not fully understood. Dysbiosis of gut microbiota has been implicated in depression through the gut-brain axis via the vagus nerve. This study explored the potential role of the gut-liver-brain axis via the vagus nerve in depression-like phenotypes in mice with liver cirrhosis. These mice underwent common bile duct ligation (CBDL), a method used to stimulate liver cirrhosis. To assess depression-like behaviors, behavioral tests were conducted 10Â days following either sham or CBDL surgeries. The mice with CBDL displayed symptoms such as splenomegaly, elevated plasma levels of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-Î±, depression-like behaviors, decreased levels of synaptic proteins in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), disrupted gut microbiota balance, and changes in blood metabolites (or lipids). Additionally, there were positive or negative correlations between the relative abundance of microbiome and behavioral data or blood metabolites (or lipids). Significantly, these changes were reversed in CBDL mice by performing a subdiaphragmatic vagotomy. Intriguingly, depression-like phenotypes in mice with CBDL were improved after a single injection of arketamine, a new antidepressant. These results suggest that CBDL-induced depression-like phenotypes in mice are mediated through the gut-liver-brain axis via the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve, and that arketamine might offer a new treatment approach for depression in liver cirrhosis patients.",Neurobiology of disease,2024,Yong Yang; Akifumi Eguchi; Chisato Mori; Kenji Hashimoto
38317780,Gut microbiota regulate stress resistance by influencing microglia-neuron interactions in the hippocampus.,"Communication among the brain, gut and microbiota in the gut is known to affect the susceptibility to stress, but the mechanisms involved are unclear. Here we demonstrated that stress resistance in mice was associated with more abundant <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Akkermansia</i> in the gut, but less abundant <i>Bacteroides, Alloprevotella, Helicobacter, Lachnoclostridium, Blautia, Roseburia, Colidextibacter</i> and <i>Lachnospiraceae NK4A136</i>. Stress-sensitive animals showed higher permeability and stronger immune responses in their colon, as well as higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum. Their hippocampus also showed more extensive microglial activation, abnormal interactions between microglia and neurons, and lower synaptic plasticity. Transplanting fecal microbiota from stress-sensitive mice into naÃ¯ve ones perturbed microglia-neuron interactions and impaired synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, translating to more depression-like behavior after stress exposure. Conversely, transplanting fecal microbiota from stress-resistant mice into naÃ¯ve ones protected microglia from activation and preserved synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, leading to less depression-like behavior after stress exposure. These results suggested that gut microbiota may influence resilience to chronic psychological stress by regulating microglia-neuron interactions in the hippocampus.","Brain, behavior, & immunity - health",2024,Haili He; Hui He; Li Mo; Qingsong Yuan; Chenghong Xiao; Qiman Ma; Saini Yi; Tao Zhou; Zili You; Jinqiang Zhang
39303815,Metformin reprograms tryptophan metabolism via gut microbiome-derived bile acid metabolites to ameliorate depression-Like behaviors in mice.,"As an adjunct therapy, metformin enhances the efficacy of conventional antidepressant medications. However, its mode of action remains unclear. Here, metformin was found to ameliorate depression-like behaviors in mice exposed to chronic restraint stress (CRS) by normalizing the dysbiotic gut microbiome. Fecal transplants from metformin-treated mice ameliorated depressive behaviors in stressed mice. Microbiome profiling revealed that Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila), in particular, was markedly increased in the gut by metformin and that oral administration of this species alone was sufficient to reverse CRS-induced depressive behaviors and normalize aberrant stress-induced 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) metabolism in the brain and gut. Untargeted metabolomic profiling further identified the bile acid metabolites taurocholate and deoxycholic acid as direct A. muciniphila-derived molecules that are, individually, sufficient to rescue the CRS-induced impaired 5-HT metabolism and depression-like behaviors. Thus, we report metformin reprograms 5-HT metabolism via microbiome-brain interactions to mitigate depressive syndromes, providing novel insights into gut microbiota-derived bile acids as potential therapeutic candidates for depressive mood disorders from bench to bedside.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2024,Xiaoxian Xie; Wenwen Li; Ze Xiong; Junyu Xu; Tailin Liao; Lei Sun; Haoshen Xu; Mengya Zhang; Jiafeng Zhou; Wenzheng Xiong; Zhengwei Fu; Zezhi Li; Qi Han; Donghong Cui; Daniel C Anthony
38606523,"Current iron therapy in the light of regulation, intestinal microbiome, and toxicity: are we prescribing too much iron?","Iron deficiency is a widespread global health concern with varying prevalence rates across different regions. In developing countries, scarcity of food and chronic infections contribute to iron deficiency, while in industrialized nations, reduced food intake and dietary preferences affect iron status. Other causes that can lead to iron deficiency are conditions and diseases that result in reduced intestinal iron absorption and blood loss. In addition, iron absorption and its bioavailability are influenced by the composition of the diet. Individuals with increased iron needs, including infants, adolescents, and athletes, are particularly vulnerable to deficiency. Severe iron deficiency can lead to anemia with performance intolerance or shortness of breath. In addition, even without anemia, iron deficiency leads to mental and physical fatigue, which points to the fundamental biological importance of iron, especially in mitochondrial function and the respiratory chain. Standard oral iron supplementation often results in gastrointestinal side effects and poor compliance. Low-dose iron therapy seems to be a valid and reasonable therapeutic option due to reduced hepatic hepcidin formation, facilitating efficient iron resorption, replenishment of iron storage, and causing significantly fewer side effects. Elevated iron levels influence gut microbiota composition, favoring pathogenic bacteria and potentially disrupting metabolic and immune functions. Protective bacteria, such as bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, are particularly susceptible to increased iron levels. Dysbiosis resulting from iron supplementation may contribute to gastrointestinal disorders, inflammatory bowel disease, and metabolic disturbances. Furthermore, gut microbiota alterations have been linked to mental health issues. Future iron therapy should consider low-dose supplementation to mitigate adverse effects and the impact on the gut microbiome. A comprehensive understanding of the interplay between iron intake, gut microbiota, and human health is crucial for optimizing therapeutic approaches and minimizing potential risks associated with iron supplementation.",Critical reviews in clinical laboratory sciences,2024,AnaÃ«lle L Dentand; Morton G Schubert; Pierre-Alexandre Krayenbuehl
38463411,A Possible Role of Akkermansia muciniphila in the Treatment of Olanzapine-Induced Weight Gain.,"Second-generation antipsychotics are mainly used in both acute and long-term treatment of major psychiatric disorders. Although better tolerated than first-generation antipsychotic drugs, they can frequently induce weight gain and metabolic disorders, of these, olanzapine is one of the drugs more likely to induce these side effects. There is consistent evidence of the role of gut microbiota in modulating the gut-brain axis with complex crosstalk with the host involving satiety signaling pathways, food intake behavior, and weight and metabolic regulation. Second-generation antipsychotics induce important gut microbiota modification thus contributing together with the central and peripheral receptors blockade mechanism to weight gain induction and metabolic impairment. These drugs can alter the composition of gut microbiota and induce dysbiosis, often reducing the concentration of <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i>, a bacterium that is also decreased in patients with diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, or chronic inflammatory diseases. Probiotic administration can be a safe and well-tolerated approach to modulate microbiotaÂ andÂ offer an integrative strategy in psychiatric patients suffering antipsychotic side effects. Multiple strain probiotics and <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> alone have been administered both in mice models and in clinical populations demonstrating efficacy on antipsychotic-induced metabolic impairment and showing a contribution in reducing induced weight gain.Â <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> can improve several parameters altered by olanzapine administration, such as weight gain, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, liver function, systemic inflammation, and gut barrier function. Although we do not have jet trials in the psychiatric population, this probiotic may be a complementary approach to treating olanzapine-induced weight gain and metabolic side effects.",Cureus,2024,Francesca Bertossi
38944290,Splenic nerve denervation attenuates depression-like behaviors in Chrna7 knock-out mice via the spleen-gut-brain axis.,"Growing evidence highlights the role of the spleen-brain axis in inflammation-associated depression. The Î±7-subtype of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (Î±7 nAChR, encoded by the Chrna7 gene) is implicated in systemic inflammation, with Chrna7 knock-out (KO) mice displaying depression-like behaviors. Yet, the influence of spleen nerve on depression-like behaviors in these KO mice remains to be elucidated.We investigated the effects of the splenic nerve denervation (SND) on depression-like behaviors, the protein expression in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and the gut microbiota composition in Chrna7 KO mice.SND markedly alleviated depression-like behaviors and the reduced expression of GluA1 and postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95) in the PFC of Chrna7 KO mice. No changes in Î±-diversity of gut microbiota were noted among the control, KOÂ +Â sham, and KOÂ +Â SND groups. However, significant differences in Î²-diversity of gut microbiota were noted among the groups. Notable alterations in various microbiota (e.g., Fluviimonas_pallidilutea, Maribacter_arcticus, Parvibacter_caecicola) and plasma metabolites (e.g., helicide, N-acetyl-L-aspartic acid, Î±-D-galactose 1-phosphate, choline, creatine) were observed between KOÂ +Â sham and KOÂ +Â SND groups. Interestingly, correlations were found between the relative abundance of specific microbiota and other outcomes, including synaptic proteins, metabolites and behavioral data.The underlying mechanisms remain to be fully understood.Our findings indicate that the splenic nerve contributes to depression-like phenotypes in Chrna7 KO mice via the spleen-gut-brain axis.",Journal of affective disorders,2024,Yong Yang; Akifumi Eguchi; Chisato Mori; Kenji Hashimoto
39199404,The Influence of Cecal Microbiota Transplantation on Chicken Injurious Behavior: Perspective in Human Neuropsychiatric Research.,"Numerous studies have evidenced that neuropsychiatric disorders (mental illness and emotional disturbances) with aggression (or violence) pose a significant challenge to public health and contribute to a substantial economic burden worldwide. Especially, social disorganization (or social inequality) associated with childhood adversity has long-lasting effects on mental health, increasing the risk of developing neuropsychiatric disorders. Intestinal bacteria, functionally as an endocrine organ and a second brain, release various immunomodulators and bioactive compounds directly or indirectly regulating a host's physiological and behavioral homeostasis. Under various social challenges, stress-induced dysbiosis increases gut permeability causes serial reactions: releasing neurotoxic compounds, leading to neuroinflammation and neuronal injury, and eventually neuropsychiatric disorders associated with aggressive, violent, or impulsive behavior in humans and various animals via a complex bidirectional communication of the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis. The dysregulation of the MGB axis has also been recognized as one of the reasons for the prevalence of social stress-induced injurious behaviors (feather pecking, aggression, and cannibalistic pecking) in chickens. However, existing knowledge of preventing and treating these disorders in both humans and chickens is not well understood. In previous studies, we developed a non-mammal model in an abnormal behavioral investigation by rationalizing the effects of gut microbiota on injurious behaviors in chickens. Based on our earlier success, the perspective article outlines the possibility of reducing stress-induced injurious behaviors in chickens through modifying gut microbiota via cecal microbiota transplantation, with the potential for providing a biotherapeutic rationale for preventing injurious behaviors among individuals with mental disorders via restoring gut microbiota diversity and function.",Biomolecules,2024,Yuechi Fu; Heng-Wei Cheng
39163908,Gaba-producing lactobacilli boost cognitive reactivity to negative mood without improving cognitive performance: A human Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Cross-Over study.,"Psychobiotic bacteria are probiotics able to influence stress-related behavior, sleep, and cognitive outcomes. Several in vitro and human studies were performed to assess their physiological potential, to find strains having psychotropic activity in humans, and to elucidate the metabolic pathways involved. In our previous in vitro study, we identified two strains Levilactobacillus brevis P30021 and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum P30025, able to produce GABA and acetylcholine, being promising candidates to provide an effect on mood and cognitive performance.To investigate the effects of probiotics in the alleviation on the cognitive performance of moderately stressed healthy adults. Secondary outcomes were related to mood improvement, production of GABA, glutamate, acetylcholine, and choline and modification of the microbiota composition.A 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study investigated the effects of a probiotic formulation (Levilactobacillus brevis P30021 and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum P30025) on psychological, memory, and cognition parameters in 44 (ProbioticÂ =Â 44, PlaceboÂ =Â 43) adults with a mean age of 29Â Â±Â 5.7Â years old by CogState Battery test. Subjects-inclusion criteria was a mild-moderate (18.7Â Â±Â 4.06) stress upon diagnosis using the DASS-42 questionnaire.Probiotic treatment had no effect on subjective stress measures. The probiotic formulation showed a significant beneficial effect on depressive symptoms by reducing cognitive reactivity to sad mood (pÂ =Â 0.034). Rumination significantly improved after intake of the probiotic (pÂ =Â 0.006), suggesting a potential benefit in reducing the negative cognitive effects associated with depression and improving overall mental health. When stratifying the treated subjects according to the response, we found an increase in the abundance of the probiotic genera in the gut microbiota of positive responders (pÂ =Â 0.009 for Lactiplantibacillus and pÂ =Â 0.004 for L.brevis). No relevant correlations were observed between the neurotransmitter concentration in the faecal sample, scores of LEIDS, DASS-42, and cognitive tests.We highlight the potential of this probiotic preparation to act as psycobiotics for the relief of negative mood feelings. The assessment of the psychotropic effects of dietary interventions in human participants has many challenges. Further interventional studies investigating the effect of these psychobiotic bacteria in populations with stressed-related disorders are required including longer period of intervention and larger sample size in order to verify the effects of the treatment on further stress-related indicators.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2024,Melania Casertano; Matthijs Dekker; Vincenzo Valentino; Francesca De Filippis; Vincenzo Fogliano; Danilo Ercolini
39386896,Unveiling the gut microbiota blueprint of schizophrenia: a multilevel omics approach.,"Schizophrenia is a persistent incurable mental disorder and is characterized by the manifestation of negative emotions and behaviors with anxiety and depression, fear and insecurity, self-harm and social withdrawal. The intricate molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain largely elusive. Accumulating evidence points towards the gut microbiota exerting an influence on brain function via the gut-brain axis, potentially contributing to the development of schizophrenia. Therefore, the objective of this study is to delineate the gut microbial composition and metabolic profile of fecal samples from individuals with schizophrenia.Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene sequencing were employed to analyze fecal metabolites and gut microbiota profiles in a cohort of 29 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and 30 normal controls. The microbial composition of fecal samples was determined through the 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and microbial Î±-diversity and Î²-diversity indices were calculated. Principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were performed to analyze the distribution of samples. The metabolites and gut microbiota exhibiting differential expression were identified through the application of biological variance criteria. Co-occurrence analysis of bacteria and metabolites was conducted using the spearman's rank correlation coefficient and visualized in a circular layout with the Cytoscape software.The findings of the study indicated a lack of substantial evidence supporting significant disparities in Î±-diversity and Î²-diversity between individuals with schizophrenia and normal controls. In terms of metabolomics, a discernible pattern in sample distribution between the two groups was observed. Our analysis has revealed 30 bacterial species and 45 fecal metabolites that exhibited notable differences in abundance between individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia and normal controls. These alterations in multilevel omics have led to the development of a co-expression network associated with schizophrenia. The perturbed microbial genes and fecal metabolites consistently demonstrated associations with amino acid and lipid metabolism, which play essential roles in regulating the central nervous system.Our results offered profound insights into the impact of imbalanced gut microbiota and metabolism on brain function in individuals with schizophrenia.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2024,DongDong Qi; Peng Liu; YiMeng Wang; XuGuang Tai; ShiFa Ma
39364125,Differences in the human gut microbiota with varying depressive symptom severity scores.,"Depression is a prevalent mental health disorder, and its incidence has increased further because of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The gut microbiome has been suggested as a potential target for mental health treatment because of the bidirectional communication system between the brain and gastrointestinal tract, known as the gut-brain axis. We aimed to investigate the relationship between the human gut microbiome and depression screening by analyzing the abundance and types of microbiomes among individuals living in Japan, where mental health awareness and support may differ from those in other countries owing to cultural factors. We used a data-driven approach to evaluate the gut microbiome of participants who underwent commercial gut microbiota testing services and completed a questionnaire survey that included a test for scoring depressive tendencies. Our data analysis results indicated that no significant differences in gut microbiome composition were found among the groups based on their depression screening scores. However, the results also indicated the potential existence of a few differentially abundant bacterial taxa. Specifically, the detected bacterial changes in abundance suggest that the Bifidobacteriaceae, Streptococcaceae, and Veillonellaceae families are candidates for differentially abundant bacteria. Our findings should contribute to the growing body of research on the relationship between gut microbiome and mental health, highlighting the potential of microbiome-based interventions for depression treatment. The limitations of this study include the lack of clear medical information on the participants' diagnoses. Future research could benefit from a larger sample size and more detailed clinical information.","Bioscience of microbiota, food and health",2024,Yuka Masamura; Ryuichi Kubo; Yuki Midorikawa; Natsuko O Shinozaki; Satoshi Watanabe; Sayumi Maekawa; Aya K Takeda; Tazro Ohta
38999739,"Effectiveness of Psychobiotic <i>Bifidobacterium breve</i> BB05 in Managing Psychosomatic Diarrhea in College Students by Regulating Gut Microbiota: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial.","Diarrhea of college students (DCS) is a prevalent issue among college students, affecting their daily lives and academic performance. This study aims to explore the potential effect of <i>Bifidobacterium breve</i> BB05 supplements on the DCS. Initially, fifty healthy and fifty diarrheal students were recruited in the observational experiment and allocated into control and diarrhea groups, respectively. Subsequently, one hundred diarrheal students were newly recruited in the intervention experiment and randomly allocated into placebo and probiotic groups, both treated for 2 weeks. Questionnaires (BSS, HAMA-14, and HDRS-17) were performed to assess the students' diarrheal states and mental health at baseline and post-treatment. Fecal samples underwent 16S rRNA sequencing and Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay to evaluate gut microbiota and fecal metabolite alternations. Results indicated that <i>B. breve</i> BB05 supplementation significantly enriched (<i>p</i> < 0.05) the reduced gut microbial diversity caused by diarrhea. Diarrhea resulted in notable alterations in gut microbiota composition, as exhibited by elevated <i>Collinsella</i> and <i>Streptococcus</i>, alongside substantially decreased <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, <i>Bacteroides</i>, and <i>Prevotella</i>, while <i>B. breve</i> BB05 supplementation partially restored the compromised gut microbiota at both the phylum and genus levels, particularly by increasing <i>Bifidobacterium</i> and <i>Roseburia</i> (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Importantly, questionnaire results suggested that <i>B. breve</i> BB05 administration achieved superior efficacy in relieving diarrhea symptoms and the associated anxiety and depression in college students. An increased fecal concentration of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) was also observed in the probiotic group, while Acetylcholine (ACH), Epinephrine (EPI), and Noradrenaline/Norepinephrine (NANE) reduced, revealing the potential of <i>B. breve</i> BB05 in alleviating anxiety and depression via modulating the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Furthermore, correlation analysis suggested that the altered microbiota and fecal neurotransmitters were closely associated with the mental symptoms.

38292207,Gut-Brain Axis Impact on Canine Anxiety Disorders: New Challenges for Behavioral Veterinary Medicine.,"Anxiety disorders in dogs are ever-growing and represent an important concern in the veterinary behavior field. These disorders are often disregarded in veterinary clinical practice, negatively impacting the animal's and owner's quality of life. Moreover, these anxiety disorders can potentially result in the abandonment or euthanasia of dogs. Growing evidence shows that the gut microbiota is a central player in the gut-brain axis. A variety of microorganisms inhabit the intestines of dogs, which are essential in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. These microbes can impact mental health through several mechanisms, including metabolic, neural, endocrine, and immune-mediated pathways. The disruption of a balanced composition of resident commensal communities, or dysbiosis, is implicated in several pathological conditions, including mental disorders such as anxiety. Studies carried out in rodent models and humans demonstrate that the intestinal microbiota can influence mental health through these mechanisms, including anxiety disorders. Furthermore, novel therapeutic strategies using prebiotics and probiotics have been shown to ameliorate anxiety-related symptoms. However, regarding the canine veterinary behavior field, there is still a lack of insightful research on this topic. In this review, we explore the few but relevant studies performed on canine anxiety disorders. We agree that innovative bacterial therapeutical approaches for canine anxiety disorders will become a promising field of investigation and certainly pave the way for new approaches to these behavioral conditions.",Veterinary medicine international,2024,Carina Sacoor; John D Marugg; Nuno R Lima; Nuno Empadinhas; Liliana Montezinho

The potential of JPJDF to inhibit CRC through modulation of intestinal microbiota and their metabolites remains uncertain.This study aims to further investigate the therapeutic mechanisms of JPJDF in CRC.CAC mouse models were developed using azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). Intestinal tissues and contents underwent 16S rRNA gene sequencing and untargeted metabolomics analysis. Serum levels of IL-1Î² and TNF-Î± were measured using ELISA. Immunohistochemistry was utilized to assess the expression of Ki67, ZO-1, Occludin, CD68, and CD206. Furthermore, western blotting was performed to evaluate the protein expression of AhR and NF-ÎºB.JPJDF inhibited colorectal tumourigenesis in AOM/DSS treated mice, while also suppressing tumor cell proliferation and upregulating the expression of tight junction proteins. The results of 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis revealed that JPJDF altered intestinal microbiota composition by increasing the abundance of beneficial bacteria. Additionally, JPJDF reduced tryptophan metabolites, effectively alleviating inflammation and significantly restoring intestinal barrier function in CAC mice. Molecular biology experiments confirmed that JPJDF suppressed the expression levels of AhR and M2-type tumor-associated macrophages, thereby promoting anti-tumor immunity and exerting inhibitory effects on CAC growth.JPJDF can regulate the tryptophan metabolism-AhR pathway by modulating the gut microbiota, reducing intestinal inflammation, improving intestinal barrier function, enhancing anti-tumor immunity, and effectively inhibiting CAC growth.",International immunopharmacology,2024,Yonglong Chang; Qinling Ou; Xuhui Zhou; Kechao Nie; Piao Zheng; Jinhui Liu; Linzi Chen; Haixia Yan; Duanyang Guo; Sifang Zhang

Ginsenosides are the main active ingredient in ginseng and have been proven to have various pharmacological effects on the nervous system. Herein, we investigated the antidepressant effect of ginsenoside Rk3 and its underlying mechanism in a murine model of depression. Rk3 significantly improved depression-like behavior in mice, ameliorated the disturbance of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, and alleviated neuronal damage in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of mice. Additionally, Rk3 improved the abnormal metabolism of tryptophan in brain tissue by targeting tryptophan hydroxylase, thereby reducing neuronal apoptosis and synaptic structural damage in the mouse hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, Rk3 reshaped the composition of the gut microbiota of mice and regulated intestinal tryptophan metabolism, which alleviated intestinal barrier damage. Thus, this study provides valuable insights into the role of Rk3 in the tryptophan metabolic cycle along the brain-gut axis, suggesting that Rk3 may have the potential for treating depression.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2024,Jingjing Shao; Linlin Qu; Yao Liu; Jingjing Zhang; Yannan Liu; Jianjun Deng; Xiaoxuan Ma; Daidi Fan
38458803,Multicomponent (bio)markers for obesity risk prediction: a scoping review protocol.,"Despite international efforts, the number of individuals struggling with obesity is still increasing. An important aspect of obesity prevention relates to identifying individuals at risk at early stage, allowing for timely risk stratification and initiation of countermeasures. However, obesity is complex and multifactorial by nature, and one isolated (bio)marker is unlikely to enable an optimal risk stratification and prognosis for the individual; rather, a combined set is required. Such a multicomponent interpretation would integrate biomarkers from various domains, such as classical markers (eg, anthropometrics, blood lipids), multiomics (eg, genetics, proteomics, metabolomics), lifestyle and behavioural attributes (eg, diet, physical activity, sleep patterns), psychological traits (mental health status such as depression) and additional host factors (eg, gut microbiota diversity), also by means of advanced interpretation tools such as machine learning. In this paper, we will present a protocol that will be employed for a scoping review that attempts to summarise and map the state-of-the-art in the area of multicomponent (bio)markers related to obesity, focusing on the usability and effectiveness of such biomarkers.PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL and Embase databases will be searched using predefined key terms to identify peer-reviewed articles published in English until January 2024. Once downloaded into EndNote for deduplication, CADIMA will be employed to review and select abstracts and full-text articles in a two-step procedure, by two independent reviewers. Data extraction will then be carried out by several independent reviewers. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews and Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies guidelines will be followed. Combinations employing at least two biomarkers from different domains will be mapped and discussed.Ethical approval is not required; data will rely on published articles. Findings will be published open access in an international peer-reviewed journal. This review will allow guiding future directions for research and public health strategies on obesity prevention, paving the way towards multicomponent interventions.",BMJ open,2024,Farhad Vahid; Coralie Dessenne; Josep A Tur; Cristina Bouzas; Yvan Devaux; Laurent Malisoux; Margalida Monserrat-Mesquida; Antoni Sureda; Mahesh S Desai; Jonathan D Turner; Elsa Lamy; Maria Perez-Jimenez; Gitte Ravn-Haren; Rikke Andersen; Sarah Forberger; Rajini Nagrani; Yacine Ouzzahra; Michele Filippo Fontefrancesco; Maria Giovanna Onorati; Gino Gabriel Bonetti; Tiziana de-Magistris; Torsten Bohn
39201866,Contributions of Artificial Intelligence to Analysis of Gut Microbiota in Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Systematic Review.,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder whose etiology is not known today, but everything indicates that it is multifactorial. For example, genetic and epigenetic factors seem to be involved in the etiology of ASD. In recent years, there has been an increase in studies on the implications of gut microbiota (GM) on the behavior of children with ASD given that dysbiosis in GM may trigger the onset, development and progression of ASD through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. At the same time, significant progress has occurred in the development of artificial intelligence (AI).The aim of the present study was to perform a systematic review of articles using AI to analyze GM in individuals with ASD. In line with the PRISMA model, 12 articles using AI to analyze GM in ASD were selected.Outcomes reveal that the majority of relevant studies on this topic have been conducted in China (33.3%) and Italy (25%), followed by the Netherlands (16.6%), Mexico (16.6%) and South Korea (8.3%).The bacteria <i>Bifidobacterium</i> is the most relevant biomarker with regard to ASD. Although AI provides a very promising approach to data analysis, caution is needed to avoid the over-interpretation of preliminary findings. A first step must be taken to analyze GM in a representative general population and ASD samples in order to obtain a GM standard according to age, sex and country. Thus, more work is required to bridge the gap between AI in mental health research and clinical care in ASD.","Children (Basel, Switzerland)",2024,Pau Climent-PÃ©rez; AgustÃ­n Ernesto MartÃ­nez-GonzÃ¡lez; Pedro Andreo-MartÃ­nez
38857554,Dietary sulforaphane glucosinolate mitigates depression-like behaviors in mice with hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury: A role of the gut-liver-brain axis.,"Nutrition has been increasingly recognized for its use in mental health. Depression is commonly observed in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD). Building on our recent findings of depression-like behaviors in mice with hepatic ischemia/reperfusion (HI/R) injury, mediated by the gut-liver-brain axis, this study explored the potential influence of dietary sulforaphane glucosinolate (SGS) on these behaviors. Behavioral assessments for depression-like behaviors were conducted 7 days post either sham or HI/R injury surgery. Dietary intake of SGS significantly prevented splenomegaly, systemic inflammation, depression-like behaviors, and downregulation of synaptic proteins in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of HI/R-injured mice. Through 16S rRNA analysis and untargeted metabolomic analyses, distinct bacterial profiles and metabolites were identified between controlÂ +Â HI/R group and SGSÂ +Â HI/R group. Correlations were observed between the relative abundance of gut microbiota and both behavioral outcomes and blood metabolites. These findings suggest that SGS intake could mitigate depression-like phenotypes in mice with HI/R injury, potentially through the gut-liver-brain axis. Additionally, SGS, found in crucial vegetables like broccoli, could offer prophylactic nutritional benefits for depression in patients with CLD.",Journal of psychiatric research,2024,Yong Yang; Akifumi Eguchi; Chisato Mori; Kenji Hashimoto
39078446,Exploring the Potential of Probiotics and Prebiotics in Major Depression: From Molecular Function to Clinical Therapy.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) represents a complex and challenging mental health condition with multifaceted etiology. Recent research exploring the gut-brain axis has shed light on the potential influence of gut microbiota on mental health, offering novel avenues for therapeutic intervention. This paper reviews current evidence on the role of prebiotics and probiotics in the context of MDD treatment. Clinical studies assessing the effects of prebiotic and probiotic interventions have demonstrated promising results, showcasing improvements in depression symptoms and metabolic parameters in certain populations. Notably, prebiotics and probiotics have shown the capacity to modulate inflammatory markers, cortisol levels, and neurotransmitter pathways linked to MDD. However, existing research presents varied outcomes, underscoring the need for further investigation into specific microbial strains, dosage optimization, and long-term effects. Future research should aim at refining personalized interventions, elucidating mechanisms of action, and establishing standardized protocols to integrate these interventions into clinical practice. While prebiotics and probiotics offer potential adjunctive therapies for MDD, continued interdisciplinary efforts are vital to harnessing their full therapeutic potential and reshaping the landscape of depression treatment paradigms.",Probiotics and antimicrobial proteins,2024,Xin Yuan; Jianbo Chai; Wenqiang Xu; Yonghou Zhao
38409102,"Microbial composition, functionality, and stress resilience or susceptibility: unraveling sex-specific patterns.","Following exposure to traumatic stress, women are twice as likely as men to develop mood disorders. Yet, individual responses to such stress vary, with some people developing stress-induced psychopathologies while others exhibit resilience. The factors influencing sex-related disparities in affective disorders as well as variations in resilience remain unclear; however, emerging evidence suggests differences in the gut microbiota play a role. In this study, using the single prolonged stress (SPS) model of post-traumatic stress disorder, we investigated pre- and post-existing differences in microbial composition, functionality, and metabolites that affect stress susceptibility or resilience in each sex.Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to control or SPS groups. Two weeks following SPS, the animals were exposed to a battery of behavioral tests and decapitated a day later. Based on their anxiety index, they were further categorized as SPS-resilient (SPS-R) or SPS-susceptible (SPS-S). On the day of dissection, cecum, and selected brain tissues were isolated. Stool samples were collected before and after SPS, whereas urine samples were taken before and 30Â min into the SPS.Before SPS exposure, the sympathoadrenal axis exhibited alterations within male subgroups only. Expression of tight junction protein claudin-5 was lower in brain of SPS-S males, but higher in SPS-R females following SPS. Across the study, alpha diversity remained consistently lower in males compared to females. Beta diversity revealed distinct separations between male and female susceptible groups before SPS, with this separation becoming evident in the resilient groups following SPS. At the genus level, Lactobacillus, Lachnospiraceae_Incertae_Sedis, and Barnesiella exhibited sex-specific alterations, displaying opposing abundances in each sex. Additionally, sex-specific changes were observed in microbial predictive functionality and targeted functional modules both before and after SPS. Alterations in the microbial short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), were also observed, with major and minor SCFAs being lower in SPS-susceptible males whereas branched-chain SCFAs being higher in SPS-susceptible females.This study highlights distinct pre- and post-trauma differences in microbial composition, functionality, and metabolites, associated with stress resilience in male and female rats. The findings underscore the importance of developing sex-specific therapeutic strategies to effectively address stress-related disorders. Highlights SPS model induces divergent anxiety and social behavioral responses to traumatic stress in both male and female rodents. SPS-resilient females displayed less anxiety-like behavior and initiated more interactions towards a juvenile rat than SPS-resilient males. Sex-specific pre-existing and SPS-induced differences in the gut microbial composition and predictive functionality were observed in susceptible and resilient rats. SPS-resilient males displayed elevated cecal acetate levels, whereas SPS-susceptible females exhibited heightened branched-chain SCFAs.",Biology of sex differences,2024,Arax Tanelian; Bistra Nankova; Mariam Miari; Esther L Sabban

However, the replicable biomarkers for PD diagnosis across multiple populations remain elusive. Herein, we performed a meta-analysis to investigate the pivotal role of the gut microbiome in PD and its potential diagnostic implications. Six 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequence datasets from five independent studies were integrated, encompassing 550 PD and 456 healthy control samples. The analysis revealed significant alterations in microbial composition and alpha and beta diversity, emphasizing altered gut microbiota in PD. Specific microbial taxa, including Faecalibacterium, Roseburia, and Coprococcus_2, known as butyrate producers, were notably diminished in PD, potentially contributing to intestinal inflammation. Conversely, genera such as Akkermansia and Bilophila exhibited increased relative abundances. A network-based algorithm called NetMoss was utilized to identify potential biomarkers of PD. Afterwards, a classification model incorporating 11 optimized genera demonstrated high performance. Further functional analyses indicated enrichment in pathways related to neurodegeneration and metabolic pathways.

39200093,Should Pregnant Women Consume Probiotics to Combat Endocrine-Disrupting Chemical-Induced Health Risks to Their Unborn Offspring?,"Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) have become so pervasive in our environment and daily lives that it is impossible to avoid contact with such compounds, including pregnant women seeking to minimize exposures to themselves and their unborn children. Developmental exposure of humans and rodent models to bisphenol A (BPA) and other EDCs is linked to increased anxiogenic behaviors, learning and memory deficits, and decreased socio-sexual behaviors. Prenatal exposure to BPA and other EDCs leads to longstanding and harmful effects on gut microbiota with reductions in beneficial bacteria, i.e., gut dysbiosis, and such microbial changes are linked to host changes in fecal metabolites, including those involved in carbohydrate metabolism and synthesis, and neurobehavioral alterations in adulthood, in particular, social and cognitive deficits. Gut dysbiosis is increasingly being recognized as a key driver of a myriad of diseases, ranging from metabolic, cardiovascular, reproductive, and neurobehavioral disorders via the gut-microbiome-brain axis. Thus, EDCs might induce indirect effects on physical and mental health by acting as microbiome-disrupting chemicals. Findings raise the important question as to whether pregnant women should consume a probiotic supplement to mitigate pernicious effects of EDCs, especially BPA, on themselves and their unborn offspring. Current studies investigating the effects of maternal probiotic supplementation on pregnant women's health and that of their unborn offspring will be reviewed. Data will inform on the potential application of probiotic supplementation to reverse harmful effects of EDCs, especially BPA, in pregnant women unwittingly exposed to these compounds and striving to give their offspring the best start in life.",Biomedicines,2024,Cheryl S Rosenfeld
38959280,Pilot study assessing gut microbial diversity among sexual and gender minority young adults.,"Evidence supports that people identifying as a sexual or gender minority (SGMs) experience minority-related stress resulting from discrimination or expectations of prejudice, and that this is associated with increased mental and physical health problems compared to cisgender heterosexuals. However, the biological mechanisms driving minority-related stress impacts remain unknown, including the role of the gut microbiome. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the relationship between SGM status and gut microbiome health among young adults attending a 4-year university. To this end, a prospective pilot study was completed in the fall and spring semesters of 2021-22. Self-identified SGMs (N = 22) and cisgender-heterosexuals (CIS-HET, N = 43) completed in-person interviews to provide mental health data and demographic information. Nail and saliva samples were collected at the time of interview to quantify chronic and acute cortisol. Stool samples were collected within 48 hours of interview for microbiome analysis. Assessment of the gut microbiota identified a significant reduction in alpha diversity among the SGM group, even when adjusting for mental health outcome. SGM group showed trends for higher abundance of microbes in phylum Bacteroidetes and lower abundance of microbes in phyla Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria compared to the CIS-HET group. These findings support that the gut microbiome could be contributing to negative health effects among the SGM community.",PloS one,2024,Ashley Guy; Shannon McAuliffe; Robbie Cross; Yue Zhang; Richard E Kennedy; Norman R Estes; Samantha Giordano-Mooga; Christine Loyd
38693730,Probiotics for Inflammatory Bowel Disease; A Deep Dive into their Impact on Disease Course and Associated Health Risks.,"To date, the underlying pathology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is undetermined. Disturbance of intestinal gut microbiota was implicated in many health diseases, including IBD. Increasing evidence suggests that probiotics play a beneficial role in restoring the balance of the gut ecosystem. This review searched multiple databases for relevant works that examined probiotics' possible benefits in adults with IBD. Probiotic mode of action in ulcerative colitis patients and Crohn's disease were examined with respect to probiotic strain, their benefits, and their advantages in adult cases. Eligible studies for inclusion were assessed and analyzed. They were effective in reducing IBD disease course, inducing and maintaining remission, particularly for ulcerative colitis patients, with good efficacy and safety profile. However, the evidence for Crohn's disease was lacking. Probiotics positively affect IBD-related risks, reducing the risk of gastrointestinal malignancy and optimizing treating them. Additionally, they improved reduced fertility odds for both genders. The osteoporosis risk among IBD patients was also reduced, although the duration of use and dose were still not established. There was an encouraging role for them in reducing IBD -cardiovascular risks among cases with acute myocardial infarction and those with chronic heart failure. Finally, they had novel use in reducing IBD-related depression and improved overall mental health. In conclusion, we recommend probiotics as an adjuvant therapeutic option for IBD therapy for ulcerative colitis; however, their role in Crohn's disease needs further research.",Current medicinal chemistry,2024,Wassan Nori Mohammed Hassan; Methaq Mueen Al-Kaabi; Nabeeha Najatee Akram; Mustafa Ali Kassim Kassim; Alexandru Cosmin Pantazi
39293692,Depletion of the paternal gut microbiome alters sperm small RNAs and impacts offspring physiology and behavior in mice.,"The paternal environment prior to conception has been demonstrated to influence offspring physiology and behavior, with the sperm epigenome (including noncoding RNAs) proposed as a potential facilitator of non-genetic inheritance. Whilst the maternal gut microbiome has been established as an important influence on offspring development, the impact of the paternal gut microbiome on offspring development, health and behavior is largely unknown. Gut microbiota have major influences on immunity, and thus we hypothesized that they may be relevant to paternal immune activation (PIA) modulating epigenetic inheritance in mice. Therefore, male C57BL/6J mice (F0) were orally administered non-absorbable antibiotics via drinking water in order to substantially deplete their gut microbiome. Four weeks after administration of the antibiotics (gut microbiome depletion), F0 male mice were then mated with naÃ¯ve female mice. The F1 offspring of the microbiome-depleted males had reduced body weight as well as altered gut morphology (shortened colon length). F1 females showed significant alterations in affective behaviors, including measures of anxiety and depressive-like behaviors, indicating altered development. Analysis of small noncoding RNAs in the sperm of F0 mice revealed that gut microbiome depletion is associated with differential expression of 8 different PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), each of which has the potential to modulate the expression of multiple downstream gene targets, and thus influence epigenetic inheritance and offspring development. This study demonstrates that the gut-germline axis influences sperm small RNA profiles and offspring physiology, with specific impacts on offspring affective and/or coping behaviors. These findings may have broader implications for other animal species with comparable gut microbiota, intergenerational epigenetics and developmental biology, including humans.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2024,Bethany A Masson; Pamudika Kiridena; Da Lu; Elizabeth A Kleeman; Sonali N Reisinger; Wendy Qin; William J Davies; Rikeish R Muralitharan; Hamdi A Jama; Simona Antonacci; Francine Z Marques; Carolina Gubert; Anthony J Hannan
39134294,Agmatine modulation of gut-brain axis alleviates dysbiosis-induced depression-like behavior in rats.,"Depression is a global health concern affecting nearly 280 million individuals. It not only imposes a significant burden on economies and healthcare systems but also manifests complex physiological connections and consequences. Agmatine, a putative neuromodulator derived primarily from beneficial gut microbes specially Lactobacillus, has emerged as a potential therapeutic agent for mental health. The microbiota-gut-brain axis is involved in the development of depression through the peripheral nervous system, endocrine system, and immune system and may be a key factor in the effect of agmatine. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the potential mechanism of agmatine in antibiotic-induced dysbiosis and depression-like behavior in rats, focusing on its modulation of the gut-brain axis. Depression-like behavior associated with dysbiosis was induced through a seven-day regimen of the broad-spectrum antibiotic, comprising ampicillin and metronidazole and validated through microbial, biochemical, and behavioral alterations. On day 8, antibiotic-treated rats exhibited loose fecal consistency, altered fecal microbiota, and depression-like behavior in forced swim test. Pro-inflammatory cytokines were elevated, while agmatine and monoamine levels decreased in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Antibiotic administration disrupted tight junction proteins in the ileum, affecting gut architecture. Oral administration of agmatine alone or combined with probiotics significantly reversed antibiotic-induced dysbiosis, restoring gut microbiota and mitigating depression-like behaviors. This intervention also restored neuro-inflammatory markers, increased agmatine and monoamine levels, and preserved gut integrity. The study highlights the regulatory role of endogenous agmatine in the gut-brain axis in broad-spectrum antibiotic induced dysbiosis and associated depression-like behavior.",European journal of pharmacology,2024,Sandip Rahangdale; Pankaj Deshmukh; Shivkumar Sammeta; Manish Aglawe; Mayur Kale; Milind Umekar; Nandkishor Kotagale; Brijesh Taksande
38968876,"A further examination of growth factors, T helper 1 polarization, and the gut microbiome in major depression: Associations with reoccurrence of illness, cognitive functions, suicidal behaviors, and quality of life.","Growth factors, T helper (Th)1 polarization, and the microbiome are involved in the pathophysiology of major depression (MDD). It remains unclear whether the combination of these three pathways could enhance the accuracy of predicting the features of MDD, including recurrence of illness (ROI), suicidal behaviors and the phenome. We measured serum stem cell factor (SCF), stem cell growth factor (SCGF), stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the ratio of serum Th1/Th2 cytokines (zTh1-zTh2), and the abundances of gut microbiome taxa by analyzing stool samples using 16S rDNA sequencing from 32 MDD patients and 37 healthy controls. The results show that serum SCF is significantly lower and VEGF increased in MDD. Adverse childhood experiences (ACE) and ROI are significantly associated with lowered SCF and increasing VEGF. Lifetime and current suicidal behaviors are strongly predicted (63.5%) by an increased VEGF/SCF ratio, Th1 polarization, a gut microbiome enterotype indicating gut dysbiosis, and lowered abundance of Dorea and Faecalobacterium. Around 80.5% of the variance in the phenome's severity is explained by ROI, ACEs, and lowered Parabacteroides distasonis and Clostridium IV abundances. A large part of the variance in health-related quality of life (54.1%) is explained by the VEGF/SCF ratio, Th1 polarization, ACE, and male sex. In conclusion, key features of MDD are largely predicted by the cumulative effects of ACE, Th1 polarization, aberrations in growth factors and the gut microbiome with increased pathobionts but lowered beneficial symbionts.",Journal of psychiatric research,2024,Michael Maes; Bo Zhou; Asara Vasupanrajit; Ketsupar Jirakran; Pavit Klomkliew; Prangwalai Chanchaem; Chavit Tunvirachaisakul; Kitiporn Plaimas; Apichat Suratanee; Jing Li; Abbas F Almulla; Sunchai Payungporn
39316970,Christensenella minuta mitigates behavioral and cardiometabolic hallmarks of social defeat stress.,"Psychological stress during early development and adolescence may increase the risk of psychiatric and cardiometabolic comorbidities in adulthood. The gut microbiota has been associated with mental health problems such as depression and anxiety and with cardiometabolic disease, but the potential role of the gut microbiota in their comorbidity is not well understood. We investigated the effects and mode of action of the intestinal bacterium Christensenella minuta DSM 32891 on stress-induced mental health and cardiometabolic disturbances in a mouse model of social defeat stress. We demonstrate that administered C. minuta alleviates chronic stress-induced depressive, anxiogenic and antisocial behavior. These effects are attributed to the bacterium's ability to modulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which mediates the stress response. This included the oversecretion of corticosterone and the overexpression of its receptors, as well as the metabolism of dopamine (DA) and the expression of its receptors (D1, D2L and D2S). Additionally, C. minuta administration reduced chronically induced inflammation in plasma, spleen and some brain areas, which likely contribute to the recovery of physical and behavioral function. Furthermore, C. minuta administration prevented chronic stress-induced cardiovascular damage by regulating key enzymes mediating liver fibrosis and oxidative stress. Finally, C. minuta increased the abundance of bacteria associated with mental health. Overall, our study highlights the potential of microbiota-directed interventions to alleviate both the physical and mental effects of chronic stress.",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2024,A Agusti; G V Molina-Mendoza; M Tamayo; V Rossini; M C Cenit; C Frances-Cuesta; V Tolosa-Enguis; E M GÃ³mez Del Pulgar; A Flor-Duro; Y Sanz
39422256,A gut-focused perinatal dietary intervention is associated with lower alpha diversity of the infant gut microbiota: results from a randomised controlled trial.,"In experimental models, the prenatal diet influences gut microbiota composition in mothers and offspring; however, it is unclear whether this occurs in humans. We investigated the effects of a gut-focused perinatal dietary intervention on maternal and infant gut microbiota composition four weeks after birth.This randomised controlled trial randomised pregnant women to receive dietary advice as part of standard care, or additionally receive a dietary intervention focused on the Australian Dietary Guidelines and increasing prebiotic and probiotic/fermented food intakes (ACTRN12616000936426). Study assessments occurred from gestation week 26 (baseline) to four weeks postpartum (follow-up). Faecal samples, collected at baseline for mothers, and follow-up for mothers and infants, underwent 16SrRNA sequencing. The primary outcome was a between-group mean difference in infant faecal Shannon index. Secondary outcomes included between-group differences in other microbiota measures, including maternal change from baseline CLR-transformed <i>Prevotella</i> abundance.Forty-four women and 45 infants completed the study. The mean Shannon index of infants in the intervention group was -0.35 (95% CI: -0.64, -0.06, SD: 0.52) units lower than control group infants, corresponding to a medium effect size (Cohen's D: -0.74, 95% CI: -1.34, -0.13). The findings were similar using other metrics of Î±-diversity. There were no between-group differences in Î²-diversity, nor any differentially abundant taxa in infants. The intervention increased abundances of the genus <i>Prevotella</i> in mothers compared to controls.This gut-focused perinatal dietary intervention was associated with differences in the maternal and infant gut microbiota composition.

38993577,"Ageing, Cognitive Decline, and Effects of Physical Exercise: Complexities, and Considerations from Animal Models.","In our ageing global population, the cognitive decline associated with dementia and neurodegenerative diseases represents a major healthcare problem. To date, there are no effective treatments for age-related cognitive impairment, thus preventative strategies are urgently required. Physical exercise is gaining traction as a non-pharmacological approach to promote brain health. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN), a unique form of brain plasticity which is necessary for certain cognitive functions declines with age and is enhanced in response to exercise. Accumulating evidence from research in rodents suggests that physical exercise has beneficial effects on cognition through its proneurogenic capabilities. Given ethical and technical limitations in human studies, preclinical research in rodents is crucial for a better understanding of such exercise-induced brain and behavioural changes. In this review, exercise paradigms used in preclinical research are compared. We provide an overview of the effects of different exercise paradigms on age-related cognitive decline from middle-age until older-age. We discuss the relationship between the age-related decrease in AHN and the potential impact of exercise on mitigating this decline. We highlight the emerging literature on the impact of exercise on gut microbiota during ageing and consider the role of the gut-brain axis as a future possible strategy to optimize exercise-enhanced cognitive function. Finally, we propose a guideline for designing optimal exercise protocols in rodent studies, which would inform clinical research and contribute to developing preventative strategies for age-related cognitive decline.","Brain plasticity (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2024,Maria Giovanna Caruso; Sarah Nicolas; Paul J Lucassen; Joram D Mul; Olivia F O'Leary; Yvonne M Nolan
39033825,Core antibiotic resistance genes mediate gut microbiota to intervene in the treatment of major depressive disorder.,"The relationship between depression and gut microbiota remains unclear, but an important role of gut microbiota has been verified. The relationship between gut microbiota and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) may be a potential new explanatory pathway.We collected samples from 63 depressed patients and 30 healthy controls for metagenomic sequencing. The two groups' microbiota characteristics, functional characteristics, and ARG differences were analyzed.We obtained 30 differential KEGG orthologs (KOs) and their producers in 5 genera and 7 species by HUMAnN3. We found 6 KOs from Weissella_cibaria and Lactobacillus_plantaru are potentially coring functional mechanism of gut microbiota. Different metabolites including sphingolipids, pyrans, prenol lipids, and isoflavonoids also showed significance between MDD and HC. We detected 48 significantly different ARGs: 5 ARGs up-regulated and 43 ARGs down-regulated in MDD compared to HC. Based on Cox model results, Three ARGs significantly affected drug efficacy (ARG29, ARG105, and ARG111). Eggerthella, Weissella, and Lactobacillus were correlated with different core ARGs, which indicated different mechanisms in affecting MDD.The present study needs to be replicated in different ethnic groups. At the same time, a larger Chinese cohort study and detailed experimental verification are also the key to further discussion.Our findings suggest that ARGs play a role in the interplay between major depressive disorder and gut microbiota.

38248533,Long-Term Impact of Childhood Adversity on the Gut Microbiome of Nursing Students.,"Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) encompass negative, stressful, and potentially traumatic events during childhood, impacting physical and mental health outcomes in adulthood. Limited studies suggest ACEs can have short-term effects on children's gut microbiomes and adult cognitive performance under stress. Nevertheless, the long-term effects of ACEs experienced during adulthood remain unexplored. Thus, this study aimed to assess the long-term effects of ACEs on the gut microbiota of adult nursing students. We employed a multidimensional approach, combining 16S rRNA sequencing, bioinformatics tools, and machine learning to predict functional capabilities. High-ACE individuals had an increased abundance of <i>Butyricimonas</i> spp. and <i>Prevotella</i> spp. and decreased levels of Clostridiales, and <i>Lachnospira</i> spp. <i>Prevotella</i> abundance correlated negatively with L-glutamate and L-glutamine biosynthesis, potentially impacting intestinal tissue integrity. While nursing students with high ACE reported increased depression, evidence for a direct gut microbiota-depression relationship was inconclusive. High-ACE individuals also experienced a higher prevalence of diarrhea. These findings highlight the long-lasting impact of ACEs on the gut microbiota and its functions in adulthood, particularly among nursing students. Further research is warranted to develop targeted interventions and strategies for healthcare professionals, optimizing overall health outcomes.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2024,Negin Kazemian; Tony Zhou; Naveen Chalasani; Apurva Narayan; Jose Guillermo CedeÃ±o Laurent; Hector A Olvera Alvarez; Sepideh Pakpour
39371767,Exploring the Renoprotective Potential of Bioactive Nutraceuticals in Chronic Kidney Disease Progression: A Narrative Review.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a condition that is characterized by progressive loss of kidney function over time. A substantial increase in the burden of CKD is evident globally, attributed to multifactorial conditions like an expanding aging population, rising diabetes and hypertension rates, and more significant exposures to risk factors associated with the environment and lifestyle. Nutraceuticals are substances that are usually considered a food or an active part of a food that provides medical or health benefits, including the prevention and treatment of a disease. The aim is to review the positive role of nutraceuticals in managing CKD. A narrative review is generated, extracting the papers from databases like Web of Science, Scopus, ScienceDirect, ResearchGate, and PubMed. Animal and human trials focusing on the effect of different nutraceuticals on the initial stage of kidney disease, i.e., stages 1, 2, and 3 of CKD, were included. The review's outcome is understanding the effectiveness of nutraceuticals that have shown positive results in CKD conditions. Active compounds include ubiquinone, curcumin, nitrates, nitrites, lycopene, and resveratrol. These bioactive components are also beneficial for other comorbid conditions like diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular conditions that have an eminent adverse effect on CKD. Lycopene, coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), resveratrol, curcumin, and flavonoids have positively impacted CKD complications. Nutraceuticals hold great promise for individuals with CKD in the coming years, offering diverse potential benefits. These include delivering vital antioxidant and anti-inflammatory support to alleviate oxidative stress and inflammation, helping to regulate blood pressure and lipid levels for improved cardiovascular health, promoting optimal renal function to sustain kidney health, assisting in maintaining electrolyte balance, warding off complications, influencing gut microbiota for enhanced digestive well-being, and ultimately elevating the overall quality of life, for those managing CKD.",Cureus,2024,Anindita Ghosh; Arti Muley; Sakshi Bhat; Archana Ainapure

Fecal gut microbiota analysis and PICRUSt (Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States) were used to predict gene family abundances based on 16S information. Over the course of treatment, the weekly frequency of feces within each group increased significantly (Fâ=â41.97, pâ<â0.001). The frequency of feces (times/week (t/w)) in the IG was significantly higher than that in the CG (3.69âÂ±â2.62 t/w vs.3.18âÂ±â1.43 t/w, 4.03âÂ±â2.54 t/w vs. 2.89âÂ±â1.39 t/w and 3.74âÂ±â2.36 t/w vs. 2.94âÂ±â1.18 t/w and 3.45âÂ±â1.98 vs. 3.17âÂ±â1.41 t/w for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th week after intervention, respectively) (Fâ=â7.60, pâ=â0.0067). After the intervention, dominate species shifted to Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium breve, and Escherichia coli in the IG. Additionally, genes related to short-chain fatty acid (SCF) metabolism were upregulated, while methane metabolism was downregulated. Administration of XLTG11 at a dose of 1âÃâ10<sup>10</sup>Â CFU/day to children increased fecal frequency, induced beneficial changes in gut microbiota, and regulated SCFs and methane metabolism-related genes.",Brazilian journal of microbiology : [publication of the Brazilian Society for Microbiology],2024,Ke Chen; Zengyuan Zhou; Yang Nie; Yanmei Cao; Ping Yang; Ying Zhang; Ping Xu; Qinghua Yu; Yang Shen; Weiwei Ma; Shanshan Jin; Changqi Liu
38863592,The effect of prebiotic and probiotic food consumption on anxiety severity: a nationwide study in Korea.,"Over the past decade, research has reported that diet and gut health affect anxiety symptoms through changes in the gut microbiota. Therefore, the introduction of prebiotic and probiotic food favorable for the intestinal microbiota is necessary to improve the mental health of the host. The purpose of this study was to examine the contribution of prebiotic and probiotic foods to lowering anxiety symptoms using a large, nationwide population-based database.The study population included 4,317 individuals 19 to 64âyears of age who participated in the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES VII-3, 2019-2021). A food frequency questionnaire was used to evaluate prebiotic and probiotic food consumption. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment 7-item scale (GAD-7) assessed the severity of anxiety symptoms. The effect of prebiotic and probiotic food consumption on anxiety severity was analyzed using multiple logistic regression.Anxiety symptom severity was significantly lower in the highest prebiotic and/or probiotic food consumption tertiles compared to the lowest food consumption tertile. We also found a sex difference in the odds ratio for anxiety symptoms. The consumption of prebiotic food was significantly associated with the highest odds of anxiety among both men and women. However, probiotic food had a significant beneficial effect on lowering anxiety symptoms in men but not in women.Our finding suggests that prebiotic and probiotic food consumption might confer a beneficial influence on anxiety symptoms. Further research is required for a deeper understanding into the mechanisms of the positive effects of prebiotics and probiotics on anxiety.",Frontiers in nutrition,2024,Hyejin Tae; Tae-Suk Kim
38979127,Washed microbiota transplantation improves sleep quality in patients with sleep disorder by the gut-brain axis.,"The clinical impact of washed microbiota transplantation (WMT) from healthy donors in sleep disorder (SD) patients is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effect of WMT in SD patients.The clinical data were collected from patients with different indications receiving 1-3 courses of WMT, divided into two groups by 7 points of PSQI scale. The score of PQSI and SF-36 scale was used to assess the improvement in sleep quality and life quality among patients with sleep disorders following WMT. Finally, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was performed on fecal samples of patients with sleep disorders before and after WMT.WMT significantly improved sleep quality in patients with sleep disorder in the short and medium term. WMT significantly improved sleep latency, sleep time and total score in the short term. WMT significantly improved sleep quality and total score in the medium term. In terms of sleep quality and sleep latency, the improvement value also increased with the increase of treatment course, and the improvement effect of multiple treatment course was better than that of single and double treatment course. In the total score, the improvement effect of double and multiple treatment was better than that of single treatment. WMT also improved quality of life in the sleep disorder group. WMT significantly improved general health, vitality, social function and mental health in the short term. WMT significantly improved role-physical, general health, vitality, and mental health in the medium term. WMT regulated the disturbed gut microbiota in patients with sleep disorders. In the normal sleep group, WMT had no effect on the decline of sleep quality in the short, medium and long term, and had an improving effect on the quality of life.WMT could significantly improve sleep quality and life quality in patients with sleep disorders with no adverse events. The improvement in sleep quality resulting from WMT could lead to an overall enhancement in life quality. WMT could be a potentially effective treatment for patients with sleep disorders by regulating the gut microbiota.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2024,Hongxin He; Manqing Li; Yifan Qiu; Zhiqing Wu; Lei Wu
39360531,The Mechanisms and Quality Markers of Anti-rheumatoid Arthritis of Traditional Chinese Medicine.,"RA is a recurrent autoimmune disease that has significant adverse effects on the physical and mental health of patients. Traditional Chinese medicine has shown significant advantages in the prevention and treatment of RA. Numerous clinical and experimental studies have confirmed that traditional Chinese medicine components have clear therapeutic effects and minimal adverse reactions in treating RA. The research on traditional Chinese medicine for the prevention and treatment of RA has become a hot topic in the field of autoimmune diseases.The related references about the mechanisms and Q-markers of anti-RA of traditional Chinese medicine in this review were collected from Willy, SpringLink, Web of Science, Elsevier, PubMed, SciFinder, Scopus, ACS publications, Baidu Scholar, Google Scholar, and CNKI.The traditional Chinese medicine components such as terpenoids, flavonoids, and alkaloids have significant anti-RA effects, and their mechanisms are mainly to inhibit NF-ÎºB signaling pathway, inhibit the proliferation of RA fibroblasts like synovial cells, and regulate Th1/Th2 cell balance, and so on. Predicting and studying the Q-markers of traditional Chinese medicine anti-RA by plant phylogeny and chemical componentss, traditional medicinal properties, pharmacokinetics, component measurability, correlation between composition and efficacy, and gut microbiota will provide scientific foundations for the research and further development of anti-RA traditional Chinese medicine.The active components of traditional Chinese medicine exhibited the characteristic of multiple mechanisms in the treatment of RA, such as terpenoids had anti-angiogenesis effects, flavonoids had anti-inflammatory and cartilage protective effects, and alkaloids had antiinflammatory and analgesic effects. The proposal of Q-markers for anti-RA provided new research ideas for promoting the development of new drugs for anti-RA and ensuring the safety and effectiveness of clinical medications.",Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening,2024,Mozili Adu; Yongwei Qiu; Qinge Ma; Guoyue Zhong; Jia-Zeng Guo; Rongrui Wei

39126817,"Interplay of yoga, physical activity, and probiotics in irritable bowel syndrome management: A double-blind randomized study.","This study aimed to explore the synergistic impact of online yoga, mindfulness practices, and probiotics on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) by evaluating changes in physical fitness, mental health, and gut microbiota composition.The six-week randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial included 31 IBS patients categorized into three groups: online yoga with probiotics (EP), online yoga with a placebo (EC), and probiotics only (P). Assessments involved physical fitness tests, subjective questionnaires (IBS-QOL, BSRS-5), and gut microbiome analysis.Participants self-collected stool samples and were given a set of questionnaires at baseline and after six weeks of intervention. Their symptoms were measured by changes in the gut microbiota, physical fitness and quality of life, and psychological well-being.The EP group demonstrated improved cardiovascular endurance (PÂ <Â 0.001) and a significant reduction in Klebsiella bacterial strains (PÂ <Â 0.05). Both the EP and EC groups exhibited significantly decreased IBS-QOL scores (PÂ <Â 0.001 and PÂ <Â 0.05, respectively), indicating enhanced quality of life. While BSRS-5 scores decreased in both groups, the reduction was statistically insignificant.Integrating online yoga, mindfulness practices, and probiotics demonstrated comprehensive benefits for IBS patients. This intervention improved physical fitness and mental well-being and positively influenced gut microbiota composition.

38806681,Temperature-dependent differences in mouse gut motility are mediated by stress.,"Researchers have advocated elevating mouse housing temperatures from the conventional ~22âÂ°C to the mouse thermoneutral point of 30âÂ°C to enhance translational research. However, the impact of environmental temperature on mouse gastrointestinal physiology remains largely unexplored. Here we show that mice raised at 22âÂ°C exhibit whole gut transit speed nearly twice as fast as those raised at 30âÂ°C, primarily driven by a threefold increase in colon transit speed. Furthermore, gut microbiota composition differs between the two temperatures but does not dictate temperature-dependent differences in gut motility. Notably, increased stress signals from the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis at 22âÂ°C have a pivotal role in mediating temperature-dependent differences in gut motility. Pharmacological and genetic depletion of the stress hormone corticotropin-releasing hormone slows gut motility in stressed 22âÂ°C mice but has no comparable effect in relatively unstressed 30âÂ°C mice. In conclusion, our findings highlight that colder mouse facility temperatures significantly increase gut motility through hormonal stress pathways.",Lab animal,2024,Alvin Han; Courtney Hudson-Paz; Beatriz G Robinson; Laren Becker; Amanda Jacobson; Julia A Kaltschmidt; Jennifer L Garrison; Ami S Bhatt; Denise M Monack
38931307,Microbiome and Metabolite Analysis Insight into the Potential of Shrimp Head Hydrolysate to Alleviate Depression-like Behaviour in Growth-Period Mice Exposed to Chronic Stress.,"Chronic stress (CS) endangers the physical and mental health of adolescents. Therefore, alleviating and preventing such negative health impacts are a top priority. This study explores the effect of feeding shrimp head hydrolysate (SHH) on gut microbiota, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and neurotransmitters in growing C57BL/6 mice subjected to chronic unpredictable mild stress. Mice in the model group and three SHH groups were exposed to CS for 44 days, distilled water and SHH doses of 0.18, 0.45, 0.90 g/kgÂ·BW were given respectively by gavage daily for 30 days from the 15th day. The results showed that SHH can significantly reverse depression-like behaviour, amino acids degradation, Î± diversity and Î² diversity, proportion of Firmicutes and Bacteroidota, abundance of genera such as <i>Muribaculaceae</i>, <i>Bacteroides</i>, <i>Prevotellaceae_UCG-001</i>, <i>Parabacteroides</i> and <i>Alistipes</i>, concentration of five short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), 5-HT and glutamate induced by CS. <i>Muribaculaceae</i> and butyric acid may be a controlled target.

39360283,From gut to brain: unveiling probiotic effects through a neuroimaging perspective-A systematic review of randomized controlled trials.,"The gut-brain axis, a bidirectional communication network between the gastrointestinal system and the brain, significantly influences mental health and behavior. Probiotics, live microorganisms conferring health benefits, have garnered attention for their potential to modulate this axis. However, their effects on brain function through gut microbiota modulation remain controversial. This systematic review examines the effects of probiotics on brain activity and functioning, focusing on randomized controlled trials using both resting-state and task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) methodologies. Studies investigating probiotic effects on brain activity in healthy individuals and clinical populations (i.e., major depressive disorder and irritable bowel syndrome) were identified. In healthy individuals, task-based fMRI studies indicated that probiotics modulate brain activity related to emotional regulation and cognitive processing, particularly in high-order areas such as the amygdala, precuneus, and orbitofrontal cortex. Resting-state fMRI studies revealed changes in connectivity patterns, such as increased activation in the Salience Network and reduced activity in the Default Mode Network. In clinical populations, task-based fMRI studies showed that probiotics could normalize brain function in patients with major depressive disorder and irritable bowel syndrome. Resting-state fMRI studies further suggested improved connectivity in mood-regulating networks, specifically in the subcallosal cortex, amygdala and hippocampus. Despite promising findings, methodological variability and limited sample sizes emphasize the need for rigorous, longitudinal research to clarify the beneficial effects of probiotics on the gut-brain axis and mental health.",Frontiers in nutrition,2024,Annachiara Crocetta; Donato Liloia; Tommaso Costa; Sergio Duca; Franco Cauda; Jordi Manuello
38866914,"Elevated fecal calprotectin is associated with gut microbial dysbiosis, altered serum markers and clinical outcomes in older individuals.","Fecal calprotectin is an established marker of gut inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Elevated levels of fecal calprotectin as well as gut microbial dysbiosis have also been observed in other clinical conditions. However, systemic and multi-omics alterations linked to elevated fecal calprotectin in older individuals remain unclear. This study comprehensively investigated the relationship between fecal calprotectin levels, gut microbiome composition, serum inflammation and targeted metabolomics markers, and relevant lifestyle and medical data in a large sample of older individuals (nâ=â735; mean ageâÂ±âSD: 68.7âÂ±â6.3) from the TREND cohortÂ study.

Several pro-inflammatory gut microbial genera were significantly increased and short-chain fatty acid producing genera were decreased in high vs. low calprotectin groups. In serum, IL-17C, CCL19 and the toxic metabolite indoxyl sulfate were increased in high vs. low fecal calprotectin groups. These changes were partially mediated by theÂ gut microbiota. Moreover, the high fecalÂ calprotectin group showed increased BMI and a higher disease prevalence of heart attack and obesity.

39392025,"Microbiological bases of obsessiveâcompulsive disorder - the role of viruses, bacteria, and parasites in the onset and progression of OCD.","Obsessiveâcompulsive disorder (OCD) is a current topic of discussion nowadays. OCD presents a variety of different etiologies including environmental, viral, cognitive, or genetic aspects. In this article, we focused on the possible correlation between various infectious diseases as well as generally the relationship between viruses, bacteria, and parasites, and an increased OCD risk. In this narrative review, we analyzed different types of articles found on PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus, as well as the articles of the National Institute of Mental Health. Searching criteria included articles from 1991 till the end of November, research involving human and animal patients (including monkeys and rats), and research published in English. Research showed a relationship between Herpes simplex virus, Rubella virus, Human immunodeficiency virus, Borna disease virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Toxoplasma gondii, streptococcal infections, as well as gut microbiota and increased OCD risk. The possible mechanisms of this relation include neuroinflammation, brain tissue damage, autoimmune processes, and impairments in neurotransmitter levels. Infections caused by Varicella zoster virus, Measles virus, Mumps virus, EpsteinâBarr virus, Cytomegalovirus, or Borrelia Burgdorferi may also contribute to the increased risk of OCD. Reports showed an increased frequency of OCD occurrence in a group of infected people compared to a healthy group. However, there is no evidence of the influence of Influenza virus, Coxsackie virus, Poliovirus, Parvovirus B19, Enterovirus 71, West Nile virus, Treponema Pallidum, or Toxocara infections on the OCD risk. There is a significant relationship between various infectious diseases and an increased OCD risk.

39346901,"Supplementation with <i>Lactobacillus helveticus</i> NS8 alleviated behavioral, neural, endocrine, and microbiota abnormalities in an endogenous rat model of depression.","Major depressive disorder is a condition involving microbiota-gut-brain axis dysfunction. Increasing research aims to improve depression through gut microbiota regulation, including interventions such as probiotics, prebiotics, and fecal microbiota transplants. However, most research focuses on exogenous depression induced by chronic stress or drugs, with less attention given to endogenous depression. Additionally, research on gut mycobiota in depression is significantly less than that on gut bacteria.In the present study, Wistar-Kyoto rats were used as an endogenous depression and treatment-resistant depression model, while Wistar rats served as controls. Differences between the two rat strains in behavior, gut bacteria, gut mycobiota, nervous system, endocrine system, immune system, and gut barrier were evaluated. Additionally, the effects of <i>Lactobacillus helveticus</i> NS8 supplementation were investigated.Wistar-Kyoto rats demonstrated increased depressive-like behaviors in the forced swimming test, reduced sucrose preference in the sucrose preference test, and decreased locomotor activity in the open field test. They also exhibited abnormal gut bacteria and mycobiota, characterized by higher bacterial Î±-diversity but lower fungal Î±-diversity, along with increased butyrate, L-tyrosine, and L-phenylalanine biosynthesis from bacteria. Furthermore, these rats showed dysfunction in the microbiota-gut-brain axis, evidenced by a hypo-serotonergic system, hyper-noradrenergic system, defective hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, compromised gut barrier integrity, heightened serum inflammation, and diminished gut immunity. A 1-month <i>L. helveticus</i> NS8 intervention increased the fecal abundance of <i>L. helveticus</i>; reduced the abundance of <i>Bilophila</i> and Debaryomycetaceae; decreased immobility time but increased climbing time in the forced swimming test; reduced hippocampal corticotropin-releasing hormone levels; decreased hypothalamic norepinephrine levels; increased hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor dopamine, and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid content; and improved the gut microbiota, serotonergic, and noradrenergic system.The depressive phenotype of Wistar-Kyoto rats is not only attributed to their genetic context but also closely related to their gut microbiota. Abnormal gut microbiota and a dysfunctional microbiota-gut-brain axis play important roles in endogenous depression, just as they do in exogenous depression. Supplementing with probiotics such as <i>L. helveticus</i> NS8 is likely a promising approach to improve endogenous depression and treatment-resistant depression.",Frontiers in immunology,2024,Husile Alatan; Shan Liang; Yosuke Shimodaira; Xiaoli Wu; Xu Hu; Tao Wang; Jia Luo; Katsunori Iijima; Feng Jin

38896988,Hyperglycemia and cognitive impairments anticipate the onset of an overt type 2 diabetes-like phenotype in TALLYHO/JngJ mice.,"Type 2 Diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disorder characterized by chronic hyperglycemia, resulting from deficits in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. Whilst the role of insulin in the peripheral nervous system has been ascertained in countless studies, its role in the central nervous system (CNS) is emerging only recently. Brain insulin has been lately associated with brain disorders like Alzheimer's disease, obsessive compulsive disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Thus, understanding the role of insulin as a common risk factor for mental and somatic comorbidities may disclose novel preventative and therapeutic approaches. We evaluated general metabolism (glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, energy expenditure, lipid metabolism, and polydipsia) and cognitive capabilities (attention, cognitive flexibility, and memory), in adolescent, young adult, and adult male and female TALLYHO/JngJ mice (TH, previously reported to constitute a valid experimental model of T2DM due to impaired insulin signaling). Adult TH mice have also been studied for alterations in gut microbiota diversity and composition. While TH mice exhibited profound deficits in cognitive flexibility and altered glucose metabolism, we observed that these alterations emerged either much earlier (males) or independent of (females) a comprehensive constellation of symptoms, isomorphic to an overt T2DM-like phenotype (insulin resistance, polydipsia, higher energy expenditure, and altered lipid metabolism). We also observed significant sex-dependent alterations in gut microbiota alpha diversity and taxonomy in adult TH mice. Deficits in insulin signaling may represent a common risk factor for both T2DM and CNS-related deficits, which may stem from (partly) independent mechanisms.",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2024,Martina Presta; Francesca Zoratto; Danique Mulder; Angela Maria Ottomana; Edoardo Pisa; Alejandro Arias VÃ¡squez; David A Slattery; Jeffrey C Glennon; Simone MacrÃ¬
39089603,"Enhanced cerebral blood flow similarity of the somatomotor network in chronic insomnia: Transcriptomic decoding, gut microbial signatures and phenotypic roles.","Chronic insomnia (CI) is a complex disease involving multiple factors including genetics, gut microbiota, and brain structure and function. However, there lacks a unified framework to elucidate how these factors interact in CI. By combining data of clinical assessment, sleep behavior recording, cognitive test, multimodal MRI (structural, functional, and perfusion), gene, and gut microbiota, this study demonstrated that enhanced cerebral blood flow (CBF) similarities of the somatomotor network (SMN) acted as a key mediator to link multiple factors in CI. Specifically, we first demonstrated that only CBF but not morphological or functional networks exhibited alterations in patients with CI, characterized by increases within the SMN and between the SMN and higher-order associative networks. Moreover, these findings were highly reproducible and the CBF similarity method was test-retest reliable. Further, we showed that transcriptional profiles explained 60.4 % variance of the pattern of the increased CBF similarities with the most correlated genes enriched in regulation of cellular and protein localization and material transport, and gut microbiota explained 69.7 % inter-individual variance in the increased CBF similarities with the most contributions from Negativicutes and Lactobacillales. Finally, we found that the increased CBF similarities were correlated with clinical variables, accounted for sleep behaviors and cognitive deficits, and contributed the most to the patient-control classification (accuracy = 84.4 %). Altogether, our findings have important implications for understanding the neuropathology of CI and may inform ways of developing new therapeutic strategies for the disease.",NeuroImage,2024,Xiaofen Ma; Junle Li; Yuping Yang; Xiaofan Qiu; Jintao Sheng; Ningke Han; Changwen Wu; Guang Xu; Guihua Jiang; Junzhang Tian; Xuchu Weng; Jinhui Wang

39452233,"Pharmacists' Knowledge, Perception, and Prescribing Practice of Probiotics in the UAE: A Cross-Sectional Study.","The human body is a complex and interconnected system where trillions of microorganisms, collectively known as the gut microbiota, coexist with these cells. Besides maintaining digestive health, this relationship also impacts well-being, including immune function, metabolism, and mental health. As frontline healthcare providers, pharmacists are pivotal in promoting the benefits of probiotics for immune support. This study explored pharmacists' knowledge, perception, and practice behavior in the UAE towards the implication of probiotic application beyond digestive health, such as cardiovascular and mental health impacts and their diverse dosage forms.An online self-administered survey was distributed among pharmacists in the UAE. Data were collected through personal visits to pharmacies, where pharmacists were approached and asked to complete the questionnaire. The sample size included 407 pharmacists, determined using the formula for proportions with a 95% confidence level and a 5% margin of error. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 29. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize demographic characteristics and survey responses. The knowledge levels were categorized into poor, moderate, and good. Chi-square analysis was employed to investigate associations between demographic factors and knowledge levels, with a significance level set at <i>p</i> < 0.05, enhancing the robustness of the study's findings.This study included 407 completed eligible responses. About 63.56% of participants were female, with 52.1% employed in pharmacy chains. While 91.2% of pharmacists recognized probiotics' role in immune support, only 30% were aware of their cardiovascular benefits. Moreover, chewing gum was the least known dosage form of probiotics, recognized by only 16.7% of respondents. Additionally, only 57% of the participants recognized liposomes as a dosage form. In practice, most pharmacists recommended storing probiotics at room temperature, accounting for 66.6%. The most prevalent misconception encountered in the pharmacy setting was the belief that probiotics are primarily intended for gastrointestinal tract problems, at 79.1% of the respondents. Regarding perception, the agreement was observed regarding the safety of probiotics for all ages. Perceived barriers included the high cost of probiotics, with the majority (86.5%) indicating this as a significant obstacle, while lack of demand was identified as the minor barrier by 64.6%. Additionally, an association was found at a significance level of <i>p</i> < 0.05 with knowledge, gender, educational level, type and location of pharmacy, and source of information.The study highlights knowledge gaps in pharmacists' understanding of probiotic applications beyond digestive health, particularly cardiovascular health and depression. Targeted educational interventions are necessary to address these gaps. The findings underscore the importance of ongoing professional development for pharmacists, enhancing their role in patient education and the promotion of probiotics for overall health.","Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)",2024,Maram O Abbas; Hanan Ahmed; Eisha Hamid; Dyshania Padayachee; Menah Talla Abdulbadia; Sohila Khalid; Ahmed Abuelhana; Bazigha K Abdul Rasool
39217732,"Investigating the bacterial profiles of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Actinobacteria, Fusobacterium, Firmicutes, and Bacteroides in stool samples from patients with severe depression and healthy individuals.","Depression is a multifaceted mental health disorder with complex etiology and significant global burden. Recent research indicates that the gut microbiota plays a role in the pathophysiology of depression, highlighting the potential role of specific bacterial species in influencing mood and cognitive function. In this study, we aimed to investigate the presence, copy numbers, and Ct values of selected bacterial species in stool samples from depressed patients (n=50) compared to control subjects (n=50). Our findings revealed significant differences in the abundance of Fusobacterium spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Lactobacillus spp., Bacteroidetes phylum, Firmicutes phylum, and Actinobacteria spp. between the two groups. Dysregulation of the gut microbiota, characterized by decreased presence of beneficial bacteria (e.g., Bifidobacterium spp., Lactobacillus spp.) and altered abundance of potentially pathogenic bacteria (e.g., Fusobacterium spp.), may contribute to the development or exacerbation of depression. These findings support the emerging concept of the gut-brain axis and its role in mental health. However, further research is needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms and explore the therapeutic potential of microbiota-targeted interventions for depression. Understanding the intricate interplay between the gut microbiota and depression could pave the way for novel treatment strategies and personalized approaches in mental health care.",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2024,Fatemeh Arbabi; Reza Shapoury; Fakhri Haghi; Habib Zeighami; Reza Pirzeh

Furthermore, 1âHz LF-TMS-treatment partially recovered chronic stress induced changes of microbiotas, such as the abundance of <i>Chloroflexi</i>, <i>Actinobacteria</i>.These results manifested that LF-TMS treatment can improve the anhedonic behaviors caused by CUMS in mice, which are connected with regulating the related intestinal microbial community disturbance, including species diversity, structure of gut microbiota, and species composition.",Alpha psychiatry,2024,Linyin Gao; Xiangwei Zhao; Lei Wu; Chuan Liu; Ran Ding; Haitao Wang; Xueliang Shang
38432179,Combination of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> and fructooligosaccharides upregulates colonic vitamin D receptor in C57BL/6J mice and affects anxiety-related behavior in a sex-specific manner.,"Depression and anxiety disorders are among the most common mental health disorders that affect US adults today, frequently related to vitamin D (VD) insufficiency. Along with VD, growing evidence suggests gut microbiota likely play a role in neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we investigated if modulation of gut microbiota would disrupt host VD status and promote behaviors related to depression and anxiety in adult mice. Six-week-old male and female C57BL/6J mice (n = 10/mice/group) were randomly assigned to receive (1) control diet (CTR), control diet treated with antibiotics (AB), control diet with total 5000 IU of VD (VD), VD treated with antibiotics (VD + AB), VD supplemented with 5% w/w fructooligosaccharides (FOS; VF), and VF diet treated with antibiotics (VF + AB), respectively, for 8 weeks. Our study demonstrated that VD status was not affected by antibiotic regimen. VD alone ameliorates anxiety-related behavior in female mice, and that combination with FOS (i.e., VF) did not further improve the outcome. Male mice, in contrast, exhibit greater anxiety with VF, but not VD, when compared with CTR mice. Colonic VD receptor was elevated in VF-treated mice in both sexes, compared with CTR, which was positively correlated to colonic TPH1, a rate-limiting enzyme for serotonin synthesis. Taken together, our data indicate that the effect of VF on anxiety-related behavior is sex-specific, which may partially be attributed to the activation of colonic VD signaling and subsequent serotonin synthesis. The synergistic or additive effect of VD and FOS on mood disorders remained to be investigated.","Nutrition research (New York, N.Y.)",2024,Karisa M Renteria; Ethan Constantine; Chin May Teoh; Analynn Cooper; Nissi Lozano; Spenser Bauer; Gar Yee Koh
38960388,Beneficial effect of GABA-producing Lactiplantibacillus strain LPB145 isolated from cheese starters evaluated in anxiety- and depression-like behaviours in rats.,"In a previous study, we reported the in vitro potential probiotic and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) production, of several strains from a collection of Lactiplantibacillus (Lpb) strains within the community of natural whey starters from the artisanal cheese industry. GABA is a non-protein amino acid widely distributed in nature and produced in animals, plants, and microorganisms. However, the best known role of GABA is its function as the major inhibitory neurotransmitter of the central nervous system. Preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that the GABAergic system has a relevant role in mental health disorders, such as anxiety and major depression. The modulation of the GABAergic system has been suggested as a potential strategy for treatment, one such mechanism of modulation is the influence of the microbiota-gut-brain axis through probiotic treatments. The present study was designed to investigate the in vivo probiotic potential of LPB145, a Lactiplantibacillus strain previously characterised as a GABA-producing potentially probiotic strain. Therefore, we evaluated the behavioural effects of chronic oral administration of LPB145 on rats' anxiety- and depression-like behaviours, using the elevated plus maze, open field, and the forced swimming test. The impact of LPB145 strain treatment on the gut microbiota structure and diversity was assessed to discern a possible mechanism of action of the LPB145 treatment through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Our results showed that LPB145 administration induced an antidepressive-like behaviour without changes in locomotor activity. In contrast, the treatment did not modify the experimental anxiety. The structure and diversity of the intestinal microbiota remained unaffected by the treatment when compared to the control. However, specific clades that could be implicated in the behavioural changes did show differences in their relative abundance. These findings provide evidence regarding the potential of probiotic strains isolated from alimentary sources, to modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis and positively impact mental health.",Beneficial microbes,2024,J Lozano; S Fabius; S FernÃ¡ndez-Ciganda; J Urbanavicius; C Piccini; C Scorza; P Zunino
39313515,Oral administration of astilbin mitigates acetaminophen-induced acute liver injury in mice by modulating the gut microbiota.,"Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose-induced acute liver injury (ALI) is characterized by extensive oxidative stress, and the clinical interventions for this adverse effect remain limited. Astilbin is an active compound found in the rhizome of Smilax glabra Roxb. with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. Due to its low oral bioavailability, astilbin can accumulate in the intestine, which provides a basis for the interaction between astilbin and gut microbiota (GM). In the present study we investigated the protective effects of astilbin against APAP-induced ALI by focusing on the interaction between astilbin and GM. Mice were treated with astilbin (50âmgÂ·kg<sup>-1</sup>Â·d<sup>-1</sup>, i.g.) for 7 days. After the last administration of astilbin for 2âh, the mice received APAP (300âmg/kg, i.g.) to induce ALI. We showed that oral administration of astilbin significantly alleviated APAP-induced ALI by altering the composition of GM and enriching beneficial metabolites including hydroxytyrosol (HT). GM depletion using an ""antibiotics cocktail"" or paraoral administration of astilbin abolished the hepatoprotective effects of astilbin. On the other hand, administration of HT (10âmg/kg, i.g.) caused similar protective effects in APAP-induced ALI mice. Transcriptomic analysis of the liver tissue revealed that HT inhibited reactive oxygen species and inflammation-related signaling in APAP-induced ALI; HT promoted activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway to combat oxidative stress following APAP challenge in a sirtuin-6-dependent manner. These results highlight that oral astilbin ameliorates APAP-induced ALI by manipulating the GM and metabolites towards a more favorable profile, and provide an alternative therapeutic strategy for alleviating APAP-induced ALI.",Acta pharmacologica Sinica,2024,Qin Yang; Wen-Hao He; Li Xie; Tao Chen; Ruo-Fan Liu; Jia-Jia Hu; Jia-Yin Guo; Guo-Zhu Tan; Fu-Ling Wu; Peng Gu; Peng Chen; Yu Chen
38166669,"Effectiveness of a socioecological model-guided, smart device-based, self-management-oriented lifestyle intervention in community residents: protocol for a cluster-randomized controlled trial.","Healthy lifestyles are crucial for preventing chronic diseases. Nonetheless, approximately 90% of Chinese community residents regularly engage in at least one unhealthy lifestyle. Mobile smart devices-based health interventions (mHealth) that incorporate theoretical frameworks regarding behavioral change in interaction with the environment may provide an appealing and cost-effective approach for promoting sustainable adaptations of healthier lifestyles. We designed a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effectiveness of a socioecological model-guided, smart device-based, and self-management-oriented lifestyles (3SLIFE) intervention, to promote healthy lifestyles among Chinese community residents.This two-arm, parallel, cluster-RCT with a 6-month intervention and 6-month follow-up period foresees to randomize a total of 20 communities/villages from 4 townships in a 1:1 ratio to either intervention or control. Within these communities, a total of at least 256 community residents will be enrolled. The experimental group will receive a multi-level intervention based on the socioecological model supplemented with a multi-dimensional empowerment approach. The control group will receive information only. The primary outcome is the reduction of modifiable unhealthy lifestyles at six months, including smoking, excess alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, unbalanced diet, and overweight/obesity. A reduction by one unhealthy behavior measured with the Healthy Lifestyle Index Score (HLIS) will be considered favorable. Secondary outcomes include reduction of specific unhealthy lifestyles at 3Â months, 9Â months, and 12Â months, and mental health outcomes such as depression measured with PHQ-9, social outcomes such as social support measured with the modified Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, clinical outcomes such as obesity, and biomedical outcomes such as the development of gut microbiota. Data will be analyzed with mixed effects generalized linear models with family and link function determined by outcome distribution and accounting for clustering of participants in communities.This study will provide evidence concerning the effect of a mHealth intervention that incorporates a behavioral change theoretical framework on cultivating and maintaining healthy lifestyles in community residents. The study will provide insights into research on and application of similar mHealth intervention strategies to promote healthy lifestyles in community populations and settings.ChiCTR2300070575.

38737108,Cucurbitacin E Alleviates Colonic Barrier Function Impairment and Inflammation Response and Improves Microbial Composition on Experimental Colitis Models.,"Cucurbitacins, which are found in a variety of medicinal plants, vegetables and fruits, were known for their diverse pharmacological and biological activities, including anticancer, anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. Cucurbitacin E, one of the major cucurbitacins, was recently proved to inhibit inflammatory response.To explore the therapeutic effects of cucurbitacin E on colitis and the underlying mechanisms, male mice drunk water containing 2.5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) to establish colitis model and administrated with cucurbitacin E during and after DSS treatment. The disease activity index was scored and colonic histological damage was observed. Intestinal tight junction and inflammatory response were determined. 16S rRNA and transcriptome sequencing were performed to analyze gut microbiota composition and gene expression, respectively.We found that cucurbitacin E alleviated DSS-induced body weight loss and impaired colonic morphology. Cucurbitacin E decreased the expression of inflammatory cytokines and cell apoptosis, and maintained barrier function. Additionally, cucurbitacin E retrieved DSS-induced alterations in the bacterial community composition. Furthermore, a variety of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) caused by cucurbitacin E were enriched in several pathways including the NFÎºB and TNF signaling pathways as well as in Th17 cell differentiation. There was a close relationship between DEGs and bacteria such as <i>Escherichia-Shigella</i> and Muribaculaceae.Our results revealed that cucurbitacin E may exert protective effects on colitis via modulating inflammatory response, microbiota composition and host gene expression. Our study supports the therapeutic potential of cucurbitacin E in colitis and indicates that gut microbes are potentially therapeutic targets.",Journal of inflammation research,2024,Fengxia Zhan; Wei Song; Yong Fan; Fangjian Wang; Qian Wang
39271063,"Probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum 299v supplementation in patients with major depression in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial: A metabolomics study.","Understanding the multifactorial nature of major depressive disorder (MDD) is crucial for tailoring treatments. However, the complex interplay of various factors underlying the development and progression of MDD poses significant challenges. Our previous study demonstrated improvements in cognitive functions in MDD patients undergoing treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) supplemented with Lactobacillus plantarum 299v (LP299v).To elucidate the biochemical mechanisms underlying cognitive functions improvements, we explored underlying metabolic changes. We employed multi-platform metabolomics, including LC-QTOF-MS and CE-TOF-MS profiling, alongside chiral LC-QqQ-MS analysis for amino acids.Supplementation of SSRI treatment with LP299v intensified the reduction of long-chain acylcarnitines, potentially indicating improved mitochondrial function. LP299v supplementation reduced N-acyl taurines more than four times compared to the placebo, suggesting a substantial impact on restoring biochemical balance. The LP299v-supplemented group showed increased levels of oxidized glycerophosphocholine (oxPC). Additionally, LP299v supplementation led to higher levels of sphingomyelins, L-histidine, D-valine, and p-cresol.This exploratory study suggests potential metabolic pathways influenced by LP299v supplementation. However, the need for further research hinders the ability to draw definitive conclusions.Observed metabolic changes were linked to mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, oxidative stress, and gut microbiota disruption. Despite the subtle nature of this alterations, our research successfully detected these differences and connected them to the metabolic disruptions associated with MDD. Our findings emphasise the intricate relationship between metabolism, gut microbiota, and mental health prompting further research into the mechanisms of action of probiotics in MDD treatment.",Journal of affective disorders,2024,Joanna Godzien; Bartlomiej Kalaska; Leszek Rudzki; Cecilia Barbas-Bernardos; Justyna Swieton; Angeles Lopez-Gonzalvez; Lucyna Ostrowska; Agata Szulc; Napoleon Waszkiewicz; Michal Ciborowski; Antonia GarcÃ­a; Adam Kretowski; Coral Barbas; Dariusz Pawlak
38278499,Alcohol use-associated alterations in the circulating metabolite profile in the general population and in individuals with major depressive disorder.,"Our aim was to evaluate whether alcohol use is associated with changes in the circulating metabolite profile similar to those present in persons with depression. If so, these findings could partially explain the link between alcohol use and depression. We applied a targeted liquid chromatography mass spectrometry method to evaluate correlates between concentrations of 86 circulating metabolites and self-reported alcohol use in a cohort of the non-depressed general population (GP) (nÂ =Â 247) and a cohort of individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) (nÂ =Â 99). Alcohol use was associated with alterations in circulating concentrations of metabolites in both cohorts. Our main finding was that self-reported alcohol use was negatively correlated with serum concentrations of hippuric acid in the GP cohort. In the GP cohort, consumption of six or more doses per week was associated with low hippuric acid concentrations, similar to those observed in the MDD cohort, but in these individuals it was regardless of their level of alcohol use. Reduced serum concentrations of hippuric acid suggest that already-moderate alcohol use is associated with depression-like changes in the serum levels of metabolites associated with gut microbiota and liver function; this may be one possible molecular level link between alcohol use and depression.","Alcohol (Fayetteville, N.Y.)",2024,Olli KÃ¤rkkÃ¤inen; Tommi Tolmunen; Petri KivimÃ¤ki; Karoliina Kurkinen; Toni Ali-Sisto; Pekka MÃ¤ntyselkÃ¤; Minna Valkonen-Korhonen; Heli Koivumaa-Honkanen; Kirsi Honkalampi; Anu Ruusunen; Vidya Velagapudi; Soili M Lehto
33362788,The Gut-Brain Axis: How Microbiota and Host Inflammasome Influence Brain Physiology and Pathology.,"The human microbiota has a fundamental role in host physiology and pathology. Gut microbial alteration, also known as dysbiosis, is a condition associated not only with gastrointestinal disorders but also with diseases affecting other distal organs. Recently it became evident that the intestinal bacteria can affect the central nervous system (CNS) physiology and inflammation. The nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract are communicating through a bidirectional network of signaling pathways called the gut-brain axis, which consists of multiple connections, including the vagus nerve, the immune system, and bacterial metabolites and products. During dysbiosis, these pathways are dysregulated and associated with altered permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and neuroinflammation. However, numerous mechanisms behind the impact of the gut microbiota in neuro-development and -pathogenesis remain poorly understood. There are several immune pathways involved in CNS homeostasis and inflammation. Among those, the inflammasome pathway has been linked to neuroinflammatory conditions such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, but also anxiety and depressive-like disorders. The inflammasome complex assembles upon cell activation due to exposure to microbes, danger signals, or stress and lead to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1Î² and interleukin-18) and to pyroptosis. Evidences suggest that there is a reciprocal influence of microbiota and inflammasome activation in the brain. However, how this influence is precisely working is yet to be discovered. Herein, we discuss the status of the knowledge and the open questions in the field focusing on the function of intestinal microbial metabolites or products on CNS cells during healthy and inflammatory conditions, such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and also neuropsychiatric disorders. In particular, we focus on the innate inflammasome pathway as immune mechanism that can be involved in several of these conditions, upon exposure to certain microbes.",Frontiers in immunology,2020,Andrina Rutsch; Johan B KantsjÃ¶; Francesca Ronchi
32934117,Gut Microbiota and Metabolome Alterations Associated with Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of intracellular aggregates of misfolded alpha-synuclein along the cerebral axis. Several studies report the association between intestinal dysbiosis and Parkinson's disease, although a cause-effect relationship remains to be established. Herein, the gut microbiota composition of 64 Italian patients with Parkinson's disease and 51 controls was determined using a next-generation sequencing approach. A real metagenomics shape based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was also investigated. The most significant changes within the Parkinson's disease group highlighted a reduction in bacterial taxa, which are linked to anti-inflammatory/neuroprotective effects, particularly in the <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> family and key members, such as <i>Butyrivibrio, Pseudobutyrivibrio, Coprococcus</i>, and <i>Blautia</i> The direct evaluation of fecal metabolites revealed changes in several classes of metabolites. Changes were seen in lipids (linoleic acid, oleic acid, succinic acid, and sebacic acid), vitamins (pantothenic acid and nicotinic acid), amino acids (isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, glutamic acid, and pyroglutamic acid) and other organic compounds (cadaverine, ethanolamine, and hydroxy propionic acid). Most modified metabolites strongly correlated with the abundance of members belonging to the <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> family, suggesting that these gut bacteria correlate with altered metabolism rates in Parkinson's disease.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> To our knowledge, this is one of the few studies thus far that correlates the composition of the gut microbiota with the direct analysis of fecal metabolites in patients with Parkinson's disease. Overall, our data highlight microbiota modifications correlated with numerous fecal metabolites. This suggests that Parkinson's disease is associated with gut dysregulation that involves a synergistic relationship between gut microbes and several bacterial metabolites favoring altered homeostasis. Interestingly, a reduction of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria influenced the shape of the metabolomics profile, affecting several metabolites with potential protective effects in the Parkinson group. On the other hand, the extensive impact that intestinal dysbiosis has at the level of numerous metabolic pathways could encourage the identification of specific biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of Parkinson's disease, also in light of the effect that specific drugs have on the composition of the intestinal microbiota.",mSystems,2020,Sarah Vascellari; Vanessa Palmas; Marta Melis; Silvia Pisanu; Roberto Cusano; Paolo Uva; Daniela Perra; Veronica Madau; Marianna Sarchioto; Valentina Oppo; Nicola Simola; Micaela Morelli; Maria Laura Santoru; Luigi Atzori; Maurizio Melis; Giovanni Cossu; Aldo Manzin
32357258,Microbiota Composition and Metabolism Are Associated With Gut Function in Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease is characterized by a high burden of gastrointestinal comorbidities, especially constipation and reduced colonic transit time, and by gut microbiota alterations. The diverse metabolites produced by the microbiota are broadly relevant to host health. How microbiota composition and metabolism relate to gastrointestinal function in Parkinson's disease is largely unknown. The objectives of the current study were to assesses associations between microbiota composition, stool consistency, constipation, and systemic microbial metabolites in Parkinson's disease to better understand how intestinal microbes contribute to gastrointestinal disturbances commonly observed in patients.Three hundred participants (197 Parkinson's patients and 103 controls) were recruited for this cross-sectional cohort study. Participants supplied fecal samples for microbiota sequencing (n = 300) and serum for untargeted metabolomics (n = 125). Data were collected on motor and nonmotor Parkinson's symptoms, medications, diet, and demographics.Significant microbiota taxonomic differences were observed in Parkinson's patients, even when controlling for gastrointestinal function. Parkinson's microbiota was characterized by reduced carbohydrate fermentation and butyrate synthesis capacity and increased proteolytic fermentation and production of deleterious amino acid metabolites, including p-cresol and phenylacetylglutamine. Taxonomic shifts and elevated proteolytic metabolites were strongly associated with stool consistency (a proxy for colonic transit time) and constipation among patients.Compositional and metabolic alterations in the Parkinson's microbiota are highly associated with gut function, suggesting plausible mechanistic links between altered bacterial metabolism and reduced gut health in this disease. The systemic detection of elevated deleterious proteolytic microbial metabolites in Parkinson's serum suggests a mechanism whereby microbiota dysbiosis contributes to disease etiology and pathophysiology.

Overall, these studies supported the differences of gut microbiota between PD patients and matched controls, while significantly altered bacterial taxa among studies were not identical. Due to relatively limited number of available studies and covered patients, the associations between oral and nasal microbiota and PD remain inconclusive. The therapeutic and diagnostic potentials of gut microbiota for PD are discussed.

32290475,d-glutamate and Gut Microbiota in Alzheimer's Disease.,"An increasing number of studies have shown that the brain-gut-microbiota axis may significantly contribute to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Moreover, impaired memory and learning involve the dysfunction neurotransmission of glutamate, the agonist of the <i>N</i>-methyl-d-aspartate receptor and a major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain. This systematic review aimed to summarize the current cutting-edge research on the gut microbiota and glutamate alterations associated with dementia.PubMed, the Cochrane Collaboration Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials, and Cochrane Systematic Reviews were reviewed for all studies on glutamate and gut microbiota in dementia published up until Feb 2020.Several pilot studies have reported alterations of gut microbiota and metabolites in AD patients and other forms of dementia. Gut microbiota including <i>Bacteroides vulgatus</i> and <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> affect glutamate metabolism and decrease the glutamate metabolite 2-keto-glutaramic acid. Meanwhile, gut bacteria with glutamate racemase including <i>Corynebacterium glutamicum, Brevibacterium lactofermentum</i>, and <i>Brevibacterium avium</i> can convert l-glutamate to d-glutamate. N-methyl-d-aspartate glutamate receptor (NMDAR)-enhancing agents have been found to potentially improve cognition in AD or Parkinson's disease patients. These findings suggest that d-glutamate (d-form glutamate) metabolized by the gut bacteria may influence the glutamate NMDAR and cognitive function in dementia patients.Gut microbiota and glutamate are potential novel interventions to be developed for dementia. Exploring comprehensive cognitive functions in animal and human trials with glutamate-related NMDAR enhancers are warranted to examine d-glutamate signaling efficacy in gut microbiota in patients with AD and other neurodegenerative dementias.",International journal of molecular sciences,2020,Chun-Hung Chang; Chieh-Hsin Lin; Hsien-Yuan Lane

32827699,Acupuncture inhibits neuroinflammation and gut microbial dysbiosis in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease.,"Growing evidences show that gut microbiota is associated with the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) and the gut-brain axis can be promising target for the development of the therapeutic strategies for PD. Acupuncture has been used to improve brain functions and inflammation in neurological disorders such as PD, and to recover the gastrointestinal dysfunctions in various gastrointestinal disorders. Thus, we investigated whether acupuncture could improve Parkinsonism and gut microbial dysbiosis induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. First, we observed that acupuncture treatment at acupoints GB34 and ST36 could improve motor functions and comorbid anxiety in PD mice. Next, we found that acupuncture increased the levels of dopaminergic fibers and neurons in the striatum and the substantia nigra, respectively. Acupuncture also restored the overexpression of microglia and astrocyte as well as conversion of Bax and Bcl-2 expression in both the striatum and the substantia nigra, indicating that inflammatory responses and apoptosis were blocked by acupuncture. Additionally, via 16S rRNA sequence analysis, we observed that the relative abundance of 18 genera were changed in acupuncture-treated mice compared to the PD mice. Of them, Butyricimonas, Holdemania, Frisingicoccus, Gracilibacter, Phocea, and Aestuariispira showed significant correlations with anxiety as well as motor functions. Furthermore, the predicted functional analyses showed that acupuncture restored the physiology functions such as glutathione metabolism, methane metabolism, and PD pathway. In conclusion, we suggest that the effects of acupuncture on the enhanced motor function and the protection of the dopaminergic neurons may be associated with the regulation of the gut microbial dysbiosis and thus the inhibition of the neuroinflammation in the PD mice.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2020,Jae-Hwan Jang; Mi-Jung Yeom; Sora Ahn; Ju-Young Oh; Suhwan Ji; Tae-Hong Kim; Hi-Joon Park

Beyond epilepsy, there are yet additional potential uses in neurological disorders because KD appears to have the broad anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. The KD exerts anti-inflammatory action against a variety of experimental models of neurological disorders including multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, pain, and spinal cord injury. Anti-inflammatory action of KD appears to be mediated by multiple mechanisms. Ketones bodies, caloric restriction, polyunsaturated fatty acids and gut microbiota modifications might be involved in the modulation of inflammation by the KD.",Epilepsy research,2020,Sookyong Koh; Nina Dupuis; StÃ©phane Auvin
31968211,Fecal microbiota transplantation in disease therapy.,"Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is the introduction (transplantation) of gut microbiota obtained from the faeces of a healthy donor into the patient's gastrointestinal tract. Most often, such therapy is used the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases caused by the activity of pathogenic or conditionally pathogenic microorganisms, however, recently an increasing number of studies have reported the use of fecal microbiota transplantation for the treatment of diseases such as metabolic syndrome, diabetes, cancer and Parkinson's disease. This review article presents the results of studies concerning the impact of FMT on weight gain, immunological response and the treatment of neurological and gastrointestinal diseases and cancer. The procedure of fecal microbiota transplantation and possible side effects that may appear in FMT recipients are also described.",Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,2020,Hanna Antushevich

Microbiota-targeted interventions, including probiotic Clostridium butyricum (Cb), have been recently shown to have favorable effects in PD by regulating microbiota-gut-brain axis. However, the potential beneficial roles and its mechanisms of Cb on PD were still unknown. Male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to a PD model-induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and were treated intragastrically with Cb for 4Â weeks. The motor functions were assessed by a series of behavioral tests including pole test, beam walking teat, forced swimming test and open field test. The dopaminergic neuron loss, synaptic plasticity and microglia activation, as well as the levels of colonic glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), colonic G protein-coupled receptors GPR41/43 and cerebral GLP-1 receptors were assessed. Gut microbial composition was assessed by 16S rRNA sequencing analysis. Our results showed that oral administration of Cb could improve motor deficits, dopaminergic neuron loss, synaptic dysfunction and microglia activation in the MPTP-induced mice. Meanwhile, Cb treatment could reverse the dysbiosis of gut microbiota and the decreased levels of colonic GLP-1, colonic GPR41/43 and cerebral GLP-1 receptor in the MPTP-induced mice. These findings indicated that the neuroprotective mechanism of Cb on PD might be related to the improvement of abnormal gut microbiota-gut-brain axis.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2021,Jing Sun; Haijun Li; Yangjie Jin; Jiaheng Yu; Shiyin Mao; Kuan-Pin Su; Zongxin Ling; Jiaming Liu

32266160,Fecal Microbiota Transplantation in Neurological Disorders.,"<b>Background:</b> Several studies suggested an important role of the gut microbiota in the pathophysiology of neurological disorders, implying that alteration of the gut microbiota might serve as a treatment strategy. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is currently the most effective gut microbiota intervention and an accepted treatment for recurrent <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> infections. To evaluate indications of FMT for patients with neurological disorders, we summarized the available literature on FMT. In addition, we provide suggestions for future directions. <b>Methods:</b> In July 2019, five main databases were searched for studies and case descriptions on FMT in neurological disorders in humans or animal models. In addition, the ClinicalTrials.gov website was consulted for registered planned and ongoing trials. <b>Results:</b> Of 541 identified studies, 34 were included in the analysis. Clinical trials with FMT have been performed in patients with autism spectrum disorder and showed beneficial effects on neurological symptoms. For multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease, several animal studies suggested a positive effect of FMT, supported by some human case reports. For epilepsy, Tourette syndrome, and diabetic neuropathy some studies suggested a beneficial effect of FMT, but evidence was restricted to case reports and limited numbers of animal studies. For stroke, Alzheimer's disease and Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome only studies with animal models were identified. These studies suggested a potential beneficial effect of healthy donor FMT. In contrast, one study with an animal model for stroke showed increased mortality after FMT. For Guillain-BarrÃ© only one study was identified. Whether positive findings from animal studies can be confirmed in the treatment of human diseases awaits to be seen. Several trials with FMT as treatment for the above mentioned neurological disorders are planned or ongoing, as well as for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. <b>Conclusions:</b> Preliminary literature suggests that FMT may be a promising treatment option for several neurological disorders. However, available evidence is still scanty and some contrasting results were observed. A limited number of studies in humans have been performed or are ongoing, while for some disorders only animal experiments have been conducted. Large double-blinded randomized controlled trials are needed to further elucidate the effect of FMT in neurological disorders.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2020,Karuna E W Vendrik; Rogier E Ooijevaar; Pieter R C de Jong; Jon D Laman; Bob W van Oosten; Jacobus J van Hilten; Quinten R Ducarmon; Josbert J Keller; Eduard J Kuijper; Maria Fiorella Contarino
33099131,Altered gut microbiota in Parkinson's disease patients/healthy spouses and its association with clinical features.,"Increasing evidence shows that gut microbiota dysbiosis may play important roles in the occurrence and progression of Parkinson's disease (PD), but the findings are inconsistent. Besides, the effect of family environment on gut microbiota dysbiosis remains unclear.We characterized the gut microbial compositions of 63 PD patients, 63 healthy spouses (HS) and 74 healthy people (HP) using 16S rRNA sequencing. Clinical phenotypes and microbial composition were analyzed comprehensively.There were markedly different microbial compositions among PD, HS and HP samples by alpha/beta diversity. We also found differential microbial compositions among Hoehn & Yahr stage/disease duration. Eight inflammation-associated microbial genera shared a continuously increase trend with increased Hoehn & Yahr stage and disease duration, indicating characteristic bacteria associated with deterioration in PD. Additionally, seven bacterial markers were identified for accurately differentiating PD patients from the controls (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.856).Our study shows altered gut microbiota in PD patients. Importantly, inflammation-associated microbial genera may play roles in PD progression. Differential microbial compositions in HS and HP samples demonstrate that the gut microbiota are also affected by family environment. Disease-associated metagenomics studies should consider the family environmental factor. Our research provides an important reference and improves the understanding of gut microbiota in PD patients.",Parkinsonism & related disorders,2020,Fan Zhang; Liya Yue; Xing Fang; Gengchao Wang; Cuidan Li; Xiaodong Sun; Xinmiao Jia; Jingjing Yang; Jinhui Song; Yu Zhang; Chongye Guo; Guannan Ma; Ming Sang; Fei Chen; Puqing Wang

The effects of levodopa (LD) have been poorly assessed, and those of LD-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) have not been evaluated so far. The aim of this study was to identify the effect of LD and LCIG, in particular, on the GM and metabolome.Fecal DNA samples from 107 patients with a clinical diagnosis of PD were analyzed by next-generation sequencing of the V3 and V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene. PD patients were classified in different groups: patients on LCIG (LCIG group, nÂ =Â 38) and on LD (LD group, nÂ =Â 46). We also included a group of patients (nÂ =Â 23) without antiparkinsonian medicaments (NaÃ¯ve group). Fecal metabolic extracts were evaluated by gas chromatography mass spectrometry.The multivariate analysis showed a significantly higher abundance in the LCIG group of Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia, and Serratia compared to the LD group. Compared to the NaÃ¯ve group, the univariate analysis showed a reduction of Blautia and Lachnospirae in the LD group. Moreover, an increase of Proteobacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, and a reduction of Firmicutes, Lachnospiraceae, and Blautia was found in the LCIG group.

32032654,Gut microbiota differences between healthy older adults and individuals with Parkinson's disease: A systematic review.,"The 'Dual Hit' hypothesis, stating that Parkinson's disease (PD) begins via olfactory pathways and the gut, and the gastrointestinal symptoms PD individuals face, have largely driven the interest of the gut's involvement in PD. Studies have since observed gut microbiota differences between PD groups and controls, with these alterations potentially relating to PD pathophysiology. However, differences in the studies' methodologies precludes unanimity on the relationships of gut microbiota to PD. Thirteen observational case-control studies investigating gut microbiota in PD and controls were reviewed to assess how microbiota abundance and diversity relates to PD. Nine studies showed butyrate producing gut microbiota had lower abundances in PD compared to controls. Three studies reported Î±-diversity was higher, with one reporting it was lower, in PD compared to controls. Given most studies show abundance, not diversity, differences of butyrate producing bacteria between groups, we propose abundance differences are more associated with PD than microbiota diversity. As current research is observational, investigating how specific bacteria and their metabolites may alter throughout PD progression is warranted.",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,2020,Nathan D Nuzum; Amy Loughman; Ewa A Szymlek-Gay; Ashlee Hendy; Wei-Peng Teo; Helen Macpherson
31952509,The progress of gut microbiome research related to brain disorders.,"There is increasing evidence showing that the dynamic changes in the gut microbiota can alter brain physiology and behavior. Cognition was originally thought to be regulated only by the central nervous system. However, it is now becoming clear that many non-nervous system factors, including the gut-resident bacteria of the gastrointestinal tract, regulate and influence cognitive dysfunction as well as the process of neurodegeneration and cerebrovascular diseases. Extrinsic and intrinsic factors including dietary habits can regulate the composition of the microbiota. Microbes release metabolites and microbiota-derived molecules to further trigger host-derived cytokines and inflammation in the central nervous system, which contribute greatly to the pathogenesis of host brain disorders such as pain, depression, anxiety, autism, Alzheimer's diseases, Parkinson's disease, and stroke. Change of blood-brain barrier permeability, brain vascular physiology, and brain structure are among the most critical causes of the development of downstream neurological dysfunction.

33381005,Fisetin Regulates Gut Microbiota and Exerts Neuroprotective Effect on Mouse Model of Parkinson's Disease.,"Previous studies have reported the anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer effects of fisetin. However, the therapeutic efficacy of fisetin in Parkinson's disease (PD) is unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that fisetin could markedly alleviate 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration in mice. To confirm the reported correlation between gut microbiota and PD, the bacterial DNA in the fresh feces of mice from each group was subjected to 16S rRNA (V3 and V4 regions) sequencing. The results revealed that fisetin changed the number, diversity, and distribution of gut microbiota in MPTP-induced mice model of PD. The alpha and beta diversity analyses showed that the fisetin intervented MPTP group gut microbiota exhibited a significantly higher abundance of Lachnospiraceae and a significantly lower abundance of uncultured_bacterium_g_Escherichia-Shigella and uncultured_bacterium_g_Bacillus than the MPTP group gut microbiota. These findings indicated that fisetin exerts a neuroprotective effect on neurodegeneration by altering the composition and diversity of gut microbiota. Thus, fisetin could be a potential novel therapeutic for PD.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2020,Tian-Jiao Chen; Ya Feng; Te Liu; Ting-Ting Wu; Ya-Jing Chen; Xuan Li; Qing Li; Yun-Cheng Wu

32712266,"Microglia, inflammation and gut microbiota responses in a progressive monkey model of Parkinson's disease: A case series.","Inflammation has been linked to the development of nonmotor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD), which greatly impact patients' quality of life and can often precede motor symptoms. Suitable animal models are critical for our understanding of the mechanisms underlying disease and the associated prodromal disturbances. The neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated monkey model is commonly seen as a ""gold standard"" model that closely mimics the clinical motor symptoms and the nigrostriatal dopaminergic loss of PD, however MPTP toxicity extends to other nondopaminergic regions. Yet, there are limited reports monitoring the MPTP-induced progressive central and peripheral inflammation as well as other nonmotor symptoms such as gastrointestinal function and microbiota. We report 5 cases of progressive parkinsonism in non-human primates to gain a broader understanding of MPTP-induced central and peripheral inflammatory dysfunction to understand the potential role of inflammation in prodromal/pre-motor features of PD-like degeneration. We measured inflammatory proteins in plasma and CSF and performed [<sup>18</sup>F]FEPPA PET scans to evaluate translocator proteins (TSPO) or microglial activation. Monkeys were also evaluated for working memory and executive function using various behavior tasks and for gastrointestinal hyperpermeability and microbiota composition. Additionally, monkeys were treated with a novel TNF inhibitor XPro1595 (10Â mg/kg, nÂ =Â 3) or vehicle (nÂ =Â 2) every three days starting 11Â weeks after the initiation of MPTP to determine whether XPro1595 would alter inflammation and microglial behavior in a progressive model of PD. The case studies revealed that earlier and robust [<sup>18</sup>F]FEPPA PET signals resulted in earlier and more severe parkinsonism, which was seen in male cases compared to female cases. Potential other sex differences were observed in circulating inflammation, microbiota diversity and their metabolites. Additional studies with larger group sizes of both sexes would enable confirmation and extension of these findings. If these findings reflect potential differences in humans, these sex differences have significant implications for therapeutic development of inflammatory targets in the clinic.",Neurobiology of disease,2020,Valerie Joers; Gunasingh Masilamoni; Doty Kempf; Alison R Weiss; Travis M Rotterman; Benjamin Murray; Gul Yalcin-Cakmakli; Ronald J Voll; Mark M Goodman; Leonard Howell; Jocelyne Bachevalier; Stefan J Green; Ankur Naqib; Maliha Shaikh; Phillip A Engen; Ali Keshavarzian; Christopher J Barnum; Jonathon A Nye; Yoland Smith; MalÃº G Tansey
33194809,Gut Microbiota Approach-A New Strategy to Treat Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by neuronal loss and dysfunction of dopaminergic neurons located in the substantia nigra, which contain a variety of misfolded Î±-synuclein (Î±-syn). Medications that increase or substitute for dopamine can be used for the treatment of PD. Recently, numerous studies have shown gut microbiota plays a crucial role in regulating and maintaining multiple aspects of host physiology including host metabolism and neurodevelopment. In this review article, the role of gut microbiota in the etiological mechanism of PD will be reviewed. Furthermore, we discussed current pharmaceutical medicine-based methods to prevent and treat PD, followed by describing specific strains that affect the host brain function through the gut-brain axis. We explained in detail how gut microbiota directly produces neurotransmitters or regulate the host biosynthesis of neurotransmitters. The neurotransmitters secreted by the intestinal lumen bacteria may induce epithelial cells to release molecules that, in turn, can regulate neural signaling in the enteric nervous system and subsequently control brain function and behavior through the brain-gut axis. Finally, we proved that the microbial regulation of the host neuronal system. Endogenous Î±-syn can be transmitted long distance and bidirectional between ENS and brain through the circulatory system which gives us a new option that the possibility of altering the community of gut microbiota in completely new medication option for treating PD.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2020,Jing Liu; Fei Xu; Zhiyan Nie; Lei Shao

32112917,The Link between Gut Dysbiosis and Neuroinflammation in Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. Despite its high frequency the etiology is still unclear; several lines of evidence show that an inflammatory process is implicated in the pathogenesis of this disorder; where activation of brain microglia plays a central role in the damage of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra. Such inflammation has been attributed to the toxic effect of aggregated Î±-synuclein; however, evidence also implicates an altered gut microbiota (dysbiosis) through the systemic release of endotoxins such as lipopolysaccharide and other metabolic products. This exposure may be enhanced by increased permeability of the intestinal (""leaky gut"") and the blood brain barrier; enhancing the entrance of microbiota-produced substances into the central nervous system. In this manuscript, we explore the evidence from clinical and basic science implicating microglia activation by gut dysbiosis and how this phenomenon may impact in the symptomatology and progression of PD.",Neuroscience,2020,JosÃ© Fidel Baizabal-Carvallo; Marlene Alonso-Juarez

We then highlight the effect of gut microbiota on mechanisms implicated in the pathophysiology of PD, including disrupted microbiota gut brain axis (GBA), barrier dysfunction, and immune dysfunction. It is too early to connect the dots between gut microbiota and PD to establish causation, and experiments focused on investigating interrelationship between gut microbiota and associated metabolites on GBA, barrier dysfunction, and immune activation will be crucial to fill in the gaps.

Recent studies have proposed links between the gut microbiota and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Human body is a complex structure where bacterial and human cells are almost equal in numbers, and most microbes are metabolically active in the gut, where they potentially influence other target organs, including the brain. The role of gut microbiota in the development and pathophysiology of the human brain is an area of growing interest for the scientific community. Several microbial-derived neurochemicals involved in the gut-microbiota-brain crosstalk seem implicated in the biological and physiological basis of neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration. Evidence supporting these connections has come from model systems, but there are still unsolved issues due to several limitations of available research tools. New technologies are recently born to help understanding the causative role of gut microbes in neurodegeneration.

32516966,Gut-Brain Axis and Neurodegeneration: State-of-the-Art of Meta-Omics Sciences for Microbiota Characterization.,"Recent advances in the field of meta-omics sciences and related bioinformatics tools have allowed a comprehensive investigation of human-associated microbiota and its contribution to achieving and maintaining the homeostatic balance. Bioactive compounds from the microbial community harboring the human gut are involved in a finely tuned network of interconnections with the host, orchestrating a wide variety of physiological processes. These includes the bi-directional crosstalk between the central nervous system, the enteric nervous system, and the gastrointestinal tract (i.e., gut-brain axis). The increasing accumulation of evidence suggest a pivotal role of the composition and activity of the gut microbiota in neurodegeneration. In the present review we aim to provide an overview of the state-of-the-art of meta-omics sciences including metagenomics for the study of microbial genomes and taxa strains, metatranscriptomics for gene expression, metaproteomics and metabolomics to identify and/or quantify microbial proteins and metabolites, respectively. The potential and limitations of each discipline were highlighted, as well as the advantages of an integrated approach (multi-omics) to predict microbial functions and molecular mechanisms related to human diseases. Particular emphasis is given to the latest results obtained with these approaches in an attempt to elucidate the link between the gut microbiota and the most common neurodegenerative diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).",International journal of molecular sciences,2020,Bruno Tilocca; Luisa Pieroni; Alessio Soggiu; Domenico Britti; Luigi Bonizzi; Paola Roncada; Viviana Greco
32926778,"1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine Induced Parkinson's Disease in Mouse: Potential Association between Neurotransmitter Disturbance and Gut Microbiota Dysbiosis.","Recent studies have revealed significant roles of neurotransmitters and gut microbiota along the gut-brain axis in Parkinson's disease (PD); however, the potential mechanisms remain poorly understood. In the current study, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) induced characteristic PD neurobehavior changes accompanied by increased Î±-synuclein, apoptotic protein Bim, and cleaved caspase-3 and decreased expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Meanwhile, the tryptophan (Trp) and tyrosine (Tyr) neurotransmitter metabolites involving kynurenine (KYN), serotonin (5-HT), and dopamine (DA) pathways were significantly changed in serum. Furthermore, the step-limited enzymes, which are responsible for the key metabolic pathways of these neurotransmitters, were obviously dysregulated. The 16S rRNA gene sequence results indicated that the abundance and diversity of the microbiota were obviously decreased in MPTP-treated mice, the presence of <i>Ruminococcus, Parabacteroides</i> and <i>Parasutterella</i> genera were obviously increased, while Coriobacteriaceae, <i>Flavonifractor</i>, Lachnospiraceae, Lactobacillaceae, and Rikenellaceae abundance was markedly decreased. The connectivity between the gut microbiota and neurotransmitter metabolism revealed that the gut microbiota dysbiosis was associated with disturbance of the DA, KYN, and 5-HT metabolic pathways. Therefore, our results provide evidence that gut-microbiota-brain axis disturbance may play an important role in PD development and targeting this axis might provide a promising therapeutic strategy for PD.",ACS chemical neuroscience,2020,Yuanhui Zhu; Fei Huan; Junfeng Wang; Xuexue Xie; Guoqin Yu; Xi Wang; Lei Jiang; Rong Gao; Hang Xiao; Haixia Ding; Jun Wang
31931152,Regulation of immune-driven pathogenesis in Parkinson's disease by gut microbiota.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most significant medical and social burdens of our time. The prevalence of PD increases with age and the number of individuals diagnosed with PD is expected to double from 6.9 million in 2015 to 14.2 million in 2040. To date, no drugs can stop the ongoing neurodegeneration caused by PD due to its unclear and complex pathogenic mechanisms. It has been wildly recognized that both gut microbiota and neuro-immunity are involved in the pathology of PD. In this review, we intend to provide a comprehensive overview of current knowledge on how gut microbiota involved in immune-driven pathogenesis of PD, and its potential as a new target of dietary and/or therapeutic interventions for PD.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2020,Wenxia Zheng; Rongni He; Zhenxing Yan; Yaowei Huang; Wei Huang; Zhuoyi Cai; Yuying Su; Siqin Liu; Yiting Deng; Qing Wang; Huifang Xie
33390888,Caffeine and Parkinson's Disease: Multiple Benefits and Emerging Mechanisms.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by dopaminergic neurodegeneration, motor impairment and non-motor symptoms. Epidemiological and experimental investigations into potential risk factors have firmly established that dietary factor caffeine, the most-widely consumed psychoactive substance, may exerts not only neuroprotective but a motor and non-motor (cognitive) benefits in PD. These multi-benefits of caffeine in PD are supported by convergence of epidemiological and animal evidence. At least six large prospective epidemiological studies have firmly established a relationship between increased caffeine consumption and decreased risk of developing PD. In addition, animal studies have also demonstrated that caffeine confers neuroprotection against dopaminergic neurodegeneration using PD models of mitochondrial toxins (MPTP, 6-OHDA, and rotenone) and expression of Î±-synuclein (Î±-Syn). While caffeine has complex pharmacological profiles, studies with genetic knockout mice have clearly revealed that caffeine's action is largely mediated by the brain adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptor (A<sub>2A</sub>R) and confer neuroprotection by modulating neuroinflammation and excitotoxicity and mitochondrial function. Interestingly, recent studies have highlighted emerging new mechanisms including caffeine modulation of Î±-Syn degradation with enhanced autophagy and caffeine modulation of gut microbiota and gut-brain axis in PD models. Importantly, since the first clinical trial in 2003, United States FDA has finally approved clinical use of the A<sub>2A</sub>R antagonist istradefylline for the treatment of PD with OFF-time in Sept. 2019. To realize therapeutic potential of caffeine in PD, genetic study of caffeine and risk genes in human population may identify useful pharmacogenetic markers for predicting individual responses to caffeine in PD clinical trials and thus offer a unique opportunity for ""personalized medicine"" in PD.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2020,Xiangpeng Ren; Jiang-Fan Chen
32247371,The gut microbiome in Parkinson's disease: A culprit or a bystander?,"In recent years, large-scale metagenomics projects such as the Human Microbiome Project placed the gut microbiota under the spotlight of research on its role in health and in the pathogenesis several diseases, as it can be a target for novel therapeutical approaches. The emerging concept of a microbiota modulation of the gut-brain axis in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders has been explored in several studies in animal models, as well as in human subjects. Particularly, research on changes in the composition of gut microbiota as a potential trigger for alpha-synuclein (Î±-syn) pathology in Parkinson's disease (PD) has gained increasing interest. In the present review, we first provide the basis to the understanding of the role of gut microbiota in healthy subjects and the molecular basis of the gut-brain interaction, focusing on metabolic and neuroinflammatory factors that could trigger the alpha-synuclein conformational changes and aggregation. Then, we critically explored preclinical and clinical studies reporting on the changes in gut microbiota in PD, as compared to healthy subjects. Furthermore, we examined the relationship between the gut microbiota and PD clinical features, discussing data consistently reported across studies, as well as the potential sources of inconsistencies. As a further step toward understanding the effects of gut microbiota on PD, we discussed the relationship between dysbiosis and response to dopamine replacement therapy, focusing on Levodopa metabolism. We conclude that further studies are needed to determine whether the gut microbiota changes observed so far in PD patients is the cause or, instead, it is merely a consequence of lifestyle changes associated with the disease. Regardless, studies so far strongly suggest that changes in microbiota appears to be impactful in pathogenesis of neuroinflammation. Thus, dysbiotic microbiota in PD could influence the disease course and response to medication, especially Levodopa. Future research will assess the impact of microbiota-directed therapeutic intervention in PD patients.",Progress in brain research,2020,Ali Keshavarzian; Phillip Engen; Salvatore Bonvegna; Roberto Cilia
32157731,EGCG ameliorates neuronal and behavioral defects by remodeling gut microbiota and TotM expression in Drosophila models of Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. Eigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the major polyphenol in green tea, is known to exert a beneficial effect on PD patients. Although some mechanisms were suggested to underlie this intervention, it remains unknown if the EGCG-mediated protection was achieved by remodeling gut microbiota. In the present study, 0.1 mM or 0.5 mM EGCG was administered to the Drosophila melanogaster with PINK1 (PTEN induced putative kinase 1) mutations, a prototype PD model, and their behavioral performances, as well as neuronal/mitochondrial morphology (only for 0.5 mM EGCG treatment) were determined. According to the results, the mutant PINK1<sup>B9</sup> flies exhibited dopaminergic, survival, and behavioral deficits, which were rescued by EGCG supplementation. Meanwhile, EGCG resulted in profound changes in gut microbial compositions in PINK1<sup>B9</sup> flies, restoring the abundance of a set of bacteria. Notably, EGCG protection was blunted when gut microbiota was disrupted by antibiotics. We further isolated four bacterial strains from fly guts and the supplementation of individual Lactobacillus plantarum or Acetobacter pomorum strain exacerbated the neuronal and behavioral dysfunction of PD flies, which could not be rescued by EGCG. Transcriptomic analysis identified TotM as the central gene responding to EGCG or microbial manipulations. Genetic ablation of TotM blocked the recovery activity of EGCG, suggesting that EGCG-mediated protection warrants TotM. Apart from familial form, EGCG was also potent in improving sporadic PD symptoms induced by rotenone treatment, wherein gut microbiota shared regulatory roles. Together, our results suggest the relevance of the gut microbiota-TotM pathway in EGCG-mediated neuroprotection, providing insight into indirect mechanisms underlying nutritional intervention of Parkinson's disease.",FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,2020,Yi Xu; Mengmeng Xie; Jinsong Xue; Ling Xiang; Yali Li; Jie Xiao; Guiran Xiao; Hui-Li Wang
31843492,Alterations of the gut microbiota with antibiotics protects dopamine neuron loss and improve motor deficits in a pharmacological rodent model of Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating condition resulting in motor and non-motor symptoms affecting approximately 10 million people worldwide. Currently, there are no pharmacological treatments that can cure the condition or effectively halt its progression. The focus of PD research has been primarily on the neurobiological basis and consequences of dopamine (DA) neuron degeneration given that the loss of DA neurons projecting from the substantia nigra to the dorsal striatum results in the development of cardinal PD motor symptoms. Alternatively, gastrointestinal dysfunction is well recognized in PD patients, and often occurs prior to the development of motor symptoms. The gut microbiota, which contains thousands of bacterial species, play important roles in intestinal barrier integrity and function, metabolism, immunity and brain function. Pre-clinical and clinical studies suggest an important link between alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota and psychiatric and neurological conditions, including PD. Several reports have documented gut dysbiosis and alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota in PD patients. Therefore, the goal of this study was to explore the contribution of the gut microbiota to the behavioral and neurochemical alterations in a rodent toxin model of DA depletion that reproduces the motor symptoms associated with PD. We observed that chronic treatment of adult rats with non-absorbable antibiotics ameliorates the neurotoxicity of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in a unilateral lesion model. Specifically, immunohistochemistry against the dopaminergic neuron marker tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) showed an attenuation of the degree of 6-OHDA-induced dopaminergic neuron loss in antibiotic treated animals compared to control animals. In addition, we observed a reduction in the expression of pro-inflammatory markers in the striatum of antibiotic-treated animals. The degree of motor dysfunction after 6-OHDA was also attenuated in antibiotic-treated animals as measured by paw-rearing measurements in the cylinder test, forepaw stepping test, and ipsilateral rotations observed in the amphetamine-induced rotation test. These results implicate the gut microbiota as a potential contributor to pathology in the development of PD. Further studies are necessary to understand the specific mechanisms involved in transducing alterations in the gut microbiota to changes in dopaminergic neuron loss and motor dysfunction.",Experimental neurology,2020,Dimitri N Koutzoumis; Macarena Vergara; Jose Pino; Julia Buddendorff; Habibeh Khoshbouei; Ronald J Mandel; Gonzalo E Torres
33138351,Implications of the Human Gut-Brain and Gut-Cancer Axes for Future Nanomedicine.,"Recent clinical and pathological evidence have implicated the gut microbiota as a nexus for modulating the homeostasis of the human body, impacting conditions from cancer and dementia to obesity and social behavior. The connections between microbiota and human diseases offer numerous opportunities in medicine, most of which have limited or no therapeutic solutions available. In light of this paradigm-setting trend in science, this review aims to provide a comprehensive and timely summary of the mechanistic pathways governing the gut microbiota and their implications for nanomedicines targeting cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Specifically, we discuss in parallel the beneficial and pathogenic relationship of the gut microbiota along the gut-brain and gut-cancer axes, elaborate on the impact of dysbiosis and the gastrointestinal corona on the efficacy of nanomedicines, and highlight a molecular mimicry that manipulates the universal cross-Î² backbone of bacterial amyloid to accelerate neurological disorders.

32226375,Microbiota and Other Preventive Strategies and Non-genetic Risk Factors in Parkinson's Disease.,"The exact cause of Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease in modern societies, is still unknown. Many scientists point out that PD is caused by a complex interaction between different factors. Although the main risk factor is age, there are other influences, genetic and environmental, that individually or in combination may trigger neurodegenerative changes leading to PD. Nowadays, research remains focused on better understanding which environmental factors are related to the risk of developing PD and why. In line with the knowledge on evidence on exposures that prevent/delay PD onset or that impact on disease progression, the aims of this review were: (i) to comment on the non-genetic risk factors that mainly affect idiopathic PD; and (ii) to comment on seemingly reliable preventive interventions. We discuss both environmental factors that may affect the central nervous system (CNS) or the intestinal tract, and the likely mechanisms underlying noxious or protective actions. Knowledge on risk, protective factors, and mechanisms may help to envisage why nigral dopaminergic neurons are so vulnerable in PD and, eventually, to design new strategies for PD prevention and/or anti-PD therapy. This article reviews the variety of the known and suspected environmental factors, such as lifestyle, gut microbiota or pesticide exposition, and distinguishes between those that are harmful or beneficial for the PD acquisition or progression. In fact, the review covers one of the most novel players in the whole picture, and we address the role of microbiota on keeping a healthy CNS and/or on preventing the ""side-effects"" related to aging.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2020,Rafael Franco; Rafael Rivas-Santisteban; Irene Reyes-Resina; Gemma Navarro; Eva MartÃ­nez-Pinilla
32473843,Microbiota-gut-brain axis in health and disease: Is NLRP3 inflammasome at the crossroads of microbiota-gut-brain communications?,"Growing evidence highlights the relevance of microbiota-gut-brain axis in the maintenance of brain homeostasis as well as in the pathophysiology of major neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), multiple sclerosis (MS), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). In particular, changes in gut microbiota can promote enteric and peripheral neurogenic/inflammatory responses, which, in turn, could contribute to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in the central nervous system (CNS). Of note, the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain leucine rich repeat and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome acts as a key player in both coordinating the host physiology and shaping the peripheral and central immune/inflammatory responses in CNS diseases. In this context, there is pioneering evidence supporting the existence of a microbiota-gut-inflammasome-brain axis, in which enteric bacteria modulate, via NLRP3 signaling, inflammatory pathways that, in turn, contribute to influence brain homeostasis. The present review provides an overview of current knowledge on the role of microbiota-gut-inflammasome-brain axis in the major CNS diseases, including PD, AD, MS, ASD and MDD. In particular, though no direct and causal correlation among altered gut microbiota, NLRP3 activation and brain pathology has been demonstrated and in-depth studies are needed in this setting, our purpose was to pave the way to a novel and pioneering perspective on the pathophysiology of CNS disorders. Our intent was also to highlight and discuss whether alterations of microbiota-gut-inflammasome-brain axis support a holistic view of the pathophysiology of CNS diseases, even though each disorder displays a different clinical picture.",Progress in neurobiology,2020,Carolina Pellegrini; Luca Antonioli; Vincenzo Calderone; Rocchina Colucci; Matteo Fornai; Corrado Blandizzi
33240722,Gut-Brain Axis and its Neuro-Psychiatric Effects: A Narrative Review.,"The gut microbiota regulates the function and health of the human gut. Preliminary evidence suggests its impact on multiple human systems including the nervous and immune systems. A major area of research has been the directional relationship between intestinal microbiota and the central nervous system (CNS), called the microbiota-gut-brain axis. It is hypothesized that the intestinal microbiota affects brain activity and behavior via endocrine, neural, and immune pathways. An alteration in the composition of the gut microbiome has been linked to a variety of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. The connection between gut microbiome and several CNS disorders indicates that the focus of research in the future should be on the bacterial and biochemical targets.Â Through this review, we outline the established knowledge regarding the gut microbiome and gut-brain axis. In addition to gut microbiome in neurological and psychiatry diseases, we have briefly discussed microbial metabolites affecting the blood-brain barrier (BBB), immune dysregulation, modification of autonomic sensorimotor connections, and hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis.",Cureus,2020,Likhita Shaik; Rahul Kashyap; Sahith Reddy Thotamgari; Romil Singh; Sahil Khanna
31854093,"The gut in Parkinson's disease: Bottom-up, top-down, or neither?","The gut-brain axis is a hot topic in Parkinson's disease. In an attempt to decipher its role in the disease pathogenesis, several animal models have been developed. Most of these models tried to reproduce Braak's hypothesis by showing that the pathological process could spread from the gut to the brain (bottom-up scenario). Interestingly, others groups showed that a top-down scenario could also occur and that 6-hydroxydopamine-induced nigrostriatal denervation was sufficient to induce significant changes in the gastrointestinal tract. Aside from this toxic approach, the article by O'Donovan and colleagues in this edition of Neurogastroenterology and Motility showed that bilateral nigral injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-alpha-synuclein in rats was accompanied by changes in the enteric nervous system and the gut microbiota, which occurred without any apparent brain-to-gut spread of human injected alpha-synuclein. Some changes observed in the gastrointestinal tract of animals injected with AAV-alpha-synuclein were in line with previous observations in Parkinson's disease patients, including increased expression of glial markers, swollen tyrosine hydroxylase-positive varicosities in the submucosal plexus, and decreases in Faecalibacterium and Lachnospiraceae. These findings suggest that, in addition to gut-brain pathways, the brain-to-gut communication may also be involved in Parkinson's disease pathophysiology. In this mini-review, we describe the strengths and limitations of the existing studies on the gut-brain axis in experimental models of parkinsonism and discuss an alternative hypothesis in which the central and enteric nervous system would evolve separately during disease progression.",Neurogastroenterology and motility,2020,LaurÃ¨ne Leclair-Visonneau; Michel Neunlist; Pascal Derkinderen; Thibaud Lebouvier
32941730,Gut Microbiota Dynamics in Parkinsonian Mice.,"Peripheral immunity is thought to be dysregulated in Parkinson's disease (PD) and may provide an avenue for novel immunotherapeutic interventions. Gut microbiota is a potential factor for modulating immunotherapy response. Considering the possibly complex role of the gut-brain axis in PD, we used a preclinical model to determine the effects of gut microbiota dynamics in mice receiving an immunotherapeutic intervention compared to controls. A total of 17 M83 heterozygous transgenic mice were used in this study. Mice in the treatment arm (<i>N</i> = 10) received adoptive cellular therapy (ACT) by injection, and control mice (<i>N</i> = 7) were injected with saline at 8 weeks of age. All mice received peripheral Î±-syn fibrils to hasten parkinsonian symptoms via an intramuscular injection 1 week later (9 weeks of age; baseline). Fecal pellets were collected from all mice at three time points postinjection (baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks). DNA from each stool sample was extracted, and 16S rDNA was amplified, sequenced, and analyzed using QIIME2 and RStudio. Differences in the relative abundance of bacterial taxa were observed over time between groups. No significant differences in alpha diversity were found between groups at any time point. UniFrac measures of phylogenetic distance between samples demonstrated distinct clustering between groups postbaseline (<i>p</i> = 0.002). These differences suggest that the gut microbiome may be capable of influencing immunotherapy outcomes. Conclusively, we observed distinctly different microbiota dynamics in treated mice compared to those in the control group. These results suggest a correlation between the gut-brain axis, PD pathology, and immunotherapy.",ACS chemical neuroscience,2020,Emily Klann; Massimiliano S Tagliamonte; Maria Ukhanova; Volker Mai; Vinata Vedam-Mai
33153085,Do the Bugs in Your Gut Eat Your Memories? Relationship between Gut Microbiota and Alzheimer's Disease.,"The human microbiota is composed of trillions of microbial cells inhabiting the oral cavity, skin, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, airways, and reproductive organs. The gut microbiota is composed of dynamic communities of microorganisms that communicate bidirectionally with the brain via cytokines, neurotransmitters, hormones, and secondary metabolites, known as the gut microbiota-brain axis. The gut microbiota-brain axis is suspected to be involved in the development of neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease, and Autism Spectrum Disorder. AD is an irreversible, neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS), characterized by amyloid-Î² plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuroinflammation. Microglia and astrocytes, the resident immune cells of the CNS, play an integral role in AD development, as neuroinflammation is a driving factor of disease severity. The gut microbiota-brain axis is a novel target for Alzheimer's disease therapeutics to modulate critical neuroimmune and metabolic pathways. Potential therapeutics include probiotics, prebiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, and dietary intervention. This review summarizes our current understanding of the role of the gut microbiota-brain axis and neuroinflammation in the onset and development of Alzheimer's disease, limitations of current research, and potential for gut microbiota-brain axis targeted therapies.",Brain sciences,2020,Emily M Borsom; Keehoon Lee; Emily K Cope

A linear mixed model was used to assess longitudinal changes in levodopa-equivalent dose (LED) during follow-up (>2 y) in three tertile PD groups according to plasma TMAO levels. Additionally, a Cox regression analysis was performed to assess the effect of plasma TMAO levels on dementia conversion.Plasma TMAO levels of patients with PD were lower than those of healthy controls. A linear mixed model demonstrated that patients with PD and lower levels of TMAO (<4.75 Î¼mol/L; i.e., lowest tertile group) exhibited faster increases in LED over time. The Cox regression model did not reveal that plasma TMAO level was associated with the risk for dementia conversion (P = 0.488). However, when we divided patients with PD into two subgroups according to bet cutoff TMAO level to maximize the log-rank statistics, the PD group with a low plasma TMAO level (<6.92 Î¼mol/L) had a higher risk (with borderline statistical significance) for PD-dementia conversion than the group with a high TMAO level (hazard ratio: 7.565; 95% confidence interval, 1.004-57.019; P = 0.050).The results demonstrate that lower baseline plasma TMAO levels are associated with faster increases in LED and tend to increase the risk for PD-dementia conversion, suggesting the prognostic implications of TMAO in early stage PD.","Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)",2021,Seok Jong Chung; John Hoon Rim; Dajeong Ji; Sangwon Lee; Han Soo Yoo; Jin Ho Jung; KyoungWon Baik; Yonghoon Choi; Byoung Seok Ye; Young H Sohn; Mijin Yun; Sang-Guk Lee; Phil Hyu Lee

However, the alteration of fecal microbiota in PD with cognitive impairment remains unexplored. This study aimed to explore whether the gut microbiota of patients with PD having mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) were different from those with PD having normal cognition (PD-NC) and from healthy controls (HC). Also, the study probed the association between altered gut microbiota and cognitive ability in patients with PD. <b>Methods:</b> The fecal bacteria composition and short-chain fatty acids of 13 patients with PD-MCI, 14 patients with PD-NC, and 13 healthy spouses were analyzed using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. <b>Results:</b> Compared with HC, the fecal microbial diversities increased in patients with PD-MCI and PD-NC. After adjusting the influence of age, sex, body mass index, education, and constipation using the statistical method, the relative abundances of two families (Rikenellaceae and Ruminococcaceae) and four genera (<i>Alistipes, Barnesiella, Butyricimonas</i>, and <i>Odoribacter</i>) were found to be higher in the feces of the PD-MCI group compared with the other two groups. Moreover, the abundance of genus <i>Blautia</i> and <i>Ruminococcus</i> decreased obviously in the PD-MCI group compared with the PD-NC group. Further, the abundance of genera <i>Butyricimonas, Barnesiella, Alistipes, Odoribacter</i>, and <i>Ruminococcus</i> negatively correlated with cognition ability. <b>Conclusion:</b> Compared with HC and patients with PD-NC, the gut microbiota of patients with PD-MCI was significantly altered, particularly manifesting in enriched genera from Porphyromonadaceae family and decreased the abundance of genera <i>Blautia</i> and <i>Ruminococcus</i>.",Frontiers in neurology,2020,Tengzhu Ren; Yuyuan Gao; Yihui Qiu; Shuolin Jiang; Qingxi Zhang; Jiahui Zhang; Limin Wang; Yuhu Zhang; Lijuan Wang; Kun Nie

In recent years, the potential of positron-emission-tomography (PET) in the field of bacteria detection has gained attention. The uptake of several PET tracers has been evaluated to investigate infection pathophysiology, e.g. sterile or pathogen-mediated infection, monitoring of progression, or as a surrogate endpoint in clinical trials. In this minireview, we briefly describe the role of microbiome-gut-brain axis in health and disease and we discuss the imaging modalities and agents that could be applied to study the dynamic interactions between microbiome, gut and brain. These are key aspects in understanding the biochemical lexicon underpinning the microbiome-host crosstalk that would enable the development of diagnostics and therapeutics by targeting the human microbiota.",Nuclear medicine and biology,2021,Maria Cecilia Giron; Ulderico Mazzi
32325848,Can Gut Microbiota Be a Good Predictor for Parkinson's Disease? A Machine Learning Approach.,"The involvement of the gut microbiota in Parkinson's disease (PD), investigated in several studies, identified some common alterations of the microbial community, such as a decrease in <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> and an increase in <i>Verrucomicrobiaceae</i> families in PD patients. However, the results of other bacterial families are often contradictory. Machine learning is a promising tool for building predictive models for the classification of biological data, such as those produced in metagenomic studies. We tested three different machine learning algorithms (random forest, neural networks and support vector machines), analyzing 846 metagenomic samples (472 from PD patients and 374 from healthy controls), including our published data and those downloaded from public databases. Prediction performance was evaluated by the area under curve, accuracy, precision, recall and F-score metrics. The random forest algorithm provided the best results. Bacterial families were sorted according to their importance in the classification, and a subset of 22 families has been identified for the prediction of patient status. Although the results are promising, it is necessary to train the algorithm with a larger number of samples in order to increase the accuracy of the procedure.",Brain sciences,2020,Daniele Pietrucci; Adelaide Teofani; Valeria Unida; Rocco Cerroni; Silvia Biocca; Alessandro Stefani; Alessandro Desideri
33338469,Gut-Brain axis in Parkinson's disease etiology: The role of lipopolysaccharide.,"Recent studies highlight the initiation of Parkinson's disease (PD) in the gastrointestinal tract, decades before the manifestations in the central nervous system (CNS). This gut-brain axis of neurodegenerative diseases defines the critical role played by the unique microbial composition of the ""second brain"" formed by the enteric nervous system (ENS). Compromise in the enteric wall can result in the translocation of gut-microbiota along with their metabolites into the system that can affect the homeostatic machinery. The released metabolites can associate with protein substrates affecting several biological pathways. Among these, the bacterial endotoxin from Gram-negative bacteria, i.e., Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), has been implicated to play a definite role in progressive neurodegeneration. The molecular interaction of the lipid metabolites can have a direct neuro-modulatory effect on homeostatic protein components that can be transported to the CNS via the vagus nerve. Î±-synuclein (Î±-syn) is one such partner protein, the molecular interactions with which modulate its overall fibrillation propensity in the system. LPS interaction has been shown to affect the protein's aggregation kinetics in an alternative inflammatory pathway of PD pathogenesis. Several other lipid contents from the bacterial membranes could also be responsible for the initiation of Î±-syn amyloidogenesis. The present review will focus on the intermolecular interactions of Î±-syn with bacterial lipid components, particularly LPS, with a definite clinical manifestation in PD pathogenesis. However, deconvolution of the sequence of interaction events from the ENS to its propagation in the CNS is not easy or obvious. Nevertheless, the characterization of these lipid-mediated structures is a step towards realizing the novel targets in the pre-emptive diagnoses of PD.

32035595,Polyphenols in the management of brain disorders: Modulation of the microbiota-gut-brain axis.,"The modulation of the microbiota-gut-brain axis with a view to preventing and treating brain disorders became recently a hot topic for the scientific community. Dietary polyphenols are multifaceted compounds that have demonstrated to be highly advantageous to counteract inflammation, oxidative stress, and neurodegeneration, among other pathological conditions, being useful in the prevention and treatment of several chronic disorders. The potential of these compounds to prevent and treat brain disorders has not been only related to their capacity to reach the brain, depending on their chemical structure, and interact directly with brain cells, but also to their ability to modulate the communication between the brain and the gut, interfering with multiple branches of this axis. Preclinical studies have demonstrated the potential of these food bioactive compounds in brain diseases, namely, neurodevelopmental, such as Down's syndrome and Autism spectrum disorder, neurodegenerative, such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, and psychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety. Until now, dietary polyphenols have been recognized as promising nutraceuticals to combat brain disorders. However, the impact of these compounds on the gut-brain interconnection remains poorly elucidated. Also, clinical assays are crucial to further support the beneficial effects of these compounds as demonstrated in preclinical research.",Advances in food and nutrition research,2020,Diana Serra; Leonor M Almeida; Teresa C P Dinis
32819577,Dcf1 deletion presents alterations in gut microbiota of mice similar to Parkinson's disease.,"The gut-brain communication is increasingly being recognized as a profound effector on Parkinson's disease (PD). Gut microbiota changes have become the focus of attention. However, the mechanism leading to changes in the gut microbiota is not clear. In the present study, we found that knockout of Dcf1 (Dcf1<sup>-/-</sup>) caused changes in the gut microbiota in mice. Results indicated that the increased Proteobacteria (phylum-level) and decreased Prevotellaceae (family-level) in the microbiota composition of Dcf1<sup>-/-</sup> (KO) mice, which is consistent with the situation of PD patients. On species-level, Prevotellaceae_UCG-001 and Helicobacter_ganmani were significantly different between KO and WT mice, suggesting glycolipid metabolism disorders and inflammatory lesions in KO mice. In the behavior of Y-maze and Open field test, KO mice showed typical PD symptoms such as memory deficits, slowness of movement and anxiety. Further Nissl staining of brain tissue sections confirmed that the deletion of Dcf1 caused damage to amygdala neurons. These results provide a new mechanism for understanding gut microbiota changes, and provide a new basis for PD treatment from a new perspective of Gut-brain axis.",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2020,Weihao Li; Qinpin Zhao; Jiao Wang; Yajiang Wang; Tieqiao Wen

32557853,Meta-Analysis of Gut Dysbiosis in Parkinson's Disease.,"PD may begin with the intestinal accumulation of Î±-synuclein fibrils, which can be causally associated with gut dysbiosis. The variability of gut microbiota across countries prevented us from identifying shared gut dysbiosis in PD.To identify gut dysbiosis in PD across countries.We performed 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing analysis of gut microbiota in 223 patients with PD and 137 controls, and meta-analyzed gut dysbiosis by combining our dataset with four previously reported data sets from the United States, Finland, Russia, and Germany. We excluded uncommon taxa from our analyses. For pathway analysis, we developed the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes orthology set enrichment analysis method.After adjusting for confounding factors (body mass index, constipation, sex, age, and catechol-O-methyl transferase inhibitor), genera Akkermansia and Catabacter, as well as families Akkermansiaceae, were increased, whereas genera Roseburia, Faecalibacterium, and Lachnospiraceae ND3007 group were decreased in PD. Catechol-O-methyl transferase inhibitor intake markedly increased family Lactobacillaceae. Inspection of these bacteria in 12 datasets that were not included in the meta-analysis revealed that increased genus Akkermansia and decreased genera Roseburia and Faecalibacterium were frequently observed across countries. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes orthology set enrichment analysis revealed changes in short-chain fatty acid metabolisms in our dataset.We report that intestinal mucin layer-degrading Akkermansia is increased and that short-chain fatty acid-producing Roseburia and Faecalibacterium are decreased in PD across countries.

31552496,Microbiota: a novel regulator of pain.,"Among the various regulators of the nervous system, the gut microbiota has been recently described to have the potential to modulate neuronal cells activation. While bacteria-derived products can induce aversive responses and influence pain perception, recent work suggests that ""abnormal"" microbiota is associated with neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease or autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Here we review how the gut microbiota modulates afferent sensory neurons function and pain, highlighting the role of the microbiota/gut/brain axis in the control of behaviors and neurological diseases. We outline the changes in gut microbiota, known as dysbiosis, and their influence on painful gastrointestinal disorders. Furthermore, both direct host/microbiota interaction that implicates activation of ""pain-sensing"" neurons by metabolites, or indirect communication via immune activation is discussed. Finally, treatment options targeting the gut microbiota, including pre- or probiotics, will be proposed. Further studies on microbiota/nervous system interaction should lead to the identification of novel microbial ligands and host receptor-targeted drugs, which could ultimately improve chronic pain management and well-being.","Journal of neural transmission (Vienna, Austria : 1996)",2020,Manon Defaye; Sandie Gervason; Christophe Altier; Jean-Yves Berthon; Denis Ardid; Edith Filaire; FrÃ©dÃ©ric Antonio Carvalho
32710966,Polymannuronic acid prevents dopaminergic neuronal loss via brain-gut-microbiota axis in Parkinson's disease model.,"The study aims to investigate the potentially neuroprotective effects and underlying mechanisms for brown seaweed polysaccharide of polymannuronic acid (PM) against Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis. PD model mice were pretreated with PM via oral gavage once per day for 4Â weeks and the preventative effects of PM against neuronal loss together with its modulation on brain-gut-microbiota axis were systematically explored. The results showed PM administration improved motor functions by preventing dopaminergic neuronal loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and enhanced contents of striatal homovanillic acid (HVA), serotonin (5-HT), 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) and Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in PD mice. PM significantly alleviated inflammation in gut, brain and systemic circulation as shown by reduced levels or expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines concurrently and inhibited mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling pathway in mice colon. Meanwhile, PM greatly improved integrity of intestinal barrier and blood brain barrier (BBB) as indicated by increased expressions of tight junction associated proteins in both mice colon and SNpc. Further studies indicated PM treatment resulted in changes of gut microbial compositions, together with great alterations of digestion and metabolism of dietary proteins and fats, which led to surge increase of fecal short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the colon of PD mice. In conclusion, pre-administration of PM could provide neuroprotective effects against PD pathogenesis by suppressing inflammation in gut, brain and systemic circulation, and by improving integrity of intestinal barrier and BBB. PM might modulate brain-gut-microbiota axis, at least in part, via gut microbiota derived SCFAs as mediators.",International journal of biological macromolecules,2020,Xiao-Li Dong; Xiong Wang; Fang Liu; Xin Liu; Zhong-Rui Du; Robert W Li; Chang-Hu Xue; Ka-Hing Wong; Wing-Tak Wong; Qing Zhao; Qing-Juan Tang
32844199,Gut metagenomics-derived genes as potential biomarkers of Parkinson's disease.,"Identification of the gut microbiome compositions associated with disease has become a research focus worldwide. Emerging evidence has revealed the presence of gut microbiota dysbiosis in Parkinson's disease. In this study, we aimed to identify the gut microbiome associated with Parkinson's disease and subsequently to screen and to validate potential diagnostic biomarkers of Parkinson's disease. This case-control study investigated gut microbial genes in faeces from 40 volunteer Chinese patients with Parkinson's disease and their healthy spouses using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Furthermore, the identified specific gut microbial gene markers were validated with real-time PCR in an independent Chinese cohort of 78 Parkinson's disease patients, 75 control subjects, 40 patients with multiple system atrophy and 25 patients with Alzheimer's disease. We developed the first gut microbial gene catalogue associated with Parkinson's disease. Twenty-five gene markers were identified that distinguished Parkinson's disease patients from healthy control subjects, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.896 (95% confidence interval: 83.1-96.1%). A highly accurate Parkinson's disease index, which was not influenced by disease severity or Parkinson's disease medications, was created. Testing these gene markers using quantitative PCR distinguished Parkinson's disease patients from healthy controls not only in the 40 couples (AUC = 0.922, 95% confidence interval: 86.4-98.0%), but also in an independent group of 78 patients with Parkinson's disease and 75 healthy control subjects (AUC = 0.905, 95% confidence interval: 86.0-95.1%). This classifier also performed a differential diagnosis power in discriminating these 78 patients with Parkinson's disease from a cohort of 40 patients with multiple system atrophy and 25 patients with Alzheimer's disease based on the panel of 25 biomarkers.

32317956,Microbial BMAA and the Pathway for Parkinson's Disease Neurodegeneration.,"The neurotoxin Î²-<i>N</i>-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) is a natural non-proteinogenic diamino acid produced by several species of both prokaryotic (cyanobacteria) and eukaryotic (diatoms and dinoflagellates) microorganisms. BMAA has been shown to biomagnify through the food chain in some ecosystems, accumulating for example in seafood such as shellfish and fish, common dietary sources of BMAA whose ingestion may have possible neuronal consequences. In addition to its excitotoxic potential, BMAA has been implicated in protein misfolding and aggregation, inhibition of specific enzymes and neuroinflammation, all hallmark features of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the exact molecular mechanisms of neurotoxicity remain to be elucidated in detail. Although BMAA is commonly detected in its free form, complex BMAA-containing molecules have also been identified such as the paenilamicins, produced by an insect gut bacterial pathogen. On the other hand, production of BMAA or BMAA-containing molecules by members of the human gut microbiota, for example by non-photosynthetic cyanobacteria, the Melainabacteria, remains only hypothetical. In any case, should BMAA reach the gut it may interact with cells of the mucosal immune system and neurons of the enteric nervous system (ENS) and possibly target the mitochondria. Here, we review the available evidence and hint on possible mechanisms by which chronic exposure to dietary sources of this microbial neurotoxin may drive protein misfolding and mitochondrial dysfunction with concomitant activation of innate immune responses, chronic low-grade gut inflammation, and ultimately the neurodegenerative features observed across the gut-brain axis in Parkinson's disease (PD).",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2020,Daniela Nunes-Costa; JoÃ£o Duarte MagalhÃ£es; Maria G-Fernandes; Sandra Morais Cardoso; Nuno Empadinhas

32768944,The gut microbiota attenuate neuroinflammation in manganese exposure by inhibiting cerebral NLRP3 inflammasome.,"Manganese (Mn) exposure has been reported to cause neurodegenerative disorders. Î²-Amyloid (AÎ²) induced Tau pathology in an NLRP3-dependent manner is at the heart of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in the bidirectional gut-brain axis that integrates the gut and central nervous system (CNS) activities. In this study, we found that Mn exposure increases AÎ²<sub>1-40</sub> and Tau production in brain, and causes hippocampal degeneration and necrosis. Meanwhile, Mn exposure can stimulate neurotoxicity by increasing inflammation either in peripheral blood and CNS. Importantly, we found that transplantation of gut microbiota from normal rats into Mn exposure rats reduced AÎ² and Tau expression, and the cerebral expression of NLRP3 was downregulated, and the expression of neuroinflammatory factors was also downregulated. Therefore, improving the composition of gut microbiota in Mn exposure rats can attenuate neuroinflammation, which is considered as a novel therapeutic strategy for Mn exposure by remodelling the gut microbiota.",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2020,Hui Wang; Feng Yang; Ruihua Xin; Dongan Cui; Jiongjie He; Shidong Zhang; Yan Sun
33293403,Short-Chain Fatty Acid-Producing Gut Microbiota Is Decreased in Parkinson's Disease but Not in Rapid-Eye-Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder.,"Gut dysbiosis has been repeatedly reported in Parkinson's disease (PD) but only once in idiopathic rapid-eye-movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) from Germany. Abnormal aggregation of Î±-synuclein fibrils causing PD possibly starts from the intestine, although this is still currently under debate. iRBD patients frequently develop PD. Early-stage gut dysbiosis that is causally associated with PD is thus expected to be observed in iRBD. We analyzed gut microbiota in 26 iRBD patients and 137 controls by 16S rRNA sequencing (16S rRNA-seq). Our iRBD data set was meta-analyzed with the German iRBD data set and was compared with gut microbiota in 223 PD patients. Unsupervised clustering of gut microbiota by LIGER, a topic model-based tool for single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis, revealed four enterotypes in controls, iRBD, and PD. Short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria were conserved in an enterotype observed in controls and iRBD, whereas they were less conserved in enterotypes observed in PD. Genus <i>Akkermansia</i> and family <i>Akkermansiaceae</i> were consistently increased in both iRBD in two countries and PD in five countries. Short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria were not significantly decreased in iRBD in two countries. In contrast, we previously reported that recognized or putative SCFA-producing genera <i>Faecalibacterium</i>, <i>Roseburia</i>, and <i>Lachnospiraceae ND3007 group</i> were consistently decreased in PD in five countries. In Î±-synucleinopathy, increase of mucin-layer-degrading genus <i>Akkermansia</i> is observed at the stage of iRBD, whereas decrease of SCFA-producing genera becomes obvious with development of PD.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Twenty studies on gut microbiota in PD have been reported, whereas only one study has been reported on iRBD from Germany. iRBD has the highest likelihood ratio to develop PD. Our meta-analysis of iRBD in Japan and Germany revealed increased mucin-layer-degrading genus <i>Akkermansia</i> in iRBD. Genus <i>Akkermansia</i> may increase the intestinal permeability, as we previously observed in PD patients, and may make the intestinal neural plexus exposed to oxidative stress, which can lead to abnormal aggregation of prion-like Î±-synuclein fibrils in the intestine. In contrast to PD, SCFA-producing bacteria were not decreased in iRBD. As SCFA induces regulatory T (Treg) cells, a decrease of SCFA-producing bacteria may be a prerequisite for the development of PD. We propose that prebiotic and/or probiotic therapeutic strategies to increase the intestinal mucin layer and to increase intestinal SCFA potentially retard the development of iRBD and PD.",mSystems,2020,Hiroshi Nishiwaki; Tomonari Hamaguchi; Mikako Ito; Tomohiro Ishida; Tetsuya Maeda; Kenichi Kashihara; Yoshio Tsuboi; Jun Ueyama; Teppei Shimamura; Hiroshi Mori; Ken Kurokawa; Masahisa Katsuno; Masaaki Hirayama; Kinji Ohno
31737957,Antibiotic exposure and risk of Parkinson's disease in Finland: A nationwide case-control study.,"Gut microbiota alterations have been found in prodromal and established Parkinson's disease (PD). Antibiotic exposure can have long-term effects on the composition of human intestinal microbiota, but a potential connection between antibiotic exposure and risk of PD has not been studied previously.To evaluate the impact of antibiotic exposure on the risk of PD in a nationwide, register-based, case-control study.We identified all patients who were diagnosed with PD in Finland during the years 1998 to 2014. Information was obtained on individual purchases of orally administered antibiotics during the years 1993 to 2014. We assessed the association between prior antibiotic exposure and PD using conditional logistic regression.The study population consisted of 13,976 PD cases and 40,697 controls. The strongest connection with PD risk was found for oral exposure to macrolides and lincosamides (adjusted odds ratio up to 1.416; 95% confidence interval, 1.053-1.904). After correction for multiple comparisons, exposure to antianaerobics and tetracyclines 10 to 15âyears before the index date, sulfonamides and trimethoprim 1 to 5âyears before the index date, and antifungal medications 1 to 5âyears before the index date were positively associated with PD risk. In post hoc analyses, further positive associations were found for broad-spectrum antibiotics.Exposure to certain types of oral antibiotics seems to be associated with an elevated risk of PD with a delay that is consistent with the proposed duration of a prodromal period. The pattern of associations supports the hypothesis that effects on gut microbiota could link antibiotics to PD, but further studies are needed to confirm this.

33106549,Increased intestinal permeability and gut dysbiosis in the R6/2 mouse model of Huntington's disease.,"Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive, multifaceted neurodegenerative disease associated with weight loss and gut problems. Under healthy conditions, tight junction (TJ)Â proteins maintain the intestinal barrier integrity preventing bacterial translocation from the intestinal lumen to the systemic circulation. Reduction of TJs expression in Parkinson's disease patients has been linked with increased intestinal permeability-leaky gut syndrome. The intestine contains microbiota, most dominant phyla being Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes; in pathogenic or disease conditions the balance between these bacteria might be disrupted. The present study investigated whether there is evidence for an increased intestinal permeability and dysbiosis in the R6/2 mouse model of HD. Our data demonstrate that decreased body weight and body length in R6/2 mice is accompanied by a significant decrease in colon length and increased gut permeability compared to wild type littermates, without any significant changes in the protein levels of the tight junction proteins (occludin, zonula occludens). Moreover, we found an altered gut microbiota in R6/2 mice with increased relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and decreased of Firmicutes. Our results indicate an increased intestinal permeability and dysbiosis in R6/2 mice and further studies investigating the clinical relevance of these findings are warranted.",Scientific reports,2020,Tiberiu Loredan Stan; Rana Soylu-Kucharz; Stephen Burleigh; Olena Prykhodko; Ling Cao; Naomi Franke; Marie SjÃ¶gren; Caroline Haikal; Frida HÃ¥llenius; Maria BjÃ¶rkqvist
32431588,Gut Microbiome-Modified Polyphenolic Compounds Inhibit Î±-Synuclein Seeding and Spreading in Î±-Synucleinopathies.,"Misfolding, aggregation and deposition of Î±-synuclein (Î±-syn) are major pathologic characteristics of Parkinson's disease (PD) and the related synucleinopathy, multiple system atrophy (MSA). The spread of Î±-syn pathology across brain regions is thought to play a key role in the onset and progression of clinical phenotypes. Thus, there is increasing interest in developing strategies that target and attenuate Î±-syn aggregation and spread. Recent studies of brain-penetrating polyphenolic acids, namely, 3-hydroxybenzoic acid (3-HBA), 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (3,4-diHBA), and 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid (3-HPPA) that are derived from gut microbiota metabolism of dietary polyphenols, show <i>in vitro</i> ability to effectively modulate Î±-syn misfolding, oligomerization, and mediate aggregated Î±-syn neurotoxicity. Here we investigate whether 3-HBA, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4-HBA), 3,4-diHBA, or 3-HPPA interfere with Î±-syn spreading in a cell-based system. Using HEK293 cells overexpressing Î±-syn-A53T-CFP/YFP, we assessed Î±-syn seeding activity using Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) to detect and quantify Î±-syn aggregation. We demonstrated that 3-HPPA, 3,4-diHBA, 3-HBA, and 4-HBA significantly attenuated intracellular Î±-syn seeding aggregation. To determine whether our compounds could inhibit brain-derived seeding activity, we utilized insoluble Î±-syn extracted from post-mortem MSA or PD brain specimens. We found that 3-HPPA effectively attenuated MSA-induced aggregation of monomer into high molecular weight aggregates capable of inducing intracellular aggregation. Outcomes from our studies suggest interactions between gut microbiome and certain dietary factors may form the basis for effective therapies that modulate pathologic Î±-syn propagation. Collectively, our findings provide the basis for future developments of probiotic, prebiotic, or synbiotic approaches for modulating the onset and/or progression of Î±-synucleinopathies.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2020,Tritia R Yamasaki; Kenjiro Ono; Lap Ho; Giulio M Pasinetti
33076930,Gut bacterial deamination of residual levodopa medication for Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by both motor and non-motor symptoms. Gastrointestinal tract dysfunction is one of the non-motor features, where constipation is reported as the most common gastrointestinal symptom. Aromatic bacterial metabolites are attracting considerable attention due to their impact on gut homeostasis and host's physiology. In particular, Clostridium sporogenes is a key contributor to the production of these bioactive metabolites in the human gut.Here, we show that C. sporogenes deaminates levodopa, the main treatment in Parkinson's disease, and identify the aromatic aminotransferase responsible for the initiation of the deamination pathway. The deaminated metabolite from levodopa, 3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)propionic acid, elicits an inhibitory effect on ileal motility in an ex vivo model. We detected 3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)propionic acid in fecal samples of Parkinson's disease patients on levodopa medication and found that this metabolite is actively produced by the gut microbiota in those stool samples.Levodopa is deaminated by the gut bacterium C. sporogenes producing a metabolite that inhibits ileal motility ex vivo. Overall, this study underpins the importance of the metabolic pathways of the gut microbiome involved in drug metabolism not only to preserve drug effectiveness, but also to avoid potential side effects of bacterial breakdown products of the unabsorbed residue of medication.",BMC biology,2020,Sebastiaan P van Kessel; Hiltje R de Jong; Simon L Winkel; Sander S van Leeuwen; Sieger A Nelemans; Hjalmar Permentier; Ali Keshavarzian; Sahar El Aidy
31654753,Emerging concepts of mitochondrial dysfunction in Parkinson's disease progression: Pathogenic and therapeutic implications.,"Mitochondria are very dynamic organelle which plays a multifactorial role for a broad range of physiological processes inside the cell to maintain neural circuit integrity. They are required for the generation of cellular energy, regulation of calcium homeostasis and controlling programmed cell death. Defective mitochondrial homeostasis is frequently reported in a broad range of neurological disorders. Many lines of evidence suggest that it plays an essential role in aging and neurodegeneration. Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder and its aetiology is still largely unexplored. Overwhelming evidences indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in PD pathogenesis. Various genes involved in maintaining the mitochondrial homeostasis are also associated with the PD pathophysiology. Alterations in mitochondrial functions such as generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), impaired mitophagy, altered mitochondrial dynamics, impaired mitochondrial biogenesis and Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering may precede the development of PD pathology. In addition, recent studies have also shown the involvement of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases including PD. In this context, mitochondria-targeted therapies that can ameliorate the mitochondrial abnormalities may have great promise in the prevention and treatment of PD. This review aims to discuss the mitochondrial dysfunction associated with PD pathogenesis, influence of microbiome on mitochondrial regulation and various mitochondrial targeted therapies that can improve the mitochondrial function and deplete the severity of the disease.",Mitochondrion,2020,Linchi Rani; Amal Chandra Mondal
32389857,Targeting the microbiota in pharmacology of psychiatric disorders.,"There is increasing interest in the role of the gut microbiota in health and disease. In particular, gut microbiota influences the Central Nervous System (CNS) development and homeostasis through neural pathways or routes involving the immune and circulatory systems. The CNS, in turn, shapes the intestinal flora through endocrine or stress-mediated responses. These overall bidirectional interactions, known as gut microbiota-brain axis, profoundly affect some brain functions, such as neurogenesis and the production of neurotransmitters, up to influence behavioral aspects of healthy subjects. Consequently, a dysfunction within this axis, as observed in case of dysbiosis, can have an impact on the behavior of a given individual (e.g. anxiety and depression) or on the development of pathologies affecting the CNS, such as autism spectrum disorders and neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease). It should be considered that the whole microbiota has a significant role not only on aspects concerning human physiology, such as harvesting of nutrients and energy from the ingested food or production of a wide range of bioactive compounds, but also has positive effects on the gastrointestinal barrier function and actively contributes to the pharmacokinetics of several compounds including neuropsychiatric drugs. Indeed, the microbiota is able to affect drug absorption and metabolism up to have an impact on drug activity and/or toxicity. On the other hand, drugs are able to shape the human gut microbiota itself, where these changes may contribute to their pharmacologic profile. Therefore, the emerging picture on the complex drug-microbiota bidirectional interplay will have considerable implications in the future not only in terms of clinical practice but also, upstream, on drug development.",Pharmacological research,2020,Alessia Pascale; Nicoletta Marchesi; Stefano Govoni; Annalisa Barbieri

Emerging evidence is supporting the use of various strategies that modulate gut microbiota to exert neurological and psychological changes. This includes the utilisation of probiotics as a natural and dietary intervention for brain health. Here, we showed the potential AD-reversal effects of <i>Lactobacillus</i> probiotics through feeding to our <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> AD model. The administration of <i>Lactobacillus</i> strains was able to rescue the rough eye phenotype (REP) seen in AD-induced <i>Drosophila</i>, with a more prominent effect observed upon the administration of <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> DR7 (DR7). Furthermore, we analysed the gut microbiota of the AD-induced <i>Drosophila</i> and found elevated levels of <i>Wolbachia</i>. The administration of DR7 restored the gut microbiota diversity of AD-induced <i>Drosophila</i> with a significant reduction in <i>Wolbachia</i>'s relative abundance, accompanied by an increase of <i>Stenotrophomonas</i> and <i>Acetobacter</i>. Through functional predictive analyses, <i>Wolbachia</i> was predicted to be positively correlated with neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's, Huntington's and Alzheimer's diseases, while <i>Stenotrophomonas</i> was negatively correlated with these neurodegenerative disorders. Altogether, our data exhibited DR7's ability to ameliorate the AD effects in our AD-induced <i>Drosophila</i>.

31576631,Nigral overexpression of Î±-synuclein in a rat Parkinson's disease model indicates alterations in the enteric nervous system and the gut microbiome.,"A hallmark feature of Parkinson's disease (PD) is the build-up of Î±-synuclein protein aggregates throughout the brain; however Î±-synuclein is also expressed in enteric neurons. Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and pathology are frequently reported in PD, including constipation, increased intestinal permeability, glial pathology, and alterations to gut microbiota composition. Î±-synuclein can propagate through neuronal systems but the site of origin of Î±-synuclein pathology, whether it be the gut or the brain, is still unknown. Physical exercise is associated with alleviating symptoms of PD and with altering the composition of the gut microbiota.This study investigated the effects of bilateral nigral injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-Î±-synuclein on enteric neurons, glia and neurochemistry, the gut microbiome, and bile acid metabolism in rats, some of whom were exposed to voluntary exercise.Nigral overexpression of Î±-synuclein resulted in significant neuronal loss in the ileal submucosal plexus with no change in enteric glia. In contrast, the myenteric plexus showed a significant increase in glial expression, while neuronal numbers were maintained. Concomitant alterations were observed in the gut microbiome and related bile acid metabolism. Voluntary running protected against neuronal loss, increased enteric glial expression, and modified gut microbiome composition in the brain-injected AAV-Î±-synuclein PD model.These results show that developing nigral Î±-synuclein pathology in this PD model exerts significant alterations on the enteric nervous system (ENS) and gut microbiome that are receptive to modification by exercise. This highlights brain to gut communication as an important mechanism in PD pathology.",Neurogastroenterology and motility,2020,Sarah M O'Donovan; Erin K Crowley; Jillian R-M Brown; Orla O'Sullivan; Olivia F O'Leary; Suzanne Timmons; Yvonne M Nolan; David J Clarke; Niall P Hyland; Susan A Joyce; Aideen M Sullivan; Cora O'Neill
32105745,Mercury sulfide-containing Hua-Feng-Dan and 70W (Rannasangpei) protect against LPS plus MPTP-induced neurotoxicity and disturbance of gut microbiota in mice.,"Mercury sulfides (HgS) are frequently included in Ayurveda, Tibetan and Chinese medicines to assist the presumed therapeutic effects, but the ethnopharmacology remains elusive. The present study examined the protective effects of Î±-HgS-containing Hua-Feng-Dan and Î²-HgS-containing 70 Wei-Zhen-Zhu-Wan (70W, Rannasangpei) against Parkinson's disease mice induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plus 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP).A single injection of LPS (5Â mg/kg ip) was given to adult male C57BL/6 mice, and 150 days later, the low dose of MPTP (15Â mg/kg, ip, for 4 days) was given to produce the ""two-hit"" Parkinson's disease model. Together with MPTP treatment, mice were fed with clinically-relevant doses of Hua-Feng-Dan (0.6Â g/kg) and 70W (0.2Â g/kg) for 35 days. Rotarod test was performed to examine muscle coordination capability. At the end of the experiment, brain was transcardially perfused with paraformaldehyde, the substantia nigra was sectioned for microglia (Iba1 staining) and dopaminergic neuron (THir staining) determination. Colon bacterial DNA was extracted and subjected to qPCR analysis with 16S rRNA probes.The low-grade, chronic neuroinflammation produced by LPS aggravated MPTP neurotoxicity, as evidenced by decreased motor activity, intensified microglia activation and loss of dopaminergic neurons. Both Hua-Feng-Dan and 70W increased rotarod activity and ameliorated the pathological lesions in the brain. In gut microbiomes examined, LPS plus MPTP increased Verrucomicrobiaceae, Methanobacteriaceae, Pronicromonosporaceae, and Clostridaceae species were attenuated by Hua-Feng-Dan and 70W.Î±-HgS-containing Hua-Feng-Dan and Î²-HgS-containing 70W at clinical doses protected against chronic LPS plus MPTP-induced toxicity to the brain and gut, suggesting HgS-containing traditional medicines could target gut microbiota as a mechanism of their therapeutic effects.",Journal of ethnopharmacology,2020,An-Ling Hu; Sheng Song; Yi Li; Shang-Fu Xu; Feng Zhang; Cen Li; Jie Liu

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is currently being explored as a potential therapy for PD. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of FMT on PD. Fifteen PD patients were included, 10 of them received FMT via colonoscopy (colonic FMT group) and 5 received FMT via nasal-jejunal tube (nasointestinal FMT group). The score of PSQI, HAMD, HAMA, PDQ-39, NMSQ and UPDRS-III significantly decreased after FMT treatment (all Pâ<â.05). Colonic FMT group showed significant improvement and longer maintenance of efficacy compared with nasointestinal FMT (Pâ=â.002). Two patients achieved self-satisfying outcomes that last for more than 24 months. However, nasointestinal FMT group had no significant therapeutic effect, although UPDRS-III score slightly reduced. There were no patients were satisfied with nasointestinal FMT for more than 3 months. Among 15 PD patients, there were 5 cases had adverse events (AEs), including diarrhea (2 cases), abdominal pain (2 cases) and flatulence (1 case). These AEs were mild and self-limiting. We conclude that FMT can relieve the motor and non-motor symptoms with acceptable safety in PD. Compared with nasointestinal FMT, colonic FMT seems better and preferable.",Medicine,2020,Liu-Jun Xue; Xiao-Zhong Yang; Qiang Tong; Peng Shen; Shi-Jie Ma; Shang-Nong Wu; Jin-Long Zheng; Hong-Gang Wang

33291597,Adiponectin Role in Neurodegenerative Diseases: Focus on Nutrition Review.,"Adiponectin is an adipokine produced by adipose tissue. It has numerous beneficial effects. In particular, it improves metabolic effects and glucose homeostasis, lipid profile, and is involved in the regulation of cytokine profile and immune cell production, having anti-inflammatory and immune-regulatory effects. Adiponectin's role is already known in immune diseases and also in neurodegenerative diseases. Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, are a set of diseases of the central nervous system, characterized by a chronic and selective process of neuron cell death, which occurs mainly in relation to oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Lifestyle is able to influence the development of these diseases. In particular, unhealthy nutrition on gut microbiota, influences its composition and predisposition to develop many diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases, given the importance of the ""gut-brain"" axis. There is a strong interplay between Adiponectin, gut microbiota, and brain-gut axis. For these reasons, a healthy diet composed of healthy nutrients such as probiotics, prebiotics, polyphenols, can prevent many metabolic and inflammatory diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases and obesity.

31606537,Protective role of cinnabar and realgar in Hua-Feng-Dan against LPS plus rotenone-induced neurotoxicity and disturbance of gut microbiota in rats.,"Hua-Feng-Dan (HFD) is a traditional Chinese medicine used for neurological disorders. HFD contains cinnabar (HgS) and realgar (As<sub>4</sub>S<sub>4</sub>). The ethnopharmacological basis of cinnabar and realgar in HFD is not known.To address the role of cinnabar and realgar in HFD-produced neuroprotection against neurodegenerative diseases and disturbance of gut microbiota.Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plus rotenone (ROT)-elicited rat dopaminergic (DA) neuronal damage loss was performed as a Parkinson's disease animal model. Rats were given a single injection of LPS. Four months later, rats were challenged with the threshold dose of ROT. The clinical dose of HFD was administered via feed, starting from ROT administration for 46 days. Behavioral dysfunction was detected by rotarod and Y-maze tests. DA neuron loss and microglial activation were assessed via immunohistochemical staining and western bolt analysis. The colon content was collected to extract bacterial DNA followed by real-time PCR analysis with 16S rRNA primers.LPS plus ROT induced neurotoxicity, as evidenced by DA neuron loss in substantia nigra, impaired behavioral functions and increased microglial activation. HFD-original (containing 10% cinnabar and 10% realgar) rescued loss of DA neurons, improved behavioral dysfunction and attenuated microglial activation. Compared with HFD-original, HFD-reduced (3% cinnabar and 3% realgar) was also effective, but to be a less extent, while HFD-removed (without cinnabar and realgar) was ineffective. In analysis of gut microbiome, the increased Verrucomicrobiaceae and Lactobacteriaceae, and the decreased Enterobacteeriaceae by LPS plus ROT were ameliorated by HFD-original, and to be the less extent by HFD-reduced.Cinnabar and realgar are active ingredients in HFD to exert beneficial effects in a neurodegenerative model and gut microbiota.",Journal of ethnopharmacology,2020,Ce Chen; Bin-Bin Zhang; An-Ling Hu; Huan Li; Jie Liu; Feng Zhang

PD produces a pathological state in the intestine and disordered gut microbiota (GM), which may be important for the pathogenesis and progression of PD, but it is not clear. To explore the conditions and characteristics of intestinal pathology and GM disorders when PD-related injuries occur, we used twice 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) subacute administration with an interval of 3 weeks (each was an intraperitoneal injection of 25â¯mg/kg MPTP for 5 consecutive days). We observed the changes in intestinal and brain immune status, intestinal barrier function and GM in different injury states one day, one week, and three weeks after the first stimulus and one day and one week after the second stimulus. Our study found that two subacute administrations of MPTP induced dopaminergic (DAergic) neuron injury and inflammation in the midbrain and ileum, impaired intestinal barrier function and GM disorders closely related to administration. These changes recovered after the first administration, but after repeated administration, some indicators showed more dramatic changes than during the first administration. Our results suggest that the intestinal tract is sensitive to PD-related injury, and the GM is susceptible to disturbances caused by intestinal function, which may be concerned in local immune disorders of the intestine.",Neurotoxicology,2020,Wenjun Xie; Jieying Gao; Rong Jiang; Xinrong Liu; Feng Lai; Yong Tang; Hong Xiao; Yan Jia; Qunhua Bai
32946938,Genetic variants of TAS2R38 bitter taste receptor associate with distinct gut microbiota traits in Parkinson's disease: A pilot study.,"The non-tasting form of the bitter taste receptor, TAS2R38, has been shown as a genetic risk factor associated with the development of Parkinson's disease (PD). Specific taste receptors that are expressed in the lower gastrointestinal tract may respond to alteration in gut microbiota composition, detecting bacterial molecules, and regulate immune responses. Given the importance of brain-gut-microbiota axis and gene-environment interactions in PD, we investigate the associations between the genetic variants of TAS2R38 and gut microbiota composition in 39 PD patients. The results confirm that the majority of PD patients have reduced sensitivity to 6-n-propylthiouracil (PROP) and are carriers of at least one non-functional TAS2R38 AVI haplotype. Moreover, we found this correlation to be associated with a reduction in bacteria alpha-diversity with a predominant reduction of Clostridium genus. We hypothesised that the high frequency of the non-taster form of TAS2R38 associated with a diminuition of Clostridium bacteria in PD might determine a reduction in the activation of protective signalling-molecules useful in preserving gut homeostasis. This pilot study, by identifying a decrease in specific bacteria associated with a reduced sensitivity to PROP, adds essential information that opens new avenues of research into the association of PD microbiota composition and sensory modification.",International journal of biological macromolecules,2020,Sarah Vascellari; Melania Melis; Giovanni Cossu; Marta Melis; Alessandra Serra; Vanessa Palmas; Daniela Perra; Valentina Oppo; Michele Fiorini; Roberto Cusano; Micaela Morelli; Aldo Manzin; Iole Tomassini Barbarossa

This cross-talk between the gut microbiota and CNS, i.e., the gut-brain axis (GBA), plays a major role in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS) and Huntington's disease (HD).We aim to discuss how gut microbiota, through GBA, regulate neurodegenerative disorders such as PD, AD, ALS, MS and HD.In this review, we have discussed the present understanding of the role played by the gut microbiota in neurodegenerative disorders and emphasized the probable therapeutic approaches being explored to treat them.In the first part, we introduce the GBA and its relevance, followed by the changes occurring in the GBA during neurodegenerative disorders and then further discuss its role in the pathogenesis of these diseases. Finally, we discuss its applications in possible therapeutics of these diseases and the current research improvements being made to better investigate this interaction.We concluded that alterations in the intestinal microbiota modulate various activities that could potentially lead to CNS disorders through interactions via the GBA.",Current topics in medicinal chemistry,2020,Sreyashi Chandra; Md Tanjim Alam; Jhilik Dey; Baby C Pulikkaparambil Sasidharan; Upasana Ray; Amit K Srivastava; Sonu Gandhi; Prem P Tripathi
32089785,Oxidative Stress and Gut-Derived Lipopolysaccharides in Neurodegenerative Disease: Role of NOX2.,"Neurodegenerative diseases (ND) as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis represent a growing cause of disability in the developed countries. The underlying physiopathology is still unclear. Several lines of evidence suggest a role for oxidative stress and NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) in the neuropathological pathways that lead to ND. Furthermore, recent studies hypothesized a role for gut microbiota in the neuroinflammation; in particular, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) derived from Gram-negative bacteria in the gut is believed to play a role in causing ND by increase of oxidative stress and inflammation. The aim of this study was to assess NOX2 activity as well as serum 8-iso-prostaglandin F2<i>Î±</i> (8-iso-PGF2<i>Î±</i> (8-iso-PGF2.One hundred and twenty-eight consecutive subjects, including 64 ND patients and 64 controls (CT) matched for age and gender, were recruited.

Serum zonulin was used to assess gut permeability.Compared with CT, ND patients had higher values of sNOX2-dp, 8-iso-PGF2<i>Î±</i> (8-iso-PGF2<i>p</i> < 0.001), zonulin (Rs = 0.411; <i>p</i> < 0.001), zonulin (Rs = 0.411; <i>p</i> < 0.001), zonulin (Rs = 0.411; <i>Î±</i> (8-iso-PGF2<i>p</i> < 0.001), zonulin (Rs = 0.411; <i>p</i> < 0.001), zonulin (Rs = 0.411; <i>Î±</i> (8-iso-PGF2<i>p</i> < 0.001), zonulin (Rs = 0.411; <i>Î²</i>, 0.459; <i>p</i> < 0.001), zonulin (Rs = 0.411; <i>Î±</i> (8-iso-PGF2<i>Î²</i>, 0.459; <i>p</i> < 0.001), zonulin (Rs = 0.411; <i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 57%).This study provides the first report attesting that patients with ND have high NOX2 activation that could be potentially implicated in the process of neuroinflammation.",Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,2020,Lorenzo Loffredo; Evaristo Ettorre; Anna Maria Zicari; Maurizio Inghilleri; Cristina Nocella; Ludovica Perri; Alberto Spalice; Chiara Fossati; Maria Caterina De Lucia; Fabio Pigozzi; Mauro Cacciafesta; Francesco Violi; Roberto Carnevale; 
32456274,Anti-aggregation Effects of Phenolic Compounds on Î±-synuclein.,"The aggregation and deposition of Î±-synuclein (Î±S) are major pathologic features of Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and other Î±-synucleinopathies. The propagation of Î±S pathology in the brain plays a key role in the onset and progression of clinical phenotypes. Thus, there is increasing interest in developing strategies that attenuate Î±S aggregation and propagation. Based on cumulative evidence that Î±S oligomers are neurotoxic and critical species in the pathogenesis of Î±-synucleinopathies, we and other groups reported that phenolic compounds inhibit Î±S aggregation including oligomerization, thereby ameliorating Î±S oligomer-induced cellular and synaptic toxicities. Heterogeneity in gut microbiota may influence the efficacy of dietary polyphenol metabolism. Our recent studies on the brain-penetrating polyphenolic acids 3-hydroxybenzoic acid (3-HBA), 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (3,4-diHBA), and 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (3-HPPA), which are derived from gut microbiota-based metabolism of dietary polyphenols, demonstrated an in vitro ability to inhibit Î±S oligomerization and mediate aggregated Î±S-induced neurotoxicity. Additionally, 3-HPPA, 3,4-diHBA, 3-HBA, and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid significantly attenuated intracellular Î±S seeding aggregation in a cell-based system. This review focuses on recent research developments regarding neuroprotective properties, especially anti-Î±S aggregation effects, of phenolic compounds and their metabolites by the gut microbiome, including our findings in the pathogenesis of Î±-synucleinopathies.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2020,Kenjiro Ono; Mayumi Tsuji; Tritia R Yamasaki; Giulio M Pasinetti
31829756,An overview of the neuroendocrine system in Parkinson's disease: what is the impact on diagnosis and treatment?,"<b>Introduction</b>: A growing body of evidence indicates that neuroendocrine interactions may occur at all levels of the brain-gut-microbiota axis, which is directly involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD).<b>Areas covered</b>: The review presents some current and emerging concepts regarding the organization and functioning of the neuroendocrine system as well as the role of neuroendocrine disturbances in the pathophysiology and symptomatology of PD. The concept of the brain-gut-microbiota triad interactions in the neuroendocrine system and PD is proposed. In PD, dysregulation of the main neuroendocrine axes coordinated by the hypothalamus is accompanied by disruptions at the peripheral level, which involve enteroendocrine cells producing numerous neuropeptides. Moreover, the important role of the gut microbiota as a main coordinator of immune and neuroendocrine interactions is discussed. The potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications in the context of the recent developments in the fields of neuroendocrinology and neurodegeneration are also presented.<b>Expert opinion</b>: Unraveling complex neuroendocrine interactions in the course of PD may provide crucial diagnostic implications and novel therapeutic approaches including the application of gut neuropeptides and gut microbiota modification.",Expert review of neurotherapeutics,2020,Agata Mulak
32791113,The Microbiome as a Modifier of Neurodegenerative Disease Risk.,"The gut microbiome is increasingly implicated in modifying susceptibility to and progression of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). In this review, we discuss roles for the microbiome in aging and in NDs. In particular, we summarize findings from human studies on microbiome alterations in Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington's disease. We assess animal studies of genetic and environmental models for NDs that investigate how manipulations of the microbiome causally impact the development of behavioral and neuropathological endophenotypes of disease. We additionally evaluate the likely immunological, neuronal, and metabolic mechanisms for how the gut microbiota may modulate risk for NDs. Finally, we speculate on cross-cutting features for microbial influences across multiple NDs and consider the potential for microbiome-targeted interventions for NDs.",Cell host & microbe,2020,P Fang; S A Kazmi; K G Jameson; E Y Hsiao
32733199,Systems Biology Approaches to Understand the Host-Microbiome Interactions in Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) comprise a broad range of progressive neurological disorders with multifactorial etiology contributing to disease pathophysiology. Evidence of the microbiome involvement in the gut-brain axis urges the interest in understanding metabolic interactions between the microbiota and host physiology in NDDs. Systems Biology offers a holistic integrative approach to study the interplay between the different biologic systems as part of a whole, and may elucidate the host-microbiome interactions in NDDs. We reviewed direct and indirect pathways through which the microbiota can modulate the bidirectional communication of the gut-brain axis, and explored the evidence of microbial dysbiosis in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. As the gut microbiota being strongly affected by diet, the potential approaches to targeting the human microbiota through diet for the stimulation of neuroprotective microbial-metabolites secretion were described. We explored the potential of Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) to infer microbe-microbe and host-microbe interactions and to identify the microbiome contribution to disease development or prevention. Finally, a systemic approach based on GEMs and 'omics integration, that would allow the design of sustainable personalized anti-inflammatory diets in NDDs prevention, through the modulation of gut microbiota was described.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2020,Dorines Rosario; Jan Boren; Mathias Uhlen; Gordon Proctor; Dag Aarsland; Adil Mardinoglu; Saeed Shoaie
32088434,Gut microbiota dysbiosis might be responsible to different toxicity caused by Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate exposure in murine rodents.,"Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is widely used as a plasticizer, which can enter the body through a variety of ways and exerted multiple harmful effects, including liver toxicity, reproductive toxicity and even glucose metabolism disorder. Many studies have suggested that changes of gut microbiota are closely related to the occurrence of various diseases, but the effects of DEHP exposure on gut microbiota are still unclear. It was found in this study that the damage to different tissues by DEHP on two strains each from two different species of male rodents before puberty was dose and time of exposure dependent, and also depending on the strain and species of rodent. Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats showed highest sensitivity to DEHP exposure, with most severe organ damage, highest Th1 inflammatory response and most significant body weight gain. Correspondingly, the gut microbiota of SD rats showed most significant changes after DEHP exposure. Only SD rats, but not Wistar rats, BALB/c and C57BL/6J mice showed an increase in Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and Proteobacteria abundance in the fecal samples, which are known to associate with obesity and diabetes. This is consistent with the increasing body weight gain which was only found in SD rats. In addition, the decrease in the level of butyrate, increase in the abundance of potential pathogens and microbial genes linked to colorectal cancer, Parkinson's disease, and type 2 diabetes in the SD rats were associated with issue and functional damages and Th1 inflammatory response caused by DEHP exposure. We postulate that the differential effects of DEHP on gut microbiota may be an important cause of the differences in the toxicity on different strains and species of rodents to DEHP.","Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2020,Gang Wang; Qian Chen; Peijun Tian; Linlin Wang; Xiu Li; Yuan-Kun Lee; Jianxin Zhao; Hao Zhang; Wei Chen
32643435,Progression and survival of patients with motor neuron disease relative to their fecal microbiota.,"Gut microbiota studies have been well-investigated for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, however, fewer studies have comprehensively examined the gut microbiome in Motor Neuron Disease (MND), with none examining its impact on disease prognosis. Here, we investigate MND prognosis and the fecal microbiota, using 16S rRNA case-control data from 100 individuals with extensive medical histories and metabolic measurements. We contrast the composition and diversity of fecal microbiome signatures from 49 MND and 51 healthy controls by combining current gold-standard 16S microbiome pipelines. Using stringent quality control thresholds, we conducted qualitative assessment approaches including; direct comparison of taxa, PICRUSt2 predicted metagenomics, Shannon and Chao1-index and Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio. We show that the fecal microbiome of patients with MND is not significantly different from that of healthy controls that were matched by age, sex, and BMI, however there are distinct differences in Beta-diversity in some patients with MND. Weight, BMI, and metabolic and clinical features of disease in patients with MND were not related to the composition of their fecal microbiome, however, we observe a greater risk for earlier death in patients with MND with increased richness and diversity of the microbiome, and in those with greater Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio. This was independent of anthropometric, metabolic, or clinical features of disease, and warrants support for further gut microbiota studies in MND. Given the disease heterogeneity in MND, and complexity of the gut microbiota, large studies are necessary to determine the detailed role of the gut microbiota and MND prognosis.",Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis & frontotemporal degeneration,2020,Shyuan T Ngo; Restuadi Restuadi; Allan F McCrae; Ruben P Van Eijk; Fleur Garton; Robert D Henderson; Naomi R Wray; Pamela A McCombe; Frederik J Steyn
33154567,Using multi-organ culture systems to study Parkinson's disease.,"In recent years, it has been revealed that Parkinson's disease pathology may begin to manifest in the gastrointestinal track at a much earlier time point than in the brain. This paradigm shift has been suggested following evidence in humans that has been reproduced in animal models. Since rodent models cannot recapitulate many of the human disease features, human induced pluripotent stem cells derived from Parkinson's patients have been used to generate brain organoids, greatly contributing to our understanding of the disease pathophysiology. To understand the multifaced aspects of Parkinson's disease, it may be desirable to expand the complexity of these models, to include different brain regions, vasculature, immune cells as well as additional diverse organ-specific organoids such as gut and intestine. Furthermore, the contribution of gut microbiota to disease progression cannot be underestimated. Recent biotechnological advances propose that such combinations may be feasible. Here we discuss how this need can be met and propose that additional brain diseases can benefit from this approach.",Molecular psychiatry,2021,Orly Reiner; Tamar Sapir; Arpan Parichha

In particular, we will discuss disease associated microbial dysbiosis; the shift in the microbiome caused by medical interventions and the altered metabolite levels between diseases and interventions. The microbial dysbiosis seen was compared between diseases including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, liver cirrhosis and neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. This review highlights the commonalities and differences in dysbiosis of the gut between diseases, along with metabolite levels in metabolic disease vs. the levels reported after an intervention.

32252363,Revisiting the Role of Neurotrophic Factors in Inflammation.,"The neurotrophic factors are well known for their implication in the growth and the survival of the central, sensory, enteric and parasympathetic nervous systems. Due to these properties, neurturin (NRTN) and Glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), which belong to the GDNF family ligands (GFLs), have been assessed in clinical trials as a treatment for neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease. In addition, studies in favor of a functional role for GFLs outside the nervous system are accumulating. Thus, GFLs are present in several peripheral tissues, including digestive, respiratory, hematopoietic and urogenital systems, heart, blood, muscles and skin. More precisely, recent data have highlighted that different types of immune and epithelial cells (macrophages, T cells, such as, for example, mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, innate lymphoid cells (ILC) 3, dendritic cells, mast cells, monocytes, bronchial epithelial cells, keratinocytes) have the capacity to release GFLs and express their receptors, leading to the participation in the repair of epithelial barrier damage after inflammation. Some of these mechanisms pass on to ILCs to produce cytokines (such as IL-22) that can impact gut microbiota. In addition, there are indications that NRTN could be used in the treatment of inflammatory airway diseases and it prevents the development of hyperglycemia in the diabetic rat model. On the other hand, it is suspected that the dysregulation of GFLs produces oncogenic effects. This review proposes the discussion of the biological understanding and the potential new opportunities of the GFLs, in the perspective of developing new treatments within a broad range of human diseases.",Cells,2020,Lucas Morel; Olivia Domingues; Jacques Zimmer; Tatiana Michel
32247376,Mechanisms of alpha-synuclein toxicity: An update and outlook.,"Alpha-synuclein (aSyn) was identified as the main component of inclusions that define synucleinopathies more than 20 years ago. Since then, aSyn has been extensively studied in an attempt to unravel its roles in both physiology and pathology. Today, studying the mechanisms of aSyn toxicity remains in the limelight, leading to the identification of novel pathways involved in pathogenesis. In this chapter, we address the molecular mechanisms involved in synucleinopathies, from aSyn misfolding and aggregation to the various cellular effects and pathologies associated. In particular, we review our current understanding of the mechanisms involved in the spreading of aSyn between different cells, from the periphery to the brain, and back. Finally, we also review recent studies on the contribution of inflammation and the gut microbiota to pathology in synucleinopathies. Despite significant advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved, we still lack an integrated understanding of the pathways leading to neurodegeneration in PD and other synucleinopathies, compromising our ability to develop novel therapeutic strategies.",Progress in brain research,2020,InÃªs Caldeira BrÃ¡s; Mary Xylaki; Tiago Fleming Outeiro

Moreover, some PD patients suffer from unintentional weight loss (WL) which may precede the motor manifestations of the disease. <b>Materials & methods:</b> Gut microbiota profiling by 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed in PD patients with an unintended WL, in steady weight patients (non-WL [NWL]) and in matched normal subjects. KEGG functional predictions were carried out. <b>Results:</b> Microbiota profiles revealed a dissimilarity between WL and NWL. Moreover, WL pathways were characterized by fatty acid biosynthesis, while NWL by inflammation pathways. <b>Conclusion:</b> The gut microbiota could participate in weight alteration observed in PD by the presence of bacteria involved in weight gain and inflammation, or conversely by bacteria implicated in energy expenditure.",Future microbiology,2020,Federica Del Chierico; Paola Grassini; Andrea Quagliariello; Margherita Torti; Alessandra Russo; Sofia Reddel; Fabrizio Stocchi
33064969,Characterization of the intestinal microbiota during <i>Citrobacter rodentium</i> infection in a mouse model of infection-triggered Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that has been shown to be influenced by the intestinal milieu. The gut microbiota is altered in PD patients, and murine studies have begun suggesting a causative role for the gut microbiota in progression of PD. We have previously shown that repeated infection with the intestinal murine pathogen <i>Citrobacter rodentium</i> resulted in the development of PD-like pathology in <i>Pink1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice compared to wild-type littermates. This addendum aims to expand this work by characterizing the gut microbiota during <i>C. rodentium</i> infection in our <i>Pink1</i><sup>-/-</sup> PD model. We observed little disturbance to the fecal microbiota diversity both between infection timepoints and between <i>Pink1</i><sup>-/-</sup> and wild-type control littermates.

33213462,Oral P. gingivalis impairs gut permeability and mediates immune responses associated with neurodegeneration in LRRK2 R1441G mice.,"The R1441G mutation in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene results in late-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). Peripheral inflammation and gut microbiota are closely associated with the pathogenesis of PD. Chronic periodontitis is a common type of peripheral inflammation, which is associated with PD. Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), the most common bacterium causing chronic periodontitis, can cause alteration of gut microbiota. It is not known whether Pg-induced dysbiosis plays a role in the pathophysiology of PD.In this study, live Pg were orally administrated to animals, three times a week for 1 month. Pg-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to stimulate mononuclear cells in vitro. The effects of oral Pg administration on the gut and brain were evaluated through behaviors, morphology, and cytokine expression.Dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra were reduced, and activated microglial cells were increased in R1441G mice given oral Pg. In addition, an increase in mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-Î±) and interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²) as well as protein level of Î±-synuclein together with a decrease in zonula occludens-1 (Zo-1) was detected in the colon in Pg-treated R1441G mice. Furthermore, serum interleukin-17A (IL-17A) and brain IL-17 receptor A (IL-17RA) were increased in Pg-treated R1441G mice.These findings suggest that oral Pg-induced inflammation may play an important role in the pathophysiology of LRRK2-associated PD.",Journal of neuroinflammation,2020,Yu-Kun Feng; Qiong-Li Wu; Yan-Wen Peng; Feng-Yin Liang; Hua-Jing You; Yi-Wei Feng; Ge Li; Xue-Jiao Li; Shu-Hua Liu; Yong-Chao Li; Yu Zhang; Zhong Pei
32894625,Helicobacter pylori Eradication in Parkinson's Disease: A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial.,"Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection has been associated with worse motor function in Parkinson's disease (PD).We aimed to evaluate the effects of HP eradication on PD symptoms.In this parallel-group, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled, single-center trial, patients with PD with positive HP urea breath test and serology were block randomized (1:1) to receive standard eradication triple therapy or identically appearing placebo capsules for 1âweek. Prespecified motor (International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society Unified PD Rating Scale [MDS-UPDRS], timed tests, and home-based wearable sensor measurements), nonmotor (Leeds Dyspepsia Questionnaire and Montreal Cognitive Assessment), and quality-of-life (Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39) outcome measures were assessed at weeks 6, 12, 24, and 52. The primary outcome was the baseline-to-week 12 change in ON medication MDS-UPDRS motor scores. Lactulose-hydrogen breath testing for concomitant small intestinal bacterial overgrowth was performed at baseline and repeated at week 24, together with the urea breath test.A total of 310 patients were screened for eligibility and 80 were randomly assigned, of whom 67 were included in the full-analysis set (32 treatment group patients, 35 placebo patients). HP eradication did not improve MDS-UPDRS motor scores at week 12 (mean difference 2.6 points in favor of placebo, 95% confidence interval: -0.4 to 5.6, P = 0.089). There was no significant improvement in any motor, nonmotor, or quality-of-life outcome at weeks 12 and 52. Both the full-analysis and per-protocol analyses (based on eradication status) supported these conclusions. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth status did not influence treatment results.HP eradication does not improve clinical outcomes in PD, suggesting that there is no justification for routine HP screening or eradication with the goal of improving PD symptoms.

33071933,Changes in Gastrointestinal Microbiome Composition in PD: A Pivotal Role of Covariates.,"Altered gut microbiota may trigger or accelerate alpha-synuclein aggregation in the enteric nervous system in Parkinson's disease (PD). While several previous studies observed gut microbiota alterations in PD, findings like diversity indices, and altered bacterial taxa itself show a considerable heterogeneity across studies. We recruited 179 participants, of whom 101 fulfilled stringent inclusion criteria. Subsequently, the composition of the gut microbiota in 71 PD patients and 30 healthy controls was analyzed, sequencing V3-V4 regions of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene in fecal samples. Our goal was (1) to evaluate whether gut microbiota are altered in a southern German PD cohort, (2) to delineate the influence of disease duration, stage, and motor impairment, and (3) to investigate the influence of PD associated covariates like constipation and coffee consumption. Aiming to control for a large variety of covariates, strict inclusion criteria were applied. Finally, propensity score matching was performed to correct for, and to delineate the effect of remaining covariates (non-motor symptom (NMS) burden, constipation, and coffee consumption) on microbiota composition. Prior to matching altered abundances of distinct bacterial classes, orders, families, and genera were observed. Both, disease duration, and stage influenced microbiome composition. Interestingly, levodopa equivalent dose influenced the correlation of taxa with disease duration, while motor impairment did not. Applying different statistical tests, and after propensity score matching to control for NMS burden, constipation and coffee consumption, <i>Faecalibacterium</i> and <i>Ruminococcus</i> were most consistently reduced in PD compared to controls. Taken together, similar to previous studies, alterations of several taxa were observed in PD. Yet, further controlling for PD associated covariates such as constipation and coffee consumption revealed a pivotal role of these covariates. Our data highlight the impact of these PD associated covariates on microbiota composition in PD. This suggests that altered microbiota may mediate the protective effect of i.e., coffee consumption and the negative effect of constipation in PD.",Frontiers in neurology,2020,Alexandra Cosma-Grigorov; Holger Meixner; Anne Mrochen; Stefan Wirtz; JÃ¼rgen Winkler; Franz Marxreiter
32154946,Plasma Short-Chain Fatty Acids in Patients With Parkinson's Disease.,"Short-chain fatty acids are exclusively produced by gut microbiota and are reduced in feces of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The objective of this study was to conduct a case-control study on peripheral concentration of short-chain fatty acids based on evidence of pathologic changes in the blood-brain barrier in PD and the possible role of short-chain fatty acids in blood-brain barrier permeability.The plasma short-chain fatty acid concentration was measured in 38 PD and 33 normal controls using gas chromatography. The clinical characteristics of patients with PD and controls were evaluated, and dietary information was obtained using a food frequency questionnaire. Short-chain fatty acid concentrations were further compared after adjusting for age, sex, and significant food frequency questionnaire items.The concentrations of acetate, propionate, and butyrate did not differ between patients with PD and controls in unadjusted comparison. Dietary intakes of fibers, carbohydrates, lipids (total and fatty acids), and proteins did not differ between groups. After correction of covariates, acetic acid concentration was higher in patients with PD than in controls (116.47âÂ±â16.83 vs 108.20âÂ±â18.37 Î¼mol/L; P = 0.010). In correlation analyses, acetic acid concentration was positively correlated (R = 0.374, P = 0.021) with age, propionic acid concentration was negatively correlated with UPDRS part III score (R = -0.376, P = 0.020) and use of entacapone (R = -0.325, P = 0.047), and butyric acid concentration was correlated with monoamine oxidase inhibitor use (R = 0.382, P = 0.018) and anticholinergic use (R = -0.385, P = 0.024).Plasma short-chain fatty acids were paradoxically increased in PD and were associated with disease severity and antiparkinsonian medications. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the relationships of gut dysbiosis and inflammation with plasma short-chain fatty acids.

32039674,Development of a Novel Oral Delivery Vehicle for Probiotics.,"There is a significant interest in effective oral drug delivery of therapeutic substances. For probiotics, there is a particular need for a delivery platform that protects the bacteria from destruction by the acidic stomach while enabling targeted delivery to the intestine where microbiota naturally reside. The use of probiotics and how they impact the gut microbiota is a growing field and holds promise for the treatment of a variety of gastrointestinal diseases, including irritable bowel disease Crohn's disease and C. diff and other diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's diseases.The aim of this research was to use our newly developed chemically-modified alginate hydrogel with the characteristic feature of stability in acidic environments but disintegration under neutral-basic pH conditions to design a novel system for effective targeted delivery of ingested probiotics.We have used the approach of encapsulation of bacterial cells in the hydrogel of the modified alginate with in vitro studies in both simulated stomach acid and intestinal fluid conditions to demonstrate the potential application of this novel platform in oral delivery of probiotics. Our data provide a proof-of-concept that enables further studies in vivo with this delivery platform.We have demonstrated in the present study that our chemically modified alginate hydrogel is resistant to acidic conditions and protects bacterial cells encapsulated in it, but it is sensitive to neutral-basic pH conditions under which it disintegrates and releases its viable bacteria cell payload.

32739365,"Lactobacillus plantarum PS128 alleviates neurodegenerative progression in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced mouse models of Parkinson's disease.","Evidence suggests that the Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis is strongly associated with bidirectional pathways in the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA), and psychobiotics may inhibit PD progression. We previously reported that the novel psychobiotic strain, Lactobacillus plantarum PS128 (PS128), ameliorated abnormal behaviors and modulated neurotransmissions in dopaminergic pathways in rodent models. Here, we report that orally administering PS128 for 4Â weeks significantly alleviated the motor deficits, elevation in corticosterone, nigrostriatal dopaminergic neuronal death, and striatal dopamine reduction in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrathydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse models. PS128 ingestion suppressed glial cell hyperactivation and increased norepinephrine and neurotrophic factors in the striatum of the PD-model mice. PS128 administration also attenuated MPTP-induced oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in the nigrostriatal pathway. Fecal analysis showed that PS128 modulated the gut microbiota. L. plantarum abundance was significantly increased along with methionine biosynthesis-related microbial modules. PS128 also suppressed the increased family Enterobacteriaceae and lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan biosynthesis-related microbial modules caused by MPTP. In conclude, PS128 ingestion alleviated MPTP-induced motor deficits and neurotoxicity.PS128 supplementation inhibited neurodegenerative processes in PD-model mice and may help prevent PD.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2020,Jian-Fu Liao; Yun-Fang Cheng; Shu-Ting You; Wen-Chun Kuo; Chi-Wei Huang; Jen-Jie Chiou; Chih-Chieh Hsu; Hsiu-Mei Hsieh-Li; Sabrina Wang; Ying-Chieh Tsai
31836471,Sodium butyrate causes Î±-synuclein degradation by an Atg5-dependent and PI3K/Akt/mTOR-related autophagy pathway.,"Aggregation of Î±-Synuclein is central to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, these Î±-Synuclein inclusions are not only present in brain, but also in gut. Enteroendocrine cells (EECs), which are directly exposed to the gut lumen, can express Î±-Synuclein and directly connect to Î±-Synuclein-containing nerves. Dysbiosis of gut microbiota and microbial metabolite short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) has been implicated as a driver for PD. Butyrate is an SCFA produced by the gut microbiota. Our aim was to demonstrate how Î±-Synuclein expression in EECs responds to butyrate stimulation. Interestingly, we found that sodium butyrate (NaB) increases Î±-Synuclein mRNA expression, enhances Atg5-mediated autophagy (increased LC3B-II and decreased SQSTM1 (also known as p62) expression) in murine neuroendocrine STC-1Â cells. Further, Î±-Synuclein mRNA was decreased by the inhibition of autophagy by using inhibitor bafilomycin A1 or by silencing Atg5 with siRNA. Moreover, the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway was significantly inhibited and cell apoptosis was activated by NaB. Conditioned media from NaB-stimulated STC-1Â cells induced inflammation in SH-SY5Y cells. Collectively, NaB causes Î±-Synuclein degradation by an Atg5-dependent and PI3K/Akt/mTOR-related autophagy pathway.",Experimental cell research,2020,Chen-Meng Qiao; Meng-Fei Sun; Xue-Bing Jia; Yun Shi; Bo-Ping Zhang; Zhi-Lan Zhou; Li-Ping Zhao; Chun Cui; Yan-Qin Shen
34500451,Parkinson's Disease and Gut Microbiota.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is caused by abnormal aggregation of Î±-synuclein fibrils, called the Lewy bodies, in the central nervous system. Accumulating knowledge points to the notion that Î±-synuclein fibrils start from the dorsal vagal nucleus and ascend to the locus ceruleus and the substantia nigra (SN). Even in healthy elderly subjects without motor or cognitive impairment, Î±-synuclein fibrils are frequently observed in the brain and sometimes in the intestinal neural plexus. Enteroendocrine cells have a direct synapse to the vagal afferents, and the vagal nucleus has synaptic pathways to the SN and the striatum. Intestinal bacteria are likely to be involved in the formation of intestinal Î±-synuclein fibrils.A nonparametric meta-analysis of intestinal microbiota in PD in 5 countries, as well as scrutinization of the other reports from the other countries, indicates that mucin-degrading Akkermansia is increased in PD and that short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria are decreased in PD. Both dysbiosis should increase the intestinal permeability, which subsequently facilitates exposure of the intestinal neural plexus to toxins like lipopolysaccharide and pesticide, which should lead to abnormal aggregation of Î±-synuclein fibrils. Decreased SCFA also downregulates regulatory T cells and fails to suppress neuronal inflammation. Key Messages: Therapeutic intervention may be able to be established against these mechanisms. Additional biochemical, cellular, and animal studies are required to further dissect the direct association between intestinal microbiota and PD.",Annals of nutrition & metabolism,2021,Masaaki Hirayama; Kinji Ohno
34450312,The role of microbiota-gut-brain axis in neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders.,"Emerging evidence indicates that the gut microbiota play a crucial role in the bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain suggesting that the gut microbes may shape neural development, modulate neurotransmission and affect behavior, and thereby contribute to the pathogenesis and/or progression of many neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric, and neurological conditions.

34784980,Fecal microbiota transplantation protects rotenone-induced Parkinson's disease mice via suppressing inflammation mediated by the lipopolysaccharide-TLR4 signaling pathway through the microbiota-gut-brain axis.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, displaying not only well-known motor deficits but also gastrointestinal dysfunctions. Consistently, it has been increasingly evident that gut microbiota affects the communication between the gut and the brain in PD pathogenesis, known as the microbiota-gut-brain axis. As an approach to re-establishing a normal microbiota community, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has exerted beneficial effects on PD in recent studies. Here, in this study, we established a chronic rotenone-induced PD mouse model to evaluate the protective effects of FMT treatment on PD and to explore the underlying mechanisms, which also proves the involvement of gut microbiota dysbiosis in PD pathogenesis via the microbiota-gut-brain axis.We demonstrated that gut microbiota dysbiosis induced by rotenone administration caused gastrointestinal function impairment and poor behavioral performances in the PD mice. Moreover, 16S RNA sequencing identified the increase of bacterial genera Akkermansia and Desulfovibrio in fecal samples of rotenone-induced mice. By contrast, FMT treatment remarkably restored the gut microbial community, thus ameliorating the gastrointestinal dysfunctions and the motor deficits of the PD mice. Further experiments revealed that FMT administration alleviated intestinal inflammation and barrier destruction, thus reducing the levels of systemic inflammation. Subsequently, FMT treatment attenuated blood-brain barrier (BBB) impairment and suppressed neuroinflammation in the substantia nigra (SN), which further decreased the damage of dopaminergic neurons. Additional mechanistic investigation discovered that FMT treatment reduced lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels in the colon, the serum, and the SN, thereafter suppressing the TLR4/MyD88/NF-ÎºB signaling pathway and its downstream pro-inflammatory products both in the SN and the colon.Our current study demonstrates that FMT treatment can correct the gut microbiota dysbiosis and ameliorate the rotenone-induced PD mouse model, in which suppression of the inflammation mediated by the LPS-TLR4 signaling pathway both in the gut and the brain possibly plays a significant role. Further, we prove that rotenone-induced microbiota dysbiosis is involved in the genesis of PD via the microbiota-gut-brain axis.

In addition to genetics, some environmental factors may exert vital parts in PD occurrence as well. At present, more and more studies are conducted to elucidate the association between gut microbial dysbiosis and the incidence of PD. Gut microbial dysbiosis has a certain effect on both the central nervous system (CNS) and the enteric nervous system (ENS), which indicates that there is a gut-microbiota-brain axis that induces CNS disorders. Some gut microbial strains are suggested to suppress or weaken the neuroinflammation- and gut-inflammation-immune responses, which suggests the protective and pathogenic effects of certain gut microbial species on PD progression. Therefore, gut microbiome may contain plenty of targets for preventing and managing PD. Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) may serve as a direct and useful treatment for PD in the future. Nonetheless, there is little available scientific research in this field.

This study sought to compare and identify associations among these factors in PD patients and controls to elucidate their interrelations and links to clinical manifestations of PD.Stool and plasma samples and clinical data were collected from 55 PD patients and 56 controls. Levels of stool SCFAs and stool and plasma inflammatory and permeability markers were compared between patients and controls and related to one another and to the gut microbiota.Calprotectin was increased and SCFAs decreased in stool in PD in a sex-dependent manner. Inflammatory markers in plasma and stool were neither intercorrelated nor strongly associated with SCFA levels. Age at PD onset was positively correlated with SCFAs and negatively correlated with CXCL8 and IL-1Î² in stool. Fecal zonulin correlated positively with fecal NGAL and negatively with PD motor and non-motor symptoms. Microbiota diversity and composition were linked to levels of SCFAs, inflammatory factors, and zonulin in stool. Certain relationships differed between patients and controls and by sex.Intestinal inflammatory responses and reductions in fecal SCFAs occur in PD, are related to the microbiota and to disease onset, and are not reflected in plasma inflammatory profiles. Some of these relationships are distinct in PD and are sex-dependent.

Firstly, the mounting evidences from clinical and preclinical arenas shows the influence of gut microbiota mediated oxidative stress resulting in dysfunctional neurological processes. Therefore, we describe the potential role of gut microbiota influencing the vulnerability of brain to oxidative stress, and a budding causative in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Secondly, contributing roles of gut microbiota has been observed in attenuating oxidative stress and inflammation via its own metabolites or by producing secondary metabolites and, also modulation in gut microbiota population with antioxidative and anti-inflammatory probiotics have shown promising neuro resilience. Thirdly, high throughput <i>in silico</i> tools and databases also gives a correlation of gut microbiome, their metabolites and brain health, thus providing fascinating perspective and promising new avenues for therapeutic options.",Journal of advanced research,2022,Shruti Shandilya; Sandeep Kumar; Niraj Kumar Jha; Kavindra Kumar Kesari; Janne Ruokolainen

However, the efficacy of many oral drugs is limited to their unsatisfactory bioavailability in the gastrointestinal tract. One of the critical and most overlooked factors is the symbiotic gut microbiota that can modulate the bioavailability of oral drugs by participating in the biotransformation of oral drugs, influencing the drug transport process and altering some gastrointestinal properties.

34576191,The Role of Gut Microbiota and Gut-Brain Interplay in Selected Diseases of the Central Nervous System.,"The gut microbiome has attracted increasing attention from researchers in recent years. The microbiota can have a specific and complex cross-talk with the host, particularly with the central nervous system (CNS), creating the so-called ""gut-brain axis"". Communication between the gut, intestinal microbiota, and the brain involves the secretion of various metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), structural components of bacteria, and signaling molecules. Moreover, an imbalance in the gut microbiota composition modulates the immune system and function of tissue barriers such as the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Therefore, the aim of this literature review is to describe how the gut-brain interplay may contribute to the development of various neurological disorders, combining the fields of gastroenterology and neuroscience. We present recent findings concerning the effect of the altered microbiota on neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, as well as multiple sclerosis. Moreover, the impact of the pathological shift in the microbiome on selected neuropsychological disorders, i.e., major depressive disorders (MDD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), is also discussed. Future research on the effect of balanced gut microbiota composition on the gut-brain axis would help to identify new potential opportunities for therapeutic interventions in the presented diseases.",International journal of molecular sciences,2021,Julia Doroszkiewicz; Magdalena Groblewska; Barbara Mroczko
33856024,The role of gut dysbiosis in Parkinson's disease: mechanistic insights and therapeutic options.,"Parkinson's disease is a common neurodegenerative disorder in which gastrointestinal symptoms may appear prior to motor symptoms. The gut microbiota of patients with Parkinson's disease shows unique changes, which may be used as early biomarkers of disease. Alterations in the gut microbiota composition may be related to the cause or effect of motor or non-motor symptoms, but the specific pathogenic mechanisms are unclear. The gut microbiota and its metabolites have been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease by regulating neuroinflammation, barrier function and neurotransmitter activity. There is bidirectional communication between the enteric nervous system and the CNS, and the microbiota-gut-brain axis may provide a pathway for the transmission of Î±-synuclein. We highlight recent discoveries about alterations to the gut microbiota in Parkinson's disease and focus on current mechanistic insights into the microbiota-gut-brain axis in disease pathophysiology. Moreover, we discuss the interactions between the production and transmission of Î±-synuclein and gut inflammation and neuroinflammation. In addition, we draw attention to diet modification, the use of probiotics and prebiotics and faecal microbiota transplantation as potential therapeutic approaches that may lead to a new treatment paradigm for Parkinson's disease.",Brain : a journal of neurology,2021,Qing Wang; Yuqi Luo; K Ray Chaudhuri; Richard Reynolds; Eng-King Tan; Sven Pettersson
33623004,Oral berberine improves brain dopa/dopamine levels to ameliorate Parkinson's disease by regulating gut microbiota.,"The phenylalanine-tyrosine-dopa-dopamine pathway provides dopamine to the brain. In this process, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is the rate-limiting enzyme that hydroxylates tyrosine and generates levodopa (L-dopa) with tetrahydrobiopterin (BH<sub>4</sub>) as a coenzyme. Here, we show that oral berberine (BBR) might supply H<sup>â¢</sup> through dihydroberberine (reduced BBR produced by bacterial nitroreductase) and promote the production of BH<sub>4</sub> from dihydrobiopterin; the increased BH<sub>4</sub> enhances TH activity, which accelerates the production of L-dopa by the gut bacteria. Oral BBR acts in a way similar to vitamins. The L-dopa produced by the intestinal bacteria enters the brain through the circulation and is transformed to dopamine. To verify the gut-brain dialog activated by BBR's effect, Enterococcus faecalis or Enterococcus faecium was transplanted into Parkinson's disease (PD) mice. The bacteria significantly increased brain dopamine and ameliorated PD manifestation in mice; additionally, combination of BBR with bacteria showed better therapeutic effect than that with bacteria alone. Moreover, 2,4,6-trimethyl-pyranylium tetrafluoroborate (TMP-TFB)-derivatized matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) imaging of dopamine identified elevated striatal dopamine levels in mouse brains with oral Enterococcus, and BBR strengthened the imaging intensity of brain dopamine. These results demonstrated that BBR was an agonist of TH in Enterococcus and could lead to the production of L-dopa in the gut. Furthermore, a study of 28 patients with hyperlipidemia confirmed that oral BBR increased blood/fecal L-dopa by the intestinal bacteria. Hence, BBR might improve the brain function by upregulating the biosynthesis of L-dopa in the gut microbiota through a vitamin-like effect.",Signal transduction and targeted therapy,2021,Yan Wang; Qian Tong; Shu-Rong Ma; Zhen-Xiong Zhao; Li-Bin Pan; Lin Cong; Pei Han; Ran Peng; Hang Yu; Yuan Lin; Tian-Le Gao; Jia-Wen Shou; Xiao-Yang Li; Xian-Feng Zhang; Zheng-Wei Zhang; Jie Fu; Bao-Ying Wen; Jin-Bo Yu; Xuetao Cao; Jian-Dong Jiang

34492236,Probiotics: Potential novel therapeutics for microbiota-gut-brain axis dysfunction across gender and lifespan.,"Probiotics are live microorganisms, which when administered in adequate amounts, present a health benefit for the host. While the beneficial effects of probiotics on gastrointestinal function are generally well recognized, new animal research and clinical studies have found that alterations in gut microbial communities can have a broad range of effects throughout the body. Non-intestinal sites impacted include the immune, endocrine, cardiovascular and the central nervous system (CNS). In particular, there has been a growing interest and appreciation about the role that gut microbiota may play in affecting CNS-related function through the 'microbiota-gut-brain axis'. Emerging evidence suggests potential therapeutic benefits of probiotics in several CNS conditions, such as anxiety, depression, autism spectrum disorders and Parkinson's disease. There may also be some gender-specific variances in terms of probiotic mediated effects, with the gut microbiota shaping and being concurrently molded by the hormonal environment governing differences between the sexes. Probiotics may influence the ability of the gut microbiome to affect a variety of biological processes in the host, including neurotransmitter activity, vagal neurotransmission, generation of neuroactive metabolites and inflammatory response mediators. Some of these may engage in cross talk with host sex hormones, such as estrogens, which could be of relevance in relation to their effects on stress response and cognitive health.

33649989,The Gut-Brain Axis: Two Ways Signaling in Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic, progressive and second most prevalent neurological disorder affecting the motor system. Cardinal motor impairment and Î±-synucleinopathy are the characteristic features of PD. Recently, it has been identified that the gut-brain axis is substantially regulated by the gut microbiome (GM) through an immunological, neuroendocrine, and neural mechanism. However, disturbance in the gut-microbiome-brain axis in PD might proceed to gastrointestinal manifestations intermittently leading to the motor system and the PD pathogenesis itself. The gut microbial toxins may induce the production of Î±-synuclein (Î±-syn) aggregates in the enteric nervous system (ENS), which may proliferate and propagate in a prion-like-manner through the vagus nerve to the central nervous system (CNS); supporting the hypothesis that, GM might play a pivotal role in PD pathogenesis. Overstimulated innate immune system due to intestinal bacterial overgrowth or gut dysbiosis and the enhanced intestinal permeability may persuade systemic inflammation, while the activation of enteric glial cells and enteric neurons may contribute to Î±-synucleinopathy. Gut microbiota can bear a significant impact on neurological outcomes such as learning, memory and cognition. In this review paper, we summarize how the alterations in gut microbiota and ENS inflammation are associated with PD pathogenesis. The evidence supporting the causative role played by gut-associated dysbiosis and microbial byproducts, in the onset of PD is also discussed.

33417973,Unravelling the role of gut microbiota in Parkinson's disease progression: Pathogenic and therapeutic implications.,"In recent years, researchers have shown interest in bi-directional interaction between the brain and gut, called ""gut-brain axis"". Emerging pieces of evidence indicate that disturbances in this axis is found to be associated with the Parkinson's disease (PD). Several clinical investigations revealed the crucial role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of PD. It has been suggested that aggregation of misfolded protein Î±-syn, the neuropathological hallmark of PD, might begin in gut and propagates to the CNS via vagus nerve and olfactory bulb. Emerging evidences also suggest that initiation and progression of PD may be due to inflammation originating from gut. It has been shown that microbial gut dysbiosis causes the production of various pathogenic microbial metabolites which elevates pro-inflammatory environment in the gut that promotes neuroinflammation in the CNS. These observations raise the intriguing question - how gut microbial dysbiosis could contribute to PD progression. In this context, various microbiota-targeted therapies are under consideration that can re-establish the intestinal homeostasis which may have greater promise in the prevention and treatment of PD. This review focuses on the role of the gut microbiota in the initiation, progression of PD and current therapeutic intervention to deplete the severity of the disease.",Neuroscience research,2021,Linchi Rani; Amal Chandra Mondal
34530073,Alterations of gut microbiota and metabolome with Parkinson's disease.,"Gut microbiota and amino acids that are one of their metabolites play important roles in the mechanism of pathology of Parkinson's disease (PD). It has been reported that the level of amino acids in vivo participate in neurodegeneration by regulating adaptive immune response, while the current researches on alteration of amino acids in gut microbiota are still insufficient. We hypothesized that alterations in gut microbiota might be accompanied by altered concentrations of amino acids, leading to the occurrence of PD. In this study, we collected stool samples from PD and healthy controls to analyse fecal microbiome and targeted metabolome by 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene sequencing and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). At the genus level, there was a greater abundance of Alistipes, Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group, Bifidobacterium, Parabacteroides, while Faecalibacterium was decreased in fecal samples from PD patients. Moreover, fecal branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) and aromatic amino acids concentrations were significantly reduced in PD patients compared to controls. Our study not only finds the abundance of certain gut microbiota in PD,but also reveals that it is related to BCAAs and aromatic amino acids.

33643026,"The Association Between the Gut Microbiota and Parkinson's Disease, a Meta-Analysis.","Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) were often observed with gastrointestinal symptoms, which preceded the onset of motor symptoms. Neuropathology of PD has also been found in the enteric nervous system (ENS). Many studies have reported significant PD-related alterations of gut microbiota. This meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the differences of gut microbiota between patients with PD and healthy controls (HCs) across different geographical regions. We conducted a systematic online search for case-control studies detecting gut microbiota in patients with PD and HCs. Mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to access alterations in the abundance of certain microbiota families in PD. Fifteen case-control studies were included in this meta-analysis study. Our results showed significant lower abundance levels of <i>Prevotellaceae</i> (MD = -0.37, 95% CI = -0.62 to -0.11), <i>Faecalibacterium</i> (MD = -0.41, 95% CI: -0.57 to -0.24), and <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> (MD = -0.34, 95% CI = -0.59 to -0.09) in patients with PD compared to HCs. Significant higher abundance level of <i>Bifidobacteriaceae</i> (MD = 0.38, 95%; CI = 0.12 to 0.63), <i>Ruminococcaceae</i> (MD = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.07 to 1.10), <i>Verrucomicrobiaceae</i> (MD = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.21 to 0.69), and <i>Christensenellaceae</i> (MD = 0.20, 95% CI = 0.07 to 0.34) was also found in patients with PD. Thus, shared alterations of certain gut microbiota were detected in patients with PD across different geographical regions.

33517890,Gut microbiota-derived propionate mediates the neuroprotective effect of osteocalcin in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with no absolute cure. The evidence of the involvement of gut microbiota in PD pathogenesis suggests the need to identify certain molecule(s) derived from the gut microbiota, which has the potential to manage PD. Osteocalcin (OCN), an osteoblast-secreted protein, has been shown to modulate brain function. Thus, it is of interest to investigate whether OCN could exert protective effect on PD and, if yes, whether the underlying mechanism lies in the subsequent changes in gut microbiota.The intraperitoneal injection of OCN can effectively ameliorate the motor deficits and dopaminergic neuronal loss in a 6-hydroxydopamine-induced PD mouse model. The further antibiotics treatment and fecal microbiota transplantation experiments confirmed that the gut microbiota was required for OCN-induced protection in PD mice. OCN elevated Bacteroidetes and depleted Firmicutes phyla in the gut microbiota of PD mice with elevated potential of microbial propionate production and was confirmed by fecal propionate levels. Two months of orally administered propionate successfully rescued motor deficits and dopaminergic neuronal loss in PD mice. Furthermore, AR420626, the agonist of FFAR3, which is the receptor of propionate, mimicked the neuroprotective effects of propionate and the ablation of enteric neurons blocked the prevention of dopaminergic neuronal loss by propionate in PD mice.Together, our results demonstrate that OCN ameliorates motor deficits and dopaminergic neuronal loss in PD mice, modulating gut microbiome and increasing propionate level might be an underlying mechanism responsible for the neuroprotective effects of OCN on PD, and the FFAR3, expressed in enteric nervous system, might be the main action site of propionate.

In parallel with the revealed tight association between ASD risk and severity and Zn status, the particular mechanisms linking Zn<sup>2+</sup> and ASD pathogenesis like modulation of synaptic plasticity through ProSAP/Shank scaffold, neurotransmitter metabolism, and gut microbiota, have been elucidated. The increasing body of data indicate the potential involvement of Zn<sup>2+</sup> metabolism in neurodegeneration. Systemic Zn levels in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease were found to be reduced, whereas its sequestration in brain may result in modulation of amyloid Î² and Î±-synuclein processing with subsequent toxic effects.

34589401,Novel compound FLZ alleviates rotenone-induced PD mouse model by suppressing TLR4/MyD88/NF-<i>Îº</i>B pathway through microbiota-gut-brain axis.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, but none of the current treatments for PD can halt the progress of the disease due to the limited understanding of the pathogenesis. In PD development, the communication between the brain and the gastrointestinal system influenced by gut microbiota is known as microbiota-gut-brain axis. However, the explicit mechanisms of microbiota dysbiosis in PD development have not been well elucidated yet. FLZ, a novel squamosamide derivative, has been proved to be effective in many PD models and is undergoing the phase I clinical trial to treat PD in China. Moreover, our previous pharmacokinetic study revealed that gut microbiota could regulate the absorption of FLZ <i>inÂ vivo</i>. The aims of our study were to assess the protective effects of FLZ treatment on PD and to further explore the underlying microbiota-related mechanisms of PD by using FLZ as a tool. In the current study, chronic oral administration of rotenone was utilized to induce a mouse model to mimic the pathological process of PD. Here we revealed that FLZ treatment alleviated gastrointestinal dysfunctions, motor symptoms, and dopaminergic neuron death in rotenone-challenged mice. 16S rRNA sequencing found that PD-related microbiota alterations induced by rotenone were reversed by FLZ treatment. Remarkably, FLZ administration attenuated intestinal inflammation and gut barrier destruction, which subsequently inhibited systemic inflammation. Eventually, FLZ treatment restored blood-brain barrier structure and suppressed neuroinflammation by inhibiting the activation of astrocytes and microglia in the substantia nigra (SN). Further mechanistic research demonstrated that FLZ treatment suppressed the TLR4/MyD88/NF-<i>Îº</i>B pathway both in the SN and colon. Collectively, FLZ treatment ameliorates microbiota dysbiosis to protect the PD model <i>via</i> inhibiting TLR4 pathway, which contributes to one of the underlying mechanisms beneath its neuroprotective effects. Our research also supports the importance of microbiota-gut-brain axis in PD pathogenesis, suggesting its potential role as a novel therapeutic target for PD treatment.",Acta pharmaceutica Sinica.

34669122,"An Alternative Explanation for Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease Initiation from Specific Antibiotics, Gut Microbiota Dysbiosis and Neurotoxins.","The late onset neuropathologies, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, have become increasingly prevalent. Their causation has been linked to genetics, gut microbiota dysbiosis (gut dysbiosis), autoimmune diseases, pathogens and exposures to neurotoxins. An alternative explanatory hypothesis is provided for their pathogenesis. Virtually everyone has pervasive daily exposures to neurotoxins, through inhalation, skin contact, direct blood transmission and through the gastrointestinal tract by ingestion. As a result, every individual has substantial and fluctuating neurotoxin blood levels. Two major barriers to neurotoxin entry into the central nervous system are the blood-brain barrier and the intestinal wall, in the absence of gut dysbiosis. Inflammation from gut dysbiosis, induced by antibiotic usage, can increase the intestinal wall permeability for neurotoxins to reach the bloodstream, and also increase the blood-brain barrier permeability to neurotoxins. Gut dysbiosis, including gut dysbiosis caused by antibiotic treatments, is an especially high risk for neurotoxin entry into the brain to cause late onset neuropathologies. Gut dysbiosis has far-reaching immune system and central nervous system effects, and even a transient gut dysbiosis can act in combination with neurotoxins, such as aluminum, mercury, lead, arsenic, cadmium, selenium, manganese, organophosphate pesticides and organochlorines, to reach neurotoxin blood levels that can initiate a late onset neuropathology, depending on an individual's age and genetic vulnerability.",Neurochemical research,2022,Kevin Roe

32504503,"Dysregulation of the Gut-Brain Axis, Dysbiosis and Influence of Numerous Factors on Gut Microbiota Associated Parkinson's Disease.","Parkinson's disease (PD) has been one of the substantial social, medical concerns and, burdens of the present time. PD is a gradually devastating neurodegenerative disorder of the neurological function marked with Î±-synucleinopathy affecting numerous regions of the brain-gut axis, as well as the central, enteric, and autonomic nervous system. Its etiology is a widely disputed topic.This review emphasizes to find out the correlation among the microbial composition and the observable disturbances in the metabolites of the microbial species and its impact on the immune response, which may have a concrete implication on the occurrence, persistence and, pathophysiology of PD via the gut-brain axis.An in-depth research and the database was developed from the available peer-reviewed articles to date (March 2020) utilizing numerous search engines like PubMed, MEDLINE and, other internet sources.Progressively increasing shreds of evidence have proved the fact that dysbiosis in the gut microbiome plays a central role in many neurological disorders, such as PD. Indeed, a disordered microbiome-gut-brain axis in PD could be focused on gastrointestinal afflictions that manifest primarily several years prior to the diagnosis, authenticating a concept wherein the pathological pathway progresses from the intestine reaching the brain.The microbiota greatly affects the bidirectional interaction between the brain and the gut via synchronized neurological, immunological, and neuroendocrine mechanisms. It can be concluded that a multitude of factors discussed in this review steadily induce the onset of dysbacteriosis that may exacerbate the etiologic mechanism of Parkinson's disease.",Current neuropharmacology,2021,Gagandeep Kaur; Tapan Behl; Simona Bungau; Arun Kumar; Md Sahab Uddin; Vineet Mehta; Gokhan Zengin; Bijo Mathew; Muhammad Ajmal Shah; Sandeep Arora
34475403,Gut microbiota and metabolites of Î±-synuclein transgenic monkey models with early stage of Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease. However, it is unclear whether microbiota and metabolites have demonstrated changes at early PD due to the difficulties in diagnosis and identification of early PD in clinical practice. In a previous study, we generated A53T transgenic monkeys with early Parkinson's symptoms, including anxiety and cognitive impairment. Here we analyzed the gut microbiota by metagenomic sequencing and metabolites by targeted gas chromatography. The gut microbiota analysis showed that the A53T monkeys have higher degree of diversity in gut microbiota with significantly elevated Sybergistetes, Akkermansia, and Eggerthella lenta compared with control monkeys. Prevotella significantly decreased in A53T transgenic monkeys. Glyceric acid, L-Aspartic acid, and p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid were significantly elevated, whereas Myristic acid and 3-Methylindole were significantly decreased in A53T monkeys. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (KO0131) and the oxidative phosphorylation reaction (KO2147) were significantly increased in metabolic pathways of A53T monkeys. Our study suggested that the transgenic A53T and Î±-syn aggregation may affect the intestine microbiota and metabolites of rhesus monkeys, and the identified five compositional different metabolites that are mainly associated with mitochondrial dysfunction may be related to the pathogenesis of PD.",NPJ biofilms and microbiomes,2021,Yaping Yan; Shuchao Ren; Yanchao Duan; Chenyu Lu; Yuyu Niu; Zhengbo Wang; Briauna Inglis; Weizhi Ji; Yun Zheng; Wei Si
31684843,Effect of nutrition on neurodegenerative diseases. A systematic review.,"Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the progressive functional loss of neurons in the brain, causing cognitive impairment and motoneuron disability. Although multifactorial interactions are evident, nutrition plays an essential role in the pathogenesis and evolution of these diseases. A systematic literature search was performed, and the prevalence of studies evaluated the effect of the Mediterranean diet (MeDiet), nutritional support, EPA and DHA, and vitamins on memory and cognition impairment. The data showed that malnutrition and low body mass index (BMI) is correlated with the higher development of dementia and mortality. MeDiet, nutritional support, and calorie-controlled diets play a protective effect against cognitive decline, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson disease (PD) while malnutrition and insulin resistance represent significant risk factors. Malnutrition activates also the gut-microbiota-brain axis dysfunction that exacerbate neurogenerative process. Omega-3 and -6, and the vitamins supplementation seem to be less effective in protecting neuron degeneration. Insulin activity is a prevalent factor contributing to brain health while malnutrition correlated with the higher development of dementia and mortality.",Nutritional neuroscience,2021,Vittorio Emanuele Bianchi; Pomares Fredy Herrera; Rizzi Laura

34243604,Role of microbiota-derived short-chain fatty acids in nervous system disorders.,"During the past decade, accumulating evidence from the research highlights the suggested effects of bacterial communities of the human gut microbiota and their metabolites on health and disease. In this regard, microbiota-derived metabolites and their receptors, beyond the immune system, maintain metabolism homeostasis, which is essential to maintain the host's health by balancing the utilization and intake of nutrients. It has been shown that gut bacterial dysbiosis can cause pathology and altered bacterial metabolites' formation, resulting in dysregulation of the immune system and metabolism. The short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as butyrate, acetate, and succinate, are produced due to the fermentation process of bacteria in the gut. It has been noted remodeling in the gut microbiota metabolites associated with the pathophysiology of several neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, stress, anxiety, depression, autism, vascular dementia, schizophrenia, stroke, and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders, among others.

34371014,The link between the gut microbiota and Parkinson's Disease: A systematic mechanism review with focus on Î±-synuclein transport.,"Research has suggested a link between the gut microbiota and Parkinson's Disease (PD), and an early involvement of gastrointestinal dysfunction has been reported in patients. A mechanism review was performed to investigate whether the neurodegenerative cascade begins in the gut; mediated by gut dysbiosis and retrograde transport of Î±-synuclein. This review provides a summary of microbiome composition associated with PD, and evaluates pathophysiological mechanisms from animal and in vitro models of PD.A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed; 82 of 299 papers met the inclusion criteria.All twenty-two human case-control studies demonstrated an altered gut microbiota in PD compared to healthy controls, with results suggesting a proinflammatory phenotype present in PD. A germ-free animal study has demonstrated that gut microbiota are required for microglia activation, Î±-synuclein pathology and motor deficits. Accumulation of phosphorylated Î±-synuclein has been observed in the enteric nervous system prior to the onset of motor symptoms in animal models of PD, and there is data to support retrograde transport of Î±-synuclein from the gut to the brain. Different animal models of PD have demonstrated neuroinflammation, microglial activation and loss of dopaminergic neurons in the brain.Evidence from this review supports the hypothesis that pathology spreads from the gut to the brain. Future animal studies using oral LPS or microbiota transplants from human PD cases could provide further insight into the entire mechanism.

34948234,Human Gut Microbiota in Health and Selected Cancers.,"The majority of the epithelial surfaces of our body, and the digestive tract, respiratory and urogenital systems, are colonized by a vast number of bacteria, archaea, fungi, protozoans, and viruses. These <i>microbiota</i>, particularly those of the intestines, play an important, beneficial role in digestion, metabolism, and the synthesis of vitamins. Their metabolites stimulate cytokine production by the human host, which are used against potential pathogens. The composition of the microbiota is influenced by several internal and external factors, including diet, age, disease, and lifestyle. Such changes, called dysbiosis, may be involved in the development of various conditions, such as metabolic diseases, including metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, Hashimoto's thyroidis and Graves' disease; they can also play a role in nervous system disturbances, such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and depression. An association has also been found between gut microbiota dysbiosis and cancer. Our health is closely associated with the state of our microbiota, and their homeostasis.

33499229,Clinical Phenotypes of Parkinson's Disease Associate with Distinct Gut Microbiota and Metabolome Enterotypes.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a clinically heterogenic disorder characterized by distinct clinical entities. Most studies on motor deficits dichotomize PD into tremor dominant (TD) or non-tremor dominant (non-TD) with akinetic-rigid features (AR). Different pathophysiological mechanisms may affect the onset of motor manifestations. Recent studies have suggested that gut microbes may be involved in PD pathogenesis. The aim of this study was to investigate the gut microbiota and metabolome composition in PD patients in relation to TD and non-TD phenotypes. In order to address this issue, gut microbiota and the metabolome structure of PD patients were determined from faecal samples using 16S next generation sequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry approaches. The results showed a reduction in the relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae, <i>Blautia</i>, <i>Coprococcus</i>, <i>Lachnospira</i>, and an increase in Enterobacteriaceae, <i>Escherichia</i> and <i>Serratia</i> linked to non-TD subtypes. Moreover, the levels of important molecules (i.e., nicotinic acid, cadaverine, glucuronic acid) were altered in relation to the severity of phenotype. We hypothesize that the microbiota/metabolome enterotypes associated to non-TD subtypes may favor the development of gut inflammatory environment and gastrointestinal dysfunctions and therefore a more severe Î±-synucleinopathy.

As is demonstrated by the accumulating evidence, the gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system interact through the gut-brain axis, which includes neuronal, immune-mediated and metabolite-mediated pathways. Additionally, recent progress from both preclinical and clinical studies indicated that gut microbiota play a pivotal role in gut-brain interactions, whereas the imbalance of the gut microbiota composition may be associated with the pathogenesis of neurological diseases (particularly neurodegenerative diseases), the underlying mechanism of which is insufficiently studied. This review aims to highlight the relationship between gut microbiota and neurodegenerative diseases, and to contribute to our understanding of the function of gut microbiota in neurodegeneration, as well as their relevant mechanisms. Furthermore, we also discuss the current application and future prospects of microbiota-associated therapy, including probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), potentially shedding new light on the research of neurodegeneration.",Microorganisms,2021,Peilin Sun; Lei Su; Hua Zhu; Xue Li; Yaxi Guo; Xiaopeng Du; Ling Zhang; Chuan Qin

35052575,Parkinson's Disease and the Metal-Microbiome-Gut-Brain Axis: A Systems Toxicology Approach.,"Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease, leading to motor and non-motor complications. Autonomic alterations, including gastrointestinal symptoms, precede motor defects and act as early warning signs. Chronic exposure to dietary, environmental heavy metals impacts the gastrointestinal system and host-associated microbiome, eventually affecting the central nervous system. The correlation between dysbiosis and PD suggests a functional and bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain. The bioaccumulation of metals promotes stress mechanisms by increasing reactive oxygen species, likely altering the bidirectional gut-brain link. To better understand the differing molecular mechanisms underlying PD, integrative modeling approaches are necessary to connect multifactorial perturbations in this heterogeneous disorder. By exploring the effects of gut microbiota modulation on dietary heavy metal exposure in relation to PD onset, the modification of the host-associated microbiome to mitigate neurological stress may be a future treatment option against neurodegeneration through bioremediation. The progressive movement towards a systems toxicology framework for precision medicine can uncover molecular mechanisms underlying PD onset such as metal regulation and microbial community interactions by developing predictive models to better understand PD etiology to identify options for novel treatments and beyond. Several methodologies recently addressed the complexity of this interaction from different perspectives; however, to date, a comprehensive review of these approaches is still lacking. Therefore, our main aim through this manuscript is to fill this gap in the scientific literature by reviewing recently published papers to address the surrounding questions regarding the underlying molecular mechanisms between metals, microbiota, and the gut-brain-axis, as well as the regulation of this system to prevent neurodegeneration.","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2021,Lady Johanna Forero-RodrÃ­guez; Jonathan Josephs-Spaulding; Stefano Flor; AndrÃ©s PinzÃ³n; Christoph Kaleta
34938619,Is the Gut Microbiota a Neglected Aspect of Gut and Brain Disorders?,"The gut microbiota is a quickly developing bacterial ecosystem with biodiversity.Â It is an adaptive immunity that varies with food intake, environmental conditions, and human habits, among other factors.Â Various external stimuli, such as drugs, can influence the gut microbial environment and lead to gut dysbiosis. Recently, gut dysbiosis has been identified as an important factor that leads to several diseases either by the released metabolites or by the gut neuronal connection. In brain disorders, gut dysbiosis is involved in neuropsychiatric manifestations, including autism spectrum disorder, anxiety, and depression by interfering with neurotransmitter homeostasis, and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease by releasing abnormal metabolites from the gut. Gut dysbiosis has been documented in gut disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease or irritable bowel syndrome. Immune cells in the gut are modulated by external factors such as stress, diet, and drugs to produce inflammatory cytokines, including interleukins (IL-4, IL-6, IL-17, IL-23, etc.). Inflammatory cytokines lead to a cascade of events, which lead to various ailments in the bowel. Beneficial bacteria in the form of probiotics ameliorate the condition and have healthful effects in disease conditions.

Pathogenetically, the gastrointestinal tract has been proposed to be the initial site of pathological changes in PD. Intestinal inflammation and alterations in the gut microbiota may contribute to initiation and progression of pathology in PD. However, the mechanisms underlying this ""gut-brain"" axis in PD remain unclear. PD patients can display a large variety of gastrointestinal symptoms, leading to reduced quality of life and psychological distress. Gastrointestinal disorders can also limit patients' response to medications, and consequently negatively impact on neurological outcomes. Despite an increasing research focus, gastrointestinal disorders in PD remain poorly understood and their clinical management often suboptimal. This review summarises our understanding of the relevance of the ""gut-brain"" axis to the pathogenesis of PD, discusses the impact of gastrointestinal disorders in patients with PD, and provides clinicians with practical guidance to their management.",Annals of medicine,2021,Elisa Menozzi; Jane Macnaughtan; Anthony H V Schapira
33459114,Role of gut microbiota in regulating gastrointestinal dysfunction and motor symptoms in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized primarily by motor and non-motor gastrointestinal (GI) deficits. GI symptoms' including compromised intestinal barrier function often accompanies altered gut microbiota composition and motor deficits in PD. Therefore, in this study, we set to investigate the role of gut microbiota and epithelial barrier dysfunction on motor symptom generation using a rotenone-induced mouse model of PD. We found that while six weeks of 10 mg/kg of chronic rotenone administration by oral gavage resulted in loss of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) neurons in both germ-free (GF) and conventionally raised (CR) mice, the decrease in motor strength and coordination was observed only in CR mice. Chronic rotenone treatment did not disrupt intestinal permeability in GF mice but resulted in a significant change in gut microbiota composition and an increase in intestinal permeability in CR mice. These results highlight the potential role of gut microbiota in regulating barrier dysfunction and motor deficits in PD.",Gut microbes,2021,Yogesh Bhattarai; Jie Si; Meng Pu; Owen A Ross; Pamela J McLean; Lisa Till; William Moor; Madhusudan Grover; Karunya K Kandimalla; Kara G Margolis; Gianrico Farrugia; Purna C Kashyap

Several interesting studies show a relationship between the gut microbiota and Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer disease, neuromyelitis optica, and multiple sclerosis, whereas other controversial studies implicate it in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Many of these studies place considerable emphasis on modulation of inflammation, particularly by bacteria capable of producing short-chain fatty acids.

34274348,Interactions between the microbiota and enteric nervous system during gut-brain disorders.,"For the last 20 years, researchers have focused their intention on the impact of gut microbiota in healthy and pathological conditions. This year (2021), more than 25,000 articles can be retrieved from PubMed with the keywords ""gut microbiota and physiology"", showing the constant progress and impact of gut microbes in scientific life. As a result, numerous therapeutic perspectives have been proposed to modulate the gut microbiota composition and/or bioactive factors released from microbes to restore our body functions. Currently, the gut is considered a primary site for the development of pathologies that modify brain functions such as neurodegenerative (Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, etc.) and metabolic (type 2 diabetes, obesity, etc.) disorders. Deciphering the mode of interaction between microbiota and the brain is a real original option to prevent (and maybe treat in the future) the establishment of gut-brain pathologies. The objective of this review is to describe recent scientific elements that explore the communication between gut microbiota and the brain by focusing our interest on the enteric nervous system (ENS) as an intermediate partner. The ENS, which is known as the ""second brain"", could be under the direct or indirect influence of the gut microbiota and its released factors (short-chain fatty acids, neurotransmitters, gaseous factors, etc.). Thus, in addition to their actions on tissue (adipose tissue, liver, brain, etc.), microbes can have an impact on local ENS activity. This potential modification of ENS function has global repercussions in the whole body via the gut-brain axis and represents a new therapeutic strategy.

33573273,Bile Acids and Microbiota: Multifaceted and Versatile Regulators of the Liver-Gut Axis.,"After their synthesis from cholesterol in hepatic tissues, bile acids (BAs) are secreted into the intestinal lumen. Most BAs are subsequently re-absorbed in the terminal ileum and are transported back for recycling to the liver. Some of them, however, reach the colon and change their physicochemical properties upon modification by gut bacteria, and vice versa, BAs also shape the composition and function of the intestinal microbiota. This mutual interplay of both BAs and gut microbiota regulates many physiological processes, including the lipid, carbohydrate and energy metabolism of the host. Emerging evidence also implies an important role of this enterohepatic BA circuit in shaping mucosal colonization resistance as well as local and distant immune responses, tissue physiology and carcinogenesis. Subsequently, disrupted interactions of gut bacteria and BAs are associated with many disorders as diverse as <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> or <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium infection, inflammatory bowel disease, type 1 diabetes, asthma, metabolic syndrome, obesity, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and epilepsy. As we cannot address all of these interesting underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms here, we summarize the current knowledge about the physiologic and pathogenic interplay of local site microbiota and the enterohepatic BA metabolism using a few selected examples of liver and gut diseases.",International journal of molecular sciences,2021,Niklas GrÃ¼ner; Jochen Mattner

In this review, we focused on the nervous system and aimed to summarize the findings regarding <i>H. pylori</i> infection and its involvement in the induction/progression of neurological disorders. Neurological impairments induced by <i>H. pylori</i> infection are primarily due to impairments in the gut-brain axis (GBA) and to an altered gut microbiota facilitated by <i>H. pylori</i> colonization.

34370175,Gut brain axis: an insight into microbiota role in Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common progressive neurodegenerative diseases. It is characterized neuropathologically by the presence of alpha-synuclein containing Lewy Bodies in the substantia nigra of the brain with loss of dopaminergic neurons in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra. The presence of alpha-synuclein aggregates in the substantia nigra and the enteric nervous system (ENS) drew attention to the possibility of a correlation between the gut microbiota and Parkinson's disease. The gut-brain axis is a two-way communication system, which explains how through the vagus nerve, the gut microbiota can affect the central nervous system (CNS), including brain functions related to the ENS, as well as how CNS can alter various gut secretions and immune responses. As a result, this dysbiosis or alteration in gut microbiota can be an early sign of PD with reported changes in short chain fatty acids, bile acids, and lipids. This gave rise to the use of probiotics and faecal microbiota transplantation as alternative approaches to improve the symptoms of patients with PD. The aim of this review is to discuss investigations that have been done to explore the gastrointestinal involvement in Parkinson's disease, the effect of dysbiosis, and potential therapeutic strategies for PD.",Metabolic brain disease,2021,Sara Ayman Moustafa; Shrouk Mohamed; Abdelhameed Dawood; Jihan Azar; Ekramy Elmorsy; Noura A M Rizk; Mohamed Salama

The presented study aimed to compare gastrointestinal microbiota composition between patients diagnosed with PD and treated only with Levodopa to healthy controls. In this prospective study, patients were recruited in 1 academic hospital from July 2019 to July 2020. The detailed demographic data and medical history were collected using a set of questionnaires. Fecal samples were obtained from all participants. Next-Generation Sequencing was used to assess the microbiota composition. The endpoint was the difference in composition of the gut microbiota. In this study, we enrolled 27 hospitalized PD patients with well-controlled symptoms. The control group included 44 healthy subjects matched for age. Among PD patients, our results presented a higher abundance of <i>Bacteroides</i> phylum, class <i>Corynebacteria</i> among phylum <i>Actinobacteria</i>, class <i>Deltaproteobacteria</i> among phylum <i>Proteobacteria</i>, and genera such as <i>Butyricimonas, Robinsoniella</i>, and <i>Flavonifractor</i>. The species <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i>, <i>Eubacterium biforme</i>, and <i>Parabacteroides merdae</i> were identified as more common in the gut microbiota of PD patients.

34829694,Probiotic Enhancement of Antioxidant Capacity and Alterations of Gut Microbiota Composition in 6-Hydroxydopamin-Induced Parkinson's Disease Rats.,"Oxidative stress plays a key role in the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD), which may be aggravated by concomitant PD-associated gut dysbiosis. Probiotics and prebiotics are therapeutically relevant to these conditions due to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and gut microbiome modulation properties. However, the mechanisms by which probiotic/prebiotic supplementation affects antioxidant capacity and the gut microbiome in PD remains poorly characterized. In this study, we assessed the effects of a <i>Lactobacillus salivarius</i> AP-32 probiotic, a prebiotic (dried AP-32 culture medium supernatant), and a probiotic/prebiotic cocktail in rats with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced PD. The neuroprotective effects and levels of oxidative stress were evaluated after eight weeks of daily supplementation. Fecal microbiota composition was analyzed by fecal 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The supplements were associated with direct increases in host antioxidant enzyme activities and short-chain fatty acid production, protected dopaminergic neurons, and improved motor functions. The supplements also altered the fecal microbiota composition, and some specifically enriched commensal taxa correlated positively with superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase activity, indicating supplementation also promotes antioxidant activity via an indirect pathway. Therefore, <i>L. salivarius</i> AP-32 supplementation enhanced the activity of host antioxidant enzymes via direct and indirect modes of action in rats with 6-OHDA-induced PD.","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2021,Shu-Ping Tsao; Bira Arumndari Nurrahma; Ravi Kumar; Chieh-Hsi Wu; Tu-Hsueh Yeh; Ching-Chi Chiu; Yen-Peng Lee; Yi-Chi Liao; Cheng-Hsieh Huang; Yao-Tsung Yeh; Hui-Yu Huang

34358037,Modulation of Neuroinflammation by the Gut Microbiota in Prion and Prion-Like Diseases.,"The process of neuroinflammation contributes to the pathogenic mechanism of many neurodegenerative diseases. The deleterious attributes of neuroinflammation involve aberrant and uncontrolled activation of glia, which can result in damage to proximal brain parenchyma. Failure to distinguish self from non-self, as well as leukocyte reaction to aggregation and accumulation of proteins in the CNS, are the primary mechanisms by which neuroinflammation is initiated. While processes local to the CNS may instigate neurodegenerative disease, the existence or dysregulation of systemic homeostasis can also serve to improve or worsen CNS pathologies, respectively. One fundamental component of systemic homeostasis is the gut microbiota, which communicates with the CNS via microbial metabolite production, the peripheral nervous system, and regulation of tryptophan metabolism. Over the past 10-15 years, research focused on the microbiota-gut-brain axis has culminated in the discovery that dysbiosis, or an imbalance between commensal and pathogenic gut bacteria, can promote CNS pathologies. Conversely, a properly regulated and well-balanced microbiome supports CNS homeostasis and reduces the incidence and extent of pathogenic neuroinflammation. This review will discuss the role of the gut microbiota in exacerbating or alleviating neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases, and potential microbiota-based therapeutic approaches to reduce pathology in diseased states.","Pathogens (Basel, Switzerland)",2021,Josephine Trichka; Wen-Quan Zou

33428888,Gut microbiota-derived vitamins - underrated powers of a multipotent ally in psychiatric health and disease.,"Despite the well-established roles of B-vitamins and their deficiencies in health and disease, there is growing evidence indicating a key role of those nutrients in functions of the central nervous system and in psychopathology. Clinical data indicate the substantial role of B-vitamins in various psychiatric disorders, including major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, autism, and dementia, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. As enzymatic cofactors, B-vitamins are involved in many physiological processes such as the metabolism of glucose, fatty acids and amino acids, metabolism of tryptophan in the kynurenine pathway, homocysteine metabolism, synthesis and metabolism of various neurotransmitters and neurohormones including serotonin, dopamine, adrenaline, acetylcholine, GABA, glutamate, D-serine, glycine, histamine and melatonin. Those vitamins are highly involved in brain energetic metabolism and respiration at the cellular level. They have a broad range of anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antioxidant and neuroprotective properties. Furthermore, some of those vitamins are involved in the regulation of permeability of the intestinal and blood-brain barriers. Despite the fact that a substantial amount of the above vitamins is acquired from various dietary sources, deficiencies are not uncommon, and it is estimated that micronutrient deficiencies affect about two billion people worldwide. The majority of gut-resident microbes and the broad range of bacteria available in fermented food, express genetic machinery enabling the synthesis and metabolism of B-vitamins and, consequently, intestinal microbiota and fermented food rich in probiotic bacteria are essential sources of B-vitamins for humans.

33406628,Gut Microbiota Dysbiosis Is Associated with Elevated Bile Acids in Parkinson's Disease.,"The gut microbiome can impact brain health and is altered in Parkinson's disease (PD). The vermiform appendix is a lymphoid tissue in the cecum implicated in the storage and regulation of the gut microbiota. We sought to determine whether the appendix microbiome is altered in PD and to analyze the biological consequences of the microbial alterations. We investigated the changes in the functional microbiota in the appendix of PD patients relative to controls (<i>n</i> = 12 PD, 16 C) by metatranscriptomic analysis. We found microbial dysbiosis affecting lipid metabolism, including an upregulation of bacteria responsible for secondary bile acid synthesis. We then quantitatively measure changes in bile acid abundance in PD relative to the controls in the appendix (<i>n</i> = 15 PD, 12 C) and ileum (<i>n</i> = 20 PD, 20 C). Bile acid analysis in the PD appendix reveals an increase in hydrophobic and secondary bile acids, deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA). Further proteomic and transcriptomic analysis in the appendix and ileum corroborated these findings, highlighting changes in the PD gut that are consistent with a disruption in bile acid control, including alterations in mediators of cholesterol homeostasis and lipid metabolism. Microbially derived toxic bile acids are heightened in PD, which suggests biliary abnormalities may play a role in PD pathogenesis.",Metabolites,2021,Peipei Li; Bryan A Killinger; Elizabeth Ensink; Ian Beddows; Ali Yilmaz; Noah Lubben; Jared Lamp; Meghan Schilthuis; Irving E Vega; Randy Woltjer; J Andrew Pospisilik; Patrik Brundin; Lena Brundin; Stewart F Graham; Viviane Labrie
34737076,Environmental neurotoxicants and inflammasome activation in Parkinson's disease - A focus on the gut-brain axis.,"Inflammasomes are multi-protein complexes expressed in immune cells that function as intracellular sensors of environmental, metabolic and cellular stress. Inflammasome activation in the brain, has been shown to drive neuropathology and disease progression by multiple mechanisms, making it one of the most attractive therapeutic targets for disease modification in Parkinson's Disease (PD). Extensive inflammasome activation is evident in the brains of people with PD at the sites of dopaminergic degeneration and synuclein aggregation. While substantial progress has been made on validating inflammasome activation as a therapeutic target for PD, the mechanisms by which inflammasome activation is triggered and sustained over the disease course remain poorly understood. A growing body of evidence point to environmental and occupational chemical exposures as possible triggers of inflammasome activation in PD. The involvement of the gastrointestinal system and gut microbiota in PD pathophysiology is beginning to be elucidated, especially the profound link between gut dysbiosis and immune activation. While large cohort studies confirmed specific changes in the gut microbiota in PD patients compared to age-matched healthy controls, recent research suggest that synuclein pathology could be initiated in the gastrointestinal tract. In this review, we present a summarized perspective on current understanding on inflammasome activation and the gut-brain-axis link during PD pathophysiology.

34737076,Environmental neurotoxicants and inflammasome activation in Parkinson's disease - A focus on the gut-brain axis.,"Inflammasomes are multi-protein complexes expressed in immune cells that function as intracellular sensors of environmental, metabolic and cellular stress. Inflammasome activation in the brain, has been shown to drive neuropathology and disease progression by multiple mechanisms, making it one of the most attractive therapeutic targets for disease modification in Parkinson's Disease (PD). Extensive inflammasome activation is evident in the brains of people with PD at the sites of dopaminergic degeneration and synuclein aggregation. While substantial progress has been made on validating inflammasome activation as a therapeutic target for PD, the mechanisms by which inflammasome activation is triggered and sustained over the disease course remain poorly understood. A growing body of evidence point to environmental and occupational chemical exposures as possible triggers of inflammasome activation in PD. The involvement of the gastrointestinal system and gut microbiota in PD pathophysiology is beginning to be elucidated, especially the profound link between gut dysbiosis and immune activation. While large cohort studies confirmed specific changes in the gut microbiota in PD patients compared to age-matched healthy controls, recent research suggest that synuclein pathology could be initiated in the gastrointestinal tract.

34512244,What Is Our Understanding of the Influence of Gut Microbiota on the Pathophysiology of Parkinson's Disease?,"Microbiota have increasingly become implicated in predisposition to human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Traditionally, a central nervous system (CNS)-centric approach to understanding PD has predominated; however, an association of the gut with PD has existed since Parkinson himself reported the disease. The gut-brain axis refers to the bidirectional communication between the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and the brain. Gut microbiota dysbiosis, reported in PD patients, may extend this to a microbiota-gut-brain axis. To date, mainly the bacteriome has been investigated. The change in abundance of bacterial products which accompanies dysbiosis is hypothesised to influence PD pathophysiology <i>via</i> multiple mechanisms which broadly centre on inflammation, a cause of alpha-synuclein (a-syn) misfolding. Two main routes are hypothesised by which gut microbiota can influence PD pathophysiology, the neural and humoral routes. The neural route involves a-syn misfolding peripherally in the enteric nerves which can then be transported to the brain <i>via</i> the vagus nerve. The humoral route involves transportation of bacterial products and proinflammatory cytokines from the gut <i>via</i> the circulation which can cause central a-syn misfolding by inducing neuroinflammation. This article will assess whether the current literature supports gut bacteria influencing PD pathophysiology <i>via</i> both routes.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2021,Amaryllis E Hill; Richard Wade-Martins; Philip W J Burnet
34094829,"Gut microbiota mediates the absorption of FLZ, a new drug for Parkinson's disease treatment.","The gut microbiota plays an important role in regulating the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of many drugs. FLZ, a novel squamosamide derivative, has been shown to have neuroprotective effects on experimental Parkinson's disease (PD) models. FLZ is under phase â  clinical trial now, while the underlying mechanisms contributing to the absorption of FLZ are still not fully elucidated. Due to the main metabolite of FLZ was abundant in feces but rare in urine and bile of mice, we focused on the gut microbiota to address how FLZ was metabolized and absorbed. <i>InÂ vitro</i> studies revealed that FLZ could be exclusively metabolized to its major metabolite M1 by the lanosterol 14 alpha-demethylase (CYP51) in the gut microbiota, but was almost not metabolized by any other metabolism-related organs, such as liver, kidney, and small intestine. M1 was quickly absorbed into the blood and then remethylated to FLZ by catechol <i>O</i>-methyltransferase (COMT). Notably, dysbacteriosis reduced the therapeutic efficacy of FLZ on the PD mouse model by inhibiting its absorption. The results show that the gut microbiota mediate the absorption of FLZ through a FLZ-M1-FLZ circulation. Our research elucidates the vital role of the gut microbiota in the absorption of FLZ and provides a theoretical basis for clinical pharmacokinetic studies and clinical application of FLZ in the treatment of PD.",Acta pharmaceutica Sinica.

34977556,Influence of probiotic bacteria on gut microbiota composition and gut wall function in an <i>in-vitro</i> model in patients with Parkinson's disease.,"We report here the potential role of a 4-strain probiotic suspension for use with patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Stool samples from a group of three patients with diagnosed PD were used to create microbiotas in an <i>in-vitro</i> gut model. The effects of dosing with an oral probiotic suspension (Symprove) on bacterial composition and metabolic activity in the microbiotas was evaluated over 48Â h and compared with healthy controls. Additionally, the effect of probiotic dosing on epithelial tight-junction integrity, production of inflammatory markers and wound healing were evaluated in cell culture models. In general, the relative proportions of the main bacterial phyla in the microbiotas of PD patients differed from those of healthy subjects, with levels of <i>Firmicutes</i> raised and levels of <i>Bacteroidetes</i> reduced. Dosing with probiotic resulted in a change in bacterial composition in the microbiotas over a 48Â h period. Several other indicators of gut health changed upon dosing with the probiotic; production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and lactate was stimulated, levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-10) increased and levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (MCP-1 and IL-8) decreased. Tight junction integrity was seen to improve with probiotic dosing and wound healing was seen to occur faster than a control. The data suggest that if development and/or progression of PD is influenced by gut microbiota dysbiosis then supplementation of the diet with a properly formulated probiotic may be a useful adjunct to standard treatment in clinic.",International journal of pharmaceutics: X,2021,Jonas Ghyselinck; Lynn Verstrepen; FrÃ©dÃ©ric Moens; Pieter Van Den Abbeele; Arnout Bruggeman; Jawal Said; Barry Smith; Lynne Ann Barker; Caroline Jordan; Valentina Leta; K Ray Chaudhuri; Abdul W Basit; Simon Gaisford
35111696,Gut Microbiota: A Key Regulator in the Effects of Environmental Hazards on Modulates Insulin Resistance.,"Insulin resistance is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), type II diabetes (T2D), and Parkinson's disease (PD). Emerging evidence indicates that these disorders are typically characterized by alterations in the gut microbiota composition, diversity, and their metabolites. Currently, it is understood that environmental hazards including ionizing radiation, toxic heavy metals, pesticides, particle matter, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are capable of interacting with gut microbiota and have a non-beneficial health effect. Based on the current study, we propose the hypothesis of ""gut microenvironment baseline drift"". According to this ""baseline drift"" theory, gut microbiota is a temporarily combined cluster of species sharing the same environmental stresses for a short period, which would change quickly under the influence of different environmental factors. This indicates that the microbial species in the gut do not have a long-term relationship; any split, division, or recombination may occur in different environments. Nonetheless, the ""baseline drift"" theory considers the critical role of the response of the whole gut microbiome. Undoubtedly, this hypothesis implies that the gut microbiota response is not merely a ""cross junction"" switch; in contrast, the human health or disease is a result of a rich palette of gut-microbiota-driven multiple-pathway responses. In summary, environmental factors, including hazardous and normal factors, are critical to the biological impact of the gut microbiota responses and the dual effect of the gut microbiota on the regulation of biological functions. Novel appreciation of the role of gut microbiota and environmental hazards in the insulin resistance would shed new light on insulin resistance and also promote the development of new research direction and new overcoming strategies for patients.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2021,Ruixue Huang

33804226,New Avenues for Parkinson's Disease Therapeutics: Disease-Modifying Strategies Based on the Gut Microbiota.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder that currently affects 1% of the population over the age of 60 years, and for which no disease-modifying treatments exist. Neurodegeneration and neuropathology in different brain areas are manifested as both motor and non-motor symptoms in patients. Recent interest in the gut-brain axis has led to increasing research into the gut microbiota changes in PD patients and their impact on disease pathophysiology. As evidence is piling up on the effects of gut microbiota in disease development and progression, another front of action has opened up in relation to the potential usage of microbiota-based therapeutic strategies in treating gastrointestinal alterations and possibly also motor symptoms in PD. This review provides status on the different strategies that are in the front line (i.e., antibiotics; probiotics; prebiotics; synbiotics; dietary interventions; fecal microbiota transplantation, live biotherapeutic products), and discusses the opportunities and challenges the field of microbiome research in PD is facing.",Biomolecules,2021,Marina Lorente-PicÃ³n; Ariadna Laguna
33857347,Bacterial Extracellular Vesicles and the Gut-Microbiota Brain Axis: Emerging Roles in Communication and Potential as Therapeutics.,"Bacterial extracellular vesicles (BEVs) have emerged as candidate signaling vectors for long-distance interkingdom communication within the gut-microbiota brain axis. Most bacteria release these nanosized vesicles, capable of signaling to the brain via their abundant protein and small RNA cargo, possibly directly via crossing the blood-brain barrier. BEVs have been shown to regulate brain gene expression and induce pathology at most stages of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, and thus they may play a causal role in diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and depression/anxiety. On the other hand, BEVs have intrinsic therapeutic properties that may be relevant to probiotic therapy and can also be engineered to function as drug delivery vehicles and vaccines. Thus, BEVs may be both a cause of and solution to neuropathological conditions. In this review, current knowledge of the physiological roles of BEVs as well as state of the art pertaining to the development of therapeutic BEVs in the context of the microbiome-gut-brain axis are summarized.",Advanced biology,2021,Nicholas H Pirolli; William E Bentley; Steven M Jay
33746867,Effect of Levodopa Initiation on the Gut Microbiota in Parkinson's Disease.,"<b>Background:</b> The impact of Levodopa on the gut microbiota of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients has not been sufficiently addressed. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted a longitudinal study to examine the impact of Levodopa initiation on the gut microbiota composition of 19 PD patients who had not previously been exposed to Levodopa. Patients provided two stool samples prior to and two samples 90 days after starting Levodopa. Motor impairment (MDS-UPDRS Part III), diet, and other patient characteristics were assessed. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was used to characterize the microbiota. We examined, cross-sectionally and longitudinally, the associations between Levodopa use and alpha and beta diversity and performed feature-wise, multivariate modeling to identify taxa associated longitudinally with Levodopa use and with improvement in motor function after Levodopa administration. <b>Results:</b> We did not observe significant differences in alpha or beta diversity before vs. after initiation of Levodopa. In longitudinal feature-wise analyses, at the genus level, no taxa were significantly associated with Levodopa use after false discovery rate (FDR) correction (<i>q</i> < 0.05). We observed a marginally lower relative abundance of bacteria belonging to <i>Clostridium</i> group IV in PD patients who experienced a medium or large improvement in motor impairment in response to Levodopa compared to those with a small response [Î² = -0.64 (SE: 0.18), p-trend: 0.00015 p-FDR: 0.019]. <b>Conclusions:</b> In this study, Levodopa was not associated with changes in microbiota composition in this longitudinal analysis.

34934429,Gut microbiota relieves inflammation in the substantia nigra of chronic Parkinson's disease by protecting the function of dopamine neurons.,"The composition of the intestinal flora of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) can change. However, whether reshaping the gut microbial composition can treat PD remains to be seen. The present study evaluated the effect of intestinal flora in the treatment of PD in a C57BL/6 mouse PD model induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Chronic, low-dose, MPTP-treated mice exhibited upregulated gene expression levels of TNF-Î± and IL-1Î² in the substantia nigra (SN) of the mice, and induced intestinal microbial disorders. This indicated that the chronic low-dose MPTP model could be used to evaluate the progress of early intestinal pathology and intestinal flora imbalance in PD. After transplantation of faecal bacteria to MPTP-induced PD mice, the level of inflammation in the SN of the mice was reduced, and motor dysfunction was alleviated. Notably, faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) upregulated the abundance of <i>Blautia</i> but downregulated <i>Anaerostipes</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, <i>ASF356</i> and <i>Ruminococcus</i> in the gut of PD mice. In addition, FMT reduced the activation of microglia and astrocytes in the SN and reduced the expression levels of GSK3Î², IL-1Î², inducible nitric oxide synthase and phosphorylated PTEN in the SN. Overall, the present study demonstrated that gut microbial dysfunction is associated with the pathogenesis of PD, and that FMT can protect PD mice by inhibiting neuroinflammation.",Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2022,Tian Zhang; Tan Wang; Xinxu Chen; Zhenqiang Zhao; Zhibin Chen

33763767,Unravelling the potential of gut microbiota in sustaining brain health and their current prospective towards development of neurotherapeutics.,"Increasing incidences of neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are being reported, but an insight into their pathology remains elusive. Findings have suggested that gut microbiota play a major role in regulating brain functions through the gut-brain axis. A unique bidirectional communication between gut microbiota and maintenance of brain health could play a pivotal role in regulating incidences of neurodegenerative diseases. Contrarily, the present life style with changing food habits and disturbed circadian rhythm may contribute to gut homeostatic imbalance and dysbiosis leading to progression of several neurological disorders. Therefore, dysbiosis, as a primary factor behind intestinal disorders, may also augment inflammation, intestinal and blood-brain barrier permeability through microbiota-gut-brain axis. This review primarily focuses on the gut-brain axis functions, specific gut microbial population, metabolites produced by gut microbiota, their role in regulating various metabolic processes and role of gut microbiota towards development of neurodegenerative diseases. However, several studies have reported a decrease in abundance of a specific gut microbial population and a corresponding increase in other microbial family, with few findings revealing some contradictions. Reports also showed that colonization of gut microbiota isolated from patients suffering from neurodegenerative disease leads to the development of enhance pathological outcomes in animal models. Hence, a systematic understanding of the dominant role of specific gut microbiome towards development of different neurodegenerative diseases could possibly provide novel insight into the use of probiotics and microbial transplantation as a substitute approach for treating/preventing such health maladies.",Archives of microbiology,2021,Ankita Banerjee; Lilesh Kumar Pradhan; Pradyumna Kumar Sahoo; Kautilya Kumar Jena; Nishant Ranjan Chauhan; Santosh Chauhan; Saroj Kumar Das
33337387,Does Gut Microbiota Influence the Course of Parkinson's Disease? A 3-Year Prospective Exploratory Study in de novo Patients.,"Although abnormalities in gut microbiota are hypothesized to influence the pathogenesis and clinical phenotype of Parkinson's disease (PD), prospective studies on de novo patients are lacking.To preliminarily investigate whether gut microbiota in early untreated PD may predict motor and non-motor features progression over a 3-year period.16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicons were sequenced on fecal samples of 39 de novo PD patients. Multiple confounders were taken into account, including dietary habits. Motor and non-motor symptoms were assessed using validated scales at baseline and followed-up yearly for 3 years. At last follow-up, a detailed neuropsychological assessment was additionally performed. A general linear model for repeated measurements- adjusted by dopaminergic therapy at follow-up- was used to investigate the relationship between bacterial taxa abundance at baseline (stratified by the median of distribution at baseline) and outcome variables.Twenty-five patients were included (11 refused, 2 lost at follow-up, 1 died). Lower abundance of Roseburia (Firmicutes phylum) at baseline was associated with worse evolution of motor, non-motor and cognitive functions at 3-year follow-up. Similarly, lower abundance of Ruminococcaceae and Actinobacteria at baseline was associated with faster worsening of global cognitive functions. At follow-up, frontal lobe functions were the features most robustly associated with baseline microbial abnormalities.In the present exploratory study on de novo PD, we found an association between abnormal distribution of specific bacterial taxa and the progression of motor and non-motor features over a 3-year period. This proof-of-principle study supports the design of a larger observational study aiming to determine whether these differences survive multiple-comparison correction and define microbiota-specific subgroups suitable for therapeutic targeting.",Journal of Parkinson's disease,2021,Roberto Cilia; Marco Piatti; Emanuele Cereda; Carlotta Bolliri; Serena Caronni; Valentina Ferri; Erica Cassani; Salvatore Bonvegna; Carlo Ferrarese; Anna L Zecchinelli; Michela Barichella; Gianni Pezzoli

A linear mixed model was used to assess longitudinal changes in levodopa-equivalent dose (LED) during follow-up (>2 y) in three tertile PD groups according to plasma TMAO levels. Additionally, a Cox regression analysis was performed to assess the effect of plasma TMAO levels on dementia conversion.Plasma TMAO levels of patients with PD were lower than those of healthy controls. A linear mixed model demonstrated that patients with PD and lower levels of TMAO (<4.75 Î¼mol/L; i.e., lowest tertile group) exhibited faster increases in LED over time. The Cox regression model did not reveal that plasma TMAO level was associated with the risk for dementia conversion (P = 0.488). However, when we divided patients with PD into two subgroups according to bet cutoff TMAO level to maximize the log-rank statistics, the PD group with a low plasma TMAO level (<6.92 Î¼mol/L) had a higher risk (with borderline statistical significance) for PD-dementia conversion than the group with a high TMAO level (hazard ratio: 7.565; 95% confidence interval, 1.004-57.019; P = 0.050).The results demonstrate that lower baseline plasma TMAO levels are associated with faster increases in LED and tend to increase the risk for PD-dementia conversion, suggesting the prognostic implications of TMAO in early stage PD.","Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)",2021,Seok Jong Chung; John Hoon Rim; Dajeong Ji; Sangwon Lee; Han Soo Yoo; Jin Ho Jung; KyoungWon Baik; Yonghoon Choi; Byoung Seok Ye; Young H Sohn; Mijin Yun; Sang-Guk Lee; Phil Hyu Lee

34219519,The Role of The Gut Microbiome in Parkinson's Disease.,"The gut microbiota is known to play a role in various disease states through inflammatory, immune and endocrinologic response. Parkinson's Disease is of particular interest as gastrointestinal involvement is one of the earlier features seen in this disease. This paper examines the relationship between gut microbiota and Parkinson's Disease, which has a growing body of literature. Inflammation caused by gut dysbiosis is thought to increase a-synuclein aggregation and worsen motor and neurologic symptoms of Parkinson's disease. We discuss potential treatment and supplementation to modify the microbiota. Some of these treatments require further research before recommendations can be made, such as cord blood transplant, antibiotic use, immunomodulation and fecal microbiota transplant. Other interventions, such as increasing dietary fiber, polyphenol and fermented food intake, can be made with few risks and may have some benefit for symptom relief and speed of disease progression.",Journal of geriatric psychiatry and neurology,2021,Amy Gallop; James Weagley; Saif-Ur-Rahman Paracha; George Grossberg
34032644,Gut Microbiota as a Mediator of Host Neuro-Immune Interactions: Implications in Neuroinflammatory Disorders.,"The dynamic population of microbes that reside in the gastrointestinal tract plays a pivotal role in orchestrating several aspects of host physiology and health, including but not limited to nutrient extraction and metabolism, as well as the regulation of intestinal epithelial barrier integrity. Gut microbes interact with the host in a bi-directional manner as the microbiota can support the development and education of the innate and adaptive immune systems, thereby conferring protection against pathogens and harmful stimuli while training the host to maintain a homeostatic tolerance towards commensal symbiotics. Recent advances in the field have highlighted the importance of the host-microbiota relationship in neurodevelopment and behaviour, with relevant implications for the onset and progression of brain disorders of inflammatory origin. Microbial modulation of brain function is achieved throughout complex neuro-immune-endocrine pathways of the microbiome-gut-brain axis. Changes in the composition of the gut microbiota or perturbation in microbial-derived metabolites and neuroactive compounds are sensed by the afferent branches of the sympathetic and vagal innervation and transmitted to the central nervous system, which in turn produces behavioural responses. Here, we focus on how the crosstalk between the gut microbiota and the immune system modulates the development and function of the peripheral and central nervous systems. Specific attention is afforded to the involvement of host-microbe neuroimmune interactions in the pathogenesis of neuro-psychiatric and neuroinflammatory disorders such as autism spectrum disorders, anxiety, and depression, as well as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.",Modern trends in psychiatry,2021,Valentina Caputi; Jelena Popov; Maria Cecilia Giron; Siobhain O Apos Mahony

33400024,Is Gut Dysbiosis an Epicenter of Parkinson's Disease?,"Once recognized as one of the most esoteric diseases of the central nervous system, Parkinson's disease (PD) is now deemed to be a chronic illness contributed by the central, autonomic and enteric nervous systems. Most likely, an accumulation of Î±-synuclein in the central and enteric nervous systems is the key that supports this viewpoint. Constipation, one of the non-motor hallmarks in roughly two-third of PD patients, is regulated by the composition of gut bacteria, which is assumed to set off the enteric Î±-synuclein accrual. Vagus nerve is suggested to direct the signal for Î±-synuclein over-expression and accumulation to the brain. While trillions of microorganisms reside in the intestinal tract, only one third of the proportion inhabits evenly in all individuals. Existence of an impaired gut-microbe-brain axis consonant with dysbiosis could be an epicenter of this inexplicable disorder. Any alteration in the structure and function of the gastrointestinal tract owing to exposure of endogenous or exogenous chemicals or toxicants could lead to dysbiosis. However, inconsistency in the symptoms even after exposure to same chemical or toxicant in PD patients emphatically creates a conundrum. While the level of a few specific neurotransmitters and metabolites is influenced by microbes, implication of dysbiosis is still debatable. Nevertheless, the scientific literature is overflowing with the remarkable observations supporting the role of dysbiosis in PD. Lack of specificity to differentially diagnose PD with non-PD or PD-plus syndrome, to identify highly precise drug targets and to develop therapeutic stratagems to encounter the disease on the basis of this approach, causes us to be open-minded about the dysbiosis theory. The article reviews the facts supporting gut dysbiosis as the foremost trigger for PD onset along with disagreements.",Neurochemical research,2021,Charul Rajput; Alika Sarkar; Nidhi Sachan; Neeraj Rawat; Mahendra Pratap Singh
34381040,Genetic and environmental factors in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases and promising therapeutic intervention via fecal microbiota transplantation.,"Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by neuronal impairment and loss of function, and with the major shared histopathological hallmarks of misfolding and aggregation of specific proteins inside or outside cells. Some genetic and environmental factors contribute to the promotion of the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Currently, there are no effective treatments for neurodegenerative diseases. It has been revealed that bidirectional communication exists between the brain and the gut. The gut microbiota is a changeable and experience-dependent ecosystem and can be modified by genetic and environmental factors. The gut microbiota provides potential therapeutic targets that can be regulated as new interventions for neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we discuss genetic and environmental risk factors for neurodegenerative diseases, summarize the communication among the components of the microbiota-gut-brain axis, and discuss the treatment strategy of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). FMT is a promising treatment for neurodegenerative diseases, and restoration of the gut microbiota to a premorbid state is a novel goal for prevention and treatment strategies.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2021,Hui Wang; Feng Yang; Shidong Zhang; Ruihua Xin; Yan Sun
33262001,Molecular imaging of microbiota-gut-brain axis: searching for the right targeted probe for the right target and disease.,"The highly bidirectional dialogue between the gut and the brain is markedly stimulated and influenced by the microbiome through integrated neuroendocrine, neurological and immunological processes. Gut microbiota itself communicate with the host producing hormonal intermediates, metabolites, proteins, and toxins responsible for a variety of biochemical and functional inputs, thereby shaping host homeostasis. Indeed, a dysregulated microbiota-gut-brain axis might be the origin of many neuroimmune-mediated disorders, e.g. autism, multiple sclerosis, depression, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, which appear months or even years prior to a diagnosis, corroborating the theory that the pathological process is spread from the gut to the brain. A much deeper comprehension of how commensal microbe can be manipulated to interfere with disease progression is crucial for developing new strategies to diagnose and treat diseases. In recent years, the potential of positron-emission-tomography (PET) in the field of bacteria detection has gained attention. The uptake of several PET tracers has been evaluated to investigate infection pathophysiology, e.g. sterile or pathogen-mediated infection, monitoring of progression, or as a surrogate endpoint in clinical trials. In this minireview, we briefly describe the role of microbiome-gut-brain axis in health and disease and we discuss the imaging modalities and agents that could be applied to study the dynamic interactions between microbiome, gut and brain.

33338469,Gut-Brain axis in Parkinson's disease etiology: The role of lipopolysaccharide.,"Recent studies highlight the initiation of Parkinson's disease (PD) in the gastrointestinal tract, decades before the manifestations in the central nervous system (CNS). This gut-brain axis of neurodegenerative diseases defines the critical role played by the unique microbial composition of the ""second brain"" formed by the enteric nervous system (ENS). Compromise in the enteric wall can result in the translocation of gut-microbiota along with their metabolites into the system that can affect the homeostatic machinery. The released metabolites can associate with protein substrates affecting several biological pathways. Among these, the bacterial endotoxin from Gram-negative bacteria, i.e., Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), has been implicated to play a definite role in progressive neurodegeneration. The molecular interaction of the lipid metabolites can have a direct neuro-modulatory effect on homeostatic protein components that can be transported to the CNS via the vagus nerve. Î±-synuclein (Î±-syn) is one such partner protein, the molecular interactions with which modulate its overall fibrillation propensity in the system. LPS interaction has been shown to affect the protein's aggregation kinetics in an alternative inflammatory pathway of PD pathogenesis. Several other lipid contents from the bacterial membranes could also be responsible for the initiation of Î±-syn amyloidogenesis. The present review will focus on the intermolecular interactions of Î±-syn with bacterial lipid components, particularly LPS, with a definite clinical manifestation in PD pathogenesis. However, deconvolution of the sequence of interaction events from the ENS to its propagation in the CNS is not easy or obvious. Nevertheless, the characterization of these lipid-mediated structures is a step towards realizing the novel targets in the pre-emptive diagnoses of PD.

33549028,A narrative review of relationship between gut microbiota and neuropsychiatric disorders: mechanisms and clinical application of probiotics and prebiotics.,"The gut microbiota is a kind of fixed-value bacteria in the human intestine, characterized by a large quantity, a wide variety and interdependence with each other and with the host. The gut microbiota is considered to be an important link in maintaining health and pathogenic mechanism of many diseases. The gut microbiota affects the central nervous system under the action of the microbe-gut-brain axis through nerve, immune, endocrine and metabolic pathways. The gut microbiota not only regulates the gastrointestinal tract but plays a vital role in the development and function of the brain. More and more studies believe that normal gut microbiota is essential for the development of the central nervous system and emotional regulation. The imbalance of the gut microbiota can affect some neuropsychiatric diseases. Probiotics and prebiotics are active microorganisms beneficial to the human body and can regulate the microecological balance of the human intestinal tract. Current research shows that probiotics and prebiotics have a good preventive effect on Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, depression, autism spectrum disorders and other neurological and mental diseases. Based on this, we review the relevant research on the pathogenesis of probiotics and prebiotics and neuropsychiatric diseases, in an attempt to providing new ideas for exploring the treatment and prevention of neuropsychiatric diseases.",Annals of palliative medicine,2021,Huan Yang; Yuqing Liu; Rui Cai; Ying Li; Bing Gu

34346706,Gut Microbiome and Serum Metabolome Alterations Associated with Isolated Dystonia.,"Dystonia is a complex neurological movement disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions. Increasing studies implicate the microbiome as a possible key susceptibility factor for neurological disorders, but the relationship between the gut microbiota and dystonia remains poorly explored. Here, the gut microbiota of 57 patients with isolated dystonia and 27 age- and environment-matched healthy controls was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Further, integrative analysis of the gut microbiome and serum metabolome measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was performed. No difference in Î±-diversity was found, while Î²-diversity was significantly different, with a more heterogeneous community structure among dystonia patients than among controls. The most significant changes in dystonia highlighted an increase in <i>Clostridiales</i>, including Blautia obeum, Dorea longicatena, and Eubacterium hallii, and a reduction in Bacteroides vulgatus and Bacteroides plebeius. The functional analysis revealed that genes related to tryptophan and purine biosynthesis were more abundant in gut microbiota from patients with dystonia, while genes linked to citrate cycle, vitamin B<sub>6</sub>, and glycan metabolism were less abundant. The evaluation of serum metabolites revealed altered levels of l-glutamic acid, taurine, and d-tyrosine, suggesting changes in neurotransmitter metabolism. The most modified metabolites strongly inversely correlated with the abundance of members belonging to the <i>Clostridiales</i>, revealing the effect of the gut microbiota on neurometabolic activity. This study is the first to reveal gut microbial dysbiosis in patients with isolated dystonia and identified potential links between gut microbiota and serum neurotransmitters, providing new insight into the pathogenesis of isolated dystonia. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Dystonia is the third most common movement disorder after essential tremor and Parkinson's disease. However, the cause for the majority of cases is not known. This is the first study so far that reveals significant alterations of gut microbiome and correlates the alteration of serum metabolites with gut dysbiosis in patients with isolated dystonia. We demonstrated a general overrepresentation of <i>Clostridiales</i> and underrepresentation of <i>Bacteroidetes</i> in patients with dystonia in comparison with healthy controls. The functional analysis found that genes related to the biosynthesis of tryptophan, which is the precursor of the neurotransmitter serotonin, were more active in isolated dystonia patients. Altered levels of several serum metabolites were found to be associated with microbial changes, such as d-tyrosine, taurine, and glutamate, indicating differences in neurotransmitter metabolism in isolated dystonia. Integrative analysis suggests that neurotransmitter system dysfunction may be a possible pathway by which the gut microbiome participates in the development of dystonia. The gut microbiome changes provide new insight into the pathogenesis of dystonia, suggesting new potential therapeutic directions.",mSphere,2021,Lingyan Ma; Jing Keng; Min Cheng; Hua Pan; Bo Feng; Yongfeng Hu; Tao Feng; Fan Yang
33470765,The gut microbiota metabolite propionate ameliorates intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction-mediated Parkinson's disease via the AKT signaling pathway.,"Parkinson's disease is a common neurodegenerative disease. Here, we investigated the protective effect and potential mechanisms of propionate on the intestinal epithelial barrier in mice with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced Parkinson's disease.Gas chromatography was used to determine short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) concentrations in the fecal samples of Parkinson's disease patients and healthy controls. The stepping test was used to analyze forelimb akinesia, whisker test was used to analyze sensorimotor injury, cylinder test was used to analyze sensorimotor function, and Western blotting was used to analyze protein expression.The concentrations of SCFAs, including acetate, butyrate and propionate, were significantly downregulated in the fecal samples of Parkinson's disease patients, and among the SCFAs, propionate decreased the most. Propionate administration improved the stepping test score, whisker test score and cylinder test score of MPTP-induced Parkinson's disease mice. Additionally, propionate administration increased the protein expression of zonula occludens-1 and occludin. Moreover, the effects of propionate on motor behavior and the intestinal epithelial barrier were dependent on the proteirrserinc-threonine kinases (AKT) signaling pathway. More importantly, treatment with SC79, a specific AKT agonist, abolished the effects of propionate on the intestinal epithelial barrier and motor behavior.Our results demonstrated that propionate, which was decreased in the fecal samples of Parkinson's disease patients, exerted beneficial effects on intestinal epithelial barrier function and improved motor behavior in MPTP-induced Parkinson's disease mice through the AKT signaling pathway.",Neuroreport,2021,Tingting Huang; Hongjuan Shi; Yuanfeng Xu; Lili Ji

34495955,Gut microbiota alterations in response to sleep length among African-origin adults.,"Sleep disorders are increasingly being characterized in modern society as contributing to a host of serious medical problems, including obesity and metabolic syndrome. Changes to the microbial community in the human gut have been reportedly associated with many of these cardiometabolic outcomes. In this study, we investigated the impact of sleep length on the gut microbiota in a large cohort of 655 participants of African descent, aged 25-45, from Ghana, South Africa (SA), Jamaica, and the United States (US). The sleep duration was self-reported via a questionnaire. Participants were classified into 3 sleep groups: short (<7hrs), normal (7-<9hrs), and long (â¥9hrs). Forty-seven percent of US participants were classified as short sleepers and 88% of SA participants as long sleepers. Gut microbial composition analysis (16S rRNA gene sequencing) revealed that bacterial alpha diversity negatively correlated with sleep length (p<0.05). Furthermore, sleep length significantly contributed to the inter-individual beta diversity dissimilarity in gut microbial composition (p<0.01). Participants with both short and long-sleep durations exhibited significantly higher abundances of several taxonomic features, compared to normal sleep duration participants. The predicted relative proportion of two genes involved in the butyrate synthesis via lysine pathway were enriched in short sleep duration participants. Finally, co-occurrence relationships revealed by network analysis showed unique interactions among the short, normal and long duration sleepers. These results suggest that sleep length in humans may alter gut microbiota by driving population shifts of the whole microbiota and also specific changes in Exact Sequence Variants abundance, which may have implications for chronic inflammation associated diseases. The current findings suggest a possible relationship between disrupted sleep patterns and the composition of the gut microbiota. Prospective investigations in larger and more prolonged sleep researches and causally experimental studies are needed to confirm these findings, investigate the underlying mechanism and determine whether improving microbial homeostasis may buffer against sleep-related health decline in humans.",PloS one,2021,Na Fei; Candice Choo-Kang; Sirimon Reutrakul; Stephanie J Crowley; Dale Rae; Kweku Bedu-Addo; Jacob Plange-Rhule; Terrence E Forrester; Estelle V Lambert; Pascal Bovet; Walter Riesen; Wolfgang Korte; Amy Luke; Brian T Layden; Jack A Gilbert; Lara R Dugas
34974121,Gut microbiota modulation by prednisolone in a rat kindling model of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizure.,"The gut microbiota is a complex community composed by several microorganisms that interact in the maintenance of homeostasis and contribute to physiological processes, including brain function. The relationship of the taxonomic composition of the gut microbiota with neurological diseases such as autism, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, anxiety, and depression is widely recognized. The immune system is an important intermediary between the gut microbiota and the central nervous system, being one of the communication routes of the gut-brain axis. Although the complexity of the relationship between inflammation and epilepsy has not yet been elucidated, inflammatory processes are similar in many ways to the consequences of dysbiosis and contribute to disease progression. This study aimed to analyze the taxonomic composition of the gut microbiota of rats treated with prednisolone in a kindling model of epilepsy.

34560239,Regulation of neurotoxicity in the striatum and colon of MPTP-induced Parkinson's disease mice by gut microbiome.,"Increasing evidence suggests the role of gut-microbiota-brain axis in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). The objective of this study was to examine whether repeated administration of MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) can influence the neurotoxicity in the striatum and colon, and the composition of gut microbiota and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in feces of adult mice. MPTP caused the reduction of dopamine transporter (DAT) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the striatum, and increases in phosphorylated Î±-synuclein (p-Î±-Syn) in the striatum and colon. There was a negative correlation between the expression of TH in the striatum and the expression of p-Î±-Syn in the colon, suggesting a role of gut-brain communication. MPTP caused abnormalities in the Î±- and Î²-diversity of gut microbiota in the mice. Furthermore, the relative abundance of the genus Faecalicatena in the MPTP-treated group was significantly lower than that of control group.

34560239,Regulation of neurotoxicity in the striatum and colon of MPTP-induced Parkinson's disease mice by gut microbiome.,"Increasing evidence suggests the role of gut-microbiota-brain axis in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). The objective of this study was to examine whether repeated administration of MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) can influence the neurotoxicity in the striatum and colon, and the composition of gut microbiota and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in feces of adult mice. MPTP caused the reduction of dopamine transporter (DAT) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the striatum, and increases in phosphorylated Î±-synuclein (p-Î±-Syn) in the striatum and colon. There was a negative correlation between the expression of TH in the striatum and the expression of p-Î±-Syn in the colon, suggesting a role of gut-brain communication. MPTP caused abnormalities in the Î±- and Î²-diversity of gut microbiota in the mice. Furthermore, the relative abundance of the genus Faecalicatena in the MPTP-treated group was significantly lower than that of control group. Interestingly, there was a positive correlation between the genus Faecalicatena and the expression of TH in the striatum. Moreover, MPTP did not alter the levels of SCFAs in feces samples. However, there was a positive correlation between the relative abundance of the genus Faecalicatena and propionic acid.

There is differential increase in evidences focusing on the bidirectional communication between the gut microbiome and the brain. It supports existence of far-reaching model of ""gut-brain axis."" This axis is attaining more adherence to fields investigating biological and physiological footing of psychiatric, neuro-developmental, age-related, and neurodegenerative disorders. Many factors can change microbiota composition in early life as well as with the increasing age. Stress can affect the microbiota-gut-brain axis at every stages of life. Recent advances have involved the gut microbiota in many conditions including severe mental illness, autism, anxiety, obesity, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. The current studies target on elaborating the underlying mechanisms of microbiota-gut-brain axis and attempt to exemplify intervention and therapeutic strategies for neuropsychiatric disorders.",Industrial psychiatry journal,2021,Markanday Sharma; Jyoti Prakash; Prateek Yadav; Kalpana Srivastava; Kaushik Chatterjee

A. muciniphila, a mucin-degrading bacterium, is a potential next-generation microbe that has anti-inflammatory properties and is responsible for keeping the body healthy. As the role of A. muciniphila in PD has become increasingly apparent, we discuss the potential link between A. muciniphila and various neurological diseases (including PD) in the current review.",Current medical science,2021,Xin Fang; Fang-Jun Li; Dao-Jun Hong
33404072,Role of pattern recognition receptors and the microbiota in neurological disorders.,"In recent years, the gut microbiota has been increasingly implicated in the development of many extraintestinal disorders, including neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Despite this growing connection, our understanding of the precise mechanisms behind these effects is currently lacking. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are important innate immune proteins expressed on the surface and within the cytoplasm of a multitude of cells, both immune and otherwise, including epithelial, endothelial and neuronal. PRRs comprise four major subfamilies: the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain leucine rich repeats-containing receptors (NLRs), the retinoic acid inducible gene 1-like receptors and the C-type lectin receptors. Recognition of commensal bacteria by PRRs is critical for maintaining host-microbe interactions and homeostasis, including behaviour. The expression of PRRs on multiple cell types makes them a highly interesting and novel target for regulation of host-microbe signalling, which may lead to gut-brain signalling. Emerging evidence indicates that two of the four known families of PRRs (the NLRs and the TLRs) are involved in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders via the gut-brain axis. Taken together, increasing evidence supports a role for these PRRs in the development of neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis, via the microbiota-gut-brain axis.",The Journal of physiology,2021,Ciara E Keogh; Kavi M Rude; MÃ©lanie G Gareau
33985520,Evaluation of fecal microbiota transplantation in Parkinson's disease patients with constipation.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder and 70-80% of PD patients suffer from gastrointestinal dysfunction such as constipation. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for treating PD related to gastrointestinal dysfunction. We conducted a prospective, single- study. Eleven patients with PD received FMT. Fecal samples were collected before and after FMT and subjected to 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) gene sequencing. Hoehn-Yahr (H-Y) grade, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score, and the Non-Motion Symptom Questionnaire (NMSS) were used to assess improvements in motor and non-motor symptoms. PAC-QOL score and Wexner constipation score were used to assess the patient's constipation symptoms. All patients were tested by the small intestine breath hydrogen test, performed before and after FMT. Community richness (chao) and microbial structure in before-FMT PD patients were significantly different from the after-FMT. We observed an increased abundance of Blautia and Prevotella in PD patients after FMT, while the abundance of Bacteroidetes decreased dramatically. After FMT, the H-Y grade, UPDRS, and NMSS of PD patients decreased significantly. Through the lactulose H2 breath test, the intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) in PD patients returned to normal. The PAC-QOL score and Wexner constipation score in after-FMT patients decreased significantly. Our study profiles specific characteristics and microbial dysbiosis in the gut of PD patients. FMT might be a therapeutic potential for reconstructing the gut microbiota of PD patients and improving their motor and non-motor symptoms.",Microbial cell factories,2021,Xiao-Yi Kuai; Xiao-Han Yao; Li-Juan Xu; Yu-Qing Zhou; Li-Ping Zhang; Yi Liu; Shao-Fang Pei; Chun-Li Zhou
33657381,Systematic analysis of gut microbiome reveals the role of bacterial folate and homocysteine metabolism in Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common progressive neurological disorder compromising motor functions. However, nonmotor symptoms, such as gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction, precede those affecting movement. Evidence of an early involvement of the GI tract and enteric nervous system highlights the need for better understanding of the role of gut microbiota in GI complications in PD. Here, we investigate the gut microbiome of patients with PD using metagenomics and serum metabolomics. We integrate these data using metabolic modeling and construct an integrative correlation network giving insight into key microbial species linked with disease severity, GI dysfunction, and age of patients with PD. Functional analysis reveals an increased microbial capability to degrade mucin and host glycans in PD. Personalized community-level metabolic modeling reveals the microbial contribution to folate deficiency and hyperhomocysteinemia observed in patients with PD. The metabolic modeling approach could be applied to uncover gut microbial metabolic contributions to PD pathophysiology.",Cell reports,2021,Dorines Rosario; Gholamreza Bidkhori; Sunjae Lee; Janis Bedarf; Falk Hildebrand; Emmanuelle Le Chatelier; Mathias Uhlen; Stanislav Dusko Ehrlich; Gordon Proctor; Ullrich WÃ¼llner; Adil Mardinoglu; Saeed Shoaie
34053222,Development of an Efficient and Sensitive Chemical Derivatization-Based LC-MS/MS Method for Quantifying Gut Microbiota-Derived Metabolites in Human Plasma and Its Application in Studying Cardiovascular Disease.,"Recently, the gut microbiota has been found to be associated with many diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, depression, Parkinson's disease, cancer, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Among various gut microbiota-derived metabolites (GMs), short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), bile acids (BAs), and tryptophan (TRP) metabolites are the most frequently discussed metabolites. LC-MS/MS shows advantages in quantifying the levels of metabolites with good sensitivity and selectivity; however, the poor ionization efficiency and polar characteristics of SCFAs make their analysis challenging, especially when analyzing plasma samples with low SCFA concentrations. Moreover, without characteristic fragment ions for unconjugated BAs and different detection ion modes for TRP metabolites and BAs, GM analysis is complex and time-consuming. To overcome these problems, we developed a derivatization method combined with LC-MS/MS to enhance the sensitivity and LC retention of GMs. Through derivatization with 3-nitrophenylhydrazine (3-NPH), 7 SCFAs, 9 bile acids, and 6 tryptophan metabolites can be simultaneously analyzed via separation within 14 min on a reversed-phase C18 column. For accurate quantification, <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-3NPH-labeled standards were used as one-to-one internal standards. This derivatization approach was optimized and then validated. We further applied this method to investigate the targeted GM profile in patients with CVD. The results showed a significant reduction in plasma butyrate levels in CVD patients compared with healthy controls, suggesting its potentially protective role in CVD. In summary, this work provides a sensitive and effective LC-MS/MS method for simultaneously quantifying gut microbiota-related metabolites in human plasma, which could benefit various future gut microbiota-related studies.",Journal of proteome research,2021,Hsin-Yu Liao; Chin-Yi Wang; Ching-Hua Lee; Hsien-Li Kao; Wei-Kai Wu; Ching-Hua Kuo

34276644,Altered Actinobacteria and Firmicutes Phylum Associated Epitopes in Patients With Parkinson's Disease.,"Recent evidence suggests that inflammation was participated in the pathogenesis of PD, thus, to understand the potential mechanism of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), we performed a metagenomic analysis of fecal samples from PD patient and controls. Using a two-stage metagenome-wide association strategy, fecal DNA samples from 69 PD patients and 244 controls in three groups (comprising 66 spouses, 97 age-matched, and 81 normal samples, respectively) were analyzed, and differences between candidate gut microbiota and microbiota-associated epitopes (MEs) were compared. In the study, 27 candidate bacterial biomarkers and twenty-eight candidate epitope peptides were significantly different between the PD patients and control groups. Further, enriched 4 and 13 MEs in PD were positively associated with abnormal inflammatory indicators [neutrophil percentage (NEUT.1), monocyte count/percentage (MONO/MONO.1), white blood cell count (WBC)] and five candidate bacterial biomarkers (c_Actinobacteria, f_Bifidobacteriaceae, <i>g_Bifidobacterium</i>, o_Bifidobacteriales, p_Actinobacteria) from Actinobacteria phylum, and they were also positively associated with histidine degradation and proline biosynthesis pathways, respectively. Additionally, enriched 2 MEs and 1 ME in PD were positively associated with above inflammatory indicators and two bacteria (f_Lactobacillaceae, <i>g_Lactobacillus</i>) from Firmicutes phylum, and they were also positively associated with pyruvate fermentation to propanoate I and negatively associated with isopropanol biosynthesis, respectively. Of these MEs, two MEs from GROEL2, RPSC were derived from <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, triggered the T cell immune response, as previously reported. Additionally, other candidate epitope peptides derived from <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> and <i>Mycobacterium leprae</i> may also have potential immune effects in PD. In all, the altered MEs in PD may relate to abnormalities in immunity and glutamate and propionate metabolism, which furthers our understanding of the pathogenesis of PD.",Frontiers in immunology,2021,Zhuo Li; Gang Lu; Zhe Li; Bin Wu; Enli Luo; Xinmin Qiu; Jianwen Guo; Zhangyong Xia; Chunye Zheng; Qiaozhen Su; Yan Zeng; Wai Yee Chan; Xianwei Su; Qiaodi Cai; Yanjuan Xu; Yingjun Chen; Mingbang Wang; Wai Sang Poon; Xiaodong Luo

33692356,Meta-analysis of the Parkinson's disease gut microbiome suggests alterations linked to intestinal inflammation.,"The gut microbiota is emerging as an important modulator of neurodegenerative diseases, and accumulating evidence has linked gut microbes to Parkinson's disease (PD) symptomatology and pathophysiology. PD is often preceded by gastrointestinal symptoms and alterations of the enteric nervous system accompany the disease. Several studies have analyzed the gut microbiome in PD, but a consensus on the features of the PD-specific microbiota is missing. Here, we conduct a meta-analysis re-analyzing the ten currently available 16S microbiome datasets to investigate whether common alterations in the gut microbiota of PD patients exist across cohorts. We found significant alterations in the PD-associated microbiome, which are robust to study-specific technical heterogeneities, although differences in microbiome structure between PD and controls are small. Enrichment of the genera Lactobacillus, Akkermansia, and Bifidobacterium and depletion of bacteria belonging to the Lachnospiraceae family and the Faecalibacterium genus, both important short-chain fatty acids producers, emerged as the most consistent PD gut microbiome alterations. This dysbiosis might result in a pro-inflammatory status which could be linked to the recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms affecting PD patients.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2021,Stefano Romano; George M Savva; Janis R Bedarf; Ian G Charles; Falk Hildebrand; Arjan Narbad
33912026,Colonic Dopaminergic Neurons Changed Reversely With Those in the Midbrain via Gut Microbiota-Mediated Autophagy in a Chronic Parkinson's Disease Mice Model.,"The role of gut-brain axis in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) have become a research hotspot, appropriate animal model to study gut-brain axis in PD is yet to be confirmed. Our study employed a classical PD mice model achieved by chronic MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) injection to study concurrent changes of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain and the colon of mice. Our results showed such a PD model exhibited apparent locomotor deficits but not gastrointestinal dysfunction. Tyrosine hydroxylase expressions and dopamine content reduced greatly in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) or striatum, but increased in the colon of PD mice. Mechanism investigation indicated autophagy activity and apoptosis were stimulated in the SNpc, but inhibited in the colon of PD mice. Interplay of gut microbiota (GM) and autophagy in response to chronic MPTP injection led to GM dysbiosis and defective autophagy in mice colon. Meanwhile, fecal short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), acetate and propionate in particular, declined greatly in PD mice, which could be attributed to the decreased bacteria abundance of phylum <i>Bacteroidetes</i>, but increased abundance of phylum <i>Firmicutes</i>. GM dysbiosis derived fecal SCFAs might be one of the mediators of downregulated autophagy in the colon of PD mice. In conclusion, colonic dopaminergic neurons changed in the opposition direction with those in the midbrain via GM dysbiosis-mediated autophagy inhibition followed by suppressed apoptosis in response to chronic MPTP injection. Such a chronic PD mice model might not be an ideal model to study role of gut-brain axis in PD progression.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2021,Xin Liu; Zhong-Rui Du; Xiong Wang; Kar-Him Luk; Cheuk-Hin Chan; Xu Cao; Qing Zhao; Fang Zhao; Wing-Tak Wong; Ka-Hing Wong; Xiao-Li Dong
33557583,Electroacupuncture may alleviate behavioral defects via modulation of gut microbiota in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease involving non-motor symptoms, of which gastrointestinal disorders are the most common. In light of recent results, intestinal dysfunction may be involved in the pathogenesis of PD. Electroacupuncture (EA) has shown potential effects, although the underlying mechanism remains mostly unknown. We speculated that EA could relieve the behavioral defects of PD, and that this effect would be associated with modulation of the gut microbiota.Mice were randomly divided into three groups: control, PDâ+âMA (manual acupuncture), and PDâ+âEA. MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) was used to establish the mouse model of PD. Rotarod performance tests, open field tests, and pole tests were carried out to assess motor deficiencies. Immunohistochemistry was conducted to examine the survival of dopaminergic neurons. 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing was applied to investigate the alterations of the gut microbiome. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to characterize the messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines.We found that EA was able to alleviate the behavioral defects in the rotarod performance test and pole test, and partially rescue the significant loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) chemically induced by MPTP in mice. Moreover, the PDâ+âMA mice showed a tendency toward decreased intestinal microbial alpha diversity, while EA significantly reversed it. The abundance of Erysipelotrichaceae was significantly increased in PDâ+âMA mice, and the alteration was also reversed by EA. In addition, the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î± were substantially increased in the SN of PDâ+âMA mice, an effect that was reversed by EA.These results suggest that EA may alleviate behavioral defects via modulation of gut microbiota and suppression of inflammation in the SN of mice with PD, which provides new insights into the pathogenesis of PD and its treatment.",Acupuncture in medicine : journal of the British Medical Acupuncture Society,2021,Qiu-Qin Han; Yi Fu; Jia-Mei Le; Adam Pilot; Si Cheng; Pei-Qing Chen; Hailong Wu; Guo-Qing Wan; Xue-Feng Gu
34569965,Drosophila as a Model for Microbiota Studies of Neurodegeneration.,"Accumulating evidence show that the gut microbiota is deeply involved not only in host nutrient metabolism but also in immune function, endocrine regulation, and chronic disease. In neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the gut-brain axis, the bidirectional interaction between the brain and the gut, provides new route of pathological spread and potential therapeutic targets. Although studies of gut microbiota have been conducted mainly in mice, mammalian gut microbiota is highly diverse, complex, and sensitive to environmental changes. Drosophila melanogaster, a fruit fly, has many advantages as a laboratory animal: short life cycle, numerous and genetically homogenous offspring, less ethical concerns, availability of many genetic models, and low maintenance costs. Drosophila has a simpler gut microbiota than mammals and can be made to remain sterile or to have standardized gut microbiota by simple established methods. Research on the microbiota of Drosophila has revealed new molecules that regulate the brain-gut axis, and it has been shown that dysbiosis of the fly microbiota worsens lifespan, motor function, and neurodegeneration in AD and PD models. The results shown in fly studies represents a fundamental part of the immune and proteomic process involving gut-microbiota interactions that are highly conserved. Even though the fly's gut microbiota are not simple mimics of humans, flies are a valuable system to learn the molecular mechanisms of how the gut microbiota affect host health and behavior.",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2021,Fukiko Kitani-Morii; Robert P Friedland; Hideki Yoshida; Toshiki Mizuno
33889128,Impact of Subthalamic Deep Brain Stimulation on Hyposmia in Patients With Parkinson's Disease Is Influenced by Constipation and Dysbiosis of Microbiota.,"<b>Background:</b> Non-motor symptoms in PD usually arise at very early stage and vary during the whole disease progression. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is considered as a highly efficient treatment option for PD's motor function. However, the effect of DBS on NMS, especially hyposmia, has not been fully understood and the deep connection between different NMS such as hyposmia and constipation is still unknown. <b>Objective:</b> The objective of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic effect of DBS on hyposmia in PD patients with or without constipation and find potential factors which might influence the efficacy. <b>Methods:</b> A retrospective analysis of 65 PD patients accepted STN-DBS operation in Qilu Hospital during 2019-2020 were conducted to evaluate the exact therapeutic effect of DBS on hyposmia in PD. Sub-group analyses about the relationship between hyposmia and constipation were carried out. Analysis of flora in nasal mucosa was also conducted to evaluate the abundance and variety in different PD groups. <b>Results:</b> Our study showed that DBS had clearly improved olfactory function in Parkinson patients (<i>P</i> = 0.012) and subgroup analysis found that PD patients with constipation have lower olfactory function scores (25.27 Â± 3.44 vs. 33.90 Â± 6.633, <i>p</i> = 0.014) and worse improvement after DBS operation (ÎTDI 12.11 Â± 3.2 vs. 8.78 Â± 2.91, <i>p</i> = 0.0072). Analysis of flora indicated the obvious discrepancy on olfactory function scores and degree of improvement might be related to the abundance and dysbiosis of microbiota. <b>Conclusion:</b> In summary, this article presents a study on PD with hyposmia and constipation after DBS operation, explored the relationship between different NMS and offer a potential explanation on why PD patients with constipation usually have worse olfactory function for the less abundance and variety of microbiota.",Frontiers in neurology,2021,Chao Li; Ying Hou; Xu Wang; Yue-Xuan Li; Feng Li; Chao Zhang; Wei-Guo Li

Epidemiological evidence supported an association between milk intake and a higher incidence of Parkinson's disease (PD), questions have been raised about prospective associations between dietary factors and the incidence of PD. Here, we investigated the significance of casein in the development of PD. The mice were given casein (6.75Â g/kg i.g.) for 21Â days after MPTP (25Â mg/kg i.p.âÃâ5Â days) treatment, the motor function, dopaminergic neurons, inflammation, gut microbiota and fecal metabolites were observed. The experimental results revealed that the mice with casein gavage after MPTP treatment showed a persisted dyskinesia, the content of dopamine in striatum and the expression of TH in midbrain and ileum were decreased, the expression of Iba-1, CD4, IL-22 in midbrain and ileum increased continuously with persisted intestinal histopathology and intestinal barrier injury. Decreased intestinal bile secretion in addition with abnormal digestion and metabolism of carbohydrate, lipids and proteins were found, whereas these pathological status for the MPTP mice without casein intake had recovered after 24Â days, no significant differences were observed with regard to only treated with casein.

34171417,The neuromicrobiology of Parkinson's disease: A unifying theory.,"Recent evidence confirms that PD is indeed a multifactorial disease with different aetiologies and prodromal symptomatology that likely depend on the initial trigger. New players with important roles as triggers, facilitators and aggravators of the PD neurodegenerative process have re-emerged in the last few years, the microbes. Having evolved in association with humans for ages, microbes and their products are now seen as fundamental regulators of human physiology with disturbances in their balance being increasingly accepted to have a relevant impact on the progression of disease in general and on PD in particular. In this review, we comprehensively address early studies that have directly or indirectly linked bacteria or other infectious agents to the onset and progression of PD, from the earliest suspects to the most recent culprits, the gut microbiota. The quest for effective treatments to arrest PD progression must inevitably address the different interactions between microbiota and human cells, and naturally consider the gut-brain axis. The comprehensive characterization of such mechanisms will help design innovative bacteriotherapeutic approaches to selectively shape the gut microbiota profile ultimately to halt PD progression. The present review describes our current understanding of the role of microorganisms and their endosymbiotic relatives, the mitochondria, in inducing, facilitating, or aggravating PD pathogenesis.",Ageing research reviews,2021,Mario F Munoz-Pinto; Nuno Empadinhas; Sandra M Cardoso

34785689,Cholecystectomy and subsequent risk of Parkinson's disease: a nationwide retrospective cohort study.,"Growing evidence has suggested that the gut-brain axis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), and that this role is mediated by the interactions between bile acids (BAs) and intestinal microbiota. Given that cholecystectomy can lead to alterations in BAs and gut microbiota, we investigated whether cholecystectomy is linked to a higher risk of PD. We constructed a cohort of patients with an operation code of cholecystectomy from 2010 to 2015 (nâ=â161,838) and age- and sex-matched control subjects without cholecystectomy (nâ=â286,135) using the National Health Insurance Service database. Incident PD was traced over a maximum observation period of 7 years. We identified 1404 incident PD cases during 1,631,265 person-years of follow-up. The cholecystectomy group showed an elevated risk of PD compared to the control group, even after adjusting for potential confounding factors (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.27). When the data were split by sex, the risk elevation was significant in men (adjusted HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.06-1.41), but not in women (adjusted HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.88-1.22). Our results provide evidence that cholecystectomy is associated with an increased risk of developing PD. This association differed between men and women, suggesting sex-specific effects of cholecystectomy on the risk of PD.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2021,Ryul Kim; Jee-Young Lee; Sanghyun Park; Kyungdo Han; Cheol Min Shin
33070123,A review on preventive role of ketogenic diet (KD) in CNS disorders from the gut microbiota perspective.,"The gut microbiota plays an important role in neurological diseases via the gut-brain axis.

34430117,Fecal Microbiota Transplantation: A Microbiome Modulation Technique for Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and the fifth leading cause of death among the elderly. AD involves parts of the brain that can lead to progressive memory loss and impaired language skills and cognitive thinking, affecting one's ability to carry out daily activities. Aging, bad dietary habits, family history, as well as altered gut microbiota composition may play a role in the pathogenesis of AD. Although the association between the imbalance of gut microbiota and AD is still difficult to determine, it has been suggested that dysbiosis can lead to the increased secretion of lipopolysaccharides and amyloid, which may impair the permeability of the intestine and the blood-brain barrier. Moreover, it can progress the process of neuroinflammation, amyloid-beta formation, and ultimately neuronal death. Microbiota-targeted interventions such as personalized diet, probiotics, or fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) might represent a potential therapeutic option for AD. This review article discusses the procedure of FMT and its possible side effects on the recipient's body. In addition, we review the role of FMT in the context of its application in various nervous system-related disorders (AD, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis).",Cureus,2021,Varsha Nandwana; Shibajee Debbarma
34422879,Memorable Food: Fighting Age-Related Neurodegeneration by Precision Nutrition.,"Healthcare systems worldwide are seriously challenged by a rising prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), which mostly, but not exclusively, affect the ever-growing population of the elderly. The most known neurodegenerative diseases are Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, but some viral infections of the brain and traumatic brain injury may also cause NDD. Typical for NDD are the malfunctioning of neurons and their irreversible loss, which often progress irreversibly to dementia and ultimately to death. Numerous factors are involved in the pathogenesis of NDD: genetic variability, epigenetic changes, extent of oxidative/nitrosative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and DNA damage. The complex interplay of all the above-mentioned factors may be a fingerprint of neurodegeneration, with different diseases being affected to different extents by particular factors. There is a voluminous body of evidence showing the benefits of regular exercise to brain health and cognitive functions. Moreover, the importance of a healthy diet, balanced in macro- and micro-nutrients, in preventing neurodegeneration and slowing down a progression to full-blown disease is evident. Individuals affected by NDD almost inevitably have low-grade inflammation and anomalies in lipid metabolism. Metabolic and lipid profiles in NDD can be improved by the Mediterranean diet. Many studies have associated the Mediterranean diet with a decreased risk of dementia and AD, but a cause-and-effect relationship has not been deduced. Studies with caloric restriction showed neuroprotective effects in animal models, but the results in humans are inconsistent. The pathologies of NDD are complex and there is a great inter-individual (epi)genetic variance within any population. Furthermore, the gut microbiome, being deeply involved in nutrient uptake and lipid metabolism, also represents a pillar of the gut microbiome-brain axis and is linked with the pathogenesis of NDD. Numerous studies on the role of different micronutrients (omega-3 fatty acids, bioactive polyphenols from fruit and medicinal plants) in the prevention, prediction, and treatment of NDD have been conducted, but we are still far away from a personalized diet plan for individual NDD patients. For this to be realized, large-scale cohorts that would include the precise monitoring of food intake, mapping of genetic variants, epigenetic data, microbiome studies, and metabolome, lipidome, and transcriptome data are needed.",Frontiers in nutrition,2021,Maja MiloÅ¡eviÄ; Aleksandra ArsiÄ; Zorica CvetkoviÄ; Vesna VuÄiÄ
34566874,Intestinal Decontamination Therapy for Dyskinesia and Motor Fluctuations in Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease is neurodegenerative disorder with an initial robust response to levodopa. As the disease progresses, patients frequently develop dyskinesia and motor fluctuations, which are sometimes resistant to pharmacological therapy. In recent years, abnormalities in gut microbiota have been identified in these patients with a possible role in motor manifestations. Dysbiosis may reduce levodopa absorption leading to delayed ""On"" or ""no-On"" states. Among 84 consecutive patients with PD, we selected 14 with levodopa-induced dyskinesia and motor fluctuations with a Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) part IV â¥ 8 points following a trial of pharmacological adjustment 2-3 months prior to study enrollment or adjustments in deep brain stimulation therapy. Patients received treatment with sodium phosphate enema followed by oral rifaximin and polyethylene glycol for 7 and 10 days, respectively. Evaluations between 14 to 21 days after starting treatment showed improvement in MDS-UPDRS-IV (<i>P</i> = 0.001), including duration (<i>P</i> = 0.001) and severity of dyskinesia (<i>P</i> = 0.003); duration of medication ""Off""-state (<i>P</i> = 0.004); functional impact of motor fluctuations (<i>P</i> = 0.047) and complexity of motor fluctuations (<i>P</i> = 0.031); no statistical improvement was observed in ""Off"" dystonia (<i>P</i> = 0.109) and total motor scores (<i>P</i> = 0.430). Marked to moderate improvement in dyskinesia was observed in 57% of cases with blinded evaluation of videos. About 80% of patients perceived moderate to robust improvement at follow-up.

The aim of this study in individuals with PD was to determine whether a Mediterranean diet intervention is feasible and affects GI function, intestinal permeability and fecal microbial communities. <b>Methods:</b> A single-arm, 5-week Mediterranean diet intervention study was conducted in eight people with PD. Daily and weekly questionnaires were administered to determine changes in GI symptoms. Urine and stool samples were collected at baseline and after 5 weeks to assess intestinal permeability and fecal microbial communities. Additionally, live-in partners of the participants with PD were matched as controls (<i>n</i> = 8) for baseline urine and stool samples. <b>Results:</b> Participants with PD increased intake of Mediterranean diet based on adherence scores from baseline to week 5 (4.4 Â± 0.6 vs. 11.9 Â± 0.7; <i>P</i> < 0.01 with >10 representing good adherence), which was linked with weight loss (77.4 kg vs. 74.9 kg, <i>P</i> = 0.01). Constipation syndrome scores decreased after 5 weeks (2.3 Â± 0.5 vs. 1.5 Â± 0.3; <i>P</i> = 0.04). <i>Bilophila</i>, was higher at baseline in PD (0.6 Â± 0.1% vs. 0.2 Â± 0.1% <i>P</i> = 0.02) and slightly decreased after the diet intervention (0.5 Â± 0.1%; <i>P</i> = 0.01). Interestingly, the proportion of <i>Roseburia</i> was significantly lower in PD compared to controls (0.6 Â± 0.2% vs. 1.6 Â± 0.3%; <i>P</i> = 0.02) and increased at week 5 (0.9 Â± 0.2%; <i>P</i> < 0.01). No differences were observed for markers of intestinal permeability between the control and PD groups or post-intervention. <b>Conclusions:</b> Short-term Mediterranean diet adherence is feasible in participants with PD; correlated with weight loss, improved constipation, and modified gut microbiota. <b>Clinical Trial Registration:</b> ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT03851861.",Frontiers in neurology,2021,Carley Rusch; Matthew Beke; Lily Tucciarone; Carmelo Nieves; Maria Ukhanova; Massimiliano S Tagliamonte; Volker Mai; Joon Hyuk Suh; Yu Wang; Shannon Chiu; Bhavana Patel; Adolfo Ramirez-Zamora; Bobbi Langkamp-Henken

34032647,Production of Psychoactive Metabolites by Gut Bacteria.,"The gut microbiome plays a vital role in numerous aspects of physiology, including functions related to metabolism, the immune system, behaviour, brain structure and function. Furthermore, it is now becoming increasingly clear that alterations in microbial composition or diversity are implicated in several disease states, including anxiety, depression, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), obesity, and diabetes. Therefore, therapeutic targeting of the gut microbiota has the potential to be useful in the treatment of both stress-related disorders and metabolic diseases. An important method by which the gut microbiome can influence the gut-brain axis is through microbial production of psychoactive metabolites. Several bacteria have been shown to produce metabolites which can impact host health, such as short-chain fatty acids, conjugated linoleic acid, antimicrobials, exopolysaccharides, and vitamins. Furthermore, several molecules with neuroactive functions, including serotonin, gamma-aminobutyric acid, catecholamines, and acetylcholine, have been isolated from bacteria within the human gut. This review aims to explore the psychoactive metabolites reported to be produced by gut bacteria, particularly those of relevance to stress-related disorders. Screening methods for psychoactive metabolite production, as well as the challenges and limitations of this research, will also be addressed. Finally, the implications of metabolite production for neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, and stress, behavioural disorders such as ASD, and neurodegenerative disorders such as AD and PD will be discussed.",Modern trends in psychiatry,2021,Niamh C Wiley; John F Cryan; Timothy G Dinan; R Paul Ross; Catherine Stanton

Additionally, aggregation of Î±-synuclein (Î±-syn) is central to PD pathogenesis. Here we identified the further mechanisms of gut microbiota in PD. A mouse model with PD was established via injection of MPTP. Normal or MPTP-induced PD like animals were treated with FMT from healthy normal mice. Pole test and traction test were performed to examine the effectsÂ of FMT on motor function of PD mice. Fecal SCFAs were assessed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The Î±-syn level in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SN) of mice was measured using western blot. Dopaminergic neurons and microglial activation in the SN were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) staining. FMT alleviated physical impairment, decreased fecal SCFAs in a mouse model of PD. Additionally, FMT decreased the expression of Î±-syn, as well as inhibited the activation of microglia in the SN, and blocked the TLR4/PI3K/AKT/NF-ÎºB signaling in the SN and striatum. FMT could protect mice against PD via suppressing Î±-syn expression and inactivating the TLR4/PI3K/AKT/NF-ÎºB signaling.",Neurochemical research,2021,Zhe Zhong; Weijie Chen; Huan Gao; Ningning Che; Min Xu; Lanqing Yang; Yingfang Zhang; Min Ye
33717189,Microbiome or Infections: Amyloid-Containing Biofilms as a Trigger for Complex Human Diseases.,"The human microbiota is the community of microorganisms that live upon or within their human host. The microbiota consists of various microorganisms including bacteria, fungi, viruses, and archaea; the gut microbiota is comprised mostly of bacteria. Many bacterial species within the gut microbiome grow as biofilms, which are multicellular communities embedded in an extracellular matrix. Studies have shown that the relative abundances of bacterial species, and therefore biofilms and bacterial byproducts, change during progression of a variety of human diseases including gastrointestinal, autoimmune, neurodegenerative, and cancer. Studies have shown the location and proximity of the biofilms within the gastrointestinal tract might impact disease outcome. Gram-negative enteric bacteria secrete the amyloid curli, which makes up as much as 85% of the extracellular matrix of enteric biofilms. Curli mediates cell-cell attachment and attachment to various surfaces including extracellular matrix components such as fibronectin and laminin. Structurally, curli is strikingly similar to pathological and immunomodulatory human amyloids such as amyloid-Î², which has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease, Î±-synuclein, which is involved in Parkinson's disease, and serum amyloid A, which is secreted during the acute phase of inflammation. The immune system recognizes both bacterial amyloid curli and human amyloids utilizing the same receptors, so curli also induces inflammation. Moreover, recent work indicates that curli can participate in the self-assembly process of pathological human amyloids. Curli is found within biofilms of commensal enteric bacteria as well as invasive pathogens; therefore, evidence suggests that curli contributes to complex human diseases. In this review, we summarize the recent findings on how bacterial biofilms containing curli participate in the pathological and immunological processes in gastrointestinal diseases, systemic autoimmune diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases.",Frontiers in immunology,2021,Amanda L Miller; Shingo Bessho; Kaitlyn Grando; Ãagla TÃ¼kel
34012926,<i>Desulfovibrio</i> Bacteria Are Associated With Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most prevalent movement disorder known and predominantly affects the elderly. It is a progressive neurodegenerative disease wherein Î±-synuclein, a neuronal protein, aggregates to form toxic structures in nerve cells. The cause of Parkinson's disease (PD) remains unknown. Intestinal dysfunction and changes in the gut microbiota, common symptoms of PD, are evidently linked to the pathogenesis of PD. Although a multitude of studies have investigated microbial etiologies of PD, the microbial role in disease progression remains unclear. Here, we show that Gram-negative sulfate-reducing bacteria of the genus <i>Desulfovibrio</i> may play a potential role in the development of PD. Conventional and quantitative real-time PCR analysis of feces from twenty PD patients and twenty healthy controls revealed that all PD patients harbored <i>Desulfovibrio</i> bacteria in their gut microbiota and these bacteria were present at higher levels in PD patients than in healthy controls. Additionally, the concentration of <i>Desulfovibrio</i> species correlated with the severity of PD. <i>Desulfovibrio</i> bacteria produce hydrogen sulfide and lipopolysaccharide, and several strains synthesize magnetite, all of which likely induce the oligomerization and aggregation of Î±-synuclein protein. The substances originating from <i>Desulfovibrio</i> bacteria likely take part in pathogenesis of PD. These findings may open new avenues for the treatment of PD and the identification of people at risk for developing PD.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2021,Kari E Murros; Vy A Huynh; Timo M Takala; Per E J Saris

The connection between gut microbiota and the brain is termed as gut-brain axis (GBA), and these connections are established by neuronal, endocrine and immunological pathways. Thus, they are involved in neurophysiology and neuropathology of several diseases like Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), depression, and autism.

33963284,Molecular mechanisms underlying the antidepressant actions of arketamine: beyond the NMDA receptor.,"The discovery of robust antidepressant actions exerted by the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist (R,S)-ketamine has been a crucial breakthrough in mood disorder research. (R,S)-ketamine is a racemic mixture of equal amounts of (R)-ketamine (arketamine) and (S)-ketamine (esketamine). In 2019, an esketamine nasal spray from Johnson & Johnson was approved in the United States of America and Europe for treatment-resistant depression. However, an increasing number of preclinical studies show that arketamine has greater potency and longer-lasting antidepressant-like effects than esketamine in rodents, despite the lower binding affinity of arketamine for the NMDAR. In clinical trials, non-ketamine NMDAR-related compounds did not exhibit ketamine-like robust antidepressant actions in patients with depression, despite these compounds showing antidepressant-like effects in rodents. Thus, the rodent data do not necessarily translate to humans due to the complexity of human psychiatric disorders. Collectively, the available studies indicate that it is unlikely that NMDAR plays a major role in the antidepressant action of (R,S)-ketamine and its enantiomers, although the precise molecular mechanisms underlying antidepressant actions of (R,S)-ketamine and its enantiomers remain unclear. In this paper, we review recent findings on the molecular mechanisms underlying the antidepressant actions of (R,S)-ketamine and its potent enantiomer arketamine. Furthermore, we discuss the possible role of the brain-gut-microbiota axis and brain-spleen axis in stress-related psychiatric disorders and in the antidepressant-like action of arketamine. Finally, we discuss the potential of arketamine as a treatment for cognitive impairment in psychiatric disorders, Parkinson's disease, osteoporosis, inflammatory bowel diseases, and stroke.",Molecular psychiatry,2022,Yan Wei; Lijia Chang; Kenji Hashimoto

In 2019, an esketamine nasal spray from Johnson & Johnson was approved in the United States of America and Europe for treatment-resistant depression. However, an increasing number of preclinical studies show that arketamine has greater potency and longer-lasting antidepressant-like effects than esketamine in rodents, despite the lower binding affinity of arketamine for the NMDAR. In clinical trials, non-ketamine NMDAR-related compounds did not exhibit ketamine-like robust antidepressant actions in patients with depression, despite these compounds showing antidepressant-like effects in rodents. Thus, the rodent data do not necessarily translate to humans due to the complexity of human psychiatric disorders. Collectively, the available studies indicate that it is unlikely that NMDAR plays a major role in the antidepressant action of (R,S)-ketamine and its enantiomers, although the precise molecular mechanisms underlying antidepressant actions of (R,S)-ketamine and its enantiomers remain unclear. In this paper, we review recent findings on the molecular mechanisms underlying the antidepressant actions of (R,S)-ketamine and its potent enantiomer arketamine. Furthermore, we discuss the possible role of the brain-gut-microbiota axis and brain-spleen axis in stress-related psychiatric disorders and in the antidepressant-like action of arketamine. Finally, we discuss the potential of arketamine as a treatment for cognitive impairment in psychiatric disorders, Parkinson's disease, osteoporosis, inflammatory bowel diseases, and stroke.",Molecular psychiatry,2022,Yan Wei; Lijia Chang; Kenji Hashimoto

34795270,Micronutrient supplements can promote disruptive protozoan and fungal communities in the developing infant gut.,"Supplementation with micronutrients, including vitamins, iron and zinc, is a key strategy to alleviate child malnutrition. However, association of gastrointestinal disorders with iron has led to ongoing debate over their administration. To better understand their impact on gut microbiota, we analyse the bacterial, protozoal, fungal and helminth communities of stool samples collected from a subset of 80 children at 12 and 24 months of age, previously enrolled into a large cluster randomized controlled trial of micronutrient supplementation in Pakistan (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00705445). We show that while bacterial diversity is reduced in supplemented children, vitamins and iron (as well as residence in a rural setting) may promote colonization with distinct protozoa and mucormycetes, whereas the addition of zinc appears to ameliorate this effect. We suggest that the risks and benefits of micronutrient interventions may depend on eukaryotic communities, potentially exacerbated by exposure to a rural setting. Larger studies are needed to evaluate the clinical significance of these findings and their impact on health outcomes.",Nature communications,2021,Ana Popovic; Celine Bourdon; Pauline W Wang; David S Guttman; Sajid Soofi; Zulfiqar A Bhutta; Robert H J Bandsma; John Parkinson; Lisa G Pell
33704660,Modulating neuroinflammation in neurodegeneration-related dementia: can microglial toll-like receptors pull the plug?,"Neurodegeneration-associated dementia disorders (NADDs), namely Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases, are developed by a significant portion of the elderly population globally. Extensive research has provided critical insights into the molecular basis of the pathological advancements of these diseases, but an efficient curative therapy seems elusive. A common attribute of NADDs is neuroinflammation due to a chronic inflammatory response within the central nervous system (CNS), which is primarily modulated by microglia. This response within the CNS is positively regulated by cytokines, chemokines, secondary messengers or cyclic nucleotides, and free radicals. Microglia mediated immune activation is regulated by a positive feedback loop in NADDs. The present review focuses on evaluating the crosstalk between inflammatory mediators and microglia, which aggravates both the clinical progression and extent of NADDs by forming a persistent chronic inflammatory milieu within the CNS. We also discuss the role of the human gut microbiota and its effect on NADDs as well as the suitability of targeting toll-like receptors for an immunotherapeutic intervention targeting the deflation of an inflamed milieu within the CNS.",Metabolic brain disease,2021,Rohit Kumar Tiwari; Afrasim Moin; Syed Mohd Danish Rizvi; Syed Monowar Alam Shahid; Preeti Bajpai
34402617,Advances in Genome-Scale Metabolic Modeling toward Microbial Community Analysis of the Human Microbiome.,"A genome-scale metabolic model (GEM) represents metabolic pathways of an organism in a mathematical form and can be built using biochemistry and genome annotation data. GEMs are invaluable for understanding organisms since they analyze the metabolic capabilities and behaviors quantitatively and can predict phenotypes. The development of high-throughput data collection techniques led to an immense increase in omics data such as metagenomics, which expand our knowledge on the human microbiome, but this also created a need for systematic analysis of these data. In recent years, GEMs have also been reconstructed for microbial species, including human gut microbiota, and methods for the analysis of microbial communities have been developed to examine the interaction between the organisms or the host. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive guide for the applications of GEMs in microbial community analysis. Starting with GEM repositories, automatic GEM reconstruction tools, and quality control of models, this review will give insights into microbe-microbe and microbe-host interaction predictions and optimization of microbial community models. Recent studies that utilize microbial GEMs and personalized models to infer the influence of microbiota on human diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) or Parkinson's disease are exemplified. Being powerful system biology tools for both species-level and community-level analysis of microbes, GEMs integrated with omics data and machine learning techniques will be indispensable for studying the microbiome and their effects on human physiology as well as for deciphering the mechanisms behind human diseases.",ACS synthetic biology,2021,Elif Esvap; Kutlu O Ulgen
34829716,The Emerging Scenario of the Gut-Brain Axis: The Therapeutic Actions of the New Actor Kefir against Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"The fact that millions of people worldwide suffer from Alzheimer's disease (AD) or Parkinson's disease (PD), the two most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), has been a permanent challenge to science. New tools were developed over the past two decades and were immediately incorporated into routines in many laboratories, but the most valuable scientific contribution was the ""waking up"" of the gut microbiota. Disturbances in the gut microbiota, such as an imbalance in the beneficial/pathogenic effects and a decrease in diversity, can result in the passage of undesired chemicals and cells to the systemic circulation. Recently, the potential effect of probiotics on restoring/preserving the microbiota was also evaluated regarding important metabolite and vitamin production, pathogen exclusion, immune system maturation, and intestinal mucosal barrier integrity. Therefore, the focus of the present review is to discuss the available data and conclude what has been accomplished over the past two decades. This perspective fosters program development of the next steps that are necessary to obtain confirmation through clinical trials on the magnitude of the effects of kefir in large samples.","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2021,Thiago M C Pereira; Larissa Z CÃ´co; Alyne M M Ton; Silvana S Meyrelles; Manuel Campos-Toimil; Bianca P Campagnaro; Elisardo C Vasquez

Often these conditions coexist and exacerbate one another. The damaged area in post-stroke dementia may lead to neurodegenerative lesions. Gut microbiome functions like an endocrine organ by generating bioactive metabolites that can directly or indirectly impact human physiology. An alteration in the composition and function of intestinal flora, i.e. gut dysbiosis, is implicated in neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases. Additionally, gut dysbiosis may accelerate the progression of cognitive impairment. Dysbiosis may result from obesity; metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disease, and sleep disorders, Lack of physical activity is associated with dysbiosis as well. These may coexist in various patterns in older people, enhancing the risk, incidence, and progression of cerebrovascular lesions, neurodegenerative disorders, and cognitive impairment, creating a vicious circle. Recently, it has been reported that several metabolites produced by gut microbiota (e.g., trimethylamine/trimethylamine N-oxide, short-chain fatty acids, secondary bile acids) may be linked to neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases. New treatment modalities, including prebiotic and probiotics, may normalize the gut microbiota composition, change the brain-gut barrier, and decrease the risk of the pathology development.

34769091,Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth as Potential Therapeutic Target in Parkinson's Disease.,"Increasing evidence suggests that the gut microbiota and the brain are closely connected via the so-called gut-brain axis. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is a gut dysbiosis in which the small intestine is abundantly colonized by bacteria that are typically found in the colon. Though not a disease, it may result in intestinal symptoms caused by the accumulation of microbial gases in the intestine. Intestinal inflammation, malabsorption and vitamin imbalances may also develop. SIBO can be eradicated by one or several courses of antibiotics but reappears if the predisposing condition persists. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative proteinopathy for which disease modifying interventions are not available. Sporadic forms may start in the gut years before the development of clinical features. Increased gastrointestinal transit time is present in most people with PD early during the course of the disease, predisposing to gut dysbiosis, including SIBO. The role that gut dysbiosis may play in the etiopathogenesis of PD is not fully understood yet. Here, we discuss the possibility that SIBO could contribute to the progression of PD, by promoting or preventing neurodegeneration, thus being a potential target for treatments aiming at slowing down the progression of PD. The direct symptomatic impact of SIBO and its impact on symptomatic medication are also briefly discussed.",International journal of molecular sciences,2021,Adela DÄnÄu; Laura Dumitrescu; Antonia Lefter; Delia TulbÄ; Bogdan Ovidiu Popescu
34909657,Gauging the role and impact of drug interactions and repurposing in neurodegenerative disorders.,"Neurodegenerative diseases (ND) are of vast origin which are characterized by gradual progressive loss of neurons in the brain region. ND can be classified according to the clinical symptoms present (e.g. Cognitive decline, hyperkinetic, and hypokinetic movements disorder) or by the pathological protein deposited (e.g., Amyloid, tau, Alpha-synuclein, TDP-43). Alzheimer's disease preceded by Parkinson's is the most prevalent form of ND world-wide. Multiple factors like aging, genetic mutations, environmental factors, gut microbiota, blood-brain barrier microvascular complication, etc. may increase the predisposition towards ND. Genetic mutation is a major contributor in increasing the susceptibility towards ND, the concept of one disease-one gene is obsolete and now multiple genes are considered to be involved in causing one particular disease. Also, the involvement of multiple pathological mechanisms like oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, etc. contributes to the complexity and makes them difficult to be treated by traditional mono-targeted ligands. In this aspect, the Poly-pharmacological drug approach which targets multiple pathological pathways at the same time provides the best way to treat such complex networked CNS diseases. In this review, we have provided an overview of ND and their pathological origin, along with a brief description of various genes associated with multiple diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Multiple sclerosis (MS), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's and a comprehensive detail about the Poly-pharmacology approach (MTDLs and Fixed-dose combinations) along with their merits over the traditional single-targeted drug is provided. This review also provides insights into current repurposing strategies along with its regulatory considerations.",Current research in pharmacology and drug discovery,2021,Dharmendra Kumar Khatri; Amey Kadbhane; Monica Patel; Shweta Nene; Srividya Atmakuri; Saurabh Srivastava; Shashi Bala Singh
33571701,The pleiotropic neuroprotective effects of resveratrol in cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease pathology: From antioxidant to epigenetic therapy.,"While the elderly segment of the population continues growing in importance, neurodegenerative diseases increase exponentially. Lifestyle factors such as nutrition, exercise, and education, among others, influence ageing progression, throughout life. Notably, the Central Nervous System (CNS) can benefit from nutritional strategies and dietary interventions that prevent signs of senescence, such as cognitive decline or neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's Disease. The dietary polyphenol Resveratrol (RV) possesses antioxidant and cytoprotective effects, producing neuroprotection in several organisms. The oxidative stress (OS) occurs because of Reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation that has been proposed to explain the cause of the ageing. One of the most harmful effects of ROS in the cell is DNA damage. Nevertheless, there is also evidence demonstrating that OS can produce other molecular changes such as mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, apoptosis, and epigenetic modifications, among others. Interestingly, the dietary polyphenol RV is a potent antioxidant and possesses pleiotropic actions, exerting its activity through various molecular pathways. In addition, recent evidence has shown that RV mediates epigenetic changes involved in ageing and the function of the CNS that persists across generations. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that RV interacts with gut microbiota, showing modifications in bacterial composition associated with beneficial effects. In this review, we give a comprehensive overview of the main mechanisms of action of RV in different experimental models, including clinical trials and discuss how the interconnection of these molecular events could explain the neuroprotective effects induced by RV.",Ageing research reviews,2021,Christian GriÃ±Ã¡n-FerrÃ©; Aina Bellver-Sanchis; Vanessa Izquierdo; RubÃ©n Corpas; Joan Roig-Soriano; Miguel ChillÃ³n; Cristina Andres-Lacueva; MilÃ¡n SomogyvÃ¡ri; Csaba SÅti; Coral Sanfeliu; MercÃ¨ PallÃ s
33063712,The emerging role of probiotics in neurodegenerative diseases: new hope for Parkinson's disease?,"Neurodegenerative disease etiology is still unclear, but different contributing factors, such as lifestyle and genetic factors are involved. Altered components of the gut could play a key role in the gut-brain axis, which is a bidirectional system between the central nervous system and the enteric nervous system. Variations in the composition of the gut microbiota and its function between healthy people and patients have been reported for a variety of human disorders comprising metabolic, autoimmune, cancer, and, notably, neurodegenerative disorders. Diet can alter the microbiota composition, affecting the gut-brain axis function. Different nutraceutical interventions have been devoted to normalizing gut microbiome dysbiosis and to improving biological outcomes in neurological conditions, including the use of probiotics. Preclinical and clinical investigations discussed in this review strengthen the correlation between intestinal microbiota and brain and the concept that modifying the microbiome composition may improve brain neurochemistry, modulating different pathways. This review will discuss the potential use of probiotics for Parkinson's disease prevention or treatment or as adjuvant therapy, confirming that gut microbiota modulation influences different pro-survival pathways. Future investigations in Parkinson's disease should consider the role of the gut-brain axis and additional comprehension of the underlying mechanisms is extremely necessary.",Neural regeneration research,2021,Vanessa Castelli; Michele d'Angelo; Massimiliano Quintiliani; Elisabetta Benedetti; Maria Grazia Cifone; Annamaria Cimini
33417221,Pathophysiological Clues to How the Emergent SARS-CoV-2 Can Potentially Increase the Susceptibility to Neurodegeneration.,"Along with emergence of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in late 2019, a myriad of neurologic symptoms, associated with structural brain changes, were reported. In this paper, we provide evidence to critically discuss the claim that the survived patients could possibly be at increased risk for neurodegenerative diseases via various mechanisms. This virus can directly invade the brain through olfactory bulb, retrograde axonal transport from peripheral nerve endings, or via hematogenous or lymphatic routes. Infection of the neurons along with peripheral leukocytes activation results in pro-inflammatory cytokine increment, rendering the brain to neurodegenerative changes. Also, occupation of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) with the virus may lead to a decline in ACE-2 activity, which acts as a neuroprotective factor. Furthermore, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and septicemia induce hypoxemia and hypoperfusion, which are locally exacerbated due to the hypercoagulable state and micro-thrombosis in brain vessels, leading to oxidative stress and neurodegeneration. Common risk factors for COVID-19 and neurodegenerative diseases, such as metabolic risk factors, genetic predispositions, and even gut microbiota dysbiosis, can contribute to higher occurrence of neurodegenerative diseases in COVID-19 survivors. However, it should be considered that severity of the infection, the extent of neurologic symptoms, and the persistence of viral infection consequences are major determinants of this association. Importantly, whether this pandemic will increase the overall incidence of neurodegeneration is not clear, as a high percentage of patients with severe form of COVID-19 might probably not survive enough to develop neurodegenerative diseases.",Molecular neurobiology,2021,Mahsa Dolatshahi; Mohammadmahdi Sabahi; Mohammad Hadi Aarabi
35035709,An analysis of the characteristics of the intestinal flora in patients with Parkinson's disease complicated with constipation.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a degenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS) and is common among the middle-aged and elderly populations. Increasing evidence shows that the gut microbiota may trigger PD through the ""gut-microbiota-brain"" axis. A previous study revealed that constipation, one of the non-motor symptoms of PD, affects gut microbiota and the progression of PD. However, whether constipation is involved in gut microbiota-associated PD is largely unknown. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between gut microbiota, PD, and constipation in this study. We carried out 16S rRNA sequencing in 15 constipated PD patients (C-PD), 14 non-constipated PD (NC-PD) patients, and 15 healthy controls to evaluate the microbial population. Furthermore, co-occurrence networks were used to assess the gut ecology of the three groups. Spearman analyses were used to analyze the correlation between the differential microbiota and the clinical features. The results showed that there were differences in the composition of the gut microbiota among the C-PD group, the NC-PD group, and the healthy controls. No significant differences were observed in the alpha diversity among the three groups, but the beta diversity differed significantly among the groups. Compared with the healthy controls, the abundance of <i>Hungatella and Collinsella</i> was increased and the abundance of <i>Lachnospira and Fusicatenibacter</i> was reduced in the PD patients' feces. Compared with the NC-PD group, the relative abundance of <i>Megamonas and Holdemanella</i> were lower, while <i>Hungatella, Streptococcus</i> and <i>Anaerotruncus</i> were enriched in the C-PD group. The co-occurrence network analysis showed that the C-PD group presented a different microbial community relationship compared with the NC-PD group and the healthy controls. Our study provides strong evidence that the gut microbiota may be related to constipation in PD. In addition, our data suggest an association between the differential microbiota genera and the clinical features of PD. Therefore, modulating gut microbiota may be another way to monitor and optimize PD treatment.",American journal of translational research,2021,Weijie Chen; Zaoan Bi; Qihui Zhu; Huan Gao; Yi Fan; Chenyang Zhang; Xingyin Liu; Min Ye
33935107,Plasma Short-Chain Fatty Acids Differences in Multiple System Atrophy from Parkinson's Disease.,"Multiple system atrophy (MSA) and Parkinson's disease (PD) have overlapping symptoms, making diagnosis challenging. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are produced exclusively by gut microbiota and were reduced in feces of MSA patients. However, plasma SCFA concentrations in MSA patients have not been investigated.We aimed to investigate the plasma SCFAs in MSA patients and to identify the potential differential diagnostic ability.Plasma SCFA were measured in 25 MSA patients, 46 healthy controls, and 46 PD patients using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants were evaluated.Acetic acid concentration was lower in MSA patients than in healthy controls. Acetic acid and propionic acid concentrations were lower in MSA and MSA with predominant parkinsonism (MSA-P) patients than in PD patients. A receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis revealed reduced acetic acid concentration discriminated MSA patients from healthy controls with 76% specificity but only 57% sensitivity and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.68 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.55-0.81). Combined acetic acid and propionic acid concentrations discriminated MSA patients from PD patients with an AUC of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.71-0.93), 84% specificity and 76% sensitivity. Especially, with combined acetic acid and propionic acid concentrations, MSA-P patients were separated from PD patients with an AUC of 0.89 (95% CI: 0.80-0.97), 91% specificity and 80% sensitivity.Plasma SCFAs were decreased in MSA patients. The combined acetic acid and propionic acid concentrations may be a potential biomarker for differentiating MSA patients from PD patients.",Journal of Parkinson's disease,2021,Xiaoqin He; Yiwei Qian; Shaoqing Xu; Yi Zhang; Chengjun Mo; Wentian Guo; Xiaodong Yang; Qin Xiao
33662500,"Korean red ginseng suppresses 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced inflammation in the substantia nigra and colon.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease involving dopaminergic neuronal death in the substantia nigra (SN); recent studies have shown that interactions between gut and brain play a critical role in the pathogenesis of PD. In this study, the anti-inflammatory effect of Korean red ginseng (KRG) and the changes in gut microbiota were evaluated in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse model. Male nine-week-old C57BL/6 mice were injected intraperitoneally with 30Â mg/kg of MPTP at 24-h intervals for 5Â days. Two hours after the daily MPTP injection, the mice were orally administered 100Â mg/kg of KRG, which continued for 7Â days beyond the MPTP injections, for a total of 12 consecutive days. Eight days after the final KRG administration, the pole and rotarod tests were performed and brain and colon samples of the mice were collected. Dopaminergic neuronal death, activation of microglia and astrocytes, Î±-synuclein and expressions of inflammatory cytokines and disruption of tight junction were evaluated. In addition, 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing of mouse fecal samples was performed to investigate microbiome changes. KRG treatment prevented MPTP-induced behavioral impairment, dopaminergic neuronal death, activation of microglia and astrocytes in the nigrostriatal pathway, disruption of tight junction and the increase in Î±-synuclein, interleukin-1Î² and tumor necrosis factor-Î± expression in the colon. The 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that MPTP altered the number of bacterial species and their relative abundances, which were partially suppressed by KRG treatment. Especially, KRG suppressed the abundance of the inflammation-related phylum Verrucomicrobia and genera Ruminococcus and Akkermansia (especially Akkermansia muciniphila), and elevated the abundance of Eubacterium, which produces the anti-inflammatory substances. These findings suggest that KRG prevents MPTP-induced dopaminergic neuronal death, activation of microglia and astrocytes, and accumulation of Î±-synuclein in the SN, and the regulation of inflammation-related factors in the colon may influence the effect.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2021,Hyongjun Jeon; Chang-Hwan Bae; Yukyoung Lee; Hee-Young Kim; Seungtae Kim
34413194,Genome-wide screen identifies curli amyloid fibril as a bacterial component promoting host neurodegeneration.,"Growing evidence indicates that gut microbiota play a critical role in regulating the progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease. The molecular mechanism underlying such microbe-host interaction is unclear. In this study, by feeding <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> expressing human Î±-syn with <i>Escherichia coli</i> knockout mutants, we conducted a genome-wide screen to identify bacterial genes that promote host neurodegeneration. The screen yielded 38 genes that fall into several genetic pathways including curli formation, lipopolysaccharide assembly, and adenosylcobalamin synthesis among others. We then focused on the curli amyloid fibril and found that genetically deleting or pharmacologically inhibiting the curli major subunit CsgA in <i>E. coli</i> reduced Î±-syn-induced neuronal death, restored mitochondrial health, and improved neuronal functions. CsgA secreted by the bacteria colocalized with Î±-syn inside neurons and promoted Î±-syn aggregation through cross-seeding. Similarly, curli also promoted neurodegeneration in <i>C. elegans</i> models of Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington's disease and in human neuroblastoma cells.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2021,Chenyin Wang; Chun Yin Lau; Fuqiang Ma; Chaogu Zheng

The preventive and therapeutic effects of H<sub>2</sub> on various pathological processes have been intensively investigated in numerous clinical trials; it is commonly believed that the beneficial effects are mainly attributed to its selective antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties (Lee et al., 2015; Ohta, 2015; LeBaron et al., 2019; Qiu et al., 2020). In recent years, a handful of rodent studies revealed that exogenous H<sub>2</sub> can affect the gut microbiota (Sha et al., 2018; Valdes et al., 2018). For example, H<sub>2</sub> was reported to induce a higher abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria in a rat model of Parkinson's disease (Bordoni et al., 2019). Recent first-in-human trials have explored the effects of the long-term consumption of H<sub>2</sub>-rich water on antioxidant activity and the gut flora (Sha et al., 2018; Suzuki et al., 2018). Although these promising results suggest that the intestinal microbiota may be another plausible target for molecular H<sub>2</sub>, more studies are highly warranted to explain the mechanism(s) of H<sub>2</sub> action on bacterial growth and functions.",Journal of Zhejiang University.

34802221,From the intestinal mucosal barrier to the enteric neuromuscular compartment: an integrated overview on the morphological changes in Parkinson's disease.,"Gastrointestinal dysfunctions represent the most common non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). Of note, changes in gut microbiota, impairments of intestinal epithelial barrier (IEB), bowel inflammation and neuroplastic rearrangements of the enteric nervous system (ENS) could be involved in the pathophysiology of the intestinal disturbances in PD. In this context, although several review articles have pooled together evidence on the alterations of enteric bacteria-neuro-immune network in PD, a revision of the literature on the specific morphological changes occurring in the intestinal mucosal barrier, the ENS and enteric muscular layers in PD, is lacking. The present review provides a complete appraisal of the available knowledge on the morphological alterations of intestinal mucosal barrier, with particular focus on IEB, ENS and enteric muscular layers in PD. In particular, our intent was to critically discuss whether, based on evidence from translational studies and pre-clinical models, morphological changes in the intestinal barrier and enteric neuromuscular compartment contribute to the pathophysiology of intestinal dysfunctions occurring in PD.",European journal of histochemistry : EJH,2021,Carolina Pellegrini; Vanessa D'Antongiovanni; Chiara Ippolito; Cristina Segnani; Luca Antonioli; Matteo Fornai; Nunzia Bernardini
34911958,Gut bacterial tyrosine decarboxylase associates with clinical variables in a longitudinal cohort study of Parkinsons disease.,"Gut microbiota influences the clinical response of a wide variety of orally administered drugs. However, the underlying mechanisms through which drug-microbiota interactions occur are still obscure. Previously, we reported that tyrosine decarboxylating (TDC) bacteria may restrict the levels of levodopa reaching circulation in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). We observed a significant positive association between disease duration and the abundance of the bacterial tdc-gene. The question arises whether increased exposure to anti-PD medication could affect the abundance of bacterial TDC, to ultimately impact drug efficacy. To this end, we investigated the potential association between anti-PD drug exposure and bacterial tdc-gene abundance over a period of 2 years in a longitudinal cohort of PD patients and healthy controls. Our data reveal significant associations between tdc-gene abundance, several anti-PD medications, including entacapone, rasagiline, pramipexole, and ropinirole but not levodopa, and gastrointestinal symptoms, warranting further research on the effect of anti-PD medication on microbial changes and gastrointestinal function.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2021,Sebastiaan P van Kessel; Petri Auvinen; Filip Scheperjans; Sahar El Aidy
33617267,Prebiotic Lactulose Ameliorates the Cognitive Deficit in Alzheimer's Disease Mouse Model through Macroautophagy and Chaperone-Mediated Autophagy Pathways.,"Lactulose, as a prebiotic, can be utilized by human gut microbiota and stimulate their growth. Although microbiota modulation has become an emerging approach to manage many diseases and can be achieved by the administration of prebiotics, fewer investigations have been carried out on the therapeutic mechanism of lactulose. Two trehalose analogs, lactulose and melibiose, were identified as having a neuroprotective effect in polyglutamine and Parkinson disease models. In this study, we examined lactulose and melibiose in a mouse primary hippocampal neuronal culture under the toxicity of oligomeric AÎ²<sub>25-35</sub>. Lactulose was further tested in vivo because its effective concentration is lower than that of melibiose. Lactulose and trehalose were applied individually to mice before a bilateral intrahippocampal CA1 injection of oligomeric AÎ²<sub>25-35</sub>. The administration of lactulose and trehalose attenuated the short-term memory and the learning retrieval of Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice. From a pathological analysis, we found that the pretreatment of lactulose and trehalose decreased neuroinflammation and increased the levels of the autophagic pathways. These results suggest that the neuroprotective effects of both lactulose and trehalose are achieved through anti-inflammation and autophagy. In addition, lactulose was better than trehalose in the enhancement of the synaptic protein expression level in AD mice. Therefore, lactulose could potentially be developed into a preventive and/or therapeutic disaccharide for AD.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2021,Yan-Suan Lee; Dar-Ming Lai; Hei-Jen Huang; Guey-Jen Lee-Chen; Ching-Hwa Chang; Hsiu Mei Hsieh-Li; Guan-Chiun Lee
34025392,Probiotic Supplementation Facilitates Recovery of 6-OHDA-Induced Motor Deficit via Improving Mitochondrial Function and Energy Metabolism.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with progressive impairment of motor and non-motor functions in aging people. Overwhelming evidence indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction is a central factor in PD pathophysiology, which impairs energy metabolism. While, several other studies have shown probiotic supplementations to improve host energy metabolism, alleviate the disease progression, prevent gut microbiota dysbiosis and alter commensal bacterial metabolites. But, whether probiotic and/or prebiotic supplementation can affect energy metabolism and cause the impediment of PD progression remains poorly characterized. Therefore, we investigated 8-weeks supplementation effects of probiotic [<i>Lactobacillus salivarius</i> subsp. <i>salicinius</i> AP-32 (AP-32)], residual medium (RM) obtained from the AP-32 culture medium, and combination of AP-32 and RM (A-RM) on unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced PD rats. We found that AP-32, RM and A-RM supplementation induced neuroprotective effects on dopaminergic neurons along with improved motor functions in PD rats. These effects were accompanied by significant increases in mitochondrial activities in the brain and muscle, antioxidative enzymes level in serum, and altered SCFAs profile in fecal samples. Importantly, the AP-32 supplement restored muscle mass along with improved motor function in PD rats, and produced the best results among the supplements. Our results demonstrate that probiotic AP-32 and A-RM supplementations can recover energy metabolism via increasing SCFAs producing and mitochondria function. This restoring of mitochondrial function in the brain and muscles with improved energy metabolism might additionally be potentiated by ROS suppression by the elevated generation of antioxidants, and which finally leads to facilitated recovery of 6-OHDA-induced motor deficit. Taken together, this work demonstrates that probiotic AP-32 supplementation could be a potential candidate for alternate treatment strategy to avert PD progression.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2021,Bira Arumndari Nurrahma; Shu-Ping Tsao; Chieh-Hsi Wu; Tu-Hsueh Yeh; Pei-Shan Hsieh; Binar Panunggal; Hui-Yu Huang
35127723,Human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells Improve Locomotor Function in Parkinson's Disease Mouse Model Through Regulating Intestinal Microorganisms.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder characterized by loss of neurons that synthesize dopamine, and subsequent impaired movement. Umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) exerted neuroprotection effects in a rodent model of PD. However, the mechanism underlying UC-MSC-generated neuroprotection was not fully elucidated. In the present study, we found that intranasal administration of UC-MSCs significantly alleviated locomotor deficits and rescued dopaminergic neurons by inhibiting neuroinflammation in a PD mouse model induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP, a toxic agent which selectively destroys nigrostriatal neurons but does not affect dopaminergic neurons elsewhere). Furthermore, UC-MSC treatment altered gut microbiota composition characterized by decreased phylum Proteobacteria, class Gammaproteobacteria, family Enterobacteriaceae, and genus <i>Escherichia-Shigella</i>. In addition, the neurotransmitter dopamine in the striatum and 5-hydroxytryptamine in the colon were also modulated by UC-MSCs. Meanwhile, UC-MSCs significantly maintained intestinal goblet cells, which secrete mucus as a mechanical barrier against pathogens. Furthermore, UC-MSCs alleviate the level of TNF-Î± and IL-6 as well as the conversion of NF-ÎºB expression in the colon, indicating that inflammatory responses were blocked by UC-MSCs. PICRUSt showed that some pathways including bacterial invasion of epithelial cells, fluorobenzoate degradation, and pathogenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> infection were significantly reversed by UC-MSCs. These data suggest that the beneficial effects were detected following UC-MSC intranasal transplantation in MPTP-treated mice.

34896331,Sodium butyrate attenuates rotenone-induced toxicity by activation of autophagy through epigenetically regulating PGC-1Î± expression in PC12 cells.,"Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are considered the key molecular link between gut microbiota and pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the role of SCFAs in PD pathogenesis is controversial. Autophagy is important for the degradation of Î±-synuclein, which is critical to the development of PD. However, whether SCFAs can regulate autophagy in PD remains unknown. We aimed to investigate the role of SCFAs and explore the potential mechanisms in rat dopaminergic PC12 cells treated with rotenone. Expression levels of Î±-synuclein, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î³ coactivator-1Î± (PGC-1Î±) and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta (LC3B)-II were detected by Western blot. Histone acetylation levels at PGC-1Î± promoter region were measured using chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (ChIP-qPCR). Among the three SCFAs, sodium butyrate (NaB) protected against rotenone-induced toxicity. NaB activated autophagy pathway and reduced rotenone-induced Î±-synuclein expression through the activation of autophagy. Notably, NaB activated autophagy pathway through upregulating PGC-1Î± expression. More importantly, NaB promoted the levels of histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9Ac) and histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27Ac) at PGC-1Î± promoter region, indicating that NaB promotes PGC-1Î± expression via histone acetylation modification.

34768765,Gastric <i>Helicobacter suis</i> Infection Partially Protects against Neurotoxicity in A 6-OHDA Parkinson's Disease Mouse Model.,"The exact etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) remains largely unknown, but more and more research suggests the involvement of the gut microbiota. Interestingly, idiopathic PD patients were shown to have at least a 10 times higher prevalence of <i>Helicobacter suis</i> (<i>H. suis</i>) DNA in gastric biopsies compared to control patients. <i>H. suis</i> is a zoonotic <i>Helicobacter</i> species that naturally colonizes the stomach of pigs and non-human primates but can be transmitted to humans. Here, we investigated the influence of a gastric <i>H. suis</i> infection on PD disease progression through a 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) mouse model. Therefore, mice with either a short- or long-term <i>H. suis</i> infection were stereotactically injected with 6-OHDA in the left striatum and sampled one week later. Remarkably, a reduced loss of dopaminergic neurons was seen in the <i>H. suis/</i>6-OHDA groups compared to the control/6-OHDA groups. Correspondingly, motor function of the <i>H. suis</i>-infected 6-OHDA mice was superior to that in the non-infected 6-OHDA mice. Interestingly, we also observed higher expression levels of antioxidant genes in brain tissue from <i>H. suis</i>-infected 6-OHDA mice, as a potential explanation for the reduced 6-OHDA-induced cell loss. Our data support an unexpected neuroprotective effect of gastric <i>H. suis</i> on PD pathology, mediated through changes in oxidative stress.",International journal of molecular sciences,2021,Helena Berlamont; Arnout Bruggeman; Eva Bauwens; Charysse Vandendriessche; Elien Clarebout; Junhua Xie; Sofie De Bruyckere; Griet Van Imschoot; Elien Van Wonterghem; Richard Ducatelle; Patrick Santens; Annemieke Smet; Freddy Haesebrouck; Roosmarijn E Vandenbroucke
35144237,"Mediterranean diet adherence, gut microbiota, and Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease risk: A systematic review.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are the two most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases, both without prevention or cure. The Mediterranean diet (MeDi) may be neuroprotective by modulating gut microbiota. We aimed to assess the effects of adherence to MeDi on the gut microbiota in relation to AD or PD risk. A search from inception to November 2020 was conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, Web of Science, Global Health, Biological Abstracts, and Grey Literature Report databases. Two searches were conducted: 1) (MeDi or Microbiota) and (PD or AD) and 2) MeDi and microbiota. Inclusion criteria for papers were specified prior to review. Of 4672 studies identified, 64 were eligible for inclusion. These studies were divided into five groups: MeDi and AD risk (nÂ =Â 4), MeDi and PD risk (nÂ =Â 2), MeDi and microbial composition or metabolomics (nÂ =Â 21), AD and microbial composition or metabolomics (nÂ =Â 7), and PD and microbial composition or metabolomics (nÂ =Â 30). Adherence to the MeDi was associated with a lower risk of AD and PD development. Eight genera and two species of bacteria had an inverse relationship with MeDi and AD, and one family, eight genera and three species of bacteria had an inverse relationship with MeDi and PD.

36280322,Human gut microbiota and Parkinson's disease.,"The bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain has come up very fascinating in recent years. Many studies have reported that the onset of gastrointestinal issues appears long before the actual manifestation of Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms. Disturbances in the gut-brain axis have been found to be linked with PD. PD-linked neuropathological changes in the enteric nervous system and significant alteration of gut microbiota suggest a vital role of gut microbiota in PD pathogenesis. Studies have also suggested that aggregation of Î±-synuclein, one of the major proteins associated with PD neuropathology, might start from the gut and move to the central nervous system (CNS) through the vagus nerve and olfactory bulb. Inflammation in the gut has been suggested to be associated with PD initiation and progression. The flushing out of healthy gut microbiota and replacing with pathogens induces gut inflammation and promotes neuroinflammation in the CNS. Therefore, it is intriguing to understand the mechanism of gut-brain communications associated with the development of PD. This review sheds light on the PD pathology, the gut dysbiosis that is associated with PD and its medications, altered gene expression, pathways and microbial metabolites during PD.",Progress in molecular biology and translational science,2022,Archana Pant; Krishna Singh Bisht; Swati Aggarwal; Tushar Kanti Maiti
36087572,Probiotics for constipation and gut microbiota in Parkinson's disease.,"Constipation is one of the common non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease that significantly impacts patient quality of life. Probiotics supplementation may improve constipation symptoms, but its effect on the gut microbiota population is unclear.In this randomized controlled study, 46 PD patients with constipation according to Rome â¢ criteria were recruited. The number of complete bowel movements per week, degree of defecation effort, Bristol stool Scale (BSS), Patient Assessment of Constipation symptom (PAC-SYM) and Patient assessment of constipation quality of life questionnaire (PAC-QOL) were collected pre- and post-intervention to evaluate the constipation symptoms. In addition, fresh feces of subjects before and after intervention and healthy controls were collected for 16s rRNA gene V3-V4 region sequencing to compare bacterial flora differences.Compared with the control group, the treatment group increased the average number of complete bowel movements per week (1.09Â Â±Â 1.24 vs. 0.04Â Â±Â 0.64, PÂ &lt;Â 0.001). Probiotics supplementation reduced the BSS score (0.65Â Â±Â 0.93 vs. -0.17Â Â±Â 0.94, PÂ =Â 0.004), PAC-SYM score (4.09Â Â±Â 6.31 vs. -1.83Â Â±Â 4.14, PÂ &lt;Â 0.001), PAC-QOL score (10.65Â Â±Â 16.53 vs. 0.57Â Â±Â 12.82, PÂ =Â 0.042), and degree of defecation effort score (1.00Â Â±Â 0.80 vs. 0.00Â Â±Â 0.30, PÂ &lt;Â 0.001).

35464431,"Gut Microbiota Interact With the Brain Through Systemic Chronic Inflammation: Implications on Neuroinflammation, Neurodegeneration, and Aging.","It has been noticed in recent years that the unfavorable effects of the gut microbiota could exhaust host vigor and life, yet knowledge and theory are just beginning to be established. Increasing documentation suggests that the microbiota-gut-brain axis not only impacts brain cognition and psychiatric symptoms but also precipitates neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). How the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a machinery protecting the central nervous system (CNS) from the systemic circulation, allows the risky factors derived from the gut to be translocated into the brain seems paradoxical. For the unique anatomical, histological, and immunological properties underpinning its permeable dynamics, the BBB has been regarded as a biomarker associated with neural pathogenesis. The BBB permeability of mice and rats caused by GM dysbiosis raises the question of how the GM and its metabolites change BBB permeability and causes the brain pathophysiology of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration (NF&ND) and brain aging, a pivotal multidisciplinary field tightly associated with immune and chronic systemic inflammation. If not all, gut microbiota-induced systemic chronic inflammation (GM-SCI) mainly refers to excessive gut inflammation caused by gut mucosal immunity dysregulation, which is often influenced by dietary components and age, is produced at the interface of the intestinal barrier (IB) or exacerbated after IB disruption, initiates various common chronic diseases along its dispersal routes, and eventually impairs BBB integrity to cause NF&ND and brain aging. To illustrate the immune roles of the BBB in pathophysiology affected by inflammatory or ""leaky"" IB resulting from GM and their metabolites, we reviewed the selected publications, including the role of the BBB as the immune barrier, systemic chronic inflammation and inflammation influences on BBB permeability, NF&ND, and brain aging. To add depth to the bridging role of systemic chronic inflammation, a plausible mechanism indispensable for BBB corruption was highlighted; namely, BBB maintenance cues are affected by inflammatory cytokines, which may help to understand how GM and its metabolites play a major role in NF&ND and aging.",Frontiers in immunology,2022,Yi Mou; Yu Du; Lixing Zhou; Jirong Yue; Xianliang Hu; Yixin Liu; Sao Chen; Xiufang Lin; Gongchang Zhang; Hengyi Xiao; Birong Dong
36293176,The Interplay between Gut Microbiota and Parkinson's Disease: Implications on Diagnosis and Treatment.,"The bidirectional interaction between the gut microbiota (GM) and the Central Nervous System, the so-called gut microbiota brain axis (GMBA), deeply affects brain function and has an important impact on the development of neurodegenerative diseases. In Parkinson's disease (PD), gastrointestinal symptoms often precede the onset of motor and non-motor manifestations, and alterations in the GM composition accompany disease pathogenesis. Several studies have been conducted to unravel the role of dysbiosis and intestinal permeability in PD onset and progression, but the therapeutic and diagnostic applications of GM modifying approaches remain to be fully elucidated. After a brief introduction on the involvement of GMBA in the disease, we present evidence for GM alterations and leaky gut in PD patients. According to these data, we then review the potential of GM-based signatures to serve as disease biomarkers and we highlight the emerging role of probiotics, prebiotics, antibiotics, dietary interventions, and fecal microbiota transplantation as supportive therapeutic approaches in PD. Finally, we analyze the mutual influence between commonly prescribed PD medications and gut-microbiota, and we offer insights on the involvement also of nasal and oral microbiota in PD pathology, thus providing a comprehensive and up-to-date overview on the role of microbial features in disease diagnosis and treatment.",International journal of molecular sciences,2022,Angelica Varesi; Lucrezia Irene Maria Campagnoli; Foroogh Fahmideh; Elisa Pierella; Marcello Romeo; Giovanni Ricevuti; Marchesi Nicoletta; Salvatore Chirumbolo; Alessia Pascale

35246670,Inflammation and immune dysfunction in Parkinson disease.,"Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects peripheral organs as well as the central nervous system and involves a fundamental role of neuroinflammation in its pathophysiology. Neurohistological and neuroimaging studies support the presence of ongoing and end-stage neuroinflammatory processes in PD. Moreover, numerous studies of peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid from patients with PD suggest alterations in markers of inflammation and immune cell populations that could initiate or exacerbate neuroinflammation and perpetuate the neurodegenerative process. A number of disease genes and risk factors have been identified as modulators of immune function in PD and evidence is mounting for a role of viral or bacterial exposure, pesticides and alterations in gut microbiota in disease pathogenesis. This has led to the hypothesis that complex gene-by-environment interactions combine with an ageing immune system to create the 'perfect storm' that enables the development and progression of PD. We discuss the evidence for this hypothesis and opportunities to harness the emerging immunological knowledge from patients with PD to create better preclinical models with the long-term goal of enabling earlier identification of at-risk individuals to prevent, delay and more effectively treat the disease.",Nature reviews.

34996879,Association of Fecal and Plasma Levels of Short-Chain Fatty Acids With Gut Microbiota and Clinical Severity in Patients With Parkinson Disease.,"Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are gut microbial metabolites that promote the disease process in a rodent model of Parkinson disease (PD), but fecal levels of SCFAs in patients with PD are reduced. Simultaneous assessments of fecal and plasma SCFA levels, and their interrelationships with the PD disease process, are scarce. We aimed to compare fecal and plasma levels of different SCFA subtypes in patients with PD and healthy controls to delineate their interrelations and link to gut microbiota changes and clinical severity of PD.A cohort of 96 patients with PD and 85 controls were recruited from National Taiwan University Hospital. Fecal and plasma concentrations of SCFAs were measured using chromatography and mass spectrometry. Gut microbiota was analyzed using metagenomic shotgun sequencing. Body mass index and medical comorbidities were evaluated and dietary information was obtained using a food frequency questionnaire. To assess motor and cognitive impairment, we used the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) and the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE).Compared with controls, patients with PD had lower fecal but higher plasma concentrations of acetate, propionate, and butyrate. After adjustment for age, sex, disease duration, and anti-PD medication dosage, MDS-UPDRS part III motor scores correlated with reduced fecal levels of acetate (Ï = -0.37, <i>p</i> = 0.012), propionate (Ï = -0.32, <i>p</i> = 0.036), and butyrate (Ï = -0.40, <i>p</i> = 0.004) and with increased plasma propionate concentrations (Ï = 0.26, <i>p</i> = 0.042) in patients with PD.

35245613,Brain-gut-microbiota axis in Parkinson's disease: A historical review and future perspective.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common degenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS) after Alzheimer's disease. In addition to the typical motor symptoms, the clinical manifestations of patients with PD include gastrointestinal symptoms, which even precede the motor symptoms. Recent research has found that the gut microbiota regulates the brain-gut axial interaction through immune, endocrine, and direct neural mechanisms, supporting the hypothesis that the pathological process of PD spreads from the gut to the brain. In this review article, we highlight the landmark findings in the field of PD, with particular attention to the brain-gut-microbiota axis. We summarize the changes and their clinical effects on the gut microbiota and metabolites observed in PD. The intestinal microbiota may contain appropriate targets for the prevention and treatment of PD. Clinical cohort studies suggest that certain intestinal microbes have protective or pathogenic effects on the progression of PD. A better understanding of the interaction between the gut-brain axis, the gut microbiota, and PD has the potential to lead to new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Animal experiments suggest that fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is helpful for treating PD, and FMT is expected to be an effective treatment for PD in the future.",Brain research bulletin,2022,Siyu Dong; Mei Sun; Chuan He; Hong Cheng
35812394,Gut Microbiota: A Novel Therapeutic Target for Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor dysfunction. Growing evidence has demonstrated that gut dysbiosis is involved in the occurrence, development and progression of PD. Numerous clinical trials have identified the characteristics of the changed gut microbiota profiles, and preclinical studies in PD animal models have indicated that gut dysbiosis can influence the progression and onset of PD <i>via</i> increasing intestinal permeability, aggravating neuroinflammation, aggregating abnormal levels of Î±-synuclein fibrils, increasing oxidative stress, and decreasing neurotransmitter production. The gut microbiota can be considered promising diagnostic and therapeutic targets for PD, which can be regulated by probiotics, psychobiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, postbiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, diet modifications, and Chinese medicine. This review summarizes the recent studies in PD-associated gut microbiota profiles and functions, the potential roles, and mechanisms of gut microbiota in PD, and gut microbiota-targeted interventions for PD. Deciphering the underlying roles and mechanisms of the PD-associated gut microbiota will help interpret the pathogenesis of PD from new perspectives and elucidate novel therapeutic strategies for PD.",Frontiers in immunology,2022,Manlian Zhu; Xia Liu; Yiru Ye; Xiumei Yan; Yiwen Cheng; Longyou Zhao; Feng Chen; Zongxin Ling
36408101,Interactions between gut microbiota and Parkinson's disease: The role of microbiota-derived amino acid metabolism.,"Non-motor symptoms (NMS) of Parkinson's disease (PD), such as constipation, sleep disorders, and olfactory deficits, may emerge up to 20 years earlier than motor symptoms. A series of evidence indicates that the pathology of PD may occur from the gastrointestinal tract to the brain. Numerous studies support that the gut microbiota communicates with the brain through the immune system, special amino acid metabolism, and the nervous system in PD. Recently, there is growing recognition that the gut microbiota plays a vital role in the modulation of multiple neurochemical pathways <i>via</i> the ""gut microbiota-brain axis"" (GMBA). Many gut microbiota metabolites, such as fatty acids, amino acids, and bile acids, convey signaling functions as they mediate the crosstalk between gut microbiota and host physiology. Amino acids' abundance and species alteration, including glutamate and tryptophan, may disturb the signaling transmission between nerve cells and disrupt the normal basal ganglia function in PD. Specific amino acids and their receptors are considered new potential targets for ameliorating PD. The present study aimed to systematically summarize all available evidence on the gut microbiota-derived amino acid metabolism alterations associated with PD.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2022,Wang Wang; Shujun Jiang; Chengcheng Xu; Lili Tang; Yan Liang; Yang Zhao; Guoxue Zhu

36421902,Approaching the Gut and Nasal Microbiota in Parkinson's Disease in the Era of the Seed Amplification Assays.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder often associated with pre-motor symptoms involving both gastrointestinal and olfactory tissues. PD patients frequently suffer from hyposmia, hyposalivation, dysphagia and gastrointestinal dysfunctions. During the last few years it has been speculated that microbial agents could play a crucial role in PD. In particular, alterations of the microbiota composition (dysbiosis) might contribute to the formation of misfolded Î±-synuclein, which is believed to be the leading cause of PD. However, while several findings confirmed that there might be an important link between intestinal microbiota alterations and PD onset, little is known about the potential contribution of the nasal microbiota. Here, we describe the latest findings on this topic by considering that more than 80% of patients with PD develop remarkable olfactory deficits in their prodromal disease stage. Therefore, the nasal microbiota might contribute to PD, eventually boosting the gut microbiota in promoting disease onset. Finally, we present the applications of the seed amplification assays to the study of the gut and olfactory mucosa of PD patients, and how they could be exploited to investigate whether pathogenic bacteria present in the gut and the nose might promote Î±-synuclein misfolding and aggregation.",Brain sciences,2022,Alessandra Consonni; Martina Miglietti; Chiara Maria Giulia De Luca; Federico Angelo Cazzaniga; Arianna Ciullini; Ilaria Linda Dellarole; Giuseppe Bufano; Alessio Di Fonzo; Giorgio Giaccone; Fulvio Baggi; Fabio Moda
35304983,Modifying the diet and gut microbiota to prevent and manage neurodegenerative diseases.,"The global prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease is steadily increasing due to the aging population. The lack of effective drugs against these neurodegenerative disorders makes it imperative to identify new strategies for their prevention and treatment. Recent studies have revealed that harnessing the power of the gut microbiota through modification of diet may be a valuable approach for reducing the risk, modulating the symptoms, and ameliorating the pathophysiological aspects of neurodegenerative diseases. Consuming specific dietary components can alter the prevalence of bacterial communities within the gut to a healthy enterotype, which can influence the production of beneficial metabolites by microbiota. This article focuses on several dietary components, which have been demonstrated to affect the gut microbiota-brain axis and therefore could lead to attenuation of specific pathological processes in neurodegenerative diseases. Published evidence indicates that fermented foods, including kefir, and foods that are high in bioactive polyphenols and complex carbohydrates, such as grapes, pomegranates, and seaweed, may be effective at reducing neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, neurotransmitter dysfunction, and neuronal death associated with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Even though experimental evidence supporting the protective properties of the above dietary components in these diseases is emerging, it is evident that further human clinical studies are required to conclusively establish the benefits of any suggested dietary interventions. The translational potential of such research is illustrated by theÂ clinical success of the recently developed Alzheimer's drug, GV-971, which is a seaweed derivative that works by modulating the gut microbiota-brain axis.",Reviews in the neurosciences,2022,Ellen J Gates; Anna K Bernath; Andis Klegeris
36034698,Curcumin-driven reprogramming of the gut microbiota and metabolome ameliorates motor deficits and neuroinflammation in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder, accompanied by motor deficits as well as gastrointestinal dysfunctions. Recent studies have proved that the disturbance of gut microbiota and metabolism contributes to the pathogenesis of PD; however, the mechanisms underlying these effects have yet to be elucidated. Curcumin (CUR) has been reported to provide neuroprotective effects on neurological disorders and modulate the gut flora in intestinal-related diseases. Therefore, it is of significant interest to investigate whether CUR could exert a protective effect on PD and whether the effect of CUR is dependent on the intestinal flora and subsequent changes in metabolites.In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of CUR on a mouse model of PD induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). 16S rRNA sequencing was performed to explore the profile of the gut microbiota among controls, MPTP-treated mice and CUR-treated mice. Then, antibiotic treatment (ABX) and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiments were conducted to examine the role of intestinal microbes on the protective effects of CUR in PD mice. Furthermore, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS)-based metabolomics analysis was used to identify the landscape of the CUR-driven serum metabolome. Finally, Pearson's analysis was conducted to investigate correlations between the gut flora-metabolite axis and CUR-driven neuroprotection in PD.Our results showed that CUR intervention effectively improved motor deficits, glial cell activation, and the aggregation of Î±-synuclein (Î±-syn) in MPTP-treated mice. 16S rRNA sequencing showed elevated abundances of <i>Muribaculaceae</i>, <i>Lactobacillaceae</i>, <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> and <i>Eggerthellaceae</i> but depleted abundances of <i>Aerococcaceae</i> and <i>Staphylococcaceae</i> in CUR-treated mice when compared with MPTP mice. ABX and FMT experiments further confirmed that the gut microbiota was required for CUR-induced protection in PD mice. Serum metabolomics analysis showed that CUR notably upregulated the levels of tyrosine, methionine, sarcosine and creatine. Importantly, strong correlations were identified among crucial taxa (<i>Aerococcaceae</i>, <i>Staphylococcaceae</i>, <i>Muribaculaceae</i>, <i>Lactobacillaceae</i>, <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> and <i>Eggerthellaceae</i>), pivotal metabolites (tyrosine, methionine, sarcosine and creatine) and the motor function and pathological results of mice. CUR treatment led to a rapid increase in the brain levels of tyrosine and levodopa (dopa) these changes were related to the abundances of <i>Lactobacillaceae</i> and <i>Aerococcaceae</i>.CUR exerts a protective effect on the progression of PD by modulating the gut microbiota-metabolite axis. <i>Lactobacillaceae</i> and <i>Aerococcaceae</i>, along with key metabolites such as tyrosine and dopa play a dominant role in CUR-associated neuroprotection in PD mice. Our findings offer unique insights into the pathogenesis and potential treatment of PD.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2022,Can Cui; Yingying Han; Hongxia Li; Hongxiang Yu; Bei Zhang; Gang Li
36613486,Mediterranean Diet and Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder, diagnosed on the basis of typical motor disturbances, but also characterized by the presence of non-motor symptoms, such as rapid eye movement (REM)-sleep behavior disorders, olfactory impairment, and constipation, which are often prodromal to the onset of the disease. PD is often associated with the presence of oxidative brain injury and chronic neuroinflammation, with infiltration and accumulation of peripheral immune cells that have been found in affected brain regions of PD patients. Recently, the role of the gut-brain axis in the pathogenesis of PD is getting more and more attention, and several pieces of evidence indicate alterations in the gut microbiota of PD-affected patients. Diet exerts a central role in defining the microbiota composition and different dietetic patterns can result in a higher or lower abundance of specific bacteria that, in turn, can affect gut permeability and express anti- or pro-inflammatory metabolites. In the present review, the effects of the Mediterranean diet in modulating both PD onset and its progression will be considered with a special focus on the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of this dietetic regimen as well as on its effects on the microbiota composition.",International journal of molecular sciences,2022,Marco Bisaglia

Our results indicated that <i>L. plantarum</i> DP189 increased the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxide (GSH-Px), and interleukin-10 (IL-10) and decreased the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), reactive oxygen species (ROS), tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²). Moreover, <i>L. plantarum</i> DP189 reduced the Î±-SYN accumulation in SN. Mechanistically, <i>L. plantarum</i> DP189 activated the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2)/ARE and PGC-1Î± pathways and suppressed the NLRP3 inflammasome. Furthermore, fecal analysis showed that <i>L. plantarum</i> DP189 reshaped the gut microbiota in PD mice by reducing the number of pathogenic bacteria (<i>Proteobacteria</i> and <i>Actinobacteria</i>) and increased the abundance of probiotics (<i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Prevotella</i>).

34985325,A Comprehensive Review on the Role of the Gut Microbiome in Human Neurological Disorders.,"The human body is full of an extensive number of commensal microbes, consisting of bacteria, viruses, and fungi, collectively termed the human microbiome. The initial acquisition of microbiota occurs from both the external and maternal environments, and the vast majority of them colonize the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). These microbial communities play a central role in the maturation and development of the immune system, the central nervous system, and the GIT system and are also responsible for essential metabolic pathways. Various factors, including host genetic predisposition, environmental factors, lifestyle, diet, antibiotic or nonantibiotic drug use, etc., affect the composition of the gut microbiota. Recent publications have highlighted that an imbalance in the gut microflora, known as dysbiosis, is associated with the onset and progression of neurological disorders. Moreover, characterization of the microbiome-host cross talk pathways provides insight into novel therapeutic strategies. Novel preclinical and clinical research on interventions related to the gut microbiome for treating neurological conditions, including autism spectrum disorders, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and stroke, hold significant promise. This review aims to present a comprehensive overview of the potential involvement of the human gut microbiome in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders, with a particular emphasis on the potential of microbe-based therapies and/or diagnostic microbial biomarkers.

34492236,Probiotics: Potential novel therapeutics for microbiota-gut-brain axis dysfunction across gender and lifespan.,"Probiotics are live microorganisms, which when administered in adequate amounts, present a health benefit for the host. While the beneficial effects of probiotics on gastrointestinal function are generally well recognized, new animal research and clinical studies have found that alterations in gut microbial communities can have a broad range of effects throughout the body. Non-intestinal sites impacted include the immune, endocrine, cardiovascular and the central nervous system (CNS). In particular, there has been a growing interest and appreciation about the role that gut microbiota may play in affecting CNS-related function through the 'microbiota-gut-brain axis'. Emerging evidence suggests potential therapeutic benefits of probiotics in several CNS conditions, such as anxiety, depression, autism spectrum disorders and Parkinson's disease. There may also be some gender-specific variances in terms of probiotic mediated effects, with the gut microbiota shaping and being concurrently molded by the hormonal environment governing differences between the sexes. Probiotics may influence the ability of the gut microbiome to affect a variety of biological processes in the host, including neurotransmitter activity, vagal neurotransmission, generation of neuroactive metabolites and inflammatory response mediators. Some of these may engage in cross talk with host sex hormones, such as estrogens, which could be of relevance in relation to their effects on stress response and cognitive health.

We also evaluate how these new learnings may impact industrial effort in probiotic research and the discovery and development of novel and more personalized, condition-specific, beneficial probiotic therapeutic agents.",Pharmacology & therapeutics,2022,Shikha Snigdha; Kevin Ha; Paul Tsai; Timothy G Dinan; Jeremy D Bartos; Mohammed Shahid
35203645,Role of Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis in Regulating Dopaminergic Signaling.,"Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a critical role both peripherally and centrally in vital functions such as cognition, reward, satiety, voluntary motor movements, pleasure, and motivation. Optimal dopamine bioavailability is essential for normal brain functioning and protection against the development of neurological diseases. Emerging evidence shows that gut microbiota have significant roles in maintaining adequate concentrations of dopamine via intricate, bidirectional communication known as the microbiota-gut-brain axis. The vagus nerve, immune system, hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, and microbial metabolites serve as important mediators of the reciprocal microbiota-gut-brain signaling. Furthermore, gut microbiota contain intrinsic enzymatic activity that is highly involved in dopamine metabolism, facilitating dopamine synthesis as well as its metabolite breakdown. This review examines the relationship between key genera of gut microbiota such as <i>Prevotella, Bacteroides, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium,</i><i>Enterococcus,</i> and <i>Ruminococcus</i> and their effects on dopamine. The effects of gut dysbiosis on dopamine bioavailability and the subsequent impact on dopamine-related pathological conditions such as Parkinson's disease are also discussed. Understanding the role of gut microbiota in modulating dopamine activity and bioavailability both in the periphery and in the central nervous system can help identify new therapeutic targets as well as optimize available methods to prevent, delay, or restore dopaminergic deficits in neurologic and metabolic disorders.",Biomedicines,2022,Sevag Hamamah; Armin Aghazarian; Anthony Nazaryan; Andras Hajnal; Mihai Covasa

Microbiota transplantation from PD patients to mice can induce increased alpha-synuclein-mediated motor deficits. Human studies have identified differences in the gut microbiota of PD patients compared to healthy controls.

We evaluated the resulting studies focusing on bacterial taxa that were different between PD patients and healthy controls.Twenty-six studies were found in which 53 microbial families and 98 genera exhibited differences between patients with PD and healthy controls. The genera identified by more than two studies as increased in PD were Bifidobacterium, Alistipes, Christensenella, Enterococcus, Oscillospira, Bilophila, Desulfovibrio, Escherichia/Shigella, and Akkermansia, while Prevotella, Blautia, Faecalibacterium, Fusicatenibacter, and Haemophilus had three or more reports of being lower in PD patients.

35923300,The Role of Gut Microbiota in the Progression of Parkinson's Disease and the Mechanism of Intervention by Traditional Chinese Medicine.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common degenerative disease of the nervous system that seriously affects the quality of life of the patients. The pathogenesis of PD is not yet fully clear. Previous studies have confirmed that patients with PD exhibit obvious gut microbiota imbalance, while intervention of PD by regulating the gut microbiota has become an important approach to the prevention and treatment of this disease. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been shown to be safe and effective in treating PD. It has the advantages of affecting multiple targets. Studies have shown TCM can regulate gut microbiota. However, the specific mechanism of action is still unclear. Therefore, this article will mainly discuss the association of the alteration of the gut microbiota and the incidence of PD, the advantages of TCM in treating PD, and the mechanism of regulating gut microbiota by TCM to treat PD. It will clarify the target and mechanism of TCM treating PD by acting gut microbiota and provided a novel methodology for the prevention and treatment of PD.",Neuropsychiatric disease and treatment,2022,Pengfei Huan; Li Wang; Zhuqing He; Jiancheng He
36075637,Enteric nervous system and intestinal epithelial regulation of the gut-brain axis.,"The gut-brain axis describes a bidirectional interplay within the enteric environment between the intestinal epithelium, the mucosal immune system, and the microbiota with the enteric nervous system. This interplay provides a link between exogenous environmental stimuli such as nutrient sensing, and nervous system function, as well as a mechanism of feedback from cortical and sensory centers of the brain to enteric activities. The intestinal epithelium is one of the human body's largest sources of hormones and neurotransmitters, which have critical effects on neuronal function. The influence of the gut microbiota on these processes appears to be profound; yet to date, it has been insufficiently explored. Disruption of the intestinal microbiota is linked not only to diseases in the gut but also to brain symptomatology, including neurodegenerative and behavioral disorders (Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, autism, and anxiety and/or depression). In this review we discuss the cellular wiring of the gut-brain axis, with a particular focus on the epithelial and neuronal interaction, the evidence that has led to our current understanding of the intestinal role in neurologic function, and future directions of research to unravel this important interaction in both healthÂ and allergic disease.",The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,2022,Laura R Dowling; Michael R Strazzari; Simon Keely; Gerard E Kaiko
33649989,The Gut-Brain Axis: Two Ways Signaling in Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic, progressive and second most prevalent neurological disorder affecting the motor system. Cardinal motor impairment and Î±-synucleinopathy are the characteristic features of PD. Recently, it has been identified that the gut-brain axis is substantially regulated by the gut microbiome (GM) through an immunological, neuroendocrine, and neural mechanism. However, disturbance in the gut-microbiome-brain axis in PD might proceed to gastrointestinal manifestations intermittently leading to the motor system and the PD pathogenesis itself. The gut microbial toxins may induce the production of Î±-synuclein (Î±-syn) aggregates in the enteric nervous system (ENS), which may proliferate and propagate in a prion-like-manner through the vagus nerve to the central nervous system (CNS); supporting the hypothesis that, GM might play a pivotal role in PD pathogenesis. Overstimulated innate immune system due to intestinal bacterial overgrowth or gut dysbiosis and the enhanced intestinal permeability may persuade systemic inflammation, while the activation of enteric glial cells and enteric neurons may contribute to Î±-synucleinopathy. Gut microbiota can bear a significant impact on neurological outcomes such as learning, memory and cognition. In this review paper, we summarize how the alterations in gut microbiota and ENS inflammation are associated with PD pathogenesis. The evidence supporting the causative role played by gut-associated dysbiosis and microbial byproducts, in the onset of PD is also discussed.

35275534,"Investigating Casual Associations Among Gut Microbiota, Metabolites, and Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Mendelian Randomization Study.","Recent studies had explored that gut microbiota was associated with neurodegenerative diseases (including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)) through the gut-brain axis, among which metabolic pathways played an important role. However, the underlying causality remained unclear.Our study aimed to evaluate potential causal relationships between gut microbiota, metabolites, and neurodegenerative diseases through Mendelian randomization (MR) approach.We selected genetic variants associated with gut microbiota traits (Nâ=â18,340) and gut microbiota-derived metabolites (Nâ=â7,824) from genome-wide association studies. Summary statistics of neurodegenerative diseases were obtained from IGAP (AD, 17,008 cases; 37,154 controls), IPDGC (PD, 37,688 cases; 141,779 controls), and IALSC (ALS, 20,806 cases; 59,804 controls) respectively.Greater abundance of Ruminococcus (OR, 1.245; 95% CI, 1.103-1.405; pâ=â0.0004) was found significantly related to higher risk of ALS. Besides, our study found suggestive associations of Actinobacteria, Lactobacillaceae, Faecalibacterium, Ruminiclostridium, and Lachnoclostridium with AD, of Lentisphaerae, Lentisphaeria, Oxalobacteraceae, Victivallales, Bacillales, Eubacteriumhalliigroup, Anaerostipes, and Clostridiumsensustricto1 with PD, and of Lachnospira, Fusicatenibacter, Catenibacterium, and Ruminococcusgnavusgroup with ALS. Our study also revealed suggestive associations between 12 gut microbiome-dependent metabolites and neurodegenerative diseases. Glutamine was related to lower risk of AD. For the serotonin pathway, serotonin was found as a protective factor of PD, while kynurenine as a risk factor for ALS.Our study firstly applied a two-sample MR approach to detect causal relationships among gut microbiota, gut metabolites, and neurodegenerative diseases.

36430144,What Are the Key Gut Microbiota Involved in Neurological Diseases? A Systematic Review.,"There is a growing body of evidence highlighting there are significant changes in the gut microbiota composition and relative abundance in various neurological disorders. We performed a systematic review of the different microbiota altered in a wide range of neurological disorders (Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and stroke). Fifty-two studies were included representing 5496 patients. At the genus level, the most frequently involved microbiota are Akkermansia, Faecalibacterium, and Prevotella. The overlap between the pathologies was strongest for MS and PD, sharing eight genera (Akkermansia, Butyricicoccus, Bifidobacterium, Coprococcus, Dorea, Faecalibacterium, Parabacteroides, and Prevotella) and PD and stroke, sharing six genera (Enterococcus, Faecalibacterium, Lactobacillus, Parabacteroides, Prevotella, and Roseburia). The identification signatures overlapping for AD, PD, and MS raise the question of whether these reflect a common etiology or rather common consequence of these diseases. The interpretation is hampered by the low number and low power for AD, ALS, and stroke with ample opportunity for false positive and false negative findings.",International journal of molecular sciences,2022,Bruno BonnechÃ¨re; Najaf Amin; Cornelia van Duijn
36126853,Role of gut microbiota-derived branched-chain amino acids in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease: An animal study.,"Neuroinflammation caused by the disorder of gut microbiota and its metabolites is associated with the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Thus, it is necessary to identify certain molecules derived from gut microbiota to verify whether they could become intervention targets for the treatment of PD. The branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), as a common dietary supplement, could modulate brain function. Herein, we investigated the longitudinal shifts of microbial community in mice treated with rotenone for 0, 3 and 4Â weeks by 16S rRNA gene sequencing to identify the microbial markers at different PD stages. Serum BCAAs were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Then, rotenone-induced mice were given a high BCAA diet to evaluate the motor and non-motor functions, dopaminergic neuron loss, and inflammation levels. Using a PD mouse model, we discovered that during PD progression, the alterations of gut microbiota compositions led to the peripheral decrease of BCAAs. Based on the serum lipopolysaccharide binding protein concentrations and the levels of pro-inflammatory factors (including tumor necrosis factor-Î±, interleukin [IL]-1Î², and IL-6) in the colon and substantia nigra, we found that the high BCAA diet could attenuate the inflammatory levels in PD mice, and reverse motor and non-motor dysfunctions and dopaminergic neuron impairment. Together, our results emphasize the dynamic changes of gut microbiota and BCAA metabolism and propose a novel strategy for PD therapy: a high BCAA diet intervention could improve PD progression by regulating the levels of inflammation.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2022,Zhenzhen Yan; Fan Yang; Linlin Sun; Jing Yu; Lina Sun; Yao Si; Lifen Yao
34536490,"Gut dysbiosis, defective autophagy and altered immune responses in neurodegenerative diseases: Tales of a vicious cycle.","The human microbiota comprises trillions of symbiotic microorganisms and is involved in regulating gastrointestinal (GI), immune, nervous system and metabolic homeostasis. Recent observations suggest a bidirectional communication between the gut microbiota and the brain via immune, circulatory and neural pathways, termed the Gut-Brain Axis (GBA). Alterations in gut microbiota composition, such as seen with an increased number of pathobionts and a decreased number of symbionts, termed gut dysbiosis or microbial intestinal dysbiosis, plays a prominent role in the pathogenesis of central nervous system (CNS)-related disorders. Clinical reports confirm that GI symptoms often precede neurological symptoms several years before the development of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). Pathologically, gut dysbiosis disrupts the integrity of the intestinal barrier leading to ingress of pathobionts and toxic metabolites into the systemic circulation causing GBA dysregulation. Subsequently, chronic neuroinflammation via dysregulated immune activation triggers the accumulation of neurotoxic misfolded proteins in and around CNS cells resulting in neuronal death. Emerging evidence links gut dysbiosis to the aggravation and/or spread of proteinopathies from the peripheral nervous system to the CNS and defective autophagy-mediated proteinopathies. This review summarizes the current understanding of the role of gut microbiota in NDDs, and highlights a vicious cycle of gut dysbiosis, immune-mediated chronic neuroinflammation, impaired autophagy and proteinopathies, which contributes to the development of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration.

35456966,Biomarker of Neuroinflammation in Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is caused by abnormal accumulation of Î±-synuclein in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra, which subsequently causes motor symptoms. Neuroinflammation plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration in PD. This neuroinflammatory neurodegeneration involves the activation of microglia, upregulation of proinflammatory factors, and gut microbiota. In this review, we summarized the recent findings on detection of PD by using inflammatory biomarkers, such as interleukin (IL)-1Î², IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î±; regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and presumably secreted (RANTES) and high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hsCRP); and radiotracers such as [11C]PK11195 and [18F]-FEPPA, as well as by monitoring disease progression and the treatment response. Many PD-causing mutations in <i>SNCA</i>, <i>LRRK2</i>, <i>PRKN</i>, <i>PINK1</i>, and <i>DJ-1</i> are also associated with neuroinflammation.

There is evidence for decreased gut barrier function and leak of bacterial antigen across the gut epithelium with sub-mucosal inflammation and systemic exposure to the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide. Preclinical evidence supports these clinical findings and suggests that systemic inflammation can affect the CNS through vagal pathways or the systemic circulation. We will review recent preclinical and clinical evidence to support this mechanism and suggest possible treatments directed at the gut-brain axis.",Frontiers in neurology,2022,Kathleen M Shannon
35411052,Multiomics implicate gut microbiota in altered lipid and energy metabolism in Parkinson's disease.,"We aimed to investigate the link between serum metabolites, gut bacterial community composition, and clinical variables in Parkinson's disease (PD) and healthy control subjects (HC). A total of 124 subjects were part of the study (63 PD patients and 61 HC subjects). 139 metabolite features were found to be predictive between the PD and Control groups. No associations were found between metabolite features and within-PD clinical variables. The results suggest alterations in serum metabolite profiles in PD, and the results of correlation analysis between metabolite features and microbiota suggest that several bacterial taxa are associated with altered lipid and energy metabolism in PD.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2022,Pedro A B Pereira; Drupad K Trivedi; Justin Silverman; Ilhan Cem Duru; Lars Paulin; Petri Auvinen; Filip Scheperjans
36359864,Rifaximin Modifies Gut Microbiota and Attenuates Inflammation in Parkinson's Disease: Preclinical and Clinical Studies.,"Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) exhibit distinct gut microbiota, which may promote gut-derived inflammation. Rifaximin is a nonabsorbable antibiotic that can modify gut microbiota. The present study investigated the effect of rifaximin on gut microbiota and inflammation status in PD. The study examined the effect of long-term rifaximin treatment on in vivo transgenic PD mice (MitoPark) and short-term rifaximin treatment on patients with PD. Rifaximin treatment caused a significant change in gut microbiota in the transgenic PD mice; in particular, it reduced the relative abundance of <i>Prevotellaceae UCG-001</i> and increased the relative abundance of <i>Bacteroides</i>, <i>Muribaculum</i>, and <i>Lachnospiraceae UCG-001</i>. Rifaximin treatment attenuated serum interleukin-1Î², interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-Î±, claudin-5 and occludin, which indicated the reduction of systemic inflammation and the protection of the blood-brain barrier integrity. The rifaximin-treated MitoPark mice exhibited better motor and memory performance than did the control mice, with lower microglial activation and increased neuronal survival in the hippocampus. In the patients with PD, 7-day rifaximin treatment caused an increase in the relative abundance of <i>Flavonifractor</i> 6 months after treatment, and the change in plasma proinflammatory cytokine levels was negatively associated with the baseline plasma interleukin-1Î± level. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that rifaximin exerted a neuroprotective effect on the transgenic PD mice by modulating gut microbiota. We observed that patients with higher baseline inflammation possibly benefited from rifaximin treatment. With consideration for the tolerability and safety of rifaximin, randomized controlled trials should investigate the disease-modification effect of long-term treatment on select patients with PD.",Cells,2022,Chien-Tai Hong; Lung Chan; Kai-Yun Chen; Hsun-Hua Lee; Li-Kai Huang; Yu-Chen S H Yang; Yun-Ru Liu; Chaur-Jong Hu
35708472,Neuroinflammation: A Distal Consequence of Periodontitis.,"Periodontitis, a chronic, inflammatory disease, induces systemic inflammation and contributes to the development of neurodegenerative diseases. The precise etiology of the most common neurodegenerative disorders, such as sporadic Alzheimer's, Parkinson's diseases and multiple sclerosis (AD, PD, and MS, respectively), remains to be revealed. Chronic neuroinflammation is a well-recognized component of these disorders, and evidence suggests that systemic inflammation is a possible stimulus for neuroinflammation development. Systemic inflammation can lead to deleterious consequences on the brain if the inflammation is sufficiently severe or if the brain shows vulnerabilities due to genetic predisposition, aging, or neurodegenerative diseases. It has been proposed that periodontal disease can initiate or contribute to the AD pathogenesis through multiple pathways, including key periodontal pathogens. Dysbiotic oral bacteria can release bacterial products into the bloodstream and eventually cross the brain-blood barrier; these bacteria can also cause alterations to gut microbiota that enhance inflammation and potentially affect brain function via the gut-brain axis. The trigeminal nerve has been suggested as another route for connecting oral bacterial products to the brain. PD and MS are often preceded by gastrointestinal symptoms or aberrant gut microbiome composition, and alterations in the enteric nervous system accompany the disease. Clinical evidence has suggested that patients with periodontitis are at a higher risk of developing PD and MS. This nexus among the brain, periodontal disease, and systemic inflammation heralds new ways in which microglial cells, the main innate immune cells, and astrocytes, the crucial regulators of innate and adaptive immune responses in the brain, contribute to brain pathology. Currently, the lack of understanding of the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration is hindering treatment development. However, we may prevent this pathogenesis by tackling one of its possible contributors (periodontitis) for systemic inflammation through simple preventive oral hygiene measures.",Journal of dental research,2022,X Li; M Kiprowska; T Kansara; P Kansara; P Li
36467550,Curcumin Regulates Gut Microbiota and Exerts a Neuroprotective Effect in the MPTP Model of Parkinson's Disease.,"The experiment aimed to explore the effects of curcumin on motor impairment, dopamine neurons, and gut microbiota in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mice model.Mice were randomly assigned to six groups: normal control group, solvent control group, MPTP group, curcumin-low-dose group (40âmg/kg), curcumin-medium-dose group (80âmg/kg), and curcumin-high-dose group (160âmg/kg). After 14 days, each group of mice was subjected to the pole text, the hanging test, and the open-field test. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunohistochemistry was used to observe the survival of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons. Moreover, ultrastructural changes were observed with a transmission electron microscope in mice striatal tissue cells. Then, 16S rRNA was used to assess changes in the gut microbiota.(1) Each dose of curcumin reduced pole climbing time and increased suspension score and total distance moved dose-dependently. (2) All curcumin groups improved cell wrinkling and vacuolar degeneration, increased the number of TH positives, improved cell survival, and the higher the dose of curcumin, the better the effect. (3) There were differences in microbiota composition and a relative abundance among the groups. The relative abundance of <i>Patescibacteria</i>, <i>Proteobacteria</i>, and <i>Verrucomicrobia</i> was higher in the MPTP group. The relative abundance of <i>Patescibacteria</i>, <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i>, <i>Enterococcaceae</i> all decreased in all curcumin groups. In addition, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways showed a reduction in the superpathway of N-acetylneuraminate degradation after medium- and high-dose curcumin administration.Curcumin regulates gut microbiota and exerts a neuroprotective effect in the MPTP mice model. This preliminary study demonstrates the therapeutic potential of curcumin for Parkinson's disease, providing clues for microbially targeted therapies for Parkinson's disease.",Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,2022,Hong Zhu; Houwen Zhang; Bonan Hou; Bin Xu; Liting Ji; You Wu
36362150,Mucosal Immunity and the Gut-Microbiota-Brain-Axis in Neuroimmune Disease.,"Recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have opened the door to a wellspring of information regarding the composition of the gut microbiota. Leveraging NGS technology, early metagenomic studies revealed that several diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, autism, and myalgic encephalomyelitis, are characterized by alterations in the diversity of gut-associated microbes. More recently, interest has shifted toward understanding how these microbes impact their host, with a special emphasis on their interactions with the brain. Such interactions typically occur either systemically, through the production of small molecules in the gut that are released into circulation, or through signaling via the vagus nerves which directly connect the enteric nervous system to the central nervous system. Collectively, this system of communication is now commonly referred to as the gut-microbiota-brain axis. While equally important, little attention has focused on the causes of the alterations in the composition of gut microbiota. Although several factors can contribute, mucosal immunity plays a significant role in shaping the microbiota in both healthy individuals and in association with several diseases. The purpose of this review is to provide a brief overview of the components of mucosal immunity that impact the gut microbiota and then discuss how altered immunological conditions may shape the gut microbiota and consequently affect neuroimmune diseases, using a select group of common neuroimmune diseases as examples.",International journal of molecular sciences,2022,Kathryn G Sterling; Griffin Kutler Dodd; Shatha Alhamdi; Peter G Asimenios; Ruben K Dagda; Kenny L De Meirleir; Dorothy Hudig; Vincent C Lombardi
35730414,The role of nutrition on Parkinson's disease: a systematic review.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) in elderly patients is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease. The pathogenesis of PD is associated with dopaminergic neuron degeneration of the substantia nigra in the basal ganglia, causing classic motor symptoms. Oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation have been identified as possible pathways in laboratory investigations. Nutrition, a potentially versatile factor from all environmental factors affecting PD, has received intense research scrutiny.A systematic search was conducted in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and WEB OF SCIENCE databases from 2000 until the present. Only randomized clinical trials (RCTs), observational case-control studies, and follow-up studies were included.We retrieved fifty-two studies that met the inclusion criteria. Most selected studies investigated the effects of malnutrition and the Mediterranean diet (MeDiet) on PD incidence and progression. Other investigations contributed evidence on the critical role of microbiota, vitamins, polyphenols, dairy products, coffee, and alcohol intake.There are still many concerns regarding the association between PD and nutrition, possibly due to underlying genetic and environmental factors. However, there is a body of evidence revealing that correcting malnutrition, gut microbiota, and following the MeDiet reduced the onset of PD and reduced clinical progression. Other factors, such as polyphenols, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and coffee intake, can have a potential protective effect. Conversely, milk and its accessory products can increase PD risk.

36558531,The Interaction of Polyphenols and the Gut Microbiota in Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Polyphenols are secondary metabolites of plants and play a potential role in the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases (NND) such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) due to their unique physiological functions such as acting as antioxidants, being anti-inflammatory, being neuroprotective, and promoting intestinal health. Since dietary polyphenols exist in plant foods in the form of glycosylation or esterification or are combined with polymers, they need to undergo extensive metabolism through phase I and phase II biotransformations by various intestinal enzymes, as well as metabolism by the intestinal microbiota before they can be fully absorbed. Polyphenols improve intestinal microbiota disorders by influencing the structure and function of intestinal microbiota, inducing beneficial bacteria to produce a variety of metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), promoting the secretion of hormones and neurotransmitters, and playing an important role in the prevention and treatment of NND by affecting the microbe-gut-brain axis. We review the ways in which some polyphenols can change the composition of the intestinal microbiota and their metabolites in AD or PD animal models to exert the role of slowing down the progression of NND, aiming to provide evidence for the role of polyphenols in slowing the progression of NND via the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis.",Nutrients,2022,Yuan Zhang; Wanpeng Yu; Lei Zhang; Man Wang; Wenguang Chang

36200207,Microbiota- Brain-Gut-Axis Relevance to Parkinson's Disease: Potential Therapeutic Effects of Probiotics.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common type of neurogenerative disease among middleaged and older people, characterized by aggregation of alpha-synuclein and dopaminergic neuron loss. The microbiota- gut-brain axis is a dynamic bidirectional communication network and is involved in the pathogenesis of PD. The aggregation of misfolded protein alpha-synuclein is a neuropathological characteristic of PD, originates in the gut and migrates to the central nervous system (CNS) through the vagus nerve and olfactory bulb. The change in the architecture of gut microbiota increases the level short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and other metabolites, acting on the neuroendocrine system and modulating the concentrations of gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), serotonin, and other neurotransmitters. It also alters the vagus and intestinal signalling, influencing the brain and behaviour by activating microglia and systemic cytokines. Both experimental and clinical reports indicate the role of intestinal dysbiosis and microbiota host interaction in neurodegeneration. Probiotics are live microorganisms that modify the gut microbiota in the small intestine to avoid neurological diseases. Probiotics have been shown in clinical and preclinical studies to be effective in the treatment of PD by balancing the gut microbiota. In this article, we described the role of gut-microbiota in the pathogenesis of PD. The article aims to explore the mechanistic strategy of the gut-brain axis and its relation with motor impairment and the use of probiotics to maintain gut microbial flora and prevent PD-like symptoms.",Current pharmaceutical design,2022,Khadga Raj; Shamsher Singh; Shivani Chib; Sudhanshu Mallan

However, whether gut dysbiosis can cause motor complications is unclear.Subjects were enrolled from four independent movement disorder centers in Japan. We performed 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequence analysis of gut microbiota. Relative abundance of gut microbiota and relationships between them and clinical characteristics were statistically analyzed. Analysis of co-variance (ANCOVA) was used to assess altered gut microbiota associated with wearing-off or dyskinesia.We enrolled 223 patients with PD. Wearing-off was noted in 47.5% of patients and dyskinesia in 21.9%. We detected 98 genera of bacteria. Some changes in the gut microbiota were observed in patients with PD and motor complications. After Bonferroni correction, patients with wearing-off showed decreased relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae Blautia (pÂ <Â 0.0001) and increased relative abundance of Lactobacillaceae Lactobacillus (pÂ <Â 0.0001), but patients with dyskinesia no longer showed significant changes in the gut microbiota.

35599496,"Effects of Gut Microbiota Alterations on Motor, Gastrointestinal, and Behavioral Phenotype in a Mouse Model of Parkinson's Disease.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multi-system disorder consisting of not only classic motor symptoms but also a variety of non-motor symptoms including gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction and mood disorders. The gut microbiota has been suggested to play a role in modulating PD motor and non-motor features, although the causality and mechanisms behind these proposed interactions remains largely understudied.In this study, we aimed to provide in-depth characterization of an established mouse model of PD (transgenic (TG) SNCA A53T) and experimentally address how changes to the gut microbiota impact the PD-like phenotype.We profiled the PD-like phenotype of transgenic mice through a panel of motor, GI, and behavioral tests. We then investigated how antibiotic treatment or gut microbial community transfer (via cohousing with wild-type mice) impacted the PD-like phenotype.We found that this mouse model demonstrated early (6 weeks of age) motor symptoms when compared to a wild-type control mouse strain. Transgenic mice also exhibited early GI dysfunction, as well as behavioral alterations, including reduced anxiety-like behavior, and increased depression-like and apathy-like behavior. Compared to wild-type mice, the transgenic fecal microbiota was less diverse and compositionally distinct. Interestingly, drastic alterations to the gut microbiota, through antibiotic treatment or cohousing with wild-type mice, had a minimal effect on the motor, GI, and behavioral phenotype of transgenic mice.We concluded that this mouse model effectively recapitulates motor and non-motor features of PD; however, the gut microbiota appears to exhibit a minor impact on the pathophysiology of this PD model.",Journal of Parkinson's disease,2022,Nina Radisavljevic; Mihai Cirstea; Kylynda Bauer; Christine Lo; Avril Metcalfe-Roach; Tahereh Bozorgmehr; Haggai Bar-Yoseph; B Brett Finlay

The inflammatory responses of astrocytes and microglia during parasite infection are strongly influenced by a variety of environmental factors. Although it has recently been shown that the gut microbiota influences the physiology and immunomodulation of the central nervous system in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's, the putative link in parasite-induced neuroinflammatory diseases has not been well characterized. Likewise, the central nervous system can influence the gut microbiota. In parasite infections, the gut microbiota is strongly perturbed and might influence the severity of the central nervous system inflammation response through changes in the production of bacterial metabolites.

36018501,"Diet, Gut Microbiome, and Cognitive Decline.","An epidemic of age-associated cognitive decline, most commonly ascribed to neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, is causing healthcare costs to soar and devastating caregivers. An estimated 6.5 million Americans are living today with Alzheimer's disease, with 13.8 million cases projected by mid-century. Although genetic mutations are known to cause neurodegeneration, autosomal dominant disease is very rare and most sporadic cases can be attributed, at least in part, to modifiable risk factors.Diet is a potential modifiable risk factor in cognitive decline. Food communicates with the brain through a complex signaling web involving multiple cells, mediators and receptors. Gut-brain communication is modulated by microorganisms including bacteria, archaea, viruses, and unicellular eukaryotes, which together constitute the microbiota. Microbes not only play major roles in the digestion and fermentation of the food, providing nutrients and bioactive metabolites, but also reflect the type and amount of food consumed and food-borne toxic exposures.

As a result of these investigations, the so-called gut-brain axis arises. Despite its influence on the evolution and development of cognitive impairment, the gut-brain axis is little defined and demonstrated.To provide the best scientific evidence available on the relationship between the gut microbiota and Alzheimer's disease.Systematic and narrative review of the information generated in the last 5 years in national and international databases, in English and Spanish.Eight observational studies were selected, carried out in humans and, therefore, suitable for inclusion in this review.The results of these studies support the hypothesis that there is a relationship between the gut microbiota and cognitive disorders through the gut-brain axis. However, today, there is a substantial lack of human studies, especially clinical trials, which makes it difficult to formulate clinical recommendations on this topic.",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2022,Elisa Marina GonzÃ¡lez Cordero; Miguel Angel Cuevas-Budhart; Diana PÃ©rez MorÃ¡n; Miguel Angel Trejo Villeda; Mercedes Gomez-Del-Pulgar GÂª-Madrid
35890040,Gut Microbes and Neuropathology: Is There a Causal Nexus?,"The gut microbiota is a virtual organ which produces a myriad of molecules that the brain and other organs require. Humans and microbes are in a symbiotic relationship, we feed the microbes, and in turn, they provide us with essential molecules. Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes phyla account for around 80% of the total human gut microbiota, and approximately 1000 species of bacteria have been identified in the human gut. In adults, the main factors influencing microbiota structure are diet, exercise, stress, disease and medications. In this narrative review, we explore the involvement of the gut microbiota in Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis and autism, as these are such high-prevalence disorders. We focus on preclinical studies that increase the understanding of disease pathophysiology. We examine the potential for targeting the gut microbiota in the development of novel therapies and the limitations of the currently published clinical studies. We conclude that while the field shows enormous promise, further large-scale studies are required if a causal link between these disorders and gut microbes is to be definitively established.","Pathogens (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,Katherine Dinan; Timothy G Dinan

35103734,Neuroprotection of chicoric acid in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease involves gut microbiota and TLR4 signaling pathway.,"Chicoric acid (CA), a polyphenolic acid obtained from chicory and purple coneflower (<i>Echinacea purpurea</i>), has been regarded as a nutraceutical to combat inflammation, viruses and obesity. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder, and the microbiota-gut-brain axis might be the potential mechanism in the pathogenesis and development of PD. The results obtained in this study demonstrated that oral pretreatments of CA significantly prevented the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced motor dysfunctions and death of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons along with the inhibition of glial hyperactivation and the increment in striatal neurotrophins. 16S rRNA sequence results showed that CA significantly reduced MPTP-induced microbial dysbiosis and partially restored the composition of the gut microbiota to normal, including decreased phylum <i>Bacteroidetes</i> and genera <i>Parabacteroide</i>, as well as increased phylum <i>Firmicutes</i>, genera <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Ruminiclostridium</i>. Besides, CA promoted colonic epithelial integrity and restored normal SCFA production. We also observed that proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-Î± and IL-1Î² in the serum, striatum and colon were reduced by CA, indicating that CA prevented neuroinflammation and gut inflammation, in which the suppression of the TLR4/MyD88/NF-ÎºB signaling pathway might be the underlying molecular mechanism. These findings demonstrated that CA had neuroprotective effects on MPTP-induced PD mice possibly <i>via</i> modulating the gut microbiota and inhibiting inflammation throughout the brain-gut axis.",Food & function,2022,Ning Wang; Bai-Nian Feng; Bin Hu; Yu-Liang Cheng; Ya-Hui Guo; He Qian

35449203,Plasma branched-chain and aromatic amino acids correlate with the gut microbiota and severity of Parkinson's disease.,"Disturbances of circulating amino acids have been demonstrated in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, there have been no consistent results for branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and aromatic amino acids (AAAs), and related factors have not been explored. We aimed to explore plasma BCAA and AAA profiles in PD patients, and identify their correlations with clinical characteristics and the gut microbiota. Plasma BCAA (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) and AAA (tyrosine and phenylalanine) levels were measured in 106 PD patients and 114 controls. Fecal samples were collected from PD patients for microbiota sequencing and functional analysis. We found that plasma BCAAs and tyrosine were decreased in PD patients. BCAAs and AAAs were correlated with clinical characteristics and microbial taxa, and, in particular, they were negatively correlated with the Hoehn and Yahr stage. Compared with early PD patients, BCAA and AAA levels were even lower, and microbial composition was altered in advanced PD patients. Predictive functional analysis indicated that predicted genes numbers involved in BCAA biosynthesis were lower in advanced PD patients. What's more, the fecal abundances of critical genes (ilvB, ilvC, ilvD, and ilvN) involved in BCAA biosynthesis were reduced and fecal BCAA concentrations were lower in advanced PD patients. In conclusion, the disturbances of plasma BCAAs and AAAs in PD patients may be related to the gut microbiota and exacerbated with PD severity. The microbial amino acid metabolism may serve as a potential mechanistic link.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2022,Yi Zhang; Xiaoqin He; Yiwei Qian; Shaoqing Xu; Chengjun Mo; Zheng Yan; Xiaodong Yang; Qin Xiao
36243356,Emerging insights between gut microbiome dysbiosis and Parkinson's disease: Pathogenic and clinical relevance.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complicated neurodegenerative disease, of which gastrointestinal disturbance appears prior to motor symptoms. Numerous studies have shed light on the roles of gastrointestinal tract and its neural connection to brain in PD pathology. In the past decades, the fields of microbiology and neuroscience have become ever more entwined. The emergence of gut microbiome has been considered as one of the key regulators of gut-brain function. With the advent of multi-omics sequencing techniques, gut microbiome of PD patients has been shown unique characteristics. The resident gut microbiota can exert considerable effects in PD and there are suggestions of a link between gut microbiome dysbiosis and PD progression. In this review, we summarize the latest progresses of gut microbiome dysbiosis in PD pathogenesis, further highlight the clinical relevance of gut microbiota and its metabolites in both the non-motor and motor symptoms of PD. Furthermore, we draw attention to the complex interplay between gut microbiota and PD drugs, with the purpose of improving drug efficacy and prescription accordingly. Further studies at specific strain level and longitudinal prospective clinical trials using optimized methods are still needed for the development of diagnostic markers and novel therapeutic regimens for PD.",Ageing research reviews,2022,Mingxia Bi; Lijuan Feng; Jiahui He; Chang Liu; Yulin Wang; Hong Jiang; Shuang-Jiang Liu
36257595,Gut microbiota manipulation as an epilepsy treatment.,"Many studies have documented the important role of the gut microbiota (GM) in the regulation of several central nervous system (CNS) processes through the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis. This latter represents the connection between the CNS, the enteric nervous system, the gut and its microbiota through several ascending and descending pathways. The variation of the GM composition is associated with the pathogenesis and/or progression as well as severity of various neuropsychiatric/neurological diseases such as depression, autism spectrum disorder, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's diseases. Recently, changes in the bacterial composition of the GM have also been linked to epilepsy and seizures, with some studies exploring the potential role of GM in the regulation of neuronal hyperexcitability, seizure occurrence and epileptogenesis. Accordingly, there are potential novel treatments which are currently being investigated such as probiotics, prebiotics and symbiotic that may represent innovative therapeutic approaches. The aim of this review is to explore the effect of gut microbiota manipulation as a therapeutic strategy in epilepsy and the methodological challenges to design (translational) clinical trial investigating the gut microbiota.",Neurobiology of disease,2022,Luigi Francesco Iannone; Maria GÃ³mez-EguÃ­laz; Carmen De Caro
35807841,Overlapping Mechanisms of Action of Brain-Active Bacteria and Bacterial Metabolites in the Pathogenesis of Common Brain Diseases.,"The involvement of the gut microbiota and the metabolites of colon-residing bacteria in brain disease pathogenesis has been covered in a growing number of studies, but comparative literature is scarce. To fill this gap, we explored the contribution of the microbiota-gut-brain axis to the pathophysiology of seven brain-related diseases (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, major depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder). In this article, we discussed changes in bacterial abundance and the metabolic implications of these changes on disease development and progression. Our central findings indicate that, mechanistically, all seven diseases are associated with a leaky gut, neuroinflammation, and over-activated microglial cells, to which gut-residing bacteria and their metabolites are important contributors. Patients show a pro-inflammatory shift in their colon microbiota, harbouring more Gram-negative bacteria containing immune-triggering lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in their cell walls. In addition, bacteria with pro-inflammatory properties (<i>Alistipes</i>, <i>Eggerthella</i>, <i>Flavonifractor</i>) are found in higher abundances, whereas lower abundances of anti-inflammatory bacteria (<i>Bifidobacterium</i>, <i>Coprococcus</i>, <i>Eucbacterium</i>, <i>Eubacterium rectale</i>, <i>Faecalibacterium</i>, <i>Faecalibacterium prasunitzii</i>, <i>Lactobacillus</i>, <i>Prevotella</i>, <i>Roseburia</i>) are reported, when compared to healthy controls. On the metabolite level, aberrant levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are involved in disease pathogenesis and are mostly found in lower quantities. Moreover, bacterial metabolites such as neurotransmitters (acetylcholine, dopamine, noradrenaline, GABA, glutamate, serotonin) or amino acids (phenylalanine, tryptophan) also play an important role. In the future, defined aberrations in the abundance of bacteria strains and altered bacterial metabolite levels could likely be possible markers for disease diagnostics and follow-ups. Moreover, they could help to identify novel treatment options, underlining the necessity for a deeper understanding of the microbiota-gut-brain axis.",Nutrients,2022,Tanja Patricia Eicher; M Hasan Mohajeri
35645785,Nutritional Intake and Gut Microbiome Composition Predict Parkinson's Disease.,"Models to predict Parkinson's disease (PD) incorporating alterations of gut microbiome (GM) composition have been reported with varying success.To assess the utility of GM compositional changes combined with macronutrient intake to develop a predictive model of PD.We performed a cross-sectional analysis of the GM and nutritional intake in 103 PD patients and 81 household controls (HCs). GM composition was determined by 16S amplicon sequencing of the V3-V4 region of bacterial ribosomal DNA isolated from stool. To determine multivariate disease-discriminant associations, we developed two models using Random Forest and support-vector machine (SVM) methodologies.Using updated taxonomic reference, we identified significant compositional differences in the GM profiles of PD patients in association with a variety of clinical PD characteristics. Six genera were overrepresented and eight underrepresented in PD patients relative to HCs, with the largest difference being overrepresentation of <i>Lactobacillaceae</i> at family taxonomic level. Correlation analyses highlighted multiple associations between clinical characteristics and select taxa, whilst constipation severity, physical activity and pharmacological therapies associated with changes in beta diversity. The random forest model of PD, incorporating taxonomic data at the genus level and carbohydrate contribution to total energy demonstrated the best predictive capacity [Area under the ROC Curve (AUC) of 0.74].The notable differences in GM diversity and composition when combined with clinical measures and nutritional data enabled the development of a predictive model to identify PD. These findings support the combination of GM and nutritional data as a potentially useful biomarker of PD to improve diagnosis and guide clinical management.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2022,Michal Lubomski; Xiangnan Xu; Andrew J Holmes; Samuel Muller; Jean Y H Yang; Ryan L Davis; Carolyn M Sue
35225349,Rethinking Parkinson Disease: Exploring Gut-Brain Interactions and the Potential Role of Exercise.,"Although Parkinson disease (PD) has traditionally been considered a disease of the central nervous system, a bidirectional communication system known as the gut-brain axis can influence PD pathogenesis. The dual-hit hypothesis proposed that PD is due to peripheral dysregulations to the gut microbiota, known as dysbiosis. Since then, further investigation has shown that there are multiple pathological sources associated with PD. However, dysbiosis plays a critical role in the disease process. Substantial evidence has identified that cardinal motor symptoms of PD and disease progression are associated with dysbiosis. In other neurodegenerative disorders, dysbiosis has been linked to cognition. Non-PD research has shown that exercise can effectively restore the gut microbiota. Likewise, exercise has become a well-established strategy to improve cognitive and motor function in PD. However, despite the interaction between the gut and brain, and the exercise benefits on gut health, no research to date has considered the effects of exercise on the gut microbiota in PD. Therefore, the purpose of this Perspective is to explore whether exercise benefits observed in PD could partly be due to restorations to the gut microbiota. First, we will review the gut-brain axis and its influence on motor and cognitive function. Next, we will outline evidence regarding exercise-induced restoration of the gut microbiota in non-PD populations. Finally, we will summarize benefits of exercise on motor-cognitive function in PD, proposing that benefits of exercise seen in PD might actually be due to restorations to the gut microbiota. By positing the gut microbiota as a moderator of exercise improvements to motor and cognitive function, we aim to provide a new perspective for physical therapists to prioritize exercise regimens for individuals with PD that can specifically restore the gut microbiota to better improve PD symptoms and prognosis.This Perspective raises awareness that dysregulations to the gut microbiota have recently been attributed to PD symptoms and pathology and that exercise can be an effective therapeutic strategy to improve gut health in individuals with PD.People with PD have been found to have reduced microbial diversity in their gut, which can play an important role in the progression of the disease. Physical therapists can design therapeutic exercises that might help improve gut health in people with PD.",Physical therapy,2022,Kaylie Zapanta; E Todd Schroeder; Beth E Fisher
36034146,The relationship between Parkinson's disease and gastrointestinal diseases.,"An increasing number of studies have provided evidence for the hypothesis that the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) may derive from the gut. Firstly, Lewy pathology can be induced in the enteric nervous system (ENS) and be transported to the central nervous system (CNS) via the vagal nerve. Secondly, the altered composition of gut microbiota causes an imbalance between beneficial and deleterious microbial metabolites which interacts with the increased gut permeability and the gut inflammation as well as the systemic inflammation. The activated inflammatory status then affects the CNS and promotes the pathology of PD. Given the above-mentioned findings, researchers start to pay attention to the connection between PD and gastrointestinal diseases including irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), microscopic colitis (MC), gastrointestinal infections, gastrointestinal neoplasms, and colonic diverticular disease (CDD). This review focuses on the association between PD and gastrointestinal diseases as well as the pathogenesis of PD from the gut.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2022,Jiaqi Zeng; Xinchan Wang; Fei Pan; Zhiqi Mao

However, the extremely short half-life of GLP-1 due to degradation by the ubiquitous proteolytic enzyme limits its clinical application. In this study, we engineered the recombinant integrant probiotic strain <i>Escherichia coli</i> Nissle 1917 (EcN) to create a strain EcN-GLP-1 that effectively delivers the heterologous GLP-1 molecule. Subsequently, we assessed its neuroprotective effects on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mice. We demonstrated that EcN-GLP-1 treatment could improve motor deficits, increase tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons, suppress microglia and astrocyte activation, reduce brain and colon inflammation, and ameliorate colonic barrier function damaged by MPTP induction. Meanwhile, we confirmed that the oral administration of EcN-GLP-1 could restore the disturbance of gut microbiota in the MPTP-induced PD mice, by reducing the relative abundances of <i>Akkermansia</i> and <i>Oscillospira</i>, and increasing the level of <i>Prevotella</i> in the gut.

35463646,"A Pilot Study Exploring the Association of Entacapone, Gut Microbiota, and the Subsequent Side Effects in Patients With Parkinson's Disease.","Entacapone, one of the most common drugs distributed among patients with Parkinson's disease, is a peripherally acting catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor that is used in addition to levodopa to control symptoms. However, there have been negative effects reported against entacapone, namely, gastrointestinal (GI) problems and drowsiness. In this pilot study, we aim to examine the hypothesis that the discomfort induced by entacapone might be originated from the shift of microbial composition by adjusting the effect of levodopa.The population in this pilot study consisted of 13 PD patients treated with levodopa only and 11 with both levodopa and entacapone. The 16S rRNA gene sequence data were processed, aligned, and categorized using the DADA2. Alpha diversity indices for Observed, Chao1, Shannon, and Simpson metrics were calculated with Phyloseq 1.32.0. Dissimilarities were calculated using unweighted unique fraction metrics (Unifrac), weighted Unifrac, and Canberra distance. Functional differences were calculated by PICRUSt2 based on the KEGG database.Results of 16S rRNA sequencing analysis showed that while entacapone did not influence the species richness, the composition of the microbial community shifted considerably. Relative abundances of bacteria related to constipation and other GI disorders also altered significantly. Functional enrichment analysis revealed changes in the metabolic activity of alanine, aspartate, and glutamate. These amino acids are related to common side effects of entacapone such as auditory hallucinations, fatigue, and nightmare.Our findings provide testable hypothesis on the cause of unpleasant side effects of entacapone, which in the long run could possibly be reduced through gut microbiota manipulation.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2022,Shih-Chen Fu; Chung-Han Lee; Yi-Chen Hsieh; Pei-Hua Wu; Sheng-Hsuan Lin; Hsiuying Wang
36140158,Microbiota Dysbiosis in Parkinson Disease-In Search of a Biomarker.,"Numerous studies have highlighted the role of the gastrointestinal system in Parkinson disease pathogenesis. It is likely triggered by proinflammatory markers produced by specific gut bacteria. This review's aim is to identify gut bacterial biomarkers of Parkinson disease. A comprehensive search for original research papers on gut microbiota composition in Parkinson disease was conducted using the PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases. Research papers on intestinal permeability, nasal and oral microbiomes, and interventional studies were excluded. The yielded results were categorized into four groups: Parkinson disease vs. healthy controls; disease severity; non-motor symptoms; and clinical phenotypes. This review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA 2020 statement. A total of 51 studies met the eligibility criteria. In the Parkinson disease vs. healthy controls group, 22 bacteria were deemed potentially important. In the disease severity category, two bacteria were distinguished. In the non-motor symptoms and clinical phenotypes categories, no distinct pathogen was identified. The studies in this review report bacteria of varying taxonomic levels, which prevents the authors from reaching a clear conclusion. Future research should follow a unified methodology in order to identify potential biomarkers for Parkinson disease.",Biomedicines,2022,Julia Maya Nowak; Mateusz KopczyÅski; Andrzej Friedman; Dariusz Koziorowski; Monika Figura
35677440,Gut Microbial Dysbiosis and Cognitive Impairment in Bipolar Disorder: Current Evidence.,"Recent studies have reported that the gut microbiota influences mood and cognitive function through the gut-brain axis, which is involved in the pathophysiology of neurocognitive and mental disorders, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia. These disorders have similar pathophysiology to that of cognitive dysfunction in bipolar disorder (BD), including neuroinflammation and dysregulation of various neurotransmitters (i.e., serotonin and dopamine). There is also emerging evidence of alterations in the gut microbial composition of patients with BD, suggesting that gut microbial dysbiosis contributes to disease progression and cognitive impairment in BD. Therefore, microbiota-centered treatment might be an effective adjuvant therapy for BD-related cognitive impairment. Given that studies focusing on connections between the gut microbiota and BD-related cognitive impairment are lagging behind those on other neurocognitive disorders, this review sought to explore the potential mechanisms of how gut microbial dysbiosis affects cognitive function in BD and identify potential microbiota-centered treatment.",Frontiers in pharmacology,2022,Wenyu Dai; Jieyu Liu; Yan Qiu; Ziwei Teng; Sujuan Li; Hui Yuan; Jing Huang; Hui Xiang; Hui Tang; Bolun Wang; Jindong Chen; Haishan Wu
36458227,Modulating the Gut Microbiota as a Therapeutic Intervention for Alzheimer's Disease.,"Growing evidence suggested that the change of composition and proportion of intestinal microbiota may be related to many diseases, such as irritable bowel syndrome, bipolar disorder, Parkinson's disease, as well as Alzheimer's disease. Current literature supports the fact that unbalanced gut microbial composition (gut dysbiosis) is a risk factor for AD. In our review, we briefly sum up the recent progress regarding the correlations between the gut microbiota and AD. Therapeutic interventions capable of modulating the make-up of the gut microflora may exert beneficial effects on AD, preventing or delaying the beginning of AD or counteracting its development. Additionally, well-documented approaches that can positively influence AD may exert their beneficial effects through modifying the gut microbiota. Therefore, other novel interventions which can target on gut microbiota will also be potential therapies for AD. The chances and challenges that AD is confronted with in the research field of microbiomics are also discussed in this review.",Indian journal of microbiology,2022,Mingli Liu; Ping Zhong
35076270,Parkinson's Disease Medication Alters Small Intestinal Motility and Microbiota Composition in Healthy Rats.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is known to be associated with altered gastrointestinal function and microbiota composition. To date, the effect of PD medication on the gastrointestinal function and microbiota, at the site of drug absorption, the small intestine, has not been studied, although it may represent an important confounder in reported microbiota alterations observed in PD patients. To this end, healthy (non-PD) wild-type Groningen rats were employed and treated with dopamine, pramipexole (in combination with levodopa-carbidopa), or ropinirole (in combination with levodopa-carbidopa) for 14 sequential days. Rats treated with dopamine agonists showed a significant reduction in small intestinal motility and an increase in bacterial overgrowth in the distal small intestine. Notably, significant alterations in microbial taxa were observed between the treated and vehicle groups; analogous to the changes previously reported in human PD versus healthy control microbiota studies. These microbial changes included an increase in <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Bifidobacterium</i> and a decrease in <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> and <i>Prevotellaceae</i>. Markedly, certain <i>Lactobacillus</i> species correlated negatively with levodopa levels in the systemic circulation, potentially affecting the bioavailability of levodopa. Overall, the study highlights a significant effect of PD medication intrinsically on disease-associated comorbidities, including gastrointestinal dysfunction and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, as well as the gut microbiota composition. The results urge future studies to take into account the influence of PD medication <i>per se</i> when seeking to identify microbiota-related biomarkers for PD. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder and is known to be associated with altered gastrointestinal function and microbiota composition. We previously showed that the gut bacteria harboring tyrosine decarboxylase enzymes interfere with levodopa, the main treatment for PD (S. P. van Kessel, A. K. Frye, A. O. El-Gendy, M. Castejon, A. Keshavarzian, G. van Dijk, and S. El Aidy, Nat Commun 10:310, 2019). Although PD medication could be an important confounder in the reported alterations, its effect, apart from the disease itself, on the microbiota composition or the gastrointestinal function at the site of drug absorption, the small intestine, has not been studied. The findings presented here show a significant impact of commonly prescribed PD medication on the small intestinal motility, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, and microbiota composition, irrespective of the PD. Remarkably, we observed negative associations between bacterial species harboring tyrosine decarboxylase activity and levodopa levels in the systemic circulation, potentially affecting the bioavailability of levodopa. Overall, this study shows that PD medication is an important factor in determining gastrointestinal motility and, in turn, microbiota composition and may, partly, explain the differential abundant taxa previously reported in the cross-sectional PD microbiota human studies. The results urge future studies to take into account the influence of PD medication on gut motility and microbiota composition when seeking to identify microbiota-related biomarkers for PD.",mSystems,2022,Sebastiaan P van Kessel; Amber Bullock; Gertjan van Dijk; Sahar El Aidy
36365188,Membrane Vesicles Derived from Gut Microbiota and Probiotics: Cutting-Edge Therapeutic Approaches for Multidrug-Resistant Superbugs Linked to Neurological Anomalies.,"Multidrug-resistant (MDR) superbugs can breach the blood-brain barrier (BBB), leading to a continuous barrage of pro-inflammatory modulators and induction of severe infection-related pathologies, including meningitis and brain abscess. Both broad-spectrum or species-specific antibiotics (Î²-lactamase inhibitors, polymyxins, vancomycin, meropenem, plazomicin, and sarecycline) and biocompatible poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles have been used to treat these infections. However, new therapeutic platforms with a broad impact that do not exert off-target deleterious effects are needed. Membrane vesicles or extracellular vesicles (EVs) are lipid bilayer-enclosed particles with therapeutic potential owing to their ability to circumvent BBB constraints. Bacteria-derived EVs (bEVs) from gut microbiota are efficient transporters that can penetrate the central nervous system. In fact, bEVs can be remodeled via surface modification and CRISPR/Cas editing and, thus, represent a novel platform for conferring protection against infections breaching the BBB. Here, we discuss the latest scientific research related to gut microbiota- and probiotic-derived bEVs, and their therapeutic modifications, in terms of regulating neurotransmitters and inhibiting quorum sensing, for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. We also emphasize the benefits of probiotic-derived bEVs to human health and propose a novel direction for the development of innovative heterologous expression systems to combat BBB-crossing pathogens.",Pharmaceutics,2022,Prakhar Srivastava; Kwang-Sun Kim
35263739,Is There Any Link between Cognitive Impairment and Gut Microbiota? A Systematic Review.,"Symptoms of cognitive impairments vary from mild without clinical manifestation to severe with advanced signs of dementia or Alzheimer's disease (AD). Growing evidence in recent years has indicated the association between the brain and gut microbiota, which has been described as the ""gut-brain axis."" This systematic review seeks to summarize the primary results from recent human and animal studies regarding the alteration of gut microbiota composition in cognitive disorders.A systematic literature search was conducted on PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases up to August 2020. The full texts of the papers were analyzed to retrieve the relevant information.Totally, 24 observational studies (14 animal and 13 human studies) were included. Most of the animal studies were performed on mouse models of AD. Human studies were conducted on patients with Parkinson's disease (3 studies), AD (4 studies), poststroke cognitive impairment patients (1 study), and patients with mild to severe cognitive impairment without mention to the cause of disease (5 studies). More recent evidence suggests that throughout aging Firmicutes and Bifidobacteria decrease but Proteobacteria increases.The gut microbiota may alter brain function or trigger various psychiatric conditions through the gut-brain axis.

35611932,Urolithins: potential biomarkers of gut dysbiosis and disease stage in Parkinson's patients.,"Gut microbiota alteration (gut dysbiosis) occurs during the onset and progression of Parkinson's disease. Gut dysbiosis biomarkers could be relevant to prodromal disease. Urolithins, anti-inflammatory metabolites produced from some dietary polyphenols by specific gut microbial ecologies (urolithin metabotypes), have been proposed as biomarkers of gut microbiota composition and functionality. However, this has not been explored in Parkinson's disease patients. The current study aimed to assess associations between urolithin metabotypes, gut dysbiosis and disease severity in Parkinson's disease patients. Participants (52 patients and 117 healthy controls) provided stool samples for microbiota sequencing and urine samples for urolithin profiling before and after consuming 30 g of walnuts for three days. Data on demographics, medication, disease duration and Hoehn and Yahr disease stage were collected. We observed a significant gradual increase of urolithin non-producers (metabotype-0) as the disease severity increased. The gut microbiome of metabotype-0 patients and patients with the greatest severity was characterized by a more altered bacterial composition, <i>i.e.</i>, increased pro-inflammatory Enterobacteriaceae and reduced protective bacteria against autoimmune and inflammatory processes, including butyrate and urolithin-producing bacteria (Lachnospiraceae members and <i>Gordonibacter</i>). Besides, their microbiome was characterized by predictive functions of lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and metabolism of glutathione, cysteine and methionine that could indirectly reflect the gut pro-inflammatory status. Urolithin detection in urine is a feasible, non-invasive and fast approach that can reflect gut microbiome dysbiosis and intestinal inflammation in Parkinson's disease patients. Our current study could provide novel strategies for improving diagnostics, and for preventing and treating disease progression in microbiota-based interventions.",Food & function,2022,MarÃ­a Romo-Vaquero; Emiliano FernÃ¡ndez-Villalba; Ana-Luisa Gil-Martinez; Lorena Cuenca-Bermejo; Juan Carlos EspÃ­n; MarÃ­a Trinidad Herrero; MarÃ­a Victoria Selma
35889124,"Nasal Microbiota, Olfactory Health, Neurological Disorders and Aging-A Review.","The nasal region is one of the distinct environments for the survival of various microbiota. The human microbial niche begins to inhabit the human body right from birth, and the microbiota survive as commensals or opportunistic pathogens throughout the life of humans in their bodies in various habitats. These microbial communities help to maintain a healthy microenvironment by preventing the attack of pathogens and being involved in immune regulation. Any dysbiosis of microbiota residing in the mucosal surfaces, such as the nasal passages, guts, and genital regions, causes immune modulation and severe infections. The coexistence of microorganisms in the mucosal layers of respiratory passage, resulting in infections due to their co-abundance and interactions, and the background molecular mechanisms responsible for such interactions, need to be considered for investigation. Additional clinical evaluations can explain the interactions among the nasal microbiota, nasal dysbiosis and neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). The respiratory airways usually act as a substratum place for the microbes and can act as the base for respiratory tract infections. The microbial metabolites and the microbes can cross the blood-brain barrier and may cause NDs, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). The scientific investigations on the potential role of the nasal microbiota in olfactory functions and the relationship between their dysfunction and neurological diseases are limited. Recently, the consequences of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in patients with neurological diseases are under exploration. The crosstalk between the gut and the nasal microbiota is highly influential, because their mucosal regions are the prominent microbial niche and are connected to the olfaction, immune regulation, and homeostasis of the central nervous system. Diet is one of the major factors, which strongly influences the mucosal membranes of the airways, gut, and lung. Unhealthy diet practices cause dysbiosis in gut microbiota and the mucosal barrier. The current review summarizes the interrelationship between the nasal microbiota dysbiosis, resulting olfactory dysfunctions, and the progression of NDs during aging and the involvement of coronavirus disease 2019 in provoking the NDs.",Microorganisms,2022,Subramanian Thangaleela; Bhagavathi Sundaram Sivamaruthi; Periyanaina Kesika; Muruganantham Bharathi; Chaiyavat Chaiyasut
34737076,Environmental neurotoxicants and inflammasome activation in Parkinson's disease - A focus on the gut-brain axis.,"Inflammasomes are multi-protein complexes expressed in immune cells that function as intracellular sensors of environmental, metabolic and cellular stress. Inflammasome activation in the brain, has been shown to drive neuropathology and disease progression by multiple mechanisms, making it one of the most attractive therapeutic targets for disease modification in Parkinson's Disease (PD). Extensive inflammasome activation is evident in the brains of people with PD at the sites of dopaminergic degeneration and synuclein aggregation. While substantial progress has been made on validating inflammasome activation as a therapeutic target for PD, the mechanisms by which inflammasome activation is triggered and sustained over the disease course remain poorly understood. A growing body of evidence point to environmental and occupational chemical exposures as possible triggers of inflammasome activation in PD. The involvement of the gastrointestinal system and gut microbiota in PD pathophysiology is beginning to be elucidated, especially the profound link between gut dysbiosis and immune activation. While large cohort studies confirmed specific changes in the gut microbiota in PD patients compared to age-matched healthy controls, recent research suggest that synuclein pathology could be initiated in the gastrointestinal tract. In this review, we present a summarized perspective on current understanding on inflammasome activation and the gut-brain-axis link during PD pathophysiology. We discuss multiple environmental toxicants that are implicated as the etiological agents in causing idiopathic PD and their mechanistic underpinnings during neuroinflammatory events.

36013962,"Role of the Gut-Brain Axis, Gut Microbial Composition, Diet, and Probiotic Intervention in Parkinson's Disease.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second-most prevalent neurodegenerative or neuropsychiatric disease, affecting 1% of seniors worldwide. The gut microbiota (GM) is one of the key access controls for most diseases and disorders. Disturbance in the GM creates an imbalance in the function and circulation of metabolites, resulting in unhealthy conditions. Any dysbiosis could affect the function of the gut, consequently disturbing the equilibrium in the intestine, and provoking pro-inflammatory conditions in the gut lumen, which send signals to the central nervous system (CNS) through the vagus enteric nervous system, possibly disturbing the blood-brain barrier. The neuroinflammatory conditions in the brain cause accumulation of Î±-syn, and progressively develop PD. An important aspect of understanding and treating the disease is access to broad knowledge about the influence of dietary supplements on GM. Probiotics are live microorganisms which, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host. Probiotic supplementation improves the function of the CNS, and improves the motor and non-motor symptoms of PD. Probiotic supplementation could be an adjuvant therapeutic method to manage PD. This review summarizes the role of GM in health, the GM-brain axis, the pathogenesis of PD, the role of GM and diet in PD, and the influence of probiotic supplementation on PD. The study encourages further detailed clinical trials in PD patients with probiotics, which aids in determining the involvement of GM, intestinal mediators, and neurological mediators in the treatment or management of PD.",Microorganisms,2022,Subramanian Thangaleela; Bhagavathi Sundaram Sivamaruthi; Periyanaina Kesika; Muruganantham Bharathi; Chaiyavat Chaiyasut
36619150,Gut Microbiota Modification via Glucagon-like Peptide-1 with Beneficial Neuroprotective Effects.,"<b>BACKGROUND</b>: In recent decades, it has been shown that the association between intestinal bacterial imbalance (dysbiosis) and various diseases such as type 2 diabetes can play a role in the development of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. In this study, the beneficial effects of intestinal microbiota glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) in cognitive disorders were investigated. <b>METHODS</b>: PubMed-Medline, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched to identify experimental studies based on the bacterial strains along with GLP-1 1 expression in preventing or reducing cognitive impairment. Of the 233 studies, six were eligible for inclusion, and the Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) risk of bias tool was used to evaluate the risk of bias in individual studies. <b>RESULTS</b>: The results showed that intestinal expression of GLP-1 1 could reduce the intestinal pathogenic genus such as <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> and was obviously associated with a greater number of beneficial genera such as <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Akkermansia</i>. Also, the neuroprotective effects of <i>Clostridium butyricum</i> with GLP-1 1 in a mice were approved. Therefore, the modulation of the intestinal microbiota, mediated by an increase in the intestinal GLP-1 1 level, consequently improved cognitive function. <b>CONCLUSION</b>: In this review, we have indicated that the gut microbiota, by stimulating the expression of the intestinal hormones like GLP-1 1, and also with a beneficial effect in inhibiting some involved genes in inflammation, can declined the development of cognitive disorders.",Middle East journal of digestive diseases,2022,Fatemeh Sayehmiri; Mohammad Samadian; Ashraf Mohamadkhani; Abbas Tafakhori; Somayeh Haghighat; Aryoobarzan Rahmatian; Mohammad Ali Mohammadkhani; Hamid Reza Fazli; Mostafa Rezaei Tavirani

36355147,Dysbiosis of Gut Microbiota from the Perspective of the Gut-Brain Axis: Role in the Provocation of Neurological Disorders.,"The gut-brain axis is a bidirectional communication network connecting the gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system. The axis keeps track of gastrointestinal activities and integrates them to connect gut health to higher cognitive parts of the brain. Disruption in this connection may facilitate various neurological and gastrointestinal problems. Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the progressive dysfunction of specific populations of neurons, determining clinical presentation. Misfolded protein aggregates that cause cellular toxicity and that aid in the collapse of cellular proteostasis are a defining characteristic of neurodegenerative proteinopathies. These disorders are not only caused by changes in the neural compartment but also due to other factors of non-neural origin. Mounting data reveal that the majority of gastrointestinal (GI) physiologies and mechanics are governed by the central nervous system (CNS). Furthermore, the gut microbiota plays a critical role in the regulation and physiological function of the brain, although the mechanism involved has not yet been fully interpreted. One of the emerging explanations of the start and progression of many neurodegenerative illnesses is dysbiosis of the gut microbial makeup. The present understanding of the literature surrounding the relationship between intestinal dysbiosis and the emergence of certain neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and multiple sclerosis, is the main emphasis of this review. The potential entry pathway of the pathogen-associated secretions and toxins into the CNS compartment has been explored in this article at the outset of neuropathology. We have also included the possible mechanism of undelaying the synergistic effect of infections, their metabolites, and other interactions based on the current understanding.",Metabolites,2022,Meenakshi Kandpal; Omkar Indari; Budhadev Baral; Shweta Jakhmola; Deeksha Tiwari; Vasundhra Bhandari; Rajan Kumar Pandey; Kiran Bala; Avinash Sonawane; Hem Chandra Jha
36072564,Age-dependent effects of gut microbiota metabolites on brain resident macrophages.,"In recent years, development of age-related diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, as well as other brain disorders, including anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia have been shown to be associated with changes in the gut microbiome. Several factors can induce an alteration in the bacterial composition of the host's gastrointestinal tract. Besides dietary changes and frequent use of antibiotics, the microbiome is also profoundly affected by aging. Levels of microbiota-derived metabolites are elevated in older individuals with age-associated diseases and cognitive defects compared to younger, healthy age groups. The identified metabolites with higher concentration in aged hosts, which include choline and trimethylamine, are known risk factors for age-related diseases. While the underlying mechanisms and pathways remain elusive for the most part, it has been shown, that these metabolites are able to trigger the innate immunity in the central nervous system by influencing development and activation status of brain-resident macrophages. The macrophages residing in the brain comprise parenchymal microglia and non-parenchymal macrophages located in the perivascular spaces, meninges, and the choroid plexus. In this review, we highlight the impact of age on the composition of the microbiome and microbiota-derived metabolites and their influence on age-associated diseases caused by dysfunctional brain-resident macrophages.",Frontiers in cellular neuroscience,2022,Dilara Hasavci; Thomas Blank
35895243,Role of the gut-microbiota-metabolite axis in the rotenone model of early-stage Parkinson's Disease.,"Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in the early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD), but its potential pathogenesis remains unclear. Therefore, in the present study, we used the 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry-based metabolomics to investigate the alterations of gut microbiome and serum amino acid levels in the early-stage PD mice model induced with rotenone. The results demonstrated that the microbial taxa at phylum, family and genus levels remarkably altered in rotenone-induced mice relative to vehicle-induced mice. The rotenone-induced mice had higher relative abundance of Flavobacteriaceae, Staphylococcaceae, and Prevotellaceae as well as lower relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae_UCG-001, Ruminiclostridium, and Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group than vehicle-induced mice. The evaluation of serum amino acids revealed the alterations in several classes of amino acids, including L-proline, L-alanine, L-serine, L-asparagine, L-threonine, L-glutamine, L-methionine, and L-4-hydroxyproline. Notably, the altered serum amino acid levels were significantly associated with the abundance of gut microbiota, especially Ruminococcaceae and Ruminiclostridium. Our study explored the possible role of the gut-microbiota-metabolite axis in the early-stage PD and provided the possibility of prevention and treatment of PD by gut-microbiota-metabolite axis in the future.",Metabolic brain disease,2022,Zhenzhen Yan; Ruihua Li; Wanying Shi; Lifen Yao
36361826,Molecular and Cellular Interactions in Pathogenesis of Sporadic Parkinson Disease.,"An increasing number of the population all around the world suffer from age-associated neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease (PD). This disorder presents different signs of genetic, epigenetic and environmental origin, and molecular, cellular and intracellular dysfunction. At the molecular level, Î±-synuclein (Î±Syn) was identified as the principal molecule constituting the Lewy bodies (LB). The gut microbiota participates in the pathogenesis of PD and may contribute to the loss of dopaminergic neurons through mitochondrial dysfunction. The most important pathogenetic link is an imbalance of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, which is associated with redox imbalance in the cells and increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this review, genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors that cause these disorders and their cause-and-effect relationships are considered. As a constituent of environmental factors, the example of organophosphates (OPs) is also reviewed. The role of endothelial damage in the pathogenesis of PD is discussed, and a 'triple hit hypothesis' is proposed as a modification of Braak's dual hit one. In the absence of effective therapies for neurodegenerative diseases, more and more evidence is emerging about the positive impact of nutritional structure and healthy lifestyle on the state of blood vessels and the risk of developing these diseases.",International journal of molecular sciences,2022,Lyudmila P Dolgacheva; Valery P Zinchenko; Nikolay V Goncharov
35111696,Gut Microbiota: A Key Regulator in the Effects of Environmental Hazards on Modulates Insulin Resistance.,"Insulin resistance is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), type II diabetes (T2D), and Parkinson's disease (PD). Emerging evidence indicates that these disorders are typically characterized by alterations in the gut microbiota composition, diversity, and their metabolites. Currently, it is understood that environmental hazards including ionizing radiation, toxic heavy metals, pesticides, particle matter, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are capable of interacting with gut microbiota and have a non-beneficial health effect. Based on the current study, we propose the hypothesis of ""gut microenvironment baseline drift"". According to this ""baseline drift"" theory, gut microbiota is a temporarily combined cluster of species sharing the same environmental stresses for a short period, which would change quickly under the influence of different environmental factors.

35111696,Gut Microbiota: A Key Regulator in the Effects of Environmental Hazards on Modulates Insulin Resistance.,"Insulin resistance is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), type II diabetes (T2D), and Parkinson's disease (PD). Emerging evidence indicates that these disorders are typically characterized by alterations in the gut microbiota composition, diversity, and their metabolites. Currently, it is understood that environmental hazards including ionizing radiation, toxic heavy metals, pesticides, particle matter, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are capable of interacting with gut microbiota and have a non-beneficial health effect. Based on the current study, we propose the hypothesis of ""gut microenvironment baseline drift"".

36494405,Gut microbiota in dementia with Lewy bodies.,"Gut microbiota and fecal bile acids were analyzed in 278 patients with Î±-synucleinopathies, which were comprised of 28 patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), 224 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), and 26 patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD). Similarly to PD, short-chain fatty acids-producing genera were decreased in DLB. Additionally, Ruminococcus torques and Collinsella were increased in DLB, which were not changed in PD. Random forest models to differentiate DLB and PD showed that high Ruminococcus torques and high Collinsella, which presumably increase intestinal permeability, as well as low Bifidobacterium, which are also observed in Alzheimer's disease, were predictive of DLB. As Ruminococcus torques and Collinsella are also major secondary bile acids-producing bacteria, we quantified fecal bile acids and found that the production of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) was high in DLB. Increased UDCA in DLB may mitigate neuroinflammation at the substantia nigra, whereas neuroinflammation may not be critical at the neocortex. Theraeutic intervention to increase Bifidobacteirum and its metabolites may retard the development and progression of DLB.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2022,Hiroshi Nishiwaki; Jun Ueyama; Kenichi Kashihara; Mikako Ito; Tomonari Hamaguchi; Tetsuya Maeda; Yoshio Tsuboi; Masahisa Katsuno; Masaaki Hirayama; Kinji Ohno
36406865,Gut Microbiota Alternation in Disease Progression of Neurosyphilis.,"The gut microbiota plays an important role in the development of neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. However, studies on the gut microbiota of patients with neurosyphilis (NS) were rarely reported.In this study, we collected fecal samples from 62 syphilis patients, including 39 with NS and 23 with non-NS. Among the NS patients, 18 were general paresis (GP). The white blood cell counts, protein concentrations, and Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test positive rates of cerebrospinal fluid from patients in NS or GP group were significantly higher than those from patients in non-NS group. 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing results revealed that the alpha and beta diversities of the gut microbiota were similar between NS and non-NS patients or GP and non-NS patients.Linear discriminant analysis with effect size (LEfSe) analysis showed that some taxa, such as <i>Coprobacter</i>, were increased in both NS group and GP group, compared with non-NS group. Besides, the clade of <i>Akkermansia</i> was also overrepresented in GP Patients. Meanwhile, some taxa such as <i>Clostridia_UCG-014</i> and <i>SC-I-84</i> were underrepresented in NS patients. The abundances of class <i>Bacilli</i> and genus <i>Alloprevotella</i> were decreased in GP patients. Among them, the abundances of some taxa such as <i>Coprobacter</i> and <i>Akkermansia</i> have been reported to be associated with other neuropsychiatric disorders.Our findings suggest that the alternation of the gut microbiota in NS patients may contribute to the course of NS, which will deepen our understanding of NS.",Infection and drug resistance,2022,Guixuan Wang; Danyang Zou; Xinying Lu; Xin Gu; Yuanyuan Cheng; Tengfei Qi; Yanchun Cheng; Junjun Yu; Meiping Ye; Pingyu Zhou

Chronic Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) treatment, an inflammatory inducer in the gut, activates AEP (asparagine endopeptidase) that cleaves Î±-Synuclein N103 and triggers its aggregation, promoting inflammation in the gut and the brain and motor defects in SNCA mice. PD fecal microbiota transplant or live H. hepaticus administration into antibiotics cocktail (Abx)-pretreated SNCA mice induces Î±-Synuclein pathology, inflammation in the gut and brain, and motor dysfunctions, for which AEP is indispensable.

35337376,Shedding light on biological sex differences and microbiota-gut-brain axis: a comprehensive review of its roles in neuropsychiatric disorders.,"Women and men are suggested to have differences in vulnerability to neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), schizophrenia, eating disorders, including anorexia nervosa, and bulimia nervosa, neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease. Genetic factors and sex hormones are apparently the main mediators of these differences. Recent evidence uncovers that reciprocal interactions between sex-related features (e.g., sex hormones and sex differences in the brain) and gut microbiota could play a role in the development of neuropsychiatric disorders via influencing the gut-brain axis. It is increasingly evident that sex-microbiota-brain interactions take part in the occurrence of neurologic and psychiatric disorders. Accordingly, integrating the existing evidence might help to enlighten the fundamental roles of these interactions in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders. In addition, an increased understanding of the biological sex differences on the microbiota-brain may lead to advances in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders and increase the potential for precision medicine. This review discusses the effects of sex differences on the brain and gut microbiota and the putative underlying mechanisms of action. Additionally, we discuss the consequences of interactions between sex differences and gut microbiota on the emergence of particular neuropsychiatric disorders.",Biology of sex differences,2022,Parnian Shobeiri; Amirali Kalantari; AntÃ´nio L Teixeira; Nima Rezaei

However, whether reshaping the gut microbial composition can treat PD remains to be seen. The present study evaluated the effect of intestinal flora in the treatment of PD in a C57BL/6 mouse PD model induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Chronic, low-dose, MPTP-treated mice exhibited upregulated gene expression levels of TNF-Î± and IL-1Î² in the substantia nigra (SN) of the mice, and induced intestinal microbial disorders. This indicated that the chronic low-dose MPTP model could be used to evaluate the progress of early intestinal pathology and intestinal flora imbalance in PD. After transplantation of faecal bacteria to MPTP-induced PD mice, the level of inflammation in the SN of the mice was reduced, and motor dysfunction was alleviated. Notably, faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) upregulated the abundance of <i>Blautia</i> but downregulated <i>Anaerostipes</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, <i>ASF356</i> and <i>Ruminococcus</i> in the gut of PD mice. In addition, FMT reduced the activation of microglia and astrocytes in the SN and reduced the expression levels of GSK3Î², IL-1Î², inducible nitric oxide synthase and phosphorylated PTEN in the SN. Overall, the present study demonstrated that gut microbial dysfunction is associated with the pathogenesis of PD, and that FMT can protect PD mice by inhibiting neuroinflammation.",Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2022,Tian Zhang; Tan Wang; Xinxu Chen; Zhenqiang Zhao; Zhibin Chen

36389228,The interplay between the gut-brain axis and the microbiome: A perspective on psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.,"What is the effect of our gut microbial flora on brain? Does the gut microbiome have any role in the causation of psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases? Does the effect of gut microbiota traverse the gut-brain axis? Questions like these have captured the interest and imagination of the scientific community for quite some time now. Research in the quest for answers to these questions, to unravel the potential role of the microbiota inhabiting the gut in controlling brain functions, has progressed manifold over the last two decades. Although the possibility of microbiome as a key susceptibility factor for neurological disorders viz. Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and autism spectrum disorder has bolstered by an increase in the clinical and preclinical evidence, the field is still in its infancy. Given the fact that the diversity of the gut microbiota is affected by various factors including the diet and exercise, the interpretation of such data becomes all the more difficult. Also, such studies have been mostly conducted on animal models, so there is a need for randomized controlled trials in human subjects, corroborated by longitudinal studies, to establish if modulating the gut microbiota can unravel novel therapeutic interventions. Exploring the genomic, metagenomic and metabolomic data from clinical subjects with psychiatric and neurological diseases can prove to be a helpful guide in individual treatment selection.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2022,Yasir Bashir; Asad U Khan
35275538,The Oral and Fecal Microbiota in a Canadian Cohort of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Despite decades of research, our understanding of Alzheimer's disease (AD) etiology remains incomplete. InÂ recent years, appreciation has grown for potential roles for the microbiota in shaping neurological health.This study aimed to examine associations between the microbiota and AD in a human cross-sectional cohort.Forty-five AD patients and 54 matched controls were recruited in Vancouver, Canada. Fecal and oral samples underwent 16S microbiota sequencing. A wide array of demographic and clinical data were collected. Differences between participant groups were assessed, and associations between microbes and clinical variables were examined within the AD population.The gut microbiota of AD patients displayed lower diversity relative to controls, although taxonomic differences were sparse. In contrast, the AD oral microbiota displayed higher diversity, with several taxonomic differences relative to controls, including a lower abundance of the families Streptococcaceae and Actinomycetaceae, and a higher abundance of Weeksellaceae, among others. The periodontitis-associated oral microbe Porphyromonas gingivalis was 5 times more prevalent among patients. No significant associations between gut or oral microbes and cognition were detected, but several correlations existed between microbes and mood disorders and BMI among patients, including a strong positive correlation between Alphaproteobacteria and depression score.The gut microbiota of AD patients was not overtly different from controls, although it displayed lower diversity, an overall marker of microbiota health.

35057561,Are We What We Eat? Impact of Diet on the Gut-Brain Axis in Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease is characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms, such as defects in the gut function, which may occur before the motor symptoms. To date, there are therapies that can improve these symptoms, but there is no cure to avoid the development or exacerbation of this disorder. Dysbiosis of gut microbiota could have a crucial role in the gut-brain axis, which is a bidirectional communication between the central nervous system and the enteric nervous system. Diet can affect the microbiota composition, impacting gut-brain axis functionality. Gut microbiome restoration through probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics or other dietary means could have the potential to slow PD progression. In this review, we will discuss the influence of diet on the bidirectional communication between gut and brain, thus supporting the hypothesis that this disorder could begin in the gut. We also focus on how food-based therapies might then have an influence on PD and could ameliorate non-motor as well as motor symptoms.",Nutrients,2022,Margherita Alfonsetti; Vanessa Castelli; Michele d'Angelo
35886849,"Impact of Nutrition, Microbiota Transplant and Weight Loss Surgery on Dopaminergic Alterations in Parkinson's Disease and Obesity.","Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disorder worldwide, is characterized by dopaminergic neuron degeneration and Î±-synuclein aggregation in the substantia nigra pars compacta of the midbrain. Emerging evidence has shown that dietary intake affects the microbial composition in the gut, which in turn contributes to, or protects against, the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in affected regions of the brain. More specifically, the Mediterranean diet and Western diet, composed of varying amounts of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats, exert contrasting effects on PD pathophysiology via alterations in the gut microbiota and dopamine levels. Interestingly, the negative changes in the gut microbiota of patients with PD parallel changes that are seen in individuals that consume a Western diet, and are opposite to those that adhere to a Mediterranean diet. In this review, we first examine the role of prominent food groups on dopamine bioavailability, how they modulate the composition and function of the gut microbiota and the subsequent effects on PD and obesity pathophysiology. We then highlight evidence on how microbiota transplant and weight loss surgery can be used as therapeutic tools to restore dopaminergic deficits through optimizing gut microbial composition. In the process, we revisit dietary metabolites and their role in therapeutic approaches involving dopaminergic pathways. Overall, understanding the role of nutrition on dopamine bioavailability and gut microbiota in dopamine-related pathologies such as PD will help develop more precise therapeutic targets to rescue dopaminergic deficits in neurologic and metabolic disorders.",International journal of molecular sciences,2022,Sevag Hamamah; Andras Hajnal; Mihai Covasa

Exercise has a positive effect on microbiota in general. The effect of aerobic exercise training (AET) on the gut microbial environment in PD remains to be explored. Here, we performed the 16S rRNA gene sequencing on feces from sham operated-mice (sham), PD mice model, and mice receiving AET (AET). Results indicated that AET had no remarkable effect on species richness and bacterial diversity of PD mice. The relative abundance of the <i>Bacteroidetes</i> was reduced, while <i>Firmicutes</i>, <i>Actinobacteria</i>, <i>Lactobacillaceae</i>, <i>Streptococcaceae</i>, <i>Lactobacillus</i>, <i>Streptococcus</i>, <i>Lactococcus</i>, <i>Lysinibacillus</i>, <i>Pelomonas</i>, and <i>Prevotellaceae_UCG-001</i> were increased in PD mice compared with those of sham operated-mice, whereas AET partly rescued their abundance. Additionally, the composition proportion of beneficial <i>Lactobacillus_gasseri</i> and u<i>ncultured_Erysipelotrichales_bacterium</i> significantly increased in AET mice compared to PD mice. Moreover, discriminative bacteria, such as <i>Bacilli</i>, <i>Lactobacillales</i>, <i>Lactobacillaceae</i>, <i>Lactobacillus</i>, and <i>Lactococcus</i> were identified as a specific taxon in AET mice.

36278360,Exploring the Connection Between the Gut Microbiome and Parkinson's Disease Symptom Progression and Pathology: Implications for Supplementary Treatment Options.,"The contribution of the microbiota to induce gastrointestinal inflammation is hypothesized to be a key component of alpha-synuclein (aSyn) aggregation within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract in the pathological progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). The function of the GI tract is governed by a system of neurons that form part of the enteric nervous system (ENS). The ENS hosts Â 100-500 million nerve cells within two thin layers lining the GI tract. The gut-brain axis (GBA) is the major communication pathway between the ENS and the central nervous system. It has become increasingly clear that the microbiota in the gut are key regulators of GBA function and help to maintain homeostasis in the immune and endocrine systems. The GBA may act as a possible etiological launching pad for the pathogenesis of age-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as PD, because of an imbalance in the gut microbiota. PD is a multi-faceted illness with multiple biological, immunological, and environmental factors contributing to its pathological progression. Interestingly, individuals with PD have an altered gut microbiota compared to healthy individuals. However, there is a lack of literature describing the relationship between microbiota composition in the gut and symptom progression in PD patients. This review article examines how the pathology and symptomology of PD may originate from dysregulated signaling in the ENS. We then discuss by targeting the imbalance within the gut microbiota such as prebiotics and probiotics, some of the prodromal symptoms might be alleviated, possibly curtailing the pathological spread of aSyn and ensuing debilitating motor symptoms.",Journal of Parkinson's disease,2022,Dennis G Chan; Katelyn Ventura; Ally Villeneuve; Paul Du Bois; Matthew R Holahan
35897024,Gut microenvironmental changes as a potential trigger in Parkinson's disease through the gut-brain axis.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease attributed to the synergistic effects of genetic risk and environmental stimuli. Although PD is characterized by motor dysfunction resulting from intraneuronal alpha-synuclein accumulations, termed Lewy bodies, and dopaminergic neuronal degeneration in the substantia nigra, multiple systems are involved in the disease process, resulting in heterogenous clinical presentation and progression. Genetic predisposition to PD regarding aberrant immune responses, abnormal protein aggregation, autophagolysosomal impairment, and mitochondrial dysfunction leads to vulnerable neurons that are sensitive to environmental triggers and, together, result in neuronal degeneration. Neuropathology studies have shown that, at least in some patients, Lewy bodies start from the enteric nervous system and then spread to the central dopaminergic neurons through the gut-brain axis, suggesting the contribution of an altered gut microenvironment in the pathogenesis of PD. A plethora of evidence has revealed different gut microbiomes and gut metabolites in patients with PD compared to unaffected controls. Chronic gut inflammation and impaired intestinal barrier integrity have been observed in human PD patients and mouse models of PD. These observations led to the hypothesis that an altered gut microenvironment is a potential trigger of the PD process in a genetically susceptible host. In this review, we will discuss the complex interplay between genetic factors and gut microenvironmental changes contributing to PD pathogenesis.",Journal of biomedical science,2022,Szu-Ju Chen; Chin-Hsien Lin
34982206,Challenges of repurposing tetracyclines for the treatment of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.,"The novel antibiotic-exploiting strategy in the treatment of Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's (PD) disease has emerged as a potential breakthrough in the field. The research in animal AD/PD models provided evidence on the antiamyloidogenic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antiapoptotic activity of tetracyclines, associated with cognitive improvement. The neuroprotective effects of minocycline and doxycycline in animals initiated investigation of their clinical efficacy in AD and PD patients which led to inconclusive results and additionally to insufficient safety data on a long-standing doxycycline and minocycline therapy in these patient populations. The safety issues should be considered in two levels; in AD/PD patients (particularly antibiotic-induced alteration of gut microbiota and its consequences), and as a world-wide threat of development of bacterial resistance to these antibiotics posed by a fact that AD and PD are widespread incurable diseases which require daily administered long-lasting antibiotic therapy. Recently proposed subantimicrobial doxycycline doses should be thoroughly explored for their effectiveness and long-term safety especially in AD/PD populations. Keeping in mind the antibacterial activity-related far-reaching undesirable effects both for the patients and globally, further work on repurposing these drugs for a long-standing therapy of AD/PD should consider the chemically modified tetracycline compounds tailored to lack antimicrobial but retain (or introduce) other activities effective against the AD/PD pathology. This strategy might reduce the risk of long-term therapy-related adverse effects (particularly gut-related ones) and development of bacterial resistance toward the tetracycline antibiotic agents but the therapeutic potential and desirable safety profile of such compounds in AD/PD patients need to be confirmed.","Journal of neural transmission (Vienna, Austria : 1996)",2022,Iva Markulin; Marija Matasin; Viktorija Erdeljic Turk; Melita SalkoviÄ-Petrisic
36411639,Deciphering the gut microbiome in neurodegenerative diseases and metagenomic approaches for characterization of gut microbes.,"The central nervous system has essential role in the regulation of the physiological condition of the human body. Gut microbes cause several types of gastrointestinal diseases like ulcer stomach and intestine and irritable bowel syndrome. Microbes present in the human gut can affect brain function by the release of neuroactive metabolites such as neurotransmitters, hormones, and other compounds. Gut microbial-derived metabolites also have an important role in neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, etc. Vital communication between the gut microbes and the central nervous system is known as the microbiota-gut-brain axis. It provides a communication pathway between the gut and brain which is made up of the vagus nerve, immune system components, and neuroendocrine. Disturbance in gut microbiota composition can alter the central nervous system and enteric nervous system functions. Metagenomics has been employed for the identification, and characterization of gut microbes and microbial-derived metabolites.

34719435,"The Role of Pathogens and Anti-Infective Agents in Parkinson's Disease, from Etiology to Therapeutic Implications.","Parkinson's disease is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder whose etiology is still unclear, hampering the development of effective treatments. There is an urgent need to identify the etiology and provide further effective treatments. Recently, accumulating evidence has indicated that infection may play a role in the etiology of Parkinson's disease. The infective pathogens may act as a trigger for Parkinson's disease, the most common of which are hepatitis C virus, influenza virus, and Helicobacter pylori. In addition, gut microbiota is increasingly recognized to influence brain function through the gut-brain axis, showing an important role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, a series of anti-infective agents exhibit surprising neuroprotective effects via various mechanisms, such as interfering with Î±-synuclein aggregation, inhibiting neuroinflammation, attenuating oxidative stress, and preventing from cell death, independent of their antimicrobial effects. The pleiotropic agents affect important events in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Moreover, most of them are less toxic, clinically safe and have good blood-brain penetrability, making them hopeful candidates for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. However, the use of antibiotics and subsequent gut dysbiosis may also play a role in Parkinson's disease, making the long-term effects of anti-infective drugs worthy of further consideration and exploration. This review summarizes the current evidence for the association between infective pathogens and Parkinson's disease and subsequently explores the application prospects of anti-infective drugs in Parkinson's disease treatment, providing novel insights into the pathogenesis and treatment of Parkinson's disease.",Journal of Parkinson's disease,2022,Si Shen; Chan Zhang; Yu-Ming Xu; Chang-He Shi
36235622,Does the Gut Microbial Metabolome Really Matter? The Connection between GUT Metabolome and Neurological Disorders.,"Herein we gathered updated knowledge regarding the alterations of gut microbiota (dysbiosis) and its correlation with human neurodegenerative and brain-related diseases, e.g., Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. This review underlines the importance of gut-derived metabolites and gut metabolic status as the main players in gut-brain crosstalk and their implications on the severity of neural conditions. Scientific evidence indicates that the administration of probiotic bacteria exerts beneficial and protective effects as reduced systemic inflammation, neuroinflammation, and inhibited neurodegeneration. The experimental results performed on animals, but also human clinical trials, show the importance of designing a novel microbiota-based probiotic dietary supplementation with the aim to prevent or ease the symptoms of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases or other forms of dementia or neurodegeneration.",Nutrients,2022,MaÅgorzata Anna MarÄ; RafaÅ JastrzÄb; Jennifer Mytych
35656540,The Gut Microbiome in Parkinson's Disease: A Longitudinal Study of the Impacts on Disease Progression and the Use of Device-Assisted Therapies.,"Altered gut microbiome (GM) composition has been established in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, few studies have longitudinally investigated the GM in PD, or the impact of device-assisted therapies.To investigate the temporal stability of GM profiles from PD patients on standard therapies and those initiating device-assisted therapies (DAT) and define multivariate models of disease and progression.We evaluated validated clinical questionnaires and stool samples from 74 PD patients and 74 household controls (HCs) at 0, 6, and 12 months. Faster or slower disease progression was defined from levodopa equivalence dose and motor severity measures. 19 PD patients initiating Deep Brain Stimulation or Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel were separately evaluated at 0, 6, and 12 months post-therapy initiation.Persistent underrepresentation of short-chain fatty-acid-producing bacteria, <i>Butyricicoccus, Fusicatenibacter, Lachnospiraceae ND3007 group</i>, and <i>Erysipelotrichaceae UCG-003</i>, were apparent in PD patients relative to controls. A sustained effect of DAT initiation on GM associations with PD was not observed. PD progression analysis indicated that the genus <i>Barnesiella</i> was underrepresented in faster progressing PD patients at <i>t</i> = 0 and <i>t</i> = 12 months. Two-stage predictive modeling, integrating microbiota abundances and nutritional profiles, improved predictive capacity (change in Area Under the Curve from 0.58 to 0.64) when assessed at Amplicon Sequence Variant taxonomic resolution.We present longitudinal GM studies in PD patients, showing persistently altered GM profiles suggestive of a reduced butyrogenic production potential. DATs exerted variable GM influences across the short and longer-term. We found that specific GM profiles combined with dietary factors improved prediction of disease progression in PD patients.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2022,Michal Lubomski; Xiangnan Xu; Andrew J Holmes; Samuel Muller; Jean Y H Yang; Ryan L Davis; Carolyn M Sue
36590421,The gut microbiome in human health and disease-Where are we and where are we going? A bibliometric analysis.,"There are trillions of microbiota in our intestinal tract, and they play a significant role in health and disease <i>via</i> interacting with the host in metabolic, immune, neural, and endocrine pathways. Over the past decades, numerous studies have been published in the field of gut microbiome and disease. Although there are narrative reviews of gut microbiome and certain diseases, the whole field is lack of systematic and quantitative analysis. Therefore, we outline research status of the gut microbiome and disease, and present insights into developments and characteristics of this field to provide a holistic grasp and future research directions.An advanced search was carried out in the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC), basing on the term ""gut microbiome"" and its synonyms. The current status and developing trends of this scientific domain were evaluated by bibliometric methodology. CiteSpace was used to perform collaboration network analysis, co-citation analysis and citation burst detection.A total of 29,870 articles and 13,311 reviews were retrieved from the database, which involve 42,900 keywords, 176 countries/regions, 19,065 institutions, 147,225 authors and 4,251 journals. The gut microbiome and disease research is active and has received increasing attention. Co-cited reference analysis revealed the landmark articles in the field. The United States had the largest number of publications and close cooperation with other countries. The current research mainly focuses on gastrointestinal diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), while extra-intestinal diseases are also rising, such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease. Omics technologies, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and metabolites linked to mechanism would be more concerned in the future.The gut microbiome and disease has been a booming field of research, and the trend is expected to continue. Overall, this research field shows a multitude of challenges and great opportunities.",Frontiers in microbiology,2022,Zhiqiang Huang; Kun Liu; Wenwen Ma; Dezhi Li; Tianlu Mo; Qing Liu
36406749,A review of the preclinical and clinical studies on the role of the gut microbiome in aging and neurodegenerative diseases and its modulation.,"As the world population ages, the burden of age-related health problems grows, creating a greater demand for new novel interventions for healthy aging. Advancing aging is related to a loss of beneficial mutualistic microbes in the gut microbiota caused by extrinsic and intrinsic factors such as diet, sedentary lifestyle, sleep deprivation, circadian rhythms, and oxidative stress, which emerge as essential elements in controlling and prolonging life expectancy of healthy aging. This condition is known as gut dysbiosis, and it affects normal brain function via the brain-gut microbiota (BGM) axis, which is a bidirectional link between the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and the central nervous system (CNS) that leads to the emergence of brain disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Here, we reviewed the role of the gut microbiome in aging and neurodegenerative diseases, as well as provided a comprehensive review of recent findings from preclinical and clinical studies to present an up-to-date overview of recent advances in developing strategies to modulate the intestinal microbiome by probiotic administration, dietary intervention, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and physical activity to address the aging process and prevent neurodegenerative diseases. The findings of this review will provide researchers in the fields of aging and the gut microbiome design innovative studies that leverage results from preclinical and clinical studies to better understand the nuances of aging, gut microbiome, and neurodegenerative diseases.",Frontiers in cellular neuroscience,2022,Haslin Madihah Hashim; Suzana Makpol
36155528,Early Dysbiosis and Dampened Gut Microbe Oscillation Precede Motor Dysfunction and Neuropathology in Animal Models of Parkinson's Disease.,"Studies have shown different gut microbiomes in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) compared to unaffected controls. However, when the gut microbiota shift toward dysbiosis in the PD process remains unclear.We aim to investigate the changes in gut microbiota, locomotor function, and neuropathology longitudinally in PD rodent models.Fecal microbiota were longitudinally assessed by sequencing the V4-V5 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene in a human mutant Î±-synuclein over-expressing mouse model of PD, SNCA p.A53T mice, and the non-transgenic littermate controls. The locomotor function, neuronal integrity, and Î±-synuclein expression in the different brain regions were compared between groups. Human fecal microbiota communities from 58 patients with PD and 46 unaffected controls were also analyzed using metagenomic sequencing for comparison.Compared to non-transgenic littermate controls, the altered gut microbiota of the SNCA p.A53T mice can be detected as early as 2 months old, and the diurnal oscillation of the gut microbiome was dampened throughout PD progression starting from 4 months old. However, neuropathology changes and motor deficits were observed starting at 6 months old. Similar changes in altered gut microbiota were also observed in another PD genetic mouse model carrying the LRRK2 p.G2019S mutation at 2 months old. Among the commonly enriched gut microbiota in both PD genetic mouse models, the abundance of Parabateroides Merdae and Ruminococcus torques were also increased in human PD patients compared to controls.These findings revealed the altered gut microbiota communities and oscillations preceding the occurrence of neuropathy and motor dysfunction in the PD process.",Journal of Parkinson's disease,2022,Feng Liang; Cheng-Yu Chen; Yun-Pu Li; Yi-Ci Ke; En-Pong Ho; Chih-Fan Jeng; Chin-Hsien Lin; Shih-Kuo Chen
35349746,Microbiota-microglia connections in age-related cognition decline.,"Aging is an inevitable process that all individuals experience, of which the extent differs among individuals. It has been recognized as the risk factor of neurodegenerative diseases by affecting gut microbiota compositions, microglia, and cognition abilities. Aging-induced changes in gut microbiota compositions have a critical role in orchestrating the morphology and functions of microglia through the gut-brain axis. Gut microbiota communicates with microglia by its secreted metabolites and neurotransmitters. This is highly associated with age-related cognitive declines. Here, we review the main composition of microbiota in the aged individuals, outline the changes of the brain in age-related cognitive decline from a neuroinflammation perspective, especially the changes of morphology and functions of microglia, discuss the crosstalk between microbiota and microglia in the aged brain and further highlight the role of microbiota-microglia connections in neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease).",Aging cell,2022,Rui Zhou; Shufang Qian; William C S Cho; Jinyun Zhou; Chentao Jin; Yan Zhong; Jing Wang; Xiaohui Zhang; Zhoujiao Xu; Mei Tian; Lawrence W C Chan; Hong Zhang
35016506,Effect of Coffee against MPTP-Induced Motor Deficits and Neurodegeneration in Mice Via Regulating Gut Microbiota.,"The mechanisms of coffee against Parkinson disease (PD) remained incompletely elucidated. Numerous studies suggested that gut microbiota played a crucial role in the pathogenesis of PD. Here, we explored the further mechanisms of coffee against PD via regulating gut microbiota. C57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally injected with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to induce a PD mouse model, then treated with coffee for 4 consecutive weeks. Behavioral tests consisting of the pole test and beam-walking test were conducted to evaluate the motor function of mice. The levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and Î±-synuclein (Î±-syn) were assessed for dopaminergic neuronal loss. The levels of occludin, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), Bcl-2, Bax, cleaved caspase-3, and cytochrome c (Cyt c) were detected. Moreover, microbial components were measured by 16s rRNA sequencing. Our results showed that coffee significantly improved the motor deficits and TH neuron loss, and reduced the level of Î±-syn in the MPTP-induced mice. Moreover, coffee increased the level of BBB tight junction protein occludin and reduced the level of astrocyte activation marker GFAP in the MPTP-induced mice. Furthermore, coffee significantly decreased the levels of proapoptotic proteins, including Bax, cleaved caspase-3, and cytochrome c, while it increased the level of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2, consequently preventing MPTP-induced apoptotic cascade. Moreover, coffee improved MPTP-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis. These findings suggested that the neuroprotective effects of coffee on PD were involved in the regulation of gut microbiota, which might provide a novel option to elucidate the effects of coffee on PD.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2022,Jiaming Liu; Yuhe Zhang; Tao Ye; Qingxia Yu; Jiaheng Yu; Shushu Yuan; Xinxin Gao; Xinxin Wan; Rui Zhang; Weihua Han; Yang Zhang
35607987,Parkinson's Disease Is Associated with Impaired Gut-Blood Barrier for Short-Chain Fatty Acids.,"Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by gut microbiota are reduced in feces but paradoxically increased in plasma of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), which may stem from intestinal wall leakage. Gut function should be taken into consideration when conducting microbial-metabolite research.The objective was to investigate synchronous changes of SCFAs in feces and plasma of patients with PD, taking constipation as a confounder to better disentangle the SCFA metabolism exclusively associated with PD.The concentrations of fecal and plasma SCFAs in 33 healthy control subjects and 95 patients with PD were measured using liquid and gas chromatography mass spectrometry, respectively. Patients with PD were divided into patients with PD without constipation (nÂ =Â 35) and patients with PD with constipation (nÂ =Â 60). Gut-blood barrier (GBB) permeability was assessed by plasma/fecal ratio of SCFA concentrations and fecal Î±1-antitrypsin concentration.Patients with PD displayed decreased concentrations of fecal acetic, propionic, and butyric acid and increased concentrations of plasma acetic and propionic acid. Fecal acetic, isobutyric, and isovaleric acid were lower and plasma acetic and propionic acid were higher in patients with PD with constipation than in patients with PD without constipation. Constipation aggravated GBB permeability in patients with PD. Combined fecal and plasma SCFAs could discriminate patients with PD from healthy control subjects. Fecal SCFAs, except propionic acid, were negatively correlated with disease severity, while plasma acetic, propionic, and valeric acid showed a positive correlation.Our study showed alterations of fecal and plasma SCFAs in patients with PD that were associated with an impaired GBB and might be aggravated by constipation.

36355135,"A New Concept of Associations between Gut Microbiota, Immunity and Central Nervous System for the Innovative Treatment of Neurodegenerative Disorders.","Nerve cell death accounts for various neurodegenerative disorders, in which altered immunity to the integrated central nervous system (CNS) might have destructive consequences. This undesirable immune response often affects the progressive neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and/or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It has been shown that commensal gut microbiota could influence the brain and/or several machineries of immune function. In other words, neurodegenerative disorders may be connected to the gut-brain-immune correlational system. The engrams in the brain could retain the information of a certain inflammation in the body which might be involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. Tactics involving the use of probiotics and/or fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) are now evolving as the most promising and/or valuable for the modification of the gut-brain-immune axis. More deliberation of this concept and the roles of gut microbiota would lead to the development of stupendous treatments for the prevention of, and/or therapeutics for, various intractable diseases including several neurodegenerative disorders.",Metabolites,2022,Sayuri Yoshikawa; Kurumi Taniguchi; Haruka Sawamura; Yuka Ikeda; Ai Tsuji; Satoru Matsuda

34974121,Gut microbiota modulation by prednisolone in a rat kindling model of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizure.,"The gut microbiota is a complex community composed by several microorganisms that interact in the maintenance of homeostasis and contribute to physiological processes, including brain function. The relationship of the taxonomic composition of the gut microbiota with neurological diseases such as autism, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, anxiety, and depression is widely recognized. The immune system is an important intermediary between the gut microbiota and the central nervous system, being one of the communication routes of the gut-brain axis. Although the complexity of the relationship between inflammation and epilepsy has not yet been elucidated, inflammatory processes are similar in many ways to the consequences of dysbiosis and contribute to disease progression.

In this study, we introduce the time factor by comparing gut-microbiota composition in 18 PD patients and 13 healthy controls (HC) at baseline and at least 1 year later, also considering PD clinical features. PD patients and HC underwent a fecal sampling at baseline and at a follow-up appointment. Fecal samples underwent sequencing and 16S rRNA amplicons analysis. Patients'clinical features were valued through Hoehn&Yahr (H&Y) staging-scale and Movement Disorder Society Unified PD Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part-III. Results demonstrated stability in microbiota findings in both PD patients and HC over a period of 14 months: both alfa and beta diversity were maintained in PD patients and HC over the observation period. In addition, differences in microbiota composition between PD patients and HC remained stable over the time period. Moreover, during the same period, patients did not experience any worsening of either staging or motor impairment. Our findings, highlighting the stability and reproducibility of the method, correlate clinical and microbiota stability over time and open the scenario to more extensive longitudinal evaluations.",Brain sciences,2022,Rocco Cerroni; Daniele Pietrucci; Adelaide Teofani; Giovanni Chillemi; Claudio Liguori; Mariangela Pierantozzi; Valeria Unida; Sidorela Selmani; Nicola Biagio Mercuri; Alessandro Stefani
35076890,Gastrointestinal Dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease.,"There has been exponential growth in the awareness and understanding of gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD) over the past 3 decades. The clinical features of GI dysfunction in PD have been clearly identified and innovative research has demonstrated the presence of pathology within the enteric nervous system (ENS) in individuals with PD, leading to suggestions that the GI system may be ground zero for the genesis and the portal of entry of PD pathology, which then ascends via the vagus nerve to the central nervous system (CNS). This theory, as well as the more recent recognition of the association of PD with dysbiosis within the gut microbiota, has been the object of intense study and scrutiny. Since most PD medications are absorbed through the GI system, the need for better understanding of changes within the GI tract that may potentially affect the pattern of response to medications has become evident. In this review, current knowledge of the pathophysiology of changes within the GI tract and the gut microbiome of individuals with PD, including changes that occur with progression of the disease, will be addressed. We focus on common clinical GI problems in PD that can arise from different segments of the GI tract. Relevant diagnostic evaluations and treatment options for each of these problems will be reviewed.",Drugs,2022,Delaram Safarpour; Kaveh Sharzehi; Ronald F Pfeiffer

35837118,Differences in Alpha Diversity of Gut Microbiota in Neurological Diseases.,"Neurological diseases are difficult to diagnose in time, and there is currently a lack of effective predictive methods. Previous studies have indicated that a variety of neurological diseases cause changes in the gut microbiota. Alpha diversity is a major indicator to describe the diversity of the gut microbiota. At present, the relationship between neurological diseases and the alpha diversity of the gut microbiota remains unclear.We performed a systematic literature search of Pubmed and Bioproject databases up to January 2021. Six indices were used to measure alpha diversity, including community richness (observed species, Chao1 and ACE), community diversity (Shannon, Simpson), and phylogenetic diversity (PD). Random-effects meta-analyses on the standardized mean difference (SMD) were carried out on the alpha diversity indices. Subgroup analyses were performed to explore the sources of interstudy heterogeneity. Meta-analysis was performed on articles by matching the age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) of the disease group with the control group. Meanwhile, subgroup analysis was performed to control the variability of the sequencing region, platform, geographical region, instrument, and diseases. The area under the curve (AUC) value of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was calculated to assess the prediction effectiveness of the microbial alpha diversity indices.We conducted a meta-analysis of 24 published studies on 16S rRNA gene amplified sequencing of the gut microbiota and neurological diseases from the Pubmed and Bioproject database (patients, <i>n</i> = 1,469; controls, <i>n</i> = 1,289). The pooled estimate demonstrated that there was no significant difference in the alpha diversity between patients and controls (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Alpha diversity decreased only in Parkinson's disease patients, while it increased in anorexia nervosa patients compared to controls. After adjusting for age, sex, BMI, and geographical region, none of the alpha diversity was associated with neurological diseases. In terms of Illumina HiSeq 2000 and the V3-V5 sequencing region, the results showed that alpha diversity increased significantly in comparison with the controls, while decreased in Illumina HiSeq 2500. ROC curves suggested that alpha diversity could be used as a biomarker to predict the AD (Simpson, AUC= 0.769, <i>P</i> = 0.0001), MS (observed species, AUC= 0.737, <i>P</i> = 0.001), schizophrenia (Chao1, AUC = 0.739, <i>P</i> = 0.002).Our review summarized the relationship between alpha diversity of the gut microbiota and neurological diseases. The alpha diversity of gut microbiota could be a promising predictor for AD, schizophrenia, and MS, but not for all neurological diseases.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2022,Zhuoxin Li; Jie Zhou; Hao Liang; Li Ye; Liuyan Lan; Fang Lu; Qing Wang; Ting Lei; Xiping Yang; Ping Cui; Jiegang Huang

In this study, vancomycin pretreatment was given by gavage once daily with either vancomycin or distilled water for 14Â days to mice, then mice were administered with MPTP (20Â mg/kg, i.p) for four times in one day to establish an acute PD model. Results show that vancomycin pretreatment significantly improved motor dysfunction of mice in pole and traction tests. Although vancomycinÂ pretreatment had no effect on dopamine (DA) or the process of DA synthesis, it inhibited the metabolism of DA by suppressing the expression of striatal monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B). Furthermore, vancomycin pretreatment reduced the number of astrocytes and microglial cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) to alleviate neuroinflammation, decreased the expression of TLR4/MyD88/NF-ÎºB/TNF-Î± signaling pathway in both brain and gut. Meanwhile, vancomycin pretreatment changed gut microbiome composition and the levels of fecal short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). The abundance of Akkermansia and Blautia increased significantly after vancomycin pretreatment, which might be related to inflammation and inhibition of TLR4 signaling pathway. In summary, these results demonstrate that the variation of gut microbiota and its metabolites induced by vancomycin pretreatment might decrease dopamine metabolic rate and relieve inflammation in both gut and brain via the microbiota-gut-brain axis in MPTP-induced PD mice.

35281490,Mechanistic Insights Into Gut Microbiome Dysbiosis-Mediated Neuroimmune Dysregulation and Protein Misfolding and Clearance in the Pathogenesis of Chronic Neurodegenerative Disorders.,"The human gut microbiota is a complex, dynamic, and highly diverse community of microorganisms. Beginning as early as <i>in utero</i> fetal development and continuing through birth to late-stage adulthood, the crosstalk between the gut microbiome and brain is essential for modulating various metabolic, neurodevelopmental, and immune-related pathways. Conversely, microbial dysbiosis - defined as alterations in richness and relative abundances - of the gut is implicated in the pathogenesis of several chronic neurological and neurodegenerative disorders. Evidence from large-population cohort studies suggests that individuals with neurodegenerative conditions have an altered gut microbial composition as well as microbial and serum metabolomic profiles distinct from those in the healthy population. Dysbiosis is also linked to psychiatric and gastrointestinal complications - comorbidities often associated with the prodromal phase of Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Studies have identified potential mediators that link gut dysbiosis and neurological disorders. Recent findings have also elucidated the potential mechanisms of disease pathology in the enteric nervous system prior to the onset of neurodegeneration. This review highlights the functional pathways and mechanisms, particularly gut microbe-induced chronic inflammation, protein misfolding, propagation of disease-specific pathology, defective protein clearance, and autoimmune dysregulation, linking gut microbial dysbiosis and neurodegeneration. In addition, we also discuss how pathogenic transformation of microbial composition leads to increased endotoxin production and fewer beneficial metabolites, both of which could trigger immune cell activation and enteric neuronal dysfunction. These can further disrupt intestinal barrier permeability, aggravate the systemic pro-inflammatory state, impair blood-brain barrier permeability and recruit immune mediators leading to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Continued biomedical advances in understanding the microbiota-gut-brain axis will extend the frontier of neurodegenerative disorders and enable the utilization of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to mitigate the pathological burden of these diseases.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2022,Piyush Padhi; Carter Worth; Gary Zenitsky; Huajun Jin; Kumar Sambamurti; Vellareddy Anantharam; Arthi Kanthasamy; Anumantha G Kanthasamy

35603160,Gut Dysbiosis Is Associated With the Severity of Cryptogenic Stroke and Enhanced Systemic Inflammatory Response.,"Studies implicate that gut dysbiosis is related with many neurological diseases. However, the potential role of gut dysbiosis in cryptogenic stroke (CS) has not been elucidated yet. In this study, a high prevalence of gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction and gut inflammation with increased intestinal permeability have been found in CS patients compared with normal controls (NCs). The systemic inflammation in CS patients was also identified by measuring the levels of plasma C-reactive protein (CRP), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), LPS-binding protein (LBP), and white blood cells (WBC) count. Using 16S rRNA sequencing, we found increased alpha diversity, accompanied by a higher abundance of Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcaceae, and Lactobacillaceae at the family level and <i>Escherichia-Shigella</i>, <i>Streptococcus</i>, <i>Lactobacillus</i>, and <i>Klebsilla</i> at the genus level in the intestinal microbiota of CS patients compared to NCs. Our results showed that the abundance of <i>Klebsilla</i> was positively correlated with the systemic inflammation, the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores, and the infarct volumes. In conclusion, gut dysbiosis in CS patients was associated with the severity of CS and the systemic inflammation.

36619768,The contribution of gut-brain axis to development of neurological symptoms in COVID-19 recovered patients: A hypothesis and review of literature.,"The gut microbiota undergoes significant alterations in response to viral infections, particularly the novel SARS-CoV-2. As impaired gut microbiota can trigger numerous neurological disorders, we suggest that the long-term neurological symptoms of COVID-19 may be related to intestinal microbiota disorders in these patients. Thus, we have gathered available information on how the virus can affect the microbiota of gastrointestinal systems, both in the acute and the recovery phase of the disease, and described several mechanisms through which this gut dysbiosis can lead to long-term neurological disorders, such as Guillain-Barre syndrome, chronic fatigue, psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety, and even neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. These mechanisms may be mediated by inflammatory cytokines, as well as certain chemicals such as gastrointestinal hormones (e.g., CCK), neurotransmitters (e.g., 5-HT), etc. (e.g., short-chain fatty acids), and the autonomic nervous system. In addition to the direct influences of the virus, repurposed medications used for COVID-19 patients can also play a role in gut dysbiosis. In conclusion, although there are many dark spots in our current knowledge of the mechanism of COVID-19-related gut-brain axis disturbance, based on available evidence, we can hypothesize that these two phenomena are more than just a coincidence and highly recommend large-scale epidemiologic studies in the future.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2022,Kimia Vakili; Mobina Fathi; Shirin Yaghoobpoor; Fatemeh Sayehmiri; Yasaman Nazerian; Amirhossein Nazerian; Ashraf Mohamadkhani; Pariya Khodabakhsh; Gislaine Z RÃ©us; Ramtin Hajibeygi; Mostafa Rezaei-Tavirani
36552604,Mangosteen Pericarp Extract Supplementation Boosts Antioxidant Status via Rebuilding Gut Microbiota to Attenuate Motor Deficit in 6-OHDA-Induced Parkinson's Disease.,"Oxidative stress and gut dysbiosis have been known to precede Parkinson's disease (PD). An antioxidant-rich product, mangosteen pericarp (MP), has the ability to counterbalance excessive free radicals and the imbalanced gut microbiota composition, suggesting the MP's capacity to delay PD progression. In this study, we explored the effects of two doses of MP extract in a unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced PD rat model. We revealed that the 8-week supplementation of a low dose (LMP) and a high dose of the MP extract (HMP) improved motor function, as observed in decreased contralateral rotation, improved time spent on rod, and higher dopamine binding transporter (DAT) in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). The MP extract, especially the HMP, also increased antioxidant-related gene expressions, restored muscle mitochondrial function, and remodeled fecal microbiota composition, which were followed by reduced reactive oxygen species levels in brain and inflammation in plasma. Importantly, bacterial genera <i>Sutterella</i>, <i>Rothia</i>, and <i>Aggregatibacter</i>, which were negatively correlated with antioxidant gene expressions, decreased in the HMP group. It is imperative to note that in addition to directly acting as an antioxidant to reduce excessive free radicals, MP extract might also increase antioxidant state by rebuilding gut microbiota, thereby enhanced anti-inflammatory capacity and restored mitochondrial function to attenuate motor deficit in 6-OHDA-induced PD-like condition. All in all, MP extract is a potential candidate for auxiliary therapy for PD.","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,Bira Arumndari Nurrahma; Tu-Hsueh Yeh; Rong-Hong Hsieh; Shu-Ping Tsao; Chia-Wen Chen; Yen-Peng Lee; Chun-Hsu Pan; Hui-Yu Huang
36439235,Probiotic <i>Pediococcus pentosaceus</i> ameliorates MPTP-induced oxidative stress <i>via</i> regulating the gut microbiota-gut-brain axis.,"Recent evidence demonstrated that functional bacteria were involved in the regulation of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the mechanism of probiotics in improving PD was unclear. Here the antioxidant effect and the mechanism of probiotics <i>Pediococcus pentosaceus</i> (PP) on PD were studied by regulating the gut-brain axis. In this study, male C57BL/6J mice were injected with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) intraperitoneally to establish a PD model and were then treated with PP for 4 weeks. Subsequently, a series of neurobehavioral tests to evaluate the motor function of the mice was performed. Additionally, degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, accumulation of Î±-synuclein, the production of an oxidative stress response, and the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway-related proteins were evaluated. Moreover, the gut microbial composition and the level of metabolite Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were assessed. The results showed that PP treatment could improve MPTP-induced motor deficits, the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, and the accumulation of Î±-synuclein. Moreover, PP treatment significantly increased the levels of SOD1, Gpx1, and Nrf2, while it decreased the levels of Keap1 in the brain of MPTP-induced mice. Notably, PP treatment improved the gut microbial dysbiosis and increased the level of GABA in MPTP-induced mice. These findings indicated that PP might represent a promising candidate, due to the metabolite of GABA, that could be used for the treatment of PD.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2022,Sipei Pan; Hongming Wei; Shushu Yuan; Yu Kong; Huiqun Yang; Yuhe Zhang; Xiaorui Cui; Weian Chen; Jiaming Liu; Yang Zhang
36504794,Reviewing the state of the art of probiotics as clinical modalities for brain-gut-microbiota axis associated disorders.,"The rise in prevalence of mental and neurological disorders is causing a high burden on society, however adequate interventions are not always available. The brain-gut-microbiota axis (BGMA) may provide a new angle for the development of clinical modalities. Due to the intricate bi-directional signaling between the brain and the gut, it may be helpful to look into interventions that target the gut, such as probiotics. Therefore, this review aimed to investigate the state of the art of probiotics and their potential as clinical modalities for BGMA-associated indications by gaining insight into patents and clinical trials that have been applied for and executed since 1999. A total of 565 patents and 390 clinical trials were found, focusing on probiotic applications for 83 indications. Since the start of the 21st century, the highest numbers of patents and clinical trials were related to primary neuropsychological, affective (depression, anxiety) and cognitive disorders, neurodegenerative and/or inflammatory brain disorders (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amongst others), and gastrointestinal disorders (irritable bowel syndrome). The locations where the most patents and clinical trials were registered included China, the United States, and Iran. From 1999 to ~2013 a slight growth could be seen in the numbers of patents and clinical trials, followed by an almost exponential growth from ~2013 onwards. Overall, the developments of the state of the art were in accordance with previous research, however it appeared that clinical trials showed a slightly slower growth compared to patents, which may have implications for the future implementation of probiotics as clinical modalities for BGMA-associated indications.",Frontiers in microbiology,2022,Cato Wiegers; MariÃ«t A Veerman; Robert Jan Brummer; Olaf F A Larsen
36570528,The effects of microbiota abundance on symptom severity in Parkinson's disease: A systematic review.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is neurodegenerative disease with a multifactorial etiopathogenesis with accumulating evidence identifying microbiota as a potential factor in the earliest, prodromal phases of the disease. Previous research has already shown a significant difference between gut microbiota composition in PD patients as opposed to healthy controls, with a growing number of studies correlating gut microbiota changes with the clinical presentation of the disease in later stages, through various motor and non-motor symptoms. Our aim in this systematic review is to compose and assess current knowledge in the field and determine if the findings could influence future clinical practice as well as therapy in PD.We have conducted a systematic review according to PRISMA guidelines through MEDLINE and Embase databases, with studies being selected for inclusion via a set inclusion and exclusion criteria.20 studies were included in this systematic review according to the selected inclusion and exclusion criteria. The search yielded 18 case control studies, 1 case study, and 1 prospective case study with no controls. The total number of PD patients encompassed in the studies cited in this review is 1,511.The link between gut microbiota and neurodegeneration is a complex one and it depends on various factors. The relative abundance of various microbiota taxa in the gut has been consistently shown to have a correlation with motor and non-motor symptom severity. The answer could lie in the products of gut microbiota metabolism which have also been linked to PD. Further research is thus warranted in the field, with a focus on the metabolic function of gut microbiota in relation to motor and non-motor symptoms.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2022,EliÅ¡a PapiÄ; Valentino RaÄki; Mario Hero; Zoran TomiÄ; Nada StarÄeviÄ-ÄiÅ¾mareviÄ; Anja Kovanda; Miljenko KapoviÄ; Goran Hauser; Borut Peterlin; Vladimira VuletiÄ
35342048,Alteration of Gut Microbial Metabolites in the Systemic Circulation of Patients with Parkinson's Disease.,"Emerging evidence suggests that gut dysbiosis contributes to Parkinson's disease (PD) by signaling through microbial metabolites. Hippuric acid (HA), indole derivatives, and secondary bile acids are among the most common gut metabolites.To examine the relationship of systemic concentrations of these microbial metabolites associated with changes of gut microbiota, PD status, and severity of PD.We enrolled 56 patients with PD and 43 age- and sex-matched healthy participants. Motor and cognitive severity were assessed with Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) part III motor score and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), respectively. Plasma concentrations of targeted gut metabolites were measured with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Gut microbiota was analyzed with shotgun metagenomic sequencing.Compared with controls, PD patients had significantly higher plasma levels of HA, indole-3-propionic acid (IPA), deoxycholic acid (DCA), and glycodeoxycholic acid (GDCA). After adjustment for age and sex in a multivariate logistic regression analysis, plasma levels of HA (odds ratio [OR] 3.21, pâ<â0.001), IPA (OR 2.59, pâ=â0.031), and GDCA (OR 2.82, pâ=â0.036) were associated with positive PD status. Concentrations of these gut metabolites did not correlate with MDS-UPDRS part III score or MMSE after adjustment for confounders. Microbial metabolite levels were associated with the relative abundance of pro-inflammatory gut bacteria.Aberrant gut microbial metabolites of HA, indole derivatives and secondary bile acids associated with specific gut microbiota changes were observed in patients with PD.",Journal of Parkinson's disease,2022,Szu-Ju Chen; Chieh-Chang Chen; Hsin-Yu Liao; Yu-Wei Wu; Jyh-Ming Liou; Ming-Shiang Wu; Ching-Hua Kuo; Chin-Hsien Lin
35786740,Gut instincts in neuroimmunity from the eighteenth to twenty-first centuries.,"In the past two decades, work on the microbiota-gut-brain axis has led to a renewed appreciation for the interconnectedness between body systems in both clinical and scientific circles. In the USA alone, millions of adults are burdened with non-communicable chronic diseases whose putative etiologies were previously thought to be restricted to either the gut or brain, such as inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, and autism spectrum disorder. However, the recent explosion of research into the impacts of the gut microbiome on diverse aspects of human health has revealed the potentially critical importance of reciprocal interactions between the gut microbiota, the immune system, and the brain in diverse diseases and disorders. In this review, we revisit the history of gut-brain interactions in science and medicine, which dates back to at least the eighteenth century, and outline how concepts in this field have shifted and evolved across eras. Next, we highlight the modern resurgence of gut-brain axis research, focusing on neuro-immune-microbiota interactions and recent progress towards a mechanistic understanding of the diverse impacts of the microbiome on human health. Finally, we offer a forward-looking perspective on the future of microbiota-gut-brain research, which may eventually reveal new paths towards the treatment of diverse diseases influenced by the complex connections between the microbiota and the brain.",Seminars in immunopathology,2022,Mytien Nguyen; Noah W Palm

35572129,Multi-Omics Integration in Mice With Parkinson's Disease and the Intervention Effect of Cyanidin-3-<i>O</i>-Glucoside.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multifactorial degenerative disease of the central nervous system, which affects mostly older adults. To date, research has focused on the progression of PD. Simultaneously, it was confirmed that the imbalances in gut microbiota are associated with the onset and progression of PD. Accurate diagnosis and precise treatment of PD are currently deficient due to the absence of effective biomarkers.In this study, the pharmacodynamic study of cyanidin-3-<i>O</i>-glucoside in PD mice was used. It intends to use the ""imbalance"" and ""balance"" of intestinal microecology as the starting point to investigate the ""gut-to-brain"" hypothesis using metabolomic-combined 16S rRNA gene sequencing methods. Simultaneously, metabolomic analysis was implemented to acquire differential metabolites, and microbiome analysis was performed to analyze the composition and filter the remarkably altered gut microbiota at the phylum/genera level. Afterward, metabolic pathway and functional prediction analysis of the screened differential metabolites and gut microbiota were applied using the MetaboAnalyst database. In addition, Pearson's correlation analysis was used for the differential metabolites and gut microbiota. We found that cyanidin-3-<i>O</i>-glucoside could protect 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6- tetrahydropy ridine (MPTP)-induced PD mice.Metabolomic analysis showed that MPTP-induced dysbiosis of the gut microbiota significantly altered sixty-seven metabolites. The present studies have also shown that MPTP-induced PD is related to lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and so on. The 16S rRNA sequencing analysis indicated that 5 phyla and 22 genera were significantly altered. Furthermore, the differential gut microbiota was interrelated with amino acid metabolism, and so on. The metabolites and gut microbiota network diagram revealed significant correlations between 11 genera and 8 differential metabolites.In combination, this study offers potential molecular biomarkers that should be validated for future translation into clinical applications for more accurately diagnosing PD. Simultaneously, the results of this study lay a basis for further study of the association between host metabolisms, gut microbiota, and PD.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2022,Wang Wang; Guoxue Zhu; Yuwen Wang; Wei Li; Shilin Yi; Kai Wang; Lu Fan; Juanjuan Tang; Ruini Chen
34996385,Serum short-chain fatty acids and its correlation with motor and non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease patients.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with enteric nervous system dysfunction and gut microbiota dysbiosis. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), derived from gut microbiota, are supposed to anticipate PD pathogenesis via the pathway of spinal cord and vagal nerve or the circulatory system. However, the serum concentration of SCFAs in PD patients is poorly known. This study aims to investigate the exact level of SCFAs in PD patients and its correlation with Parkinson's symptoms.50 PD patients and 50 healthy controls were recruited, and their demographic and clinical characteristics were collected. The serum concentration of SCFAs was detected using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometer. SCFAs were compared between PD and control groups. The correlation between serum SCFAs and Parkinson's symptoms and the potential effects of medications on the serum SCFAs was analyzed.Serum propionic acid, butyric acid and caproic acid were lower, while heptanoic acid was higher in PD patients than in control subjects. However, only the serum level of propionic acid was correlated with Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRs) part III score (RÂ =Â -0.365, PÂ =Â 0.009), Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE) score (RÂ =Â -0.416, PÂ =Â 0.003), and Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) score (RÂ =Â 0.306, PÂ =Â 0.03). There was no correlation between other serum SCFAs and motor complications. The use of trihexyphenidyl or tizanidine increased the serum concentration of propionic acid.Serum SCFAs are altered in PD patients, and the decrease of serum propionic acid level is correlated with motor symptoms, cognitive ability and non-depressed state. Thus, the gut microbial-derived SCFAs potentially affect Parkinson's symptoms through the blood circulation. Propionic acid supplementation might ameliorate motor and non-motor symptoms of PD patients, although clinical trials are needed to test this hypothesis.",BMC neurology,2022,Gang Wu; Zhengli Jiang; Yaling Pu; Shiyong Chen; Tingling Wang; Yajing Wang; Xiaoping Xu; Shanshan Wang; Minya Jin; Yangyang Yao; Yang Liu; Shaofa Ke; Suzhi Liu

36358513,Neurodegenerative Microbially-Shaped Diseases: Oxidative Stress Meets Neuroinflammation.,"Inflammation and oxidative stress characterize a number of chronic conditions including neurodegenerative diseases and aging. Inflammation is a key component of the innate immune response in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease of which oxidative stress is an important hallmark. Immune dysregulation and mitochondrial dysfunction with concomitant reactive oxygen species accumulation have also been implicated in both diseases, both systemically and within the Central Nervous System. Mitochondria are a centrally positioned signalling hub for inflammatory responses and inflammatory cells can release reactive species at the site of inflammation often leading to exaggerated oxidative stress. A growing body of evidence suggests that disruption of normal gut microbiota composition may induce increased permeability of the gut barrier leading to chronic systemic inflammation, which may, in turn, impair the blood-brain barrier function and promote neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. The gastrointestinal tract is constantly exposed to myriad exogenous substances and microbial pathogens, which are abundant sources of reactive oxygen species, oxidative damage and pro-inflammatory events. Several studies have demonstrated that microbial infections may also affect the balance in gut microbiota composition (involving oxidant and inflammatory processes by the host and indigenous microbiota) and influence downstream Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease pathogenesis, in which blood-brain barrier damage ultimately occurs. Therefore, the oxidant/inflammatory insults triggered by a disrupted gut microbiota and chronic dysbiosis often lead to compromised gut barrier function, allowing inflammation to ""escape"" as well as uncontrolled immune responses that may ultimately disrupt mitochondrial function upwards the brain. Future therapeutic strategies should be designed to ""restrain"" gut inflammation, a goal that could ideally be attained by microbiota modulation strategies, in alternative to classic anti-inflammatory agents with unpredictable effects on the microbiota architecture itself.","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,Diana Filipa Silva; Nuno Empadinhas; Sandra Morais Cardoso; Ana Raquel Esteves
35405323,Linking circadian rhythms to microbiome-gut-brain axis in aging-associated neurodegenerative diseases.,"Emerging evidence suggests that both disruption of circadian rhythms and gut dysbiosis are closely related to aging-associated neurodegenerative diseases. Over the last decade, the microbiota-gut-brain axis has been an emerging field and revolutionized studies in pathology, diagnosis, and treatment of neurological disorders. Crosstalk between the brain and gut microbiota can be accomplished via the endocrine, immune, and nervous system. Recent studies have shown that the composition and diurnal oscillation of gut microbiota are influenced by host circadian rhythms. This provides a new perspective for investigating the microbiome-gut-brain axis. We aim to review current understanding and research on the dynamic interaction between circadian rhythms and the microbiome-gut-brain axis. Furthermore, we will address the possible neurodegenerative disease contribution through circadian rhythms and microbiome-gut-brain axis crosstalk.",Ageing research reviews,2022,Wai-Yin Cheng; Yuen-Shan Ho; Raymond Chuen-Chung Chang
36144449,Advanced Glycation End Products in Health and Disease.,"Advanced glycation end products (AGEs), formed through the nonenzymatic reaction of reducing sugars with the side-chain amino groups of lysine or arginine of proteins, followed by further glycoxidation reactions under oxidative stress conditions, are involved in the onset and exacerbation of a variety of diseases, including diabetes, atherosclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) as well as in the secondary stages of traumatic brain injury (TBI). AGEs, in the form of intra- and interprotein crosslinks, deactivate various enzymes, exacerbating disease progression. The interactions of AGEs with the receptors for the AGEs (RAGE) also result in further downstream inflammatory cascade events. The overexpression of RAGE and the AGE-RAGE interactions are especially involved in cases of Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases, including TBI and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Maillard reactions are also observed in the gut bacterial species. The protein aggregates found in the bacterial species resemble those of AD and Parkinson's disease (PD), and AGE inhibitors increase the life span of the bacteria. Dietary AGEs alter the gut microbiota composition and elevate plasma glycosylation, thereby leading to systemic proinflammatory effects and endothelial dysfunction. There is emerging interest in developing AGE inhibitor and AGE breaker compounds to treat AGE-mediated pathologies, including diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases. Gut-microbiota-derived enzymes may also function as AGE-breaker biocatalysts. Thus, AGEs have a prominent role in the pathogenesis of various diseases, and the AGE inhibitor and AGE breaker approach may lead to novel therapeutic candidates.",Microorganisms,2022,V Prakash Reddy; Puspa Aryal; Emmanuel K Darkwah

The makeup of the microbiome is impacted by a variety of factors, such as genetics, health status, method of delivery, environment, nutrition, and exercise, and the present understanding of the role of gut microbiota and its metabolites in the preservation of brain functioning and the development of the aforementioned neurological illnesses is summarized in this review article. Furthermore, we discuss current breakthroughs in the use of probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics to address neurological illnesses. Moreover, we also discussed the role of boron-based diet in memory, boron and microbiome relation, boron as anti-inflammatory agents, and boron in neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, in the coming years, boron reagents will play a significant role to improve dysbiosis and will open new areas for researchers.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,Varsha Nandwana; Nitesh K Nandwana; Yogarupa Das; Mariko Saito; Tanisha Panda; Sasmita Das; Frankis Almaguel; Narayan S Hosmane; Bhaskar C Das
36226922,Fucosylated Chondroitin Sulfate against Parkinson's Disease through Inhibiting Inflammation Induced by Gut Dysbiosis.,"Growing evidence for the importance of the gut-brain axis in Parkinson's disease (PD) has attracted researchers' interest in the possible application of microbiota-based treatment approaches. Using a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced mouse model, we looked into the prospect of treating PD with fucosylated chondroitin sulfate obtained from sea cucumbers <i>Isostichopus badionotus</i> (fCS-<i>Ib</i>). We showed that giving fCS-<i>Ib</i> polysaccharide orally greatly reduced the motor deficits, dopamine depletion, and alpha-synuclein increase caused by MPTP in the substantia nigra (SN). It appears that the anti-PD action of fCS-<i>Ib</i> polysaccharide could be attained by squelching inflammation. Glial cell hyperactivation in SN and overproduction of proinflammatory substances in serum could both be suppressed by fCS-<i>Ib</i> polysaccharide injection. The bacterial DNA in fresh colonic feces was submitted to 16S rRNA and untargeted metabolic analyses to confirm the participation of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in the aforementioned interpretation. The findings showed that the MPTP treatment-induced decrease in <i>norank_f_Muribaculaceae</i> and the increase in <i>Staphylococcus</i> were reversed by the administration of fCS-<i>Ib</i> polysaccharide. The NF-ÎºB signaling pathway was shown to be involved in the fCS-<i>Ib</i> polysaccharide-induced anti-inflammation. In conclusion, our research demonstrated for the first time how fCS-<i>Ib</i> polysaccharide combats PD by reducing inflammation caused by gut microbial dysbiosis.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2022,Yimeng Liu; Xuyu Liu; Qiantao Ye; Yida Wang; Jiafu Zhang; Song Lin; Guang Wang; Xuesong Yang; Jichun Zhang; Shiguo Chen; Nian Wu
35829770,Studying the Parkinson's disease metabolome and exposome in biological samples through different analytical and cheminformatics approaches: a pilot study.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease, with an increasing incidence in recent years due to the aging population. Genetic mutations alone only explainâ<10% of PD cases, while environmental factors, including small molecules, may play a significant role in PD. In the present work, 22 plasma (11 PD, 11 control) and 19 feces samples (10 PD, 9 control) were analyzed by non-target high-resolution mass spectrometry (NT-HRMS) coupled to two liquid chromatography (LC) methods (reversed-phase (RP) and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC)). A cheminformatics workflow was optimized using open software (MS-DIAL and patRoon) and open databases (all public MSP-formatted spectral libraries for MS-DIAL, PubChemLite for Exposomics, and the LITMINEDNEURO list for patRoon). Furthermore, five disease-specific databases and three suspect lists (on PD and related disorders) were developed, using PubChem functionality to identifying relevant unknown chemicals. The results showed that non-target screening with the larger databases generally provided better results compared with smaller suspect lists. However, two suspect screening approaches with patRoon were also good options to study specific chemicals in PD. The combination of chromatographic methods (RP and HILIC) as well as two ionization modes (positive and negative) enhanced the coverage of chemicals in the biological samples. While most metabolomics studies in PD have focused on blood and cerebrospinal fluid, we found a higher number of relevant features in feces, such as alanine betaine or nicotinamide, which can be directly metabolized by gut microbiota. This highlights the potential role of gut dysbiosis in PD development.",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,2022,BegoÃ±a Talavera AndÃºjar; Dagny Aurich; Velma T E Aho; Randolph R Singh; Tiejun Cheng; Leonid Zaslavsky; Evan E Bolton; Brit Mollenhauer; Paul Wilmes; Emma L Schymanski
36001607,A Metabologenomic approach reveals alterations in the gut microbiota of a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"The key role played by host-microbiota interactions on human health, disease onset and progression, and on host response to treatments has increasingly emerged in the latest decades. Indeed, dysbiosis has been associated to several human diseases such as obesity, diabetes, cancer and also neurodegenerative disease, such as Parkinson, Huntington and Alzheimer's disease (AD), although whether causative, consequence or merely an epiphenomenon is still under investigation. In the present study, we performed a metabologenomic analysis of stool samples from a mouse model of AD, the 3xTgAD. We found a significant change in the microbiota of AD mice compared to WT, with a longitudinal divergence of the F/B ratio, a parameter suggesting a gut dysbiosis. Moreover, AD mice showed a significant decrease of some amino acids, while data integration revealed a dysregulated production of desaminotyrosine (DAT) and dihydro-3-coumaric acid. Collectively, our data show a dysregulated gut microbiota associated to the onset and progression of AD, also indicating that a dysbiosis can occur prior to significant clinical signs, evidenced by early SCFA alterations, compatible with gut inflammation.",PloS one,2022,Francesco Favero; Elettra Barberis; Mara Gagliardi; Stefano Espinoza; Liliana Contu; Stefano Gustincich; Francesca Boccafoschi; Chiara Borsotti; Dmitry Lim; Vito Rubino; Flavio Mignone; Edoardo Pasolli; Marcello Manfredi; Silvia Zucchelli; Davide CorÃ ; Marco Corazzari

36289839,Involvement of Intestinal Enteroendocrine Cells in Neurological and Psychiatric Disorders.,"Neurological and psychiatric patients have increased dramatically in number in the past few decades. However, effective treatments for these diseases and disorders are limited due to heterogeneous and unclear pathogenic mechanisms. Therefore, further exploration of the biological aspects of the disease, and the identification of novel targets to develop alternative treatment strategies, is urgently required. Systems-level investigations have indicated the potential involvement of the brain-gut axis and intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis and regulation of neurological and psychiatric disorders. While intestinal microbiota is crucial for maintaining host physiology, some important sensory and regulatory cells in the host should not be overlooked. Intestinal epithelial enteroendocrine cells (EECs) residing in the epithelium throughout intestine are the key regulators orchestrating the communication along the brain-gut-microbiota axis. On one hand, EECs sense changes in luminal microorganisms via microbial metabolites; on the other hand, they communicate with host body systems via neuroendocrine molecules. Therefore, EECs are believed to play important roles in neurological and psychiatric disorders. This review highlights the involvement of EECs and subtype cells, via secretion of endocrine molecules, in the development and regulation of neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD), schizophrenia, visceral pain, neuropathic pain, and depression. Moreover, the current paper summarizes the potential mechanism of EECs in contributing to disease pathogenesis. Examination of these mechanisms may inspire and lead to the development of new aspects of treatment strategies for neurological and psychiatric disorders in the future.",Biomedicines,2022,Liangen Yu; Yihang Li
35742813,Dual-Hit Model of Parkinson's Disease: Impact of Dysbiosis on 6-Hydroxydopamine-Insulted Mice-Neuroprotective and Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Butyrate.,"Recent evidence highlights Parkinson's disease (PD) initiation in the gut as the prodromal phase of neurodegeneration. Gut impairment due to microbial dysbiosis could affect PD pathogenesis and progression. Here, we propose a two-hit model of PD through ceftriaxone (CFX)-induced dysbiosis and gut inflammation before the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) intrastriatal injection to mimic dysfunctional gut-associated mechanisms preceding PD onset. Therefore, we showed that dysbiosis and gut damage amplified PD progression, worsening motor deficits induced by 6-OHDA up to 14 days post intrastriatal injection. This effect was accompanied by a significant increase in neuronal dopaminergic loss (reduced tyrosine hydroxylase expression and increased Bcl-2/Bax ratio). Notably, CFX pretreatment also enhanced systemic and colon inflammation of dual-hit subjected mice. The exacerbated inflammatory response ran in tandem with a worsening of colonic architecture and gut microbiota perturbation. Finally, we demonstrated the beneficial effect of post-biotic sodium butyrate in limiting at once motor deficits, neuroinflammation, and colon damage and re-shaping microbiota composition in this novel dual-hit model of PD. Taken together, the bidirectional communication of the microbiota-gut-brain axis and the recapitulation of PD prodromal/pathogenic features make this new paradigm a useful tool for testing or repurposing new multi-target compounds in the treatment of PD.",International journal of molecular sciences,2022,Carmen Avagliano; Lorena Coretti; Adriano Lama; Claudio Pirozzi; Carmen De Caro; Davide De Biase; Luigia Turco; Maria Pina Mollica; Orlando Paciello; Antonio Calignano; Rosaria Meli; Francesca Lembo; Giuseppina Mattace Raso

They are known as ""health-friendly bacteria"", normally residing in the human gut and involved in maintaining homeostatic conditions. Imbalance in gut microbiota results in the pathophysiology of several diseases entailing the GIT tract, skin, immune system, inflammation, and gut-brain axis. Recently, the use of probiotics has gained tremendous interest, because of their profound effects on the management of these disease conditions. Recent findings suggest that probiotics enrichment in different human and mouse disease models showed promising beneficial effects and results in the amelioration of disease symptoms.

36364961,Direct Action of Non-Digestible Oligosaccharides against a Leaky Gut.,"The epithelial monolayer is the primary determinant of mucosal barrier function, and tight junction (TJ) complexes seal the paracellular space between the adjacent epithelial cells and represent the main ""gate-keepers"" of the paracellular route. Impaired TJ functionality results in increased permeation of the ""pro-inflammatory"" luminal contents to the circulation that induces local and systemic inflammatory and immune responses, ultimately triggering and/or perpetuating (chronic) systemic inflammatory disorders. Increased gut leakiness is associated with intestinal and systemic disease states such as inflammatory bowel disease and neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease. Modulation of TJ dynamics is an appealing strategy aiming at inflammatory conditions associated with compromised intestinal epithelial function. Recently there has been a growing interest in nutraceuticals, particularly in non-digestible oligosaccharides (NDOs). NDOs confer innumerable health benefits via microbiome-shaping and gut microbiota-related immune responses, including enhancement of epithelial barrier integrity. Emerging evidence supports that NDOs also exert health-beneficial effects on microbiota independently via direct interactions with intestinal epithelial and immune cells. Among these valuable features, NDOs promote barrier function by directly regulating TJs via AMPK-, PKC-, MAPK-, and TLR-associated pathways. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the epithelial barrier-protective effects of different NDOs with a special focus on their microbiota-independent modulation of TJs.",Nutrients,2022,Maria Eleni Mavrogeni; Mostafa Asadpoor; Paul A J Henricks; Ali Keshavarzian; Gert Folkerts; Saskia Braber

The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs) of gut microbiota-based models for Hoehn & Yahr (HY) stages 1 and 2 were 0.799 and 0.705, respectively. Similarly, gut microbiota predicted the progression of Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) III scores in an early stage of PD with AUROCâ=â0.728. Decreases of short-chain fatty acid-producing genera, Fusicatenibacter, Faecalibacterium, and Blautia, as well as an increase of mucin-degrading genus Akkermansia, predicted accelerated disease progression.

36240098,Association Between Microbial Tyrosine Decarboxylase Gene and Levodopa Responsiveness in Patients With Parkinson Disease.,"Interindividual variability in levodopa efficacy is a challenge for the personalized treatment of Parkinson disease (PD). Gut microbiota might represent a new approach for personalized medicine. Recently, a novel microbial levodopa metabolism pathway was identified, which is mediated by tyrosine decarboxylase mainly encoded by tyrosine decarboxylase gene (<i>tyrDC</i>) in <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i>. In this study, we aimed to identify whether the abundance of microbial <i>tyrDC</i> gene and <i>E faecalis</i> is associated with levodopa responsiveness and could predict the drug response.This cross-sectional study enrolled patients with PD between December 2019 and January 2022 and evaluated levodopa responsiveness using a levodopa challenge test. Patients were stratified into moderate and good responders based on levodopa responsiveness. The <i>tyrDC</i> gene and <i>E. faecalis</i> abundance in fecal samples were measured using quantitative real-time PCR. Plasma levodopa concentrations were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis. The predictive models for levodopa responsiveness were constructed and verified through cross-validation and external validation.A total of 101 patients with PD were enrolled in the primary cohort and 43 were enrolled in the external validation cohort. Moderate responders had higher abundances of the <i>tyrDC</i> gene (3.6 [3.1-4.3] vs 2.6 [2.1-2.9], <i>p</i> < 0.001) and <i>E faecalis</i> (3.2 [2.5-4.4] vs 2.6 [2.1-3.6], <i>p</i> = 0.010) than good responders. The <i>tyrDC</i> gene abundance was independently associated with levodopa responsiveness (OR: 5.848; 95% CI: 2.664-12.838; <i>p</i> < 0.001). Notably, <i>tyrDC</i> gene abundance showed certain discriminative power for levodopa responsiveness in primary cohort (sensitivity: 80.0%; specificity: 84.3%; area under the curve [AUC]: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.77-0.93; <i>p</i> < 0.001) and external validation cohort (sensitivity: 85.0%; specificity: 95.7%; AUC: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.89-1.02; <i>p</i> < 0.001). The prediction of levodopa responsiveness based on <i>tyrDC</i> gene abundance had good calibration and discrimination in cross-validation (C-index in training and test sets: 0.856 and 0.851, respectively) and external validation (C-index: 0.952).The microbial <i>tyrDC</i> gene abundance could serve as a potential biomarker of levodopa responsiveness. Novel strategies targeting the <i>tyrDC</i> gene may provide new approaches for personalized levodopa treatment.",Neurology,2022,Yi Zhang; Xiaoqin He; Chengjun Mo; Xiaoqian Liu; Jian Li; Zheng Yan; Yiwei Qian; Yiqiu Lai; Shaoqing Xu; Xiaodong Yang; Qin Xiao
35806985,The Risk of Developing Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Meta-Analysis.,"Recently, a growing body of research has linked gut microbiota dysbiosis to central nervous system diseases, such as Alzheimerâs disease (AD) and Parkinsonâs disease (PD), and has suggested that AD and PD pathology may take its origin from chronic inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. Thus, this study aimed to elucidate whether inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with a higher risk of developing AD and PD as compared to the non-IBD population by conducting a meta-analysis. A thorough search of Pubmed and Embase databases was performed to identify all relevant articles. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were analyzed using a fixed-effect model. To assess publication bias and heterogeneity among the studies, Eggerâs test and LâAbbÃ© plots were used, respectively. A total of eight eligible studies were included in this meta-analysis. No significant heterogeneity or significant publication bias was detected. The risk of developing AD in IBD patients was higher than in non-IBD patients (OR = 0.37; 95% CI = 0.14â1.00; p = 0.05), and there was a relationship between the occurrence of AD and Crohnâs disease or ulcerative colitis (OR = 0.11; 95% CI = 0.04â0.30; p < 0.0001, OR = 0.14; 95% CI = 0.04â0.49; p = 0.0024, respectively). The risk of developing both of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, AD and PD, was also significantly higher in patients diagnosed with Crohnâs disease or ulcerative colitis (OR = 0.21; 95% CI = 0.09â0.49; p = 0.0003, OR = 0.25; 95% CI = 0.13â0.51; p = 0.0001, respectively). This meta-analysis revealed a higher risk of AD and PD among CD and UC patients compared to the general population. It may suggest a key role for the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of not only Crohnâs disease and ulcerative colitis but also AD and PD. The identification of this potential risk may provide earlier preventive measures to be implemented to reduce comorbidity and mortality rate.",Journal of clinical medicine,2022,Marta Szandruk-Bender; Benita Wiatrak; Adam SzelÄg
36422338,Role of Probiotics and Diet in the Management of Neurological Diseases and Mood States: A Review.,"Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's diseases (PD) are common in older people. Autism spectrum disorders (ASD), anxiety, depression, stress, and cognitive impairment are prevalent among people irrespective of age. The incidence of neurological disorders has been increasing in recent decades. Communication between the gut microbiota and the brain is intrinsically complicated, and it is necessary for the maintenance of the gut, brain, and immune functions of the host. The bidirectional link among the gut, gut microbiota and the brain is designated as the ""microbiota-gut-brain axis."" Gut microbiota modulates the host immune system and functions of tissue barriers such as gut mucosa and blood-brain barrier (BBB). Gut microbial dysfunction disturbs the gut-brain interplay and may contribute to various gut disorders, neurocognitive and psychiatric disorders. Probiotics could protect intestinal integrity, enhance gut functions, promote intestinal mucosal and BBB functions, and support the synthesis of brain-derived neurotrophic factors, which enhance neuronal survival and differentiation. Probiotics could be considered an adjunct therapy to manage metabolic and psychiatric diseases. Predominantly, <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Bifidobacterium</i> strains are documented as potent probiotics, which help to maintain the bidirectional interactions between the gut and brain. The consumption of probiotics and probiotics containing fermented foods could improve the gut microbiota. The diet impacts gut microbiota, and a balanced diet could maintain the integrity of gut-brain communication by facilitating the production of neurotrophic factors and other neuropeptides. However, the beneficial effects of probiotics and diet might depend upon several factors, including strain, dosage, duration, age, host physiology, etc. This review summarizes the importance and involvement of probiotics and diet in neuroprotection and managing representative neurological disorders, injuries and mood states.",Microorganisms,2022,Subramanian Thangaleela; Bhagavathi Sundaram Sivamaruthi; Periyanaina Kesika; Chaiyavat Chaiyasut

35844606,T<sub>REG</sub>king From Gut to Brain: The Control of Regulatory T Cells Along the Gut-Brain Axis.,"The human gastrointestinal tract has an enormous and diverse microbial community, termed microbiota, that is necessary for the development of the immune system and tissue homeostasis. In contrast, microbial dysbiosis is associated with various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases as well as neurological disorders in humans by affecting not only the immune system in the gastrointestinal tract but also other distal organs. FOXP3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a subset of CD4<sup>+</sup> helper T cell lineages that function as a gatekeeper for immune activation and are essential for peripheral autoimmunity prevention. Tregs are crucial to the maintenance of immunological homeostasis and tolerance at barrier regions. Tregs reside in both lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues, and tissue-resident Tregs have unique tissue-specific phenotype and distinct function. The gut microbiota has an impact on Tregs development, accumulation, and function in periphery. Tregs, in turn, modulate antigen-specific responses aimed towards gut microbes, which supports the host-microbiota symbiotic interaction in the gut. Recent studies have indicated that Tregs interact with a variety of resident cells in central nervous system (CNS) to limit the progression of neurological illnesses such as ischemic stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. The gastrointestinal tract and CNS are functionally connected, and current findings provide insights that Tregs function along the gut-brain axis by interacting with immune, epithelial, and neuronal cells. The purpose of this study is to explain our current knowledge of the biological role of tissue-resident Tregs, as well as the interaction along the gut-brain axis.",Frontiers in immunology,2022,Juli Choi; Bo-Ram Kim; Begum Akuzum; Leechung Chang; June-Yong Lee; Ho-Keun Kwon
35600818,Network Pharmacology and Absolute Bacterial Quantification-Combined Approach to Explore the Mechanism of Tianqi Pingchan Granule Against 6-OHDA-Induced Parkinson's Disease in Rats.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. Tianqi Pingchan Granule (TPG) is a clinically effective formula of traditional Chinese medicine to treat PD. However, the therapeutic effect and underlying mechanisms of TPG in PD remain unclear. Based on network pharmacology, the corresponding targets of TPG were identified using the Traditional Chinese Medicine Database and Analysis Platform Database. Differentially expressed genes in PD were obtained from the Therapeutic Target Database, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, GeneCards, and DrugBank databases. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks of intersected targets were constructed using the STRING database and visualized using Cytoscape. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed, and the pathways directly related to the pathogenesis of PD were integrated manually. Furthermore, <i>in vivo</i> studies were carried out based on network pharmacology. The gut microbiota, peripheral inflammatory cytokines, and glia-mediated neuroinflammation in substantia nigra were evaluated. A total of 99 target genes were intersected between targets of TPG and deferentially expressed genes in PD. The PPI network analysis indicated the proinflammatory cytokine as essential targets. GO and KEGG analyses indicated that inflammatory response and its related signaling pathways were closely associated with TPG-mediated PD treatment. <i>In vivo</i> studies revealed that class Negativicutes and order Selenomonadales decreased, whereas class Mollicutes, order Enterobacteriales, and Mycoplasmatales increased in fecal samples of PD rats <i>via</i> 16S rRNA sequence analysis. Furthermore, the function prediction methods purposely revealed that TPG therapy may be involved in flavonoid biosynthesis, which have anti-inflammatory properties. In addition, <i>in vivo</i> studies revealed that TPG exposure was found to not only attenuate the production of peripheral inflammatory cytokines but also inhibit the activation of microglia and astrocytes in substantia nigra of PD rats. Through network pharmacology and <i>in vivo</i> experiment-combined approach, the mechanisms of TPG in the treatment of PD were revealed, and the role of TPG in the regulation of gut microbiota and inflammatory response was confirmed.",Frontiers in nutrition,2022,Zhihua Liu; Jiahao Zhao; Shuyuan Yang; Yu Zhang; Lu Song; Na Wu; Zhenguo Liu
33050862,Engineered Probiotic and Prebiotic Nutraceutical Supplementations in Combating Non-communicable Disorders: A Review.,"Nutritional supplementations are a form of nutrition sources that may help in improving the health complexities of a person throughout his or her life span. Being also categorized as food supplementations, nutraceuticals are products that are extracted from edible sources with medical benefits as well as primary nutritional values. Nutraceuticals can be considered as functional foods. There are evidences that nutraceutical supplementations can alter the commensal gut microbiota and help to prevent or fight against chronic non-communicable degenerative diseases in adults, including neurological disorders (Autism Spectrum Disorder [ASD], Parkinson's disease [PD], Multiple sclerosis [MS]) and metabolic disorders (Type-II diabetes, obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease). They can even lessen the complexities of preterm babies like extra-uterine growth restriction, necrotizing enterocolitis, infant eczema and allergy (during pregnancy) as well as bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Molecular perception of inflammatory and apoptotic modulators regulating the pathogenesis of these health risks, their control and management by probiotics and prebiotics could further emphasize the scientific overview of their utility. In this study, the pivotal role of nutraceutical supplementations in regulating or modulating molecular pathways in the above non-communicable diseases is briefly described. This work also gives an overall introduction of the sophisticated genome-editing techniques and advanced delivery systems in therapeutic activities applicable under these health risks.",Current pharmaceutical biotechnology,2022,Rout George Kerry; Gitishree Das; Upendarrao Golla; Maria Del Pilar Rodriguez-Torres; Han-Seung Shin; Jayanta Kumar Patra
36516809,Neurotensin-Binding Immunoglobulin G in Patients with Parkinson's Disease.,"Neurotensin (NTS) is a 13-amino acid neuropeptide functionally linked with the brain dopaminergic system via expression of the NTS peptide or its receptor in dopamine neurons. Neuropeptide-binding immunoglobulins (Igs) are present in humans and can be involved in both physiological and pathological processes. Considering the functional link between NTS and dopamine neurons, we studied the occurrence of NTS-binding IgG autoantibodies in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).Plasma levels of NTS-binding IgG were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in both male and female PD patents and in age-matched healthy controls. Possible microbial origin of NTS cross-reactive IgG was analyzed by sequence alignment of the 6-amino acid C-terminal NTS pharmacophore with bacterial and viral proteins from the public NCBI database.NTS-binding IgG were detected in the plasma of all study subjects, while their levels were consistently lower in PD patients versus controls (p = 0.0001), independently from age or sex of the study participants. Moreover, PD patients with a more severe stage (2.5-3.0) of the disease had lower levels of NTS-binding IgG (p = 0.0004) than those with a milder stage (1.0-2.0). Furthermore, PD patients taking amantadine or high doses of levodopa had higher levels of NTS-binding IgG than those without medication. Contiguous sequence homology for the NTS pharmacophore was present in several microbial proteins occurring in human gut microbiota.The study revealed that NTS-binding IgG occur naturally in humans and that PD patients display their low plasma levels accentuated by disease severity. The functional significance of this finding and its relevance to the pathophysiology of PD, including putative link to gut microbiota, remain to be studied.",Neuroimmunomodulation,2023,Zamira M Muruzheva; Daniil S Egorov; Margarita T Absalyamova; Dmitrii S Traktirov; Marina N Karpenko; Serguei O Fetissov

36532064,Hypothesis of a potential BrainBiota and its relation to CNS autoimmune inflammation.,"Infectious agents have been long considered to play a role in the pathogenesis of neurological diseases as part of the interaction between genetic susceptibility and the environment. The role of bacteria in CNS autoimmunity has also been highlighted by changes in the diversity of gut microbiota in patients with neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer disease and multiple sclerosis, emphasizing the role of the gut-brain axis. We discuss the hypothesis of a brain microbiota, the BrainBiota: bacteria living in symbiosis with brain cells. Existence of various bacteria in the human brain is suggested by morphological evidence, presence of bacterial proteins, metabolites, transcripts and mucosal-associated invariant T cells. Based on our data, we discuss the hypothesis that these bacteria are an integral part of brain development and immune tolerance as well as directly linked to the gut microbiome. We further suggest that changes of the BrainBiota during brain diseases may be the consequence or cause of the chronic inflammation similarly to the gut microbiota.",Frontiers in immunology,2022,Maria L Elkjaer; Lukas Simon; Tobias Frisch; Lisa-Marie Bente; Tim Kacprowski; Mads Thomassen; Richard Reynolds; Jan Baumbach; Richard RÃ¶ttger; Zsolt Illes

(R,S)-ketamine is a racemic mixture of equal amounts of (R)-ketamine (arketamine) and (S)-ketamine (esketamine). In 2019, an esketamine nasal spray from Johnson & Johnson was approved in the United States of America and Europe for treatment-resistant depression. However, an increasing number of preclinical studies show that arketamine has greater potency and longer-lasting antidepressant-like effects than esketamine in rodents, despite the lower binding affinity of arketamine for the NMDAR. In clinical trials, non-ketamine NMDAR-related compounds did not exhibit ketamine-like robust antidepressant actions in patients with depression, despite these compounds showing antidepressant-like effects in rodents. Thus, the rodent data do not necessarily translate to humans due to the complexity of human psychiatric disorders. Collectively, the available studies indicate that it is unlikely that NMDAR plays a major role in the antidepressant action of (R,S)-ketamine and its enantiomers, although the precise molecular mechanisms underlying antidepressant actions of (R,S)-ketamine and its enantiomers remain unclear. In this paper, we review recent findings on the molecular mechanisms underlying the antidepressant actions of (R,S)-ketamine and its potent enantiomer arketamine. Furthermore, we discuss the possible role of the brain-gut-microbiota axis and brain-spleen axis in stress-related psychiatric disorders and in the antidepressant-like action of arketamine.

35272713,The microbiota restrains neurodegenerative microglia in a model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"The gut microbiota can affect neurologic disease by shaping microglia, the primary immune cell in the central nervous system (CNS). While antibiotics improve models of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and the C9orf72 model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), antibiotics worsen disease progression the in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> model of ALS. In ALS, microglia transition from a homeostatic to a neurodegenerative (MGnD) phenotype and contribute to disease pathogenesis, but whether this switch can be affected by the microbiota has not been investigated.In this short report, we found that a low-dose antibiotic treatment worsened motor function and decreased survival in the SOD1 mice, which is consistent with studies using high-dose antibiotics. We also found that co-housing SOD1 mice with wildtype mice had no effect on disease progression. We investigated changes in the microbiome and found that antibiotics reduced Akkermansia and butyrate-producing bacteria, which may be beneficial in ALS, and cohousing had little effect on the microbiome. To investigate changes in CNS resident immune cells, we sorted spinal cord microglia and found that antibiotics downregulated homeostatic genes and increased neurodegenerative disease genes in SOD1 mice. Furthermore, antibiotic-induced changes in microglia preceded changes in motor function, suggesting that this may be contributing to disease progression.Our findings suggest that the microbiota play a protective role in the SOD1 model of ALS by restraining MGnD microglia, which is opposite to other neurologic disease models, and sheds new light on the importance of disease-specific interactions between microbiota and microglia.

35610236,Probiotics synergized with conventional regimen in managing Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is mainly managed by pharmacological therapy (e.g., Benserazide and dopamine agonists). However, prolonged use of these drugs would gradually diminish their dopaminergic effect. Gut dysbiosis was observed in some patients with PD, suggesting close association between the gut microbiome and PD. Probiotics modulate the host's gut microbiota beneficially. A 3-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted to investigate the beneficial effect of probiotic co-administration in patients with PD. Eighty-two PD patients were recruited and randomly divided into probiotic [nâ=â48; Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Probio-M8 (Probio-M8), Benserazide, dopamine agonists] and placebo (nâ=â34; placebo, Benserazide, dopamine agonists) groups. Finally, 45 and 29 patients from Probio-M8 and placebo groups provided complete fecal and serum samples for further omics analysis, respectively. The results showed that Probio-M8 co-administration conferred added benefits by improving sleep quality, alleviating anxiety, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Metagenomic analysis showed that, after the intervention, there were significantly more species-level genome bins (SGBs) of Bifidobacterium animalis, Ruminococcaceae, and Lachnospira, while less Lactobacillus fermentum and Klebsiella oxytoca in Probio-M8 group (Pâ<â0.05). Interestingly, Lactobacillus fermentum correlated positively with the scores of UPDRS-III, HAMA, HAMD-17, and negatively with MMSE. Klebsiella oxytoca correlated negatively with feces hardness. Moreover, co-administering Probio-M8 increased SGBs involved in tryptophan degradation, gamma-aminobutyric acid, short-chain fatty acids, and secondary bile acid biosynthesis, as well as serum acetic acid and dopamine levels (Pâ<â0.05).

Meanwhile, engineered bacteria as oral live biotherapeutic agents to regulate the host's healthy homeostasis have attracted much attention in microbial therapy. However, whether this strategy is able to remotely regulate the host's brain function <i>in vivo</i> has not been investigated. Here, we engineered three blue-light-responsive probiotics as oral live biotherapeutic agents. They are spatiotemporally delivered and controlled by the upconversion optogenetic micro-nano system. This micro-nano system promotes the small intestine targeting and production of the exogenous <i>L. lactis</i> in the intestines, which realizes precise manipulation of brain functions including anxiety behavior, Parkinson's disease, and vagal afferent. The noninvasive and real-time probiotic intervention strategy makes the communiation from the gut to the host more controllable, which will enable the potential for engineered microbes accurately and effectively regulating a host's health.",ACS nano,2022,Huizhuo Pan; Tao Sun; Meihui Cui; Ning Ma; Chun Yang; Jing Liu; Gaoju Pang; Baona Liu; Lianyue Li; Xinyu Zhang; Weiwen Zhang; Jin Chang; Hanjie Wang
35563197,Bacteria-Derived Protein Aggregates Contribute to the Disruption of Host Proteostasis.,"Neurodegenerative protein conformational diseases are characterized by the misfolding and aggregation of metastable proteins encoded within the host genome. The host is also home to thousands of proteins encoded within exogenous genomes harbored by bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Yet, their contributions to host protein-folding homeostasis, or proteostasis, remain elusive. Recent studies, including our previous work, suggest that bacterial products contribute to the toxic aggregation of endogenous host proteins. We refer to these products as bacteria-derived protein aggregates (BDPAs). Furthermore, antibiotics were recently associated with an increased risk for neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-possibly by virtue of altering the composition of the human gut microbiota. Other studies have shown a negative correlation between disease progression and antibiotic administration, supporting their protective effect against neurodegenerative diseases. These contradicting studies emphasize the complexity of the human gut microbiota, the gut-brain axis, and the effect of antibiotics. Here, we further our understanding of bacteria's effect on host protein folding using the model <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. We employed genetic and chemical methods to demonstrate that the proteotoxic effect of bacteria on host protein folding correlates with the presence of BDPAs. Furthermore, the abundance and proteotoxicity of BDPAs are influenced by gentamicin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic that induces protein misfolding, and by butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid that we previously found to affect host protein aggregation and the associated toxicity. Collectively, these results increase our understanding of host-bacteria interactions in the context of protein conformational diseases.",International journal of molecular sciences,2022,Alyssa C Walker; Rohan Bhargava; Autumn S Dove; Amanda S Brust; Ali A Owji; Daniel M CzyÅ¼

The ROC curve showed that the three species (71.2%) from <i>Bifidobacteriaceae</i> had good predictive efficiency for PD.Elevated <i>Bifidobacteriaceae</i> may be associated with PD. Elevated three species from the <i>Bifidobacteriaceae</i>, including <i>Scardovia_inopinata</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium_dentium</i> and <i>Scardovia_wiggsiae</i> may provide new potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of PD.",Frontiers in integrative neuroscience,2022,ShuJia Zuo; HaiJing Wang; Qiang Zhao; Jie Tang; Min Wang; Yu Zhang; Ming Sang; Jing Tian; Puqing Wang
35924055,Neuroprotective Effects of Oligosaccharides From <i>Periplaneta Americana</i> on Parkinson's Disease Models <i>In Vitro</i> and <i>In Vivo</i>.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the neurodegenerative diseases that is characterized by obvious motor and some nonmotor symptoms. Various therapeutics failed in the effective treatment of PD because of impaired neurological function in the brain and various complications. <i>Periplaneta Americana</i> oligosaccharides (OPA), the main active ingredients extracted from the medicine residues of <i>Periplaneta Americana</i> (<i>P. Americana</i>), have been reported to exert anti-inflammatory effects. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the possible mechanisms of OPA against 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP<sup>+</sup>)-induced apotosis in SH-SY5Y cells and its potential neuroprotective effects in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD subacute model mice. The data demonstrated that OPA significantly reversed the MPP<sup>+</sup>-induced decrease in SH-SY5Y cell viability, reduced the proportion of apoptotic cells, and protected SH-SY5Y cells from apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner by regulating the expression of apoptosis-related genes. Furthermore, OPA also alleviated the motor dysfunction of PD model mice, prevented the loss of tyrosine hydroxylase positive cells, suppressed the apoptosis of substantia nigra cells, and improved the dysbiosis of gut microbiota <i>in vivo</i>, suggesting that OPA demonstrated a significantly neuroprotective effect on PD model mice. These results indicated that OPA might be the possibility of PD therapeutics with economic utility and high safety.",Frontiers in pharmacology,2022,Miao-Miao Liu; Nan Zhou; Na Jiang; Kai-Min Lu; Chuan-Fang Wu; Jin-Ku Bao
36110534,Global trends in research on miRNA-microbiome interaction from 2011 to 2021: A bibliometric analysis.,"An increasing number of research suggests that the microRNA (miRNA)-microbiome interaction plays an essential role in host health and diseases. This bibliometric analysis aimed to identify the status of global scientific output, research hotspots, and frontiers regarding the study of miRNA-microbiome interaction over the past decade. We retrieved miRNA-microbiome-related studies published from 2011 to 2021 from the Web of Science Core Collection database; the R package bibliometrix was used to analyze bibliometric indicators, and VOSviewer was used to visualize the field status, hotspots, and research trends of miRNA-microbiome interplay. In total, 590 articles and reviews were collected. A visual analysis of the results showed that significant increase in the number of publications over time. China produced the most papers, and the United States contributed the highest number of citations. Shanghai Jiaotong University and the University of California Davis were the most active institutions in the field. Most publications were published in the areas of biochemistry and molecular biology. Yu Aiming was the most prolific writer, as indicated by the h-index and m-index, and Liu Shirong was the most commonly co-cited author. A paper published in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences in 2017 had the highest number of citations. The keywords ""expression"" and ""gut microbiota"" appeared most frequently, and the top three groups of diseases that appeared among keywords were cancer (colorectal, et al.), inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), and neurological disorders (anxiety, Parkinson's disease, et al.). This bibliometric study revealed that most studies have focused on miRNAs (e.g., miR-21, miR-155, and miR-146a), gut microbes (e.g., <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, and <i>Fusobacterium nucleatum</i>), and gut bacteria metabolites (e.g., butyric acid), which have the potential to improve the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of diseases. We found that therapeutic strategies targeting the miRNA-microbiome axis focus on miRNA drugs produced <i>in vitro</i>; however, some studies suggest that <i>in vivo</i> fermentation can greatly increase the stability and reduce the degradation of miRNA. Therefore, this method is worthy of further research.",Frontiers in pharmacology,2022,Xiang-Yun Yan; Jun-Peng Yao; Yan-Qiu Li; Wei Zhang; Meng-Han Xi; Min Chen; Ying Li
36516898,Effects of molecular hydrogen intervention on the gut microbiome in methamphetamine abusers with mental disorder.,"Methamphetamine (METH) is a potent and highly addictive psychostimulant and one of the most widely used illicit drugs, the abuse of which has become a severe public health problem worldwide. A growing amount of evidence has indicated potential connections between gut microbiota and mental disorders induced by METH and associations with neural and metabolic pathways. The present study aimed to explore the relationship between fecal microbial alterations and neuropsychiatric diseases in METH addictions. Thus, mental disorders and gut microbial alterations were analyzed by self-rating depression (SDS) and anxiety (SAS) scales and 16Â S rRNA gene sequencing, respectively. Our results showed that increased SDS and SAS indices and decreased alpha diversity indicated more serious mental disorders and lower bacterial diversity in METH users than in the age-matched healthy control group. The gut microbial composition in female METH users was also significantly altered, with reductions in hydrogen-producing bacteria, including Bacteroides and Roseburia. Molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) is spontaneously produced by intestinal bacteria in the process of anaerobic metabolism, which is the main pathway for H<sub>2</sub> production in vivo. Numerous studies have shown that hydrogen intervention can significantly improve neuropsychiatric diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Our results showed that hydrogen intervention, including drinking and inhaling, significantly alleviated mental disorders induced by METH abuse, and the inhalation of hydrogen also altered gut microbiota profiles in the METH abusers. These results suggest that hydrogen intervention has potential therapeutic applicability in the treatment of mental disorders in METH abusers.",Brain research bulletin,2023,Yong Wang; Mengmeng Wang; Bing Xie; Di Wen; Wenbo Li; Meiqi Zhou; Xintao Wang; Yun Lu; Bin Cong; Zhiyu Ni; Chunling Ma

Multiple studies implicate the microbiota-gut-brain axis in Parkinson's disease pathophysiology. <i>Ping-wei-san plus</i> Herbal Decoction, a traditional Chinese medicine composition with beneficial effects in Parkinson's disease, may have a complex array of actions. Here we sought to determine whether gut microbiota and metabolic pathways are involved in <i>Ping-wei-san plus</i> herbal therapy for Parkinson's disease and to identify functional pathways to guide research.The model of Parkinson's disease were induced with the rotenone. The <i>Ping-wei-san plus</i> group received the PWP herbal decoction for 90 days, after which all groups were analyzed experimentally. PWP herbal treatment improved motor behavior and emotional performance, balanced gut microbiota, and benefited dietary metabolism. Tandem Mass Tags mass spectrometry identified many differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in the substantia nigra and duodenum in the PWP group, and these DEPs were enriched in pathways such as those involving cAMP signaling, glutamatergic synapses, dopaminergic synapses, and ribosome-rich functions in the gut.

36466165,Mapping trends and hotspot regarding gastrointestinal microbiome and neuroscience: A bibliometric analysis of global research (2002-2022).,"Scholars have long understood that gastrointestinal microorganisms are intimately related to human disorders. The literature on research involving the gut microbiome and neuroscience is emerging. This study exposed the connections between gut microbiota and neuroscience methodically and intuitively using bibliometrics and visualization. This study's objectives were to summarize the knowledge structure and identify emerging trends and potential hotspots in this field.On October 18, 2022, a literature search was conducted utilizing the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database for studies on gut microbiota and neuroscience studies from 2002 to 2022 (August 20, 2022). VOSviewer and CiteSpace V software was used to conduct the bibliometrics and visualization analysis.From 2002 to 2022 (August 20, 2022), 2,275 publications in the WoSCC database satisfied the criteria. The annual volume of publications has rapidly emerged in recent years (2016-2022). The most productive nation (<i>n</i> = 732, 32.18%) and the hub of inter-country cooperation (links: 38) were the United States. University College Cork had the most research papers published in this area, followed by McMaster University and Harvard Medical School. Cryan JF, Dinan TG, and Clarke G were key researchers with considerable academic influence. The journals with the most publications are ""Neurogastroenterology and Motility"" and ""Brain Behavior and Immunity."" The most cited article and co-cited reference was Cryan JF's 2012 article on the impact of gut microbiota on the brain and behavior. The current research hotspot includes gastrointestinal microbiome, inflammation, gut-brain axis, Parkinson's disease (PD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD).

35257836,Central dopaminergic control of cell proliferation in the colonic epithelium.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease, mainly characterized by the loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra. Several non-motor symptoms, including those associated with gastrointestinal dysfunction, precede the classical motor symptoms in PD. However, the mechanisms underlying gastrointestinal dysfunction in the prodromal phase of PD remain elusive. Here, we investigated the contribution of the central DA system to cell proliferation in the colonic epithelium. Degeneration of nigrostriatal DA pathway induced by striatal 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) injection resulted in a marked reduction in cell proliferation in the colonic epithelium as assessed by Ki-67 and bromodeoxyuridine labeling assays. RNA-sequencing analysis confirmed the suppression of cell cycle-related gene expression in the colonic epithelium of 6-OHDA-lesioned mice. Mesencephalic DA neuron degeneration also caused the gut microbiota dysbiosis. Moreover, 6-OHDA-lesioned mice showed profoundly increased vulnerability to dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis. Together, our study uncovers a crucial role for the integrity of nigral DA neurons in the maintenance of colonic epithelial cell homeostasis. Our data also provide a new strategy for protecting intestinal homeostasis in PD.",Neuroscience research,2022,Shui Yu; Hai-Rong Peng; Yu-Kai Zhang; Yan-Qing Yin; Jia-Wei Zhou
34980288,Performance of distinct microbial based solutions in a Campylobacter infection challenge model in poultry.,"Antibiotic growth promoters (AGPs) are commonly used within poultry production to improve feed conversion, bird growth, and reduce morbidity and mortality from clinical and subclinical diseases. Due to the association between AGP usage and rising antimicrobial resistance, the industry has explored new strategies including the use of probiotics and other microbial-based interventions to promote the development of a healthy microbiome in birds and mitigate against infections associated with food safety and food security. While previous studies have largely focused on the ability of probiotics to protect against Clostridium perfringens and Salmonella enterica, much less is known concerning their impact on Campylobacter jejuni, a near commensal of the chicken gut microbiome that nevertheless is a major cause of food poisoning in humans.Here we compare the efficacy of four microbial interventions (two single strain probiotics, the bacterium-Pediococcus acidilactici, and the yeast-Saccharomyces cerevisiae boulardii; and two complex, competitive exclusion, consortia-Aviguard and CEL) to bacitracin, a commonly used AGP, to modulate chicken gut microbiota and subsequently impact C. jejuni infection in poultry. Cecal samples were harvested at 30- and 39-days post hatch to assess Campylobacter burden and examine their impact on the gut microbiota. While the different treatments did not significantly decrease C. jejuni burden relative to the untreated controls, both complex consortia resulted in significant decreases relative to treatment with bacitracin. Analysis of 16S rDNA profiles revealed a distinct microbial signature associated with each microbial intervention. For example, treatment with Aviguard and CEL increased the relative abundance of Bacteroidaceae and Rikenellaceae respectively. Furthermore, Aviguard promoted a less complex microbial community compared to other treatments.Depending upon the individual needs of the producer, our results illustrate the potential of each microbial interventions to serve flock-specific requirements.",Animal microbiome,2022,Maxine Ty; Khaled Taha-Abdelaziz; Vanessa Demey; Mathieu Castex; Shayan Sharif; John Parkinson
36216843,Fecal microbiome alterations in treatment-naive de novo Parkinson's disease.,"Gut microbiota alterations in Parkinson's disease (PD) have been found in several studies and are suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis of PD. However, previous results could not be adequately adjusted for a potential confounding effect of PD medication and disease duration, as almost all PD participants were already using dopaminergic medication and were included several years after diagnosis. Here, the gut microbiome composition of treatment-naive de novo PD subjects was assessed compared to healthy controls (HC) in two large independent case-control cohorts (nâ=â136 and 56 PD, nâ=â85 and 87 HC), using 16S-sequencing of fecal samples. Relevant variables such as technical batches, diet and constipation were assessed for their potential effects. Overall gut microbiome composition differed between PD and HC in both cohorts, suggesting gut microbiome alterations are already present in de novo PD subjects at the time of diagnosis, without the possible confounding effect of dopaminergic medication. Although no differentially abundant taxon could be replicated in both cohorts, multiple short chain fatty acids (SCFA) producing taxa were decreased in PD in both cohorts. In particular, several taxa belonging to the family Lachnospiraceae were decreased in abundance. Fewer taxonomic differences were found compared to previous studies, indicating smaller effect sizes in de novo PD.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2022,Jeffrey M Boertien; Kirsi MurtomÃ¤ki; Pedro A B Pereira; Sygrid van der Zee; Tuomas H Mertsalmi; Reeta Levo; Tanja Nojonen; Elina MÃ¤kinen; Elina Jaakkola; Pia Laine; Lars Paulin; Eero Pekkonen; Valtteri Kaasinen; Petri Auvinen; Filip Scheperjans; Teus van Laar; 
36742204,Effects of a probiotic suspension Symproveâ¢ on a rat early-stage Parkinson's disease model.,"An increasing number of studies in recent years have focused on the role that the gut may play in Parkinson's Disease (PD) pathogenesis, suggesting that the maintenance of a healthy gut may lead to potential treatments of the disease. The health of microbiota has been shown to be directly associated with parameters that play a potential role in PD including gut barrier integrity, immunity, function, metabolism and the correct functioning of the gut-brain axis. The gut microbiota (GM) may therefore be employed as valuable indicators for early diagnosis of PD and potential targets for preventing or treating PD symptoms. Preserving the gut homeostasis using probiotics may therefore lead to a promising treatment strategy due to their known benefits in improving constipation, motor impairments, inflammation, and neurodegeneration. However, the mechanisms underlying the effects of probiotics in PD are yet to be clarified. In this project, we have tested the efficacy of an oral probiotic suspension, Symproveâ¢, on an established animal model of PD. Symproveâ¢, unlike many commercially available probiotics, has been shown to be resistant to gastric acidity, improve symptoms in gastrointestinal diseases and improve gut integrity in an <i>in vitro</i> PD model. In this study, we used an early-stage PD rat model to determine the effect of Symproveâ¢ on neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in the brain and on plasma cytokine levels, GM composition and short chain fatty acid (SCFA) release. Symproveâ¢ was shown to significantly influence both the gut and brain of the PD model. It preserved the gut integrity in the PD model, reduced plasma inflammatory markers and changed microbiota composition. The treatment also prevented the reduction in SCFAs and striatal inflammation and prevented tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive cell loss by 17% compared to that observed in animals treated with placebo. We conclude that Symproveâ¢ treatment may have a positive influence on the symptomology of early-stage PD with obvious implications for the improvement of gut integrity and possibly delaying/preventing the onset of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in human PD patients.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2022,Marco Sancandi; Carmen De Caro; Neringa Cypaite; Nadia Marascio; Carmen Avagliano; Carmela De Marco; Emilio Russo; Andrew Constanti; Audrey Mercer

35399136,"Intestinal Dopamine Receptor D2 is Required for Neuroprotection Against 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced Dopaminergic Neurodegeneration.","A wealth of evidence has suggested that gastrointestinal dysfunction is associated with the onset and progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the mechanisms underlying these links remain to be defined. Here, we investigated the impact of deregulation of intestinal dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) signaling in response to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Dopamine/dopamine signaling in the mouse colon decreased with ageing. Selective ablation of Drd2, but not Drd4, in the intestinal epithelium, caused a more severe loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra following MPTP challenge, and this was accompanied by a reduced abundance of succinate-producing Alleoprevotella in the gut microbiota. Administration of succinate markedly attenuated dopaminergic neuronal loss in MPTP-treated mice by elevating the mitochondrial membrane potential. This study suggests that intestinal epithelial DRD2 activity and succinate from the gut microbiome contribute to the maintenance of nigral DA neuron survival. These findings provide a potential strategy targeting neuroinflammation-related neurological disorders such as PD.",Neuroscience bulletin,2022,Hairong Peng; Shui Yu; Yukai Zhang; Yanqing Yin; Jiawei Zhou
36551872,Milmed Yeast Alters the LPS-Induced M1 Microglia Cells to Form M2 Anti-Inflammatory Phenotype.,"Microglial cells polarized towards a proinflammatory phenotype are considered the main cellular players of neuroinflammation, underlying several neurodegenerative diseases. Many studies have suggested that imbalance of the gut microbial composition is associated with an increase in the pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress that underlie chronic neuroinflammatory diseases, and perturbations to the gut microbiota were detected in neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. The importance of gut-brain axis has been uncovered and the relevance of an appropriate microbiota balance has been highlighted. Probiotic treatment, rebalancing the gut microbioma, may reduce inflammation. We show that Milmed yeast, obtained from <i>S. cerevisiae</i> after exposure to electromagnetic millimeter wavelengths, induces a reversal of LPS-M1 polarized microglia towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype, as demonstrated morphologically by the recovery of resting phenotype by microglia, by the decrease in the mRNAs of IL-1Î², IL-6, TNF-Î± and in the expression of iNOS. Moreover, Milmed stimulated the secretion of IL-10 and the expression of Arginase-1, cell markers of M2 anti-inflammatory polarized cells. The present findings data suggest that Milmed may be considered to be a probiotic with diversified anti-inflammatory activity, capable of directing the polarization of microglial cells.",Biomedicines,2022,Federica Armeli; Beatrice Mengoni; Elisa Maggi; Cristina Mazzoni; Adele Preziosi; Patrizia Mancini; Rita Businaro; Thomas Lenz; Trevor Archer
35466109,Effects of Subdiaphragmatic Vagotomy in the MPTP-induced Neurotoxicity in the Striatum and Colon of Mice.,"Gut-microbiota-brain axis plays a role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). The subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve serves as a major modulatory pathway between the gut microbiota and the brain. However, the role of subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve in PD pathogenesis are unknown. Here, we investigated the effects of subdiaphragmatic vagotomy (SDV) on the neurotoxicity in the mouse striatum and colon after administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6- tetrahydropyridine (MPTP).Sham or SVD was performed. Subsequently, saline or MPTP (10 mg/kg Ã 3, 2-hour interval) was administered to mice. Western blot analysis of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine transporter (DAT) in the striatum and phosphorylated Î±-synuclein (p-Î±-Syn) in the colon was performed.Repeated administration of MPTP significantly caused reduction of TH and DAT in the striatum and increase of p-Î±-Syn in the colon of mice. However, SDV did not affect the reduction of TH and DAT in the striatum and increases in p-Î±-Syn in the colon after repeated MPTP administration.These data suggest that subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve doses not play a role in the MPTP-induced neurotoxicity in the brain and colon.",Clinical psychopharmacology and neuroscience : the official scientific journal of the Korean College of Neuropsychopharmacology,2022,Jiajing Shan; Youge Qu; Jiancheng Zhang; Li Ma; Kenji Hashimoto

36168204,<i>Agathobaculum butyriciproducens</i> Shows Neuroprotective Effects in a 6-OHDA-Induced Mouse Model of Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second-most prevalent neurodegenerative disease and is characterized by dopaminergic neuronal death in the midbrain. Recently, the association between alterations in PD pathology and the gut microbiota has been explored. Microbiota-targeted interventions have been suggested as a novel therapeutic approach for PD. <i>Agathobaculum butyriciproducens</i> SR79<sup>T</sup> (SR79) is an anaerobic bacterium. Previously, we showed that SR79 treatment induced cognitive improvement and reduced Alzheimer's disease pathologies in a mouse model. In this study, we hypothesized that SR79 treatment may have beneficial effects on PD pathology. To investigate the therapeutic effects of SR79 on PD, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced mouse models were used. D-Amphetamine sulfate (d-AMPH)-induced behavioral rotations and dopaminergic cell death were analyzed in unilateral 6-OHDA-lesioned mice. Treatment with SR79 significantly decreased ipsilateral rotations induced by d-AMPH. Moreover, SR79 treatment markedly activated the AKT/GSK3Î² signaling pathway in the striatum. In addition, SR79 treatment affected the Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway and its downstream target genes in the striatum of 6-OHDA-lesioned mice. Our findings suggest a protective role of SR79 in 6-OHDA-induced toxicity by regulating the AKT/Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway and astrocyte activation. Thus, SR79 may be a potential microbe-based intervention and therapeutic strategy for PD.",Journal of microbiology and biotechnology,2022,Da Woon Lee; Young-Kyoung Ryu; Dong-Ho Chang; Hye-Yeon Park; Jun Go; So-Young Maeng; Dae Youn Hwang; Byoung-Chan Kim; Chul-Ho Lee; Kyoung-Shim Kim

35127723,Human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells Improve Locomotor Function in Parkinson's Disease Mouse Model Through Regulating Intestinal Microorganisms.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder characterized by loss of neurons that synthesize dopamine, and subsequent impaired movement. Umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) exerted neuroprotection effects in a rodent model of PD. However, the mechanism underlying UC-MSC-generated neuroprotection was not fully elucidated. In the present study, we found that intranasal administration of UC-MSCs significantly alleviated locomotor deficits and rescued dopaminergic neurons by inhibiting neuroinflammation in a PD mouse model induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP, a toxic agent which selectively destroys nigrostriatal neurons but does not affect dopaminergic neurons elsewhere). Furthermore, UC-MSC treatment altered gut microbiota composition characterized by decreased phylum Proteobacteria, class Gammaproteobacteria, family Enterobacteriaceae, and genus <i>Escherichia-Shigella</i>. In addition, the neurotransmitter dopamine in the striatum and 5-hydroxytryptamine in the colon were also modulated by UC-MSCs. Meanwhile, UC-MSCs significantly maintained intestinal goblet cells, which secrete mucus as a mechanical barrier against pathogens. Furthermore, UC-MSCs alleviate the level of TNF-Î± and IL-6 as well as the conversion of NF-ÎºB expression in the colon, indicating that inflammatory responses were blocked by UC-MSCs. PICRUSt showed that some pathways including bacterial invasion of epithelial cells, fluorobenzoate degradation, and pathogenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> infection were significantly reversed by UC-MSCs. These data suggest that the beneficial effects were detected following UC-MSC intranasal transplantation in MPTP-treated mice.

However, the role of SCFAs in PD pathogenesis is controversial. Autophagy is important for the degradation of Î±-synuclein, which is critical to the development of PD. However, whether SCFAs can regulate autophagy in PD remains unknown. We aimed to investigate the role of SCFAs and explore the potential mechanisms in rat dopaminergic PC12 cells treated with rotenone. Expression levels of Î±-synuclein, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î³ coactivator-1Î± (PGC-1Î±) and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta (LC3B)-II were detected by Western blot. Histone acetylation levels at PGC-1Î± promoter region were measured using chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (ChIP-qPCR). Among the three SCFAs, sodium butyrate (NaB) protected against rotenone-induced toxicity. NaB activated autophagy pathway and reduced rotenone-induced Î±-synuclein expression through the activation of autophagy. Notably, NaB activated autophagy pathway through upregulating PGC-1Î± expression. More importantly, NaB promoted the levels of histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9Ac) and histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27Ac) at PGC-1Î± promoter region, indicating that NaB promotes PGC-1Î± expression via histone acetylation modification.

35917710,Fecal microbiome transplantation attenuates manganese-induced neurotoxicity through regulation of the apelin signaling pathway by inhibition of autophagy in mouse brain.,"Manganese (Mn) is a common environmental pollutant. Mn exposure can lead to neurodegenerative diseases resembling Parkinson's disease, and has become a major public health concern. However, the mechanism of Mn-induced neurotoxicity in the brain is not clear. Fecal microbiome transplantation (FMT) may alleviate the neurotoxicity of Mn exposure by remodeling the gut microbiota. In this study, MnCl<sub>2</sub> (manganese chloride) was administered to mice as in drinking water (Mn: 200Â mg/L), and fecal matter from donor mice was administered by oral gavage every other day to the recipient mice. The Mn exposure model (Mn group) and FMT model (Mn+FMT group) were established and analyzed 5 weeks post-exposure. The Wipi1 gene exhibited the most significant increase associated with Mn exposure and Mn+FMT treatment groups based on transcriptome analysis. Combined analysis of transcriptomics and proteomics demonstrated that the apelin signaling pathway is the main pathway affected by FMT during Mn exposure. Immunofluorescence and Western blot showed that the expression of key proteins (Beclin-1, LC-3B, and PINK1) associated with autophagy in the hippocampus was robustly activated in the Mn exposure group, but attenuation was observed in Mn+FMT mice, suggesting a critical role of autophagy in neurotoxicity induced by Mn exposure. Our research provides evidence for the neurotoxic effects of Mn exposure through autophagy activation and provides an underlying mechanism of FMT protection against Mn-induced neurotoxicity through regulation of the apelin signaling pathway.",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2022,Jingjing Liu; Xin Zhang; Xiaojuan Ta; Miaomiao Luo; Xuhong Chang; Hui Wang

Several studies have consistently reported a greater abundance of <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> in Parkinson disease (PD) fecal samples. Therefore, we investigated whether <i>A.muciniphila</i>-conditioned medium (CM) could initiate Î±-synuclein (Î±Syn) misfolding in enteroendocrine cells (EEC) - a component of the gut epithelium featuring neuron-like properties. We found that <i>A</i>. <i>muciniphila</i> CM composition is influenced by the ability of the strain to degrade mucin. Our <i>inÂ vitro</i> experiments showed that the protein-enriched fraction of mucin-free CM induces RyR-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and increased mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake leading to ROS generation and Î±Syn aggregation. Oral administration of <i>A.Â muciniphila</i> cultivated in the absence of mucin to mice ledÂ to Î±Syn aggregation in cholecystokinin (CCK)-positive EECs but no motor deficitsÂ were observed. Noteworthy, buffering mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> reverted the damaging effects observed.

35400445,Polymannuronic acid prebiotic plus Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG probiotic as a novel synbiotic promoted their separate neuroprotection against Parkinson's disease.,"Gut microbiota (GM) dysbiosis plays key roles in aggravating Parkinson's disease (PD) and discovery of agents targeting GM may open new avenues for PD therapy. This study aims to investigate the potentially neuroprotective effects and underlying mechanisms of polymannuronic acid (PM) or Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), or their combination in a chronic PD mice model. Our results found oral administration of prebiotic PM or LGG separately or in combination for 5Â weeks could prevent dopaminergic neuronal loss via improving reduced walking distance and activity or weakened muscle strength in behavior tests by enhancing tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene and/or protein expressions in the midbrain and striatum of PD mice. Strikingly, PM and LGG in combination had a much better neuroprotective effects than separate PM or LGG. PM provided neuroprotection via a short chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-mediated anti-inflammation and anti-apoptosis mechanism. The neuroprotective effects of LGG might be associated with its ability to improve the expression of striatal glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and to increase bacteria abundance of Clostridiales. When PD mice were administered with PMÂ +Â LGG, PM as prebiotic favored bacterial growth (from Bacilli class to Lactobacillus genus) in the colon, which helped to improve blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity and increase brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and GDNF expressions, thereby inhibiting apoptosis in the striatum. In conclusion, PM and LGG in combination promoted their separate neuroprotection against PD. Our study discovered and testified a novel synbiotic that might be one of the ideal oral agents for PD therapy.","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2022,Xin Liu; Zhong Rui Du; Xiong Wang; Xiang Rong Sun; Qing Zhao; Fang Zhao; Wing Tak Wong; Ka Hing Wong; Xiao-Li Dong
38098067,Parkinson's disease and gut microbiota: from clinical to mechanistic and therapeutic studies.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases. The typical symptomatology of PD includes motor symptoms; however, a range of nonmotor symptoms, such as intestinal issues, usually occur before the motor symptoms. Various microorganisms inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract can profoundly influence the physiopathology of the central nervous system through neurological, endocrine, and immune system pathways involved in the microbiota-gut-brain axis. In addition, extensive evidence suggests that the gut microbiota is strongly associated with PD. This review summarizes the latest findings on microbial changes in PD and their clinical relevance, describes the underlying mechanisms through which intestinal bacteria may mediate PD, and discusses the correlations between gut microbes and anti-PD drugs. In addition, this review outlines the status of research on microbial therapies for PD and the future directions of PD-gut microbiota research.",Translational neurodegeneration,2023,Xuxiang Zhang; Beisha Tang; Jifeng Guo
37159496,Associations between gut microbiota and Parkinson disease: AÂ bidirectional Mendelian randomization analysis.,"Parkinson disease (PD)-associated alterations in the gut microbiome have been observed in clinical and animal studies. However, it remains unclear whether this association reflects a causal effect in humans.We performed two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization using summary statistics from the international consortium MiBioGen (Nâ=â18,340), the Framingham Heart Study (Nâ=â2076), and the International Parkinson's Disease Genomics Consortium for PD (33,674 cases and 449,056 controls) and PD age at onset (17,996 cases).Twelve microbiota features presented suggestive associations with PD risk or age at onset. Genetically increased Bifidobacterium levels correlated with decreased PD risk (odds ratioâ=â0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] =â0.60-0.99, pâ=â0.040). Conversely, high levels of five short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria (LachnospiraceaeUCG010, RuminococcaceaeUCG002, Clostridium sensustricto1, Eubacterium hallii group, and Bacillales) correlated with increased PD risk, and three SCFA-producing bacteria (Roseburia, RuminococcaceaeUCG002, and Erysipelatoclostridium) correlated with an earlier age at PD onset. Gut production of serotonin was associated with an earlier age at PD onset (beta = -0.64, 95% CI = -1.15 to -0.13, pâ=â0.013). In the reverse direction, genetic predisposition to PD was related to altered gut microbiota composition.These results support a bidirectional relationship between gut microbiome dysbiosis and PD, and highlight the role of elevated endogenous SCFAs and serotonin in PD pathogenesis. Future clinical studies and experimental evidence are needed to explain the observed associations and to suggest new therapeutic approaches, such as dietary probiotic supplementation.",European journal of neurology,2023,Li Jiang; Jin-Chen Li; Bei-Sha Tang; Ji-Feng Guo
37404311,Signalling cognition: the gut microbiota and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.,"Cognitive function in humans depends on the complex and interplay between multiple body systems, including the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The gut microbiota, which vastly outnumbers human cells and has a genetic potential that exceeds that of the human genome, plays a crucial role in this interplay. The microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis is a bidirectional signalling pathway that operates through neural, endocrine, immune, and metabolic pathways. One of the major neuroendocrine systems responding to stress is the HPA axis which produces glucocorticoids such as cortisol in humans and corticosterone in rodents. Appropriate concentrations of cortisol are essential for normal neurodevelopment and function, as well as cognitive processes such as learning and memory, and studies have shown that microbes modulate the HPA axis throughout life. Stress can significantly impact the MGB axis <i>via</i> the HPA axis and other pathways. Animal research has advanced our understanding of these mechanisms and pathways, leading to a paradigm shift in conceptual thinking about the influence of the microbiota on human health and disease. Preclinical and human trials are currently underway to determine how these animal models translate to humans. In this review article, we summarize the current knowledge of the relationship between the gut microbiota, HPA axis, and cognition, and provide an overview of the main findings and conclusions in this broad field.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2023,Jody A Rusch; Brian T Layden; Lara R Dugas
36593694,Gut microbiota dysbiosis in Parkinson disease: A systematic review and pooled analysis.,"The role of the gut microbiome in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease (PD) is under intense investigation, and the results presented are still very heterogeneous. These discrepancies arise not only from the highly heterogeneous pathology of PD, but also from widely varying methodologies at all stages of the workflow, from sampling to final statistical analysis. The aim of the present work is to harmonize the workflow across studies to reduce the methodological heterogeneity and to perform a pooled analysis to account for other sources of heterogeneity.We performed a systematic review to identify studies comparing the gut microbiota of PD patients to healthy controls. A workflow was designed to harmonize processing across all studies from bioinformatics processing to final statistical analysis using a Bayesian random-effects meta-analysis based on individual patient-level data.The results show that harmonizing workflows minimizes differences between statistical methods and reveals only a small set of taxa being associated with the pathogenesis of PD. Increased shares of the genera Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium and decreased shares of the genera Roseburia and Faecalibacterium were most characteristic for PD-associated microbiota.Our study summarizes evidence that reduced levels of butyrate-producing taxa in combination with possible degradation of the mucus layer by Akkermansia may promote intestinal inflammation and reduced permeability of the gut mucosal layer.

Through the last two decades of research, there has been growing consensus that inflammation-mediated oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cytokine-induced toxicity are mainly involved in neuronal damage and loss associated with PD. However, it remains unclear how these mechanisms relate to sporadic PD, a more common form of PD. Both enteric and central nervous systems have been implicated in the pathogenesis of sporadic PD, thus highlighting the crosstalk between the gut and brain.of Review: In this review, we summarize how alterations in the gut microbiome can affect PD pathogenesis. We highlight various mechanisms increasing/decreasing the risk of PD development. Based on the previous supporting evidence, we suggest how early interventions could protect against PD development and how controlling specific factors, including our diet, could modify our perspective on disease mechanisms and therapeutics. We explain the strong relationship between the gut microbiota and the brain in PD subjects, by delineating the multiple mechanisms involved inneuroinflammation and oxidative stress. We conclude that the neurodetrimental effects of western diet (WD) and the neuroprotective effects of Mediterranean diets should be further exploredin humans through clinical trials. Key Scientific Concepts of Review: Alterations in the gut microbiome and associated metabolites may contribute to pathogenesis in PD. In some studies, probiotics have been shown to exert anti-oxidative effects in PD via improved mitochondrial dynamics and homeostasis, thus reducing PD-related consequences.

We conclude that the neurodetrimental effects of western diet (WD) and the neuroprotective effects of Mediterranean diets should be further exploredin humans through clinical trials. Key Scientific Concepts of Review: Alterations in the gut microbiome and associated metabolites may contribute to pathogenesis in PD. In some studies, probiotics have been shown to exert anti-oxidative effects in PD via improved mitochondrial dynamics and homeostasis, thus reducing PD-related consequences. However, there is a significant unmet need for randomized clinical trials to investigate the effectiveness of microbial products, probiotic-based supplementation, and dietary intervention in reversing gut microbial dysbiosis in PD.",Journal of advanced research,2023,Safa Salim; Fatima Ahmad; Ayesha Banu; Farhan Mohammad
36816743,The Role of Gut Microbiota in Various Neurological and Psychiatric Disorders-An Evidence Mapping Based on Quantified Evidence.,"We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Epistemonikos to identify systematic reviews and meta-analysis (SRs). We searched for neurological diseases and psychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), anorexia nervosa (AN), bipolar disorder (BD), eating disorder (ED), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), major depressive disorder (MDD), multiple sclerosis (MS), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), Parkinson's disease (PD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), spinal cord injury (SCI), schizophrenia, and stroke. We used A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR-2) to evaluate the quality of included SRs. We also created an evidence map showing the role of gut microbiota in neurological diseases and the certainty of the evidence.In total, 42 studies were included in this evidence mapping. Most findings were obtained from observational studies. According to the AMSTAR-2 assessment, 21 SRs scored ""critically low"" in terms of methodological quality, 16 SR scored ""low,"" and 5 SR scored ""moderate."" A total of 15 diseases have been investigated for the potential association between gut microbiome alpha diversity and disease, with the Shannon index and Simpson index being the most widely studied. A total of 12 diseases were investigated for potential link between beta diversity and disease. At the phylum level, <i>Firmicutes</i>, <i>Bacteroidetes</i>, <i>Actinobacteria</i>, <i>Proteobacteria</i>, and <i>Verrucomicrobia</i> were more researched. At the genus level, <i>Prevotella</i>, <i>Coprococcus</i>, <i>Parabacteroides</i>, <i>Phascolarctobacterium</i>, <i>Escherichia Shigella</i>, <i>Alistipes</i>, <i>Sutteralla</i>, <i>Veillonella</i>, <i>Odoribacter</i>, <i>Faecalibacterium</i>, <i>Bacteroides</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, <i>Dialister</i>, and <i>Blautia</i> were more researched. Some diseases have been found to have specific flora changes, and some diseases have been found to have common intestinal microbiological changes.We found varied levels of evidence for the associations between gut microbiota and neurological diseases; some gut microbiota increased the risk of neurological diseases, whereas others showed evidence of benefit that gut microbiota might be promising therapeutic targets for such diseases.",Mediators of inflammation,2023,Yaning Zang; Xigui Lai; Conghui Li; Dongfang Ding; Ying Wang; Yi Zhu
37368331,Gut Microbiota and Its Repercussion in Parkinson's Disease: A Systematic Review in Occidental Patients.,"(1) Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a relatively common and complex pathology, and some of its mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Change in host microbiota is related to the pathophysiology of numerous diseases. This systematic review aims to gather existing data on the occidental hemisphere, compare it, and search for any significant association between Parkinson's disease and gut microbiota dysbiosis. (2) Methods: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) and Meta-analyses Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) protocols were used for this systematic review. PubMed was used as the database search engine. Of the 166 studies found, only 10 were used, as they met our inclusion criteria: case-control studies, studies that assessed the correlation of PD and gut microbiome, studies that took place in occidental regions, and studies that were performed on humans and were written in English. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used as the assessment tool for overall risk of bias in this systematic review. (3) Results: The studies analyzed were divided into three geographic areas: Region 1: United States of America and Canada; Region 2: Germany, Ireland, and Finland; and Region 3: Italy; based on geographical similarities among these populations. The following statistically significant results were described in PD patients, compared with non-PD controls. In the first region, a significant increase in the following bacteria was seen: 1. Phylum: Actinobacteriota and its Genus: <i>Bifidobacterium</i>; 2. Phylum: Verrucomicrobiota and its Genus: <i>Akkermansia</i>; 3. Genus: <i>Enterococcus</i>, <i>Hungatella</i>, <i>Lactobacillus</i>, and <i>Oscillospira</i> of the Phylum: Firmicutes; 4. Family: <i>Ruminococcaceae</i> of Phylum: Firmicutes; 5. Phylum: Bacteroidetes and its Genus: <i>Bacteroides</i>; 6. Phylum: Proteobacteria. A significant decrease was described in the Family: <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> and its Genus: <i>Blautia</i>, <i>Coprococcus</i>, and <i>Roseburia</i>, which belong to the Phylum: Firmicutes. In the second region, a raised number of: 1. Phylum: Verrucomicrobiota, its Genus: <i>Akkermansia</i>, and its Species: <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i>; 2. Family: <i>Verrucomicrobiaceae</i> of the Phylum: Verrucomicrobiota; 3. Genus: <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Roseburia</i> of the Phylum: Firmicutes; 4. Family: <i>Lactobacillaceae</i> of the Phylum: Firmicutes; 5. Family: <i>Barnesiellaceae</i> of the Phylum: Bacteroidetes; 6. Genus: <i>Bifidobacterium</i> of the Phylum: Actinobacteriota; 7. Species: <i>Bilophila wadsworthia</i> of the Phylum: Thermodesulfobacteriota, was identified. Only one Genus: <i>Prevotella</i> of the Phylum: Bacteroidetes was decreased. In the third and last region, an augmented number of these bacteria were found: 1. Phylum: Verrucomicrobiota and its Genus: <i>Akkermansia</i>; 2. Family: <i>Bifidobacteriaceae</i> and <i>Coriobacteriaceae</i> of the Phylum: Actinobacteriota; 3. Phylum: Firmicutes and its Family: <i>Christensenellaceae</i> and <i>Lactobacillaceae</i>; 4. Family: <i>Enterococcaceae</i> and its Genus: <i>Enterococcus</i>, of the Phylum: Firmicutes; 5. Genus: <i>Lactococcus</i> and <i>Oscillospira</i>, of the Phylum: Firmicutes; 6. Phylum: Proteobacteria, its Family: <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i>, and the Genus: <i>Citrobacter</i>, <i>Klebsiella</i>, <i>Salmonella</i>, and <i>Shigella</i>; 7. Genus: <i>ParaBacteroides</i> of the Phylum: Bacteroidetes. In contrast, a significant decrease in 1. Phylum: Firmicutes, its Family: <i>Lachnospiraceae</i>, and its Genus: <i>Roseburia</i> and 2. Genus: <i>Ruminococcus</i> of the Phylum: Firmicutes, was described. (4) Conclusion: A significant gut dysbiosis, involving multiple bacterial taxa, was found in PD patients compared to healthy people in the occidental regions. However, more studies are needed to find the precise pathophysiologic involvement of other groups of pathogens, such as fungi and parasites, in the development and progression of PD.",Neurology international,2023,Ana Cristina Proano; Javier A Viteri; Eileen N Orozco; Marco Antonio Calle; Stefany Carolina Costa; Daniel V Reyes; Melissa German-Montenegro; David F Moncayo; Andrea C Tobar; Juan A Moncayo
37892440,Gut Microbiota Composition in Patients with Neurodegenerative Disorders (Parkinson's and Alzheimer's) and Healthy Controls: A Systematic Review.,"This systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current literature regarding gut microbiota composition in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to healthy controls. To identify the relevant studies, a thorough search of PubMed, Medline, and Embase was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. Out of 5627 articles, 73 studies were assessed for full-text eligibility, which led to the inclusion of 42 studies (26 PD and 16 AD studies). The risk of bias assessment showed a medium risk in 32 studies (20 PD studies and 12 AD studies), a low risk in 9 studies (5 PD studies and 4 AD studies), and 1 PD study with a high risk. Among the PD studies, 22 out of 26 studies reported a different gut microbiota composition between the PD cases and the healthy controls, and 15 out of 16 AD studies reported differences in gut microbiota composition between the AD cases and the healthy controls. The PD and AD studies consistently identified the phyla Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria as prevalent in the gut microbiota in both the healthy groups and the case groups. Microbial dysbiosis was specifically characterized in the PD studies by a high abundance of <i>Akkermansia</i>, <i>Verrucomicrobiaceae</i>, <i>Lachnospiraceae</i>, and <i>Ruminococcaceae</i> in the cases and a high abundance of <i>Blautia</i>, <i>Coprococcus</i>, <i>Prevotellaceae</i>, and <i>Roseburia</i> in the controls. Similarly, Bacteroides and Acidobacteriota were abundant in the AD cases, and <i>Acidaminococcaceae</i>, Firmicutes, <i>Lachnospiraceae</i>, and <i>Ruminiclostridium</i> were abundant in the AD controls. The microbial signature assessment showed the association of several microbial taxa, including <i>Akkermansia</i>, <i>Lachnospiraceae</i>, <i>Verrucomicrobiaceae</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, <i>Ruminococcacea</i>, and Verrucomicrobia with PD and <i>Ruminococcaceae</i>, <i>Bacteroides</i>, and Actinobacteria with AD. The microbial diversity evaluations in the PD and AD studies indicated comparable alpha diversity in some groups and distinct gut microbiota composition in others, with consistent beta diversity differences between the cases and the controls across multiple studies. The bacterial signatures identified in this study that are associated with PD and AD may offer promising prospects for efficient management and treatment approaches.",Nutrients,2023,Fatemah Sadeghpour Heravi; Kaveh Naseri; Honghua Hu
37208728,Dysbiosis of gut microbiota inhibits NMNAT2 to promote neurobehavioral deficits and oxidative stress response in the 6-OHDA-lesioned rat model of Parkinson's disease.,"New data are accumulating on gut microbial dysbiosis in Parkinson's disease (PD), while the specific mechanism remains uncharacterized. This study aims to investigate the potential role and pathophysiological mechanism of dysbiosis of gut microbiota in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced PD rat models.The shotgun metagenome sequencing data of fecal samples from PD patients and healthy individuals were obtained from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database. The diversity, abundance, and functional composition of gut microbiota were further analyzed in these data. After the exploration of the functional pathway-related genes, KEGG and GEO databases were used to obtain PD-related microarray datasets for differential expression analysis. Finally, in vivo experiments were performed to confirm the roles of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and upregulated NMNAT2 in neurobehavioral symptoms and oxidative stress response in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats.Significant differences were found in the diversity, abundance, and functional composition of gut microbiota between PD patients and healthy individuals. Dysbiosis of gut microbiota could regulate NAD<sup>+</sup> anabolic pathway to affect the occurrence and development of PD. As a NAD<sup>+</sup> anabolic pathway-related gene, NMNAT2 was poorly expressed in the brain tissues of PD patients. More importantly, FMT or overexpression of NMNAT2 alleviated neurobehavioral deficits and reduced oxidative stress in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats.Taken together, we demonstrated that dysbiosis of gut microbiota suppressed NMNAT2 expression, thus exacerbating neurobehavioral deficits and oxidative stress response in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, which could be rescued by FMT or NMNAT2 restoration.",Journal of neuroinflammation,2023,Jianjun Yu; Jianhong Meng; Zhengwei Qin; Yuan Yu; Yingxin Liang; Yanjun Wang; Dongmei Min

37600019,The gut microbiota-brain axis in neurological disorder.,"The gut microbiota (GM) plays an important role in the physiology and pathology of the host. Microbiota communicate with different organs of the organism by synthesizing hormones and regulating body activity. The interaction of the central nervous system (CNS) and gut signaling pathways includes chemical, neural immune and endocrine routes. Alteration or dysbiosis in the gut microbiota leads to different gastrointestinal tract disorders that ultimately impact host physiology because of the abnormal microbial metabolites that stimulate and trigger different physiologic reactions in the host body. Intestinal dysbiosis leads to a change in the bidirectional relationship between the CNS and GM, which is linked to the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental and neurological disorders. Increasing preclinical and clinical studies/evidence indicate that gut microbes are a possible susceptibility factor for the progression of neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In this review, we discuss the crucial connection between the gut microbiota and the central nervous system, the signaling pathways of multiple biological systems and the contribution of gut microbiota-related neurological disorders.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2023,Hanif Ullah; Safia Arbab; Yali Tian; Chang-Qing Liu; Yuwen Chen; Li Qijie; Muhammad Inayat Ullah Khan; Inam Ul Hassan; Ka Li
37913731,"Flavonoids: Their putative neurologic roles, epigenetic changes, and gut microbiota alterations in Parkinson's disease.","Parkinson's Disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by the degeneration of progressive dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra region of the human midbrain. Although just what causes PD remains a mystery, it is known that oxidative stress (OS) as well as mitochondrial dysfunction, neuro-inflammation, and insufficient neurotrophic support play a role in the disease's pathophysiology. Phytochemicals are a diverse small molecule group derived from plants that can be classified into numerous classes on the basis of their biological activities and chemical structure. Of these groups of phytochemicals, the most abundant, which has well-established anti-Parkinson's effects, are polyphenols. Flavonoids, including naringin and naringenin, genistein, kaempferol, anthocyanins, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, and baicalein are plant-based biologically active polyphenols, which have been shown to exhibit therapeutic potential when used as treatment for a variety of pathological illnesses, such as neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) and PD. Recently, it was reported that flavonoids have beneficial effects on PD, such as the protection of DA neurons, improvement of motor and cognitive abilities, regulation of signaling pathways, and modulation of OS and neuro-inflammation. In addition, by changing the composition of bacteria in gut microbiota, flavonoids reduce pathogenic strains and promote the growth of beneficial strains. In this context, the current paper will provide a literature review on the neurological roles that flavonoids play, as one of the most abundant phytochemical families, in PD.",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2023,Yasemin AÃ§ar; Duygu AÄagÃ¼ndÃ¼z; Paola De Cicco; Raffaele Capasso
37823531,Role of Bmal1 and Gut Microbiota in Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease Pathophysiology: The Probable Effect of Melatonin on Their Association.,"In recent years, the role of new factors in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases has been investigated. Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are the most common neurodegenerative diseases worldwide. Although pathological changes such as the accumulation of aggregated proteins in the brain and inflammatory responses are known as the main factors involved in the development of these diseases, new studies show the role of gut microbiota and circadian rhythm in the occurrence of these changes. However, the association between circadian rhythm and gut microbiota in AD and PD has not yet been investigated. Recent results propose that alterations in circadian rhythm regulators, mainly Bmal1, may regulate the abundance of gut microbiota. This correlation has been linked to the regulation of the expression of immune-related genes and Bmal-1 mediated oscillation of IgA and hydrogen peroxide production. These data seem to provide new insight into the molecular mechanism of melatonin inhibiting the progression of AD and PD. Therefore, this manuscript aims to review the role of the gut microbiota and circadian rhythm in health and AD and PD and also presents a hypothesis on the effect of melatonin on their communication.",ACS chemical neuroscience,2023,Mohammad Rafi Khezri; Ayda Esmaeili; Morteza Ghasemnejad-Berenji
36934020,Oral and intestinal dysbiosis in Parkinson's disease.,"The suspicion of an origin of Parkinson's disease (PD) at the periphery of the body and the involvement of environmental risk factors in the pathogenesis of PD have directed the attention of the scientific community towards the microbiota. The microbiota represents all the microorganisms residing both in and on a host. It plays an essential role in the physiological functioning of the host. In this article, we review the dysbiosis repeatedly demonstrated in PD and how it influences PD symptoms. Dysbiosis is associated with both motor and non-motor PD symptoms. In animal models, dysbiosis only promotes symptoms in individuals genetically susceptible to Parkinson's disease, suggesting that dysbiosis is a risk factor but not a cause of Parkinson's disease. We also review how dysbiosis contributes to the pathophysiology of PD. Dysbiosis induces numerous and complex metabolic changes, resulting in increased intestinal permeability, local and systemic inflammation, production of bacterial amyloid proteins that promote Î±-synuclein aggregation, as well as a decrease in short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria that have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective potential. In addition, we review how dysbiosis decreases the efficacy of dopaminergic treatments. We then discuss the interest of dysbiosis analysis as a biomarker of Parkinson's disease. Finally, we give an overview of how interventions modulating the gut microbiota such as dietary interventions, pro-biotics, intestinal decontamination and fecal microbiota transplantation could influence the course of PD.",Revue neurologique,2023,E Berthouzoz; V Lazarevic; A Zekeridou; M Castro; I Debove; S Aybek; J Schrenzel; P R Burkhard; V Fleury

Microbiota transplantation from PD patients to mice can induce increased alpha-synuclein-mediated motor deficits. Human studies have identified differences in the gut microbiota of PD patients compared to healthy controls. We undertook a systematic review to evaluate the available evidence for the involvement of gut bacteria in the etiology of PD.The PubMed databank, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure databank, and Wanfang Data were searched from inception until June 2021 to identify human case-control studies that investigated relationships between PD and microbiota quantified from feces. We evaluated the resulting studies focusing on bacterial taxa that were different between PD patients and healthy controls.Twenty-six studies were found in which 53 microbial families and 98 genera exhibited differences between patients with PD and healthy controls.

It has been reported that the microbiota-gut-brain axis plays a crucial role in regulating host neuroprotective function. Studies have shown that patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have dysbiosis of the gut microbiota, and experiments involving germ-free mice and fecal microbiota transplantation from PD patients have revealed the pathogenic role of the gut microbiota in PD. Interventions targeting the gut microbiota in PD, including the use of prebiotics, probiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation, have also shown efficacy in treating PD. However, the causal relationship between the gut microbiota and Parkinson's disease remains intricate. This study reviewed the association between the microbiota-gut-brain axis and PD from the perspectives of humoral pathway, cellular immune pathway and neuronal pathway. We found that the interactions among gut microbiota and PD are very complex, which should be ""multidirectional"", rather than conventionally regarded ""bidirectional"".

Here we performed a cross-sectional study to profile gut microbiota across early PD, REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), first-degree relatives of RBD (RBD-FDR), and healthy controls, which could reflect the gut-brain staging model of PD. We show gut microbiota compositions are significantly altered in early PD and RBD compared with control and RBD-FDR. Depletion of butyrate-producing bacteria and enrichment of pro-inflammatory Collinsella have already emerged in RBD and RBD-FDR after controlling potential confounders including antidepressants, osmotic laxatives, and bowel movement frequency. Random forest modelling identifies 12 microbial markers that are effective to distinguish RBD from control. These findings suggest that PD-like gut dysbiosis occurs at the prodromal stages of PD when RBD develops and starts to emerge in the younger RBD-FDR subjects.

37960284,Understanding the Gut-Brain Axis and Its Therapeutic Implications for Neurodegenerative Disorders.,"The gut-brain axis (GBA) is a complex bidirectional communication network connecting the gut and brain. It involves neural, immune, and endocrine communication pathways between the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the central nervous system (CNS). Perturbations of the GBA have been reported in many neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs), such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), among others, suggesting a possible role in disease pathogenesis. The gut microbiota is a pivotal component of the GBA, and alterations in its composition, known as gut dysbiosis, have been associated with GBA dysfunction and neurodegeneration. The gut microbiota might influence the homeostasis of the CNS by modulating the immune system and, more directly, regulating the production of molecules and metabolites that influence the nervous and endocrine systems, making it a potential therapeutic target. Preclinical trials manipulating microbial composition through dietary intervention, probiotic and prebiotic supplementation, and fecal microbial transplantation (FMT) have provided promising outcomes. However, its clear mechanism is not well understood, and the results are not always consistent. Here, we provide an overview of the major components and communication pathways of the GBA, as well as therapeutic approaches targeting the GBA to ameliorate NDDs.",Nutrients,2023,Yadong Zheng; Laura Bonfili; Tao Wei; Anna Maria Eleuteri
37298527,Neurodegenerative and Neurodevelopmental Diseases and the Gut-Brain Axis: The Potential of Therapeutic Targeting of the Microbiome.,"The human gut microbiome contains the largest number of bacteria in the body and has the potential to greatly influence metabolism, not only locally but also systemically. There is an established link between a healthy, balanced, and diverse microbiome and overall health. When the gut microbiome becomes unbalanced (dysbiosis) through dietary changes, medication use, lifestyle choices, environmental factors, and ageing, this has a profound effect on our health and is linked to many diseases, including lifestyle diseases, metabolic diseases, inflammatory diseases, and neurological diseases. While this link in humans is largely an association of dysbiosis with disease, in animal models, a causative link can be demonstrated. The link between the gut and the brain is particularly important in maintaining brain health, with a strong association between dysbiosis in the gut and neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases. This link suggests not only that the gut microbiota composition can be used to make an early diagnosis of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases but also that modifying the gut microbiome to influence the microbiome-gut-brain axis might present a therapeutic target for diseases that have proved intractable, with the aim of altering the trajectory of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, autism spectrum disorder, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, among others. There is also a microbiome-gut-brain link to other potentially reversible neurological diseases, such as migraine, post-operative cognitive dysfunction, and long COVID, which might be considered models of therapy for neurodegenerative disease.

The literature suggests crosstalk mechanisms between mitochondria and circadian clocks, the gut microbiota, and the immune system. They might even be the hub supporting and integrating activity across all these domains. Hence, they might be the (missing) link in both health and disease. Mitochondrial dysfunction is related to metabolic syndrome, neuronal diseases, cancer, cardiovascular and infectious diseases, and inflammatory disorders. In this regard, diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), and chronic pain are discussed. This review focuses on understanding the mitochondrial mechanisms of action that allow for the maintenance of mitochondrial health and the pathways toward dysregulated mechanisms. Although mitochondria have allowed us to adapt to changes over the course of evolution, in turn, evolution has shaped mitochondria. Each evolution-based intervention influences mitochondria in its own way. The use of physiological stress triggers tolerance to the stressor, achieving adaptability and resistance. This review describes strategies that could recover mitochondrial functioning in multiple diseases, providing a comprehensive, root-cause-focused, integrative approach to recovering health and treating people suffering from chronic diseases.",Frontiers in physiology,2023,Amaloha Casanova; Anne Wevers; Santiago Navarro-Ledesma; Leo Pruimboom
37619773,The role of the indoles in microbiota-gut-brain axis and potential therapeutic targets: A focus on human neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases.,"At present, a large number of relevant studies have suggested that the changes in gut microbiota are related to the course of nervous system diseases, and the microbiota-gut-brain axis is necessary for the proper functioning of the nervous system. Indole and its derivatives, as the products of the gut microbiota metabolism of tryptophan, can be used as ligands to regulate inflammation and autoimmune response in vivo. In recent years, some studies have found that the levels of indole and its derivatives differ significantly between patients with central nervous system diseases and healthy individuals, suggesting that they may be important mediators for the involvement of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in the disease course. Tryptophan metabolites produced by gut microbiota are involved in multiple physiological reactions, take indole for example, it participates in the process of inflammation and anti-inflammatory effects through various cellular physiological activities mediated by aromatic hydrocarbon receptors (AHR), which can influence a variety of neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases. This review mainly explores and summarizes the relationship between indoles and human neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, including ischemic stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, cognitive impairment, depression and anxiety, and puts forward that the level of indoles can be regulated through various direct or indirect ways to improve the prognosis of central nervous system diseases and reverse the dysfunction of the microbiota-gut-brain axis.

37389240,Epidemiology of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.,"Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is defined as an increase in the bacterial content of the small intestine above normal values. The presence of SIBO is detected in 33.8% of patients with gastroenterological complaints who underwent a breath test, and is significantly associated with smoking, bloating, abdominal pain, and anemia. Proton pump inhibitor therapy is a significant risk factor for SIBO. The risk of SIBO increases with age and does not depend on gender or race. SIBO complicates the course of a number of diseases and may be of pathogenetic significance in the development of their symptoms. SIBO is significantly associated with functional dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome, functional abdominal bloating, functional constipation, functional diarrhea, short bowel syndrome, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, lactase deficiency, diverticular and celiac diseases, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, cirrhosis, metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), primary biliary cholangitis, gastroparesis, pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, gallstone disease, diabetes, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, acromegaly, multiple sclerosis, autism, Parkinson's disease, systemic sclerosis, spondylarthropathy, fibromyalgia, asthma, heart failure, and other diseases. The development of SIBO is often associated with a slowdown in orocecal transit time that decreases the normal clearance of bacteria from the small intestine. The slowdown of this transit may be due to motor dysfunction of the intestine in diseases of the gut, autonomic diabetic polyneuropathy, and portal hypertension, or a decrease in the motor-stimulating influence of thyroid hormones. In a number of diseases, including cirrhosis, MAFLD, diabetes, and pancreatitis, an association was found between disease severity and the presence of SIBO. Further work on the effect of SIBO eradication on the condition and prognosis of patients with various diseases is required.",World journal of gastroenterology,2023,Irina Efremova; Roman Maslennikov; Elena Poluektova; Ekaterina Vasilieva; Yury Zharikov; Andrey Suslov; Yana Letyagina; Evgenii Kozlov; Anna Levshina; Vladimir Ivashkin
37798034,Safety and feasibility of faecal microbiota transplantation for patients with Parkinson's disease: a protocol for a self-controlled interventional donor-FMT pilot study.,"Experimental studies suggest a role of gut microbiota in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) via the gut-brain axis. The gut microbiota can also influence the metabolism of levodopa, which is the mainstay of treatment of PD. Therefore, modifying the gut microbiota by faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) could be a supportive treatment strategy.We have developed a study protocol for a single-centre, prospective, self-controlled, interventional, safety and feasibility donor-FMT pilot study with randomisation and double-blinded allocation of donor faeces. The primary objectives are feasibility and safety of FMT in patients with PD. Secondary objectives include exploring whether FMT leads to alterations in motor complications (fluctuations and dyskinesias) and PD motor and non-motor symptoms (including constipation), determining alterations in gut microbiota composition, assessing donor-recipient microbiota similarities and their association with PD symptoms and motor complications, evaluating the ease of the study protocol and examining FMT-related adverse events in patients with PD. The study population will consist of 16 patients with idiopathic PD that use levodopa and experience motor complications. They will receive FMT with faeces from one of two selected healthy human donors. FMT will be administered via a gastroscope into the duodenum, after treatment with oral vancomycin, bowel lavage and domperidone. There will be seven follow-up moments during 12 months.This study was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee Leiden Den Haag Delft (ref. P20.087).

However, the source of seeding-capable Î±-synuclein in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) has not been fully investigated. Additionally, the mechanism by which the GIT microbiome contributes to PD pathogenesis remains to be characterized.We aimed to investigate whether blood-derived Î±-synuclein might contribute to PD pathology via a gut-driven pathway and involve GIT microbiota.The GIT expression of Î±-synuclein and the transmission of extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from erythrocytes/red blood cells (RBCs), with their cargo Î±-synuclein, to the GIT were explored with various methods, including radioactive labeling of RBC-EVs and direct analysis of the transfer of Î±-synuclein protein. The potential role of microbiota on the EVs transmission was further investigated by administering butyrate, the short-chain fatty acids produced by gut microbiota and studying mice with different Î±-synuclein genotypes.This study demonstrated that RBC-EVs can effectively transport Î±-synuclein to the GIT in a region-dependent manner, along with variations closely associated with regional differences in the expression of gut-vascular barrier markers. The investigation further revealed that the infiltration of Î±-synuclein into the GIT was influenced significantly by butyrate and Î±-synuclein genotypes, which may also affect the GIT microbiome directly.By demonstrating the transportation of Î±-synuclein through RBC-EVs to the GIT, and its potential association with gut-vascular barrier markers and gut microbiome, this work highlights a potential mechanism by which RBC Î±-synuclein may impact PD initiation and/or progression.

37492530,<i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> in neuropsychiatric disorders: friend or foe?,"An accumulating body of evidence suggests that the bacterium <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> exhibits positive systemic effects on host health, mainly by improving immunological and metabolic functions, and it is therefore regarded as a promising potential probiotic. Recent clinical and preclinical studies have shown that <i>A. muciniphila</i> plays a vital role in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders by influencing the host brain through the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA). Numerous studies observed that <i>A. muciniphila</i> and its metabolic substances can effectively improve the symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders by restoring the gut microbiota, reestablishing the integrity of the gut mucosal barrier, regulating host immunity, and modulating gut and neuroinflammation. However, <i>A. muciniphila</i> was also reported to participate in the development of neuropsychiatric disorders by aggravating inflammation and influencing mucus production. Therefore, the exact mechanism of action of <i>A. muciniphila</i> remains much controversial. This review summarizes the proposed roles and mechanisms of <i>A. muciniphila</i> in various neurological and psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, strokes, and autism spectrum disorders, and provides insights into the potential therapeutic application of <i>A. muciniphila</i> for the treatment of these conditions.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2023,Wenhui Lei; Yiwen Cheng; Jie Gao; Xia Liu; Li Shao; Qingming Kong; Nengneng Zheng; Zongxin Ling; Weiming Hu

37515687,Gut microbiota bridges the iron homeostasis and host health.,"The gut microbiota acts as a symbiotic microecosystem that plays an indispensable role in the regulation of a number of metabolic processes in the host by secreting secondary metabolites and impacting the physiology and pathophysiology of numerous organs and tissues through the circulatory system. This relationship, referred to as the ""gut-X axis"", is associated with the development and progression of disorders, including obesity, fatty liver and Parkinson's disease. Given its importance, the gut flora is a vital research area for the understanding and development of the novel therapeutic approaches for multiple disorders. Iron is a common but necessary element required by both mammals and bacteria. As a result, iron metabolism is closely intertwined with the gut microbiota. The host's iron homeostasis affects the composition of the gut microbiota and the interaction between host and gut microbiota through various mechanisms such as nutrient homeostasis, intestinal peaceability, gut immunity, and oxidative stress. Therefore, understanding the relationship between gut microbes and host iron metabolism is not only of enormous significance to host health but also may offer preventative and therapeutic approaches for a number of disorders that impact both parties. In this review, we delve into the connection between the dysregulation of iron metabolism and dysbiosis of gut microbiota, and how it contributes to the onset and progression of metabolic and chronic diseases.",Science China.

37375679,"New Pieces for an Old Puzzle: Approaching Parkinson's Disease from Translatable Animal Models, Gut Microbiota Modulation, and Lipidomics.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is a severe neurodegenerative disease characterized by disabling motor alterations that are diagnosed at a relatively late stage in its development, and non-motor symptoms, including those affecting the gastrointestinal tract (mainly constipation), which start much earlier than the motor symptoms. Remarkably, current treatments only reduce motor symptoms, not without important drawbacks (relatively low efficiency and impactful side effects). Thus, new approaches are needed to halt PD progression and, possibly, to prevent its development, including new therapeutic strategies that target PD etiopathogeny and new biomarkers. Our aim was to review some of these new approaches. Although PD is complex and heterogeneous, compelling evidence suggests it might have a gastrointestinal origin, at least in a significant number of patients, and findings in recently developed animal models strongly support this hypothesis. Furthermore, the modulation of the gut microbiome, mainly through probiotics, is being tested to improve motor and non-motor symptoms and even to prevent PD. Finally, lipidomics has emerged as a useful tool to identify lipid biomarkers that may help analyze PD progression and treatment efficacy in a personalized manner, although, as of today, it has only scarcely been applied to monitor gut motility, dysbiosis, and probiotic effects in PD. Altogether, these new pieces should be helpful in solving the old puzzle of PD.",Nutrients,2023,Lorena Ortega Moreno; Ana Bagues; Vicente MartÃ­nez; Raquel Abalo
36958817,Faecal metabolome and its determinants in inflammatory bowel disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a multifactorial immune-mediated inflammatory disease of the intestine, comprising Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. By characterising metabolites in faeces, combined with faecal metagenomics, host genetics and clinical characteristics, we aimed to unravel metabolic alterations in IBD.We measured 1684 different faecal metabolites and 8 short-chain and branched-chain fatty acids in stool samples of 424 patients with IBD and 255 non-IBD controls. Regression analyses were used to compare concentrations of metabolites between cases and controls and determine the relationship between metabolites and each participant's lifestyle, clinical characteristics and gut microbiota composition. Moreover, genome-wide association analysis was conducted on faecal metabolite levels.We identified over 300 molecules that were differentially abundant in the faeces of patients with IBD. The ratio between a sphingolipid and L-urobilin could discriminate between IBD and non-IBD samples (AUC=0.85). We found changes in the bile acid pool in patients with dysbiotic microbial communities and a strong association between faecal metabolome and gut microbiota. For example, the abundance of <i>Ruminococcus gnavus</i> was positively associated with tryptamine levels. In addition, we found 158 associations between metabolites and dietary patterns, and polymorphisms near <i>NAT2</i> strongly associated with coffee metabolism.In this large-scale analysis, we identified alterations in the metabolome of patients with IBD that are independent of commonly overlooked confounders such as diet and surgical history.

The pathological mechanisms underlying PD are complex and yet to be fully elucidated. Clinical studies suggest that the onset of gastrointestinal symptoms may precede motor symptoms in PD patients. The microbiota-gut-brain axis plays a bidirectional communication role between the enteric nervous system and the central nervous system. This bidirectional communication between the brain and gut is influenced by the neural, immune and endocrine systems related to the gut microbiome. A growing body of evidence indicates a strong link between dysregulation of the gut microbiota and PD.

38097625,Plasma metabolites of aromatic amino acids associate with clinical severity and gut microbiota of Parkinson's disease.,"Gut microbial proteolytic metabolism has been reportedly altered in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the circulating aromatic amino acids (AAA) described in PD are inconsistent. Here we aimed to investigate plasma AAA profiles in a large cohort of PD patients, and examine their correlations with clinical severity and gut microbiota changes. We enrolled 500 participants including 250 PD patients and 250 neurologically normal controls. Plasma metabolites were measured using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Faecal samples were newly collected from 154 PD patients for microbiota shotgun metagenomic sequencing combined with data derived from 96 PD patients reported before. Data were collected regarding diet, medications, and motor and non-motor symptoms of PD. Compared to controls, PD patients had higher plasma AAA levels, including phenylacetylglutamine (PAGln), p-cresol sulfate (Pcs), p-cresol glucuronide (Pcg), and indoxyl sulfate (IS). Multivariable linear regression analyses, with adjustment for age, sex, and medications, revealed that the plasma levels of PAGln (coefficient 4.49, 95% CI 0.40-8.58, Pâ=â0.032) and Pcg (coefficient 1.79, 95% CI 0.07-3.52, Pâ=â0.042) positively correlated with motor symptom severity but not cognitive function. After correcting for abovementioned potential confounders, these AAA metabolites were also associated with the occurrence of constipation in PD patients (all Pâ<â0.05). Furthermore, plasma levels of AAA metabolites were correlated with the abundance of specific gut microbiota species, including Bacteroides sp. CF01-10NS, Bacteroides vulgatus, and Clostridium sp. AF50-3. In conclusion, elevated plasma AAA metabolite levels correlated with disease characteristics in PD, suggesting that upregulated proteolytic metabolism may contribute to the pathophysiology of PD.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2023,Szu-Ju Chen; Yu-Jun Wu; Chieh-Chang Chen; Yu-Wei Wu; Jyh-Ming Liou; Ming-Shiang Wu; Ching-Hua Kuo; Chin-Hsien Lin
37490970,The Role of Gut Microbiota in Glaucoma Progression and Other Retinal Diseases.,"As a rapidly growing field, microbiota research offers novel approaches to promoting ocular health and treating major retinal diseases, such as glaucoma. Gut microbiota changes throughout life; however, certain patterns of population changes have been increasingly associated with specific diseases. It has been well established that a disrupted microbiome contributes to central nervous system diseases, including Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, and glioma, suggesting a prominent role of microbiome in neurodegenerative diseases. This review summarizes the progress in identifying significant changes in the microbial composition of patients with glaucoma by compiling studies on the association between microbiota and disease progression. Of interest is the relationship between increased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma, increased taurocholic acid, decreased glutathione, and a reduction in retinal ganglion cell survival. Connecting these microbes to specific metabolites sheds light on the pathogenic mechanism and novel treatment strategies. In summary, the current review synthesizes the findings of several studies investigating the effects of shifting bacterial population in retinal diseases, particularly glaucoma, with the aim to identify the current direction of treatment and help direct future endeavors.",The American journal of pathology,2023,Julie Chen; Dong Feng Chen; Kin-Sang Cho

The loss of dopaminergic neurons and intestinal barrier function was measured using Western blot and immunofluorescence. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing and LC-MS were parallelly performed on mice feces to investigate alterations in microbiota and metabolites. <b>Results:</b> Curcumin alleviated motor deficits and the loss of dopaminergic neurons in MPTP-induced mice. Curcumin ameliorated gastrointestinal and intestinal barrier dysfunctions in MPTP-induced mice. Curcumin reduced gut microbial dysbiosis and modulated carbohydrate metabolism in MPTP-induced mice. Curcumin restored short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) profiles in MPTP-induced mice. <b>Conclusion:</b> Concurrently, these results indicate that curcumin inhibits Parkinson's disease by regulating the gut microbiota and short-chain fatty acids.",Frontiers in pharmacology,2023,Benchi Cai; Lifan Zhong; Qitong Wang; Wendi Xu; Xi Li; Tao Chen

Recently, aberrant microbiota-derived metabolites are emerging as important participants in PD etiology. However, the alterations of gut microbiota community and serum untargeted metabolite profile have not been fully investigated in a PD mice model. Here, we discover sharply reduced levels of <i>Lactobacillus</i> and taurine in MPTP-treated mice. Moreover, <i>Lactobacillus</i>, <i>Adlercreutzia</i>, and taurine-related metabolites showed the most significant correlation with pathological and GI performance of PD mice. The abundances of microbial transporter and enzymes participating in the degeneration of taurine were disturbed in PD mice. Most importantly, taurine supplement ameliorates MPTP-induced motor deficits, DA neuron loss, and microglial activation. Our data highlight the impaired taurine-based microbiome-metabolism axis during the progression of PD and reveal a novel and previously unrecognized role of genera in modulating taurine metabolism.",mSphere,2023,Can Cui; Huan Song; Yingying Han; Hongxiang Yu; Hongxia Li; Yumei Yang; Bei Zhang
37736791,"The link between the gut microbiome, inflammation, and Parkinson's disease.","As our society ages, the growing number of people with Parkinson's disease (PD) puts tremendous pressure on our society. Currently, there is no effective treatment for PD, so there is an urgent need to find new treatment options. In recent years, increasing studies have shown a strong link between gut microbes and PD. In this review, recent advances in research on gut microbes in PD patients were summarized. Increased potential pro-inflammatory microbes and decreased potential anti-inflammatory microbes are prominent features of gut microbiota in PD patients. These changes may lead to an increase in pro-inflammatory substances (such as lipopolysaccharide and H<sub>2</sub>S) and a decrease in anti-inflammatory substances (such as short-chain fatty acids) to promote inflammation in the gut. This gut microbiota-mediated inflammation will lead to pathological Î±-synuclein accumulation in the gut, and the inflammation and Î±-synuclein can spread to the brain via the microbiota-gut-brain axis, thereby promoting neuroinflammation, apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons, and ultimately the development of PD. This review also showed that therapies based on gut microbiota may have a bright future for PD. However, more research and new approaches are still needed to clarify the causal relationship between gut microbes and PD and to determine whether therapies based on gut microbiota are effective in PD patients. KEY POINTS: â¢ There is a strong association between gut microbes and PD. â¢ Inflammation mediated by gut microbes may promote the development of PD. â¢ Therapies based on the gut microbiome provide a promising strategy for PD prevention.",Applied microbiology and biotechnology,2023,Shiqing Nie; Yuan Ge
37620311,Gut microbiota and fecal short chain fatty acids differ with adiposity and country of origin: the METS-microbiome study.,"The relationship between microbiota, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and obesity remains enigmatic. We employ amplicon sequencing and targeted metabolomics in a large (nâ=â1904) African origin cohort from Ghana, South Africa, Jamaica, Seychelles, and the US. Microbiota diversity and fecal SCFAs are greatest in Ghanaians, and lowest in Americans, representing each end of the urbanization spectrum. Obesity is significantly associated with a reduction in SCFA concentration, microbial diversity, and SCFA synthesizing bacteria, with country of origin being the strongest explanatory factor. Diabetes, glucose state, hypertension, obesity, and sex can be accurately predicted from the global microbiota, but when analyzed at the level of country, predictive accuracy is only universally maintained for sex. Diabetes, glucose, and hypertension are only predictive in certain low-income countries. Our findings suggest that adiposity-related microbiota differences differ between low-to-middle-income compared to high-income countries.

37807941,The gut microbiota metabolite butyrate mitigates MPTP/MPP<sup>+</sup> -induced Parkinson's disease by inhibiting the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.,"Butyrate (BU), a gut microbiota-derived metabolite, has been reported to play a neuroprotective role in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the specific molecular mechanism of BU has not been fully interpreted. This work aimed to verify the protective effects of BU against MPTP/MPP<sup>+</sup> -induced neurotoxicity and explore the mechanisms involved. The results showed that BU protected against MPTP-induced motor dysfunction and decreased tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine transporter (DAT) levels. Additionally, BU pretreatment improved PC12 cell viability and reduced MPP<sup>+</sup> -induced PC12 cell apoptosis. BU treatment also attenuated MPP<sup>+</sup> -stimulated oxidative stress and inflammatory response in PC12 cells. Furthermore, BU inhibited MPTP/MPP<sup>+</sup> -induced hyperactivation of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling in mice and PC12 cells. Besides, a JAK2 agonist, Coumermycin A1 (C-A1), substantially reversed BU-mediated inhibition on JAK2/STAT3 phosphorylation in MPP<sup>+</sup> -challenged PC12 cells and abated BU-induced repression on MPP<sup>+</sup> -triggered apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammatory response in PC12 cells.

Although gender differences are known to an essential role in the epidemiology and clinical course of PD, there are no studies on the sex specificity of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in the development and progression of PD.Fresh fecal samples from 24 PD patients (13 males, 11 females) were collected for metagenomic sequencing. The composition and function of the gut microbiota were analyzed by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Gender-dependent differences in brain ALFF values and their correlation with microbiota were further analyzed.The relative abundance of <i>Propionivibrio</i>, <i>Thermosediminibacter</i>, and <i>Flavobacteriaceae_noname</i> was increased in male PD patients. LEfse analysis showed that <i>Verrucomicrobial</i>, <i>Akkermansiaceae</i>, and <i>Akkermansia</i> were dominant in the males. In female patients, the relative abundance of <i>Propionicicella</i> was decreased and <i>Escherichia</i>, <i>Escherichia_coli</i>, and <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> were predominant. The expression of the sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis pathways was increased in male PD patients and was statistically different from females. Compared to the Male PD patients, female patients showed decreased ALFF values in the left inferior parietal regions, and the relative abundance of <i>Propionivibrio</i> was positively correlated with the regional ALFF values.Our study provides novel clinical evidence of the gender-specific relationship between gut microbiota alterations and brain function in PD patients, highlighting the critical role of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in gender differences in PD.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2023,Minna Zhang; Zhiyuan Zhai; Bo Yang; Le He; Jingyi Wang; Weijie Dai; Liujun Xue; Xiaozhong Yang; Yun Feng; Honggang Wang

38022117,The Role of Gut Microbiota in Neurodegenerative Diseases: Current Insights and Therapeutic Implications.,"Small microscopic entities known as microbes, having a population of hundreds of billions or perhaps even in trillions, reside in our gastrointestinal tract. A healthy immune system, digestion, and creation of vitamins and enzymes are all thanks to these microbes. However, new research has shown a hitherto unrecognized connection between the microbiota of the intestines and the genesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Neurons in the CNS gradually deteriorate in neurodegenerative illnesses like multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease (PD). This deterioration impairs cognitive and physical function. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), PD, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are just a few examples of neurodegenerative illnesses that pose a serious threat to world health and have few effective treatments. Recent research suggests that the gut microbiota, a diverse microbial population found in the gastrointestinal system, may substantially impact the cause and development of various diseases. The discovery of altered gut microbiota composition in people with these illnesses is one of the most critical lines of evidence connecting gut microbiota dysbiosis to neurodegenerative diseases. AD patients have a distinct characteristic of having a particular microbiota profile. In addition, an excess population of a specific microbe data profile is seen as compared to a healthy individual. Similar changes in the gut microbiota composition have been noted in people with multiple sclerosis and PD. The latest study indicates the potential that dysbiosis, a condition characterized by alteration in the intestinal microbiota's makeup and functioning, may have an effect on the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, including PD and multiple sclerosis. In order to emphasize any potential underlying mechanisms and examine potential treatment repercussions, the review article's goal is to summarize current knowledge about the connection between gut microbiota and neurodegenerative disorders.

37200942,Ketogenic diet protects MPTP-induced mouse model of Parkinson's disease via altering gut microbiota and metabolites.,"The ketogenic diet (KD) is a low-carbohydrate, high-fat regime that is protective against neurodegenerative diseases. However, the impact of KD on Parkinson's disease (PD) and its mechanisms remains unclear. 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced mouse model of PD was fed with KD for 8Â weeks. Motor function and dopaminergic neurons were evaluated. Inflammation in the brain, plasma, and colon tissue were also measured. Fecal samples were assessed by 16S rDNA gene sequencing and untargeted metabolomics. We found that KD protected motor dysfunction, dopaminergic neuron loss, and inflammation in an MPTP mouse model of PD. 16S rDNA sequencing revealed that MPTP administration significantly increased <i>Citrobacter</i>, <i>Desulfovibrio</i>, and <i>Ruminococcus</i>, and decreased <i>Dubosiella</i>, whereas KD treatment reversed the dysbiosis. Meanwhile, KD regulated the MPTP-induced histamine, N-acetylputrescine, d-aspartic acid, and other metabolites. Fecal microbiota transplantation using feces from the KD-treated mice attenuated the motor function impairment and dopaminergic neuron loss in antibiotic-pretreated PD mice. Our current study demonstrates that KD played a neuroprotective role in the MPTP mouse model of PD through the diet-gut microbiota-brain axis, which may involve inflammation in the brain and colon. However, future research is warranted to explore the explicit anti-inflammatory mechanisms of the gut-brain axis in PD models fed with KD.",MedComm,2023,Ziying Jiang; Xinyu Wang; Haoqiang Zhang; Jian Yin; Peiqing Zhao; Qingqing Yin; Zhenfu Wang

The authors chose these three disorders because of their burdensome and great effect on health care. We live on a microbial planet. Before humans, microorganisms existed for a hundred million years. Today, there are trillions of these microbes living in our bodies, it is called human microbiota. These organisms have a crucial role in our homeostasis and survival. Most of the human microbiota live in the gut. The number of gut microbiota is much more than the number of body cells. Gut microbiota has been regarded as a crucial regulator of the gut-brain axis. The discovery of the microbiota-gut-brain axis is described as a major advancement in neuroscience because it influences the pathophysiology of several neurological and psychiatric disorders. From this, more studies of the microbiota-gut-brain axis are needed in the future, to provide a better understanding of brain disorders and so that better treatment and prognosis.",Annals of medicine and surgery (2012),2023,Amjad Mhanna; Zuheir Alshehabi
37323141,Effects of gut microbiota on neurodegenerative diseases.,"A progressive degradation of the brain's structure and function, which results in a reduction in cognitive and motor skills, characterizes neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington's disease (HD). The morbidity linked to NDs is growing, which poses a severe threat to human being's mental and physical ability to live well. The gut-brain axis (GBA) is now known to have a crucial role in the emergence of NDs. The gut microbiota is a conduit for the GBA, a two-way communication system between the gut and the brain. The myriad microorganisms that make up the gut microbiota can affect brain physiology by transmitting numerous microbial chemicals from the gut to the brain <i>via</i> the GBA or neurological system. The synthesis of neurotransmitters, the immunological response, and the metabolism of lipids and glucose have all been demonstrated to be impacted by alterations in the gut microbiota, such as an imbalance of helpful and harmful bacteria. In order to develop innovative interventions and clinical therapies for NDs, it is crucial to comprehend the participation of the gut microbiota in these conditions. In addition to using antibiotics and other drugs to target particular bacterial species that may be a factor in NDs, this also includes using probiotics and other fecal microbiota transplantation to maintain a healthy gut microbiota. In conclusion, the examination of the GBA can aid in understanding the etiology and development of NDs, which may benefit the improvement of clinical treatments for these disorders and ND interventions. This review indicates existing knowledge about the involvement of microbiota present in the gut in NDs and potential treatment options.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2023,Saima Khatoon; Nida Kalam; Summya Rashid; Gulnaz Bano

An exploratory Mendelian randomization study was conducted to investigate whether TMAO and its precursors have a causal relationship with PD.Summary statistics were obtained for single nucleotide polymorphisms related to circulating levels of TMAO, betaine, carnitine and choline, and the corresponding data for the risk, age at onset and progression of PD from genome-wide association studies. Inverse-variance weighting was used as the primary method for effect estimation. The false discovery rate was applied to the correction of multiple testing. A p value of association <0.05 but above the false discovery rate corrected threshold was deemed suggestive evidence of a possible association. A range of robust Mendelian randomization methods were used for sensitivity analysis.Suggestive evidence was observed of an inverse causal effect of TMAO on motor fluctuations (odds ratio [OR] 0.851, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.731, 0.990, pÂ =Â 0.037) and carnitine on insomnia (OR 0.817, 95% CI 0.700, 0.954, pÂ =Â 0.010) and a positive causal effect of betaine on Hoehn-Yahr stage (OR 1.397, 95% CI 1.112, 1.756, pÂ =Â 0.004), Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) III score (Î²Â =Â 0.138, 95% CI 0.051, 0.225, pÂ =Â 0.002), motor fluctuations (OR 1.236, 95% CI 1.011, 1.511, pÂ =Â 0.039), and choline on UPDRS IV (Î²Â =Â 0.106, 95% CI 0.026, 0.185, pÂ =Â 0.009) and modified Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living Scale score (Î²Â =Â 0.806, 95% CI 0.127, 1.484, pÂ =Â 0.020).Our findings provide suggestive evidence that TMAO and its precursors have a causal effect on the progression of PD.

36750613,Gut microbiota of Parkinson's disease in an appendectomy cohort: a preliminary study.,"In patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), Î±-synuclein pathology is thought to spread to the brain via the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve. The link between the gut microbiome and PD has been explored in various studies. The appendix might play an important role in immunity by maintaining the microbiota as a reservoir. In recent times, appendectomy has been linked to a lower risk of PD, possibly owing to the role of the appendix in altering the gut microbiome. We aimed to elucidate whether the gut microbiota affects PD development in the appendectomy cohort. We analyzed the fecal microbial composition in patients with PD and healthy controls with and without a history of appendectomy. The abundance of microbes from the family Enterobacteriaceae was higher in feces samples from patients with Parkinson's disease compared to that in samples collected from healthy controls. Furthermore, there was a significant phylogenetic difference between patients with PD and healthy controls who had undergone appendectomy. There was a significant phylogenetic difference between patients with PD and HCs who had undergone APP. These results suggest the correlation between gut microbiota and PD in patients who have undergone APP.",Scientific reports,2023,Keiichi Nakahara; Shunya Nakane; Kazuo Ishii; Tokunori Ikeda; Yukio Ando

38127816,Autophagic dysfunction and gut microbiota dysbiosis cause chronic immune activation in a Drosophila model of Gaucher disease.,"Mutations in the GBA1 gene cause the lysosomal storage disorder Gaucher disease (GD) and are the greatest known genetic risk factors for Parkinson's disease (PD). Communication between the gut and brain and immune dysregulation are increasingly being implicated in neurodegenerative disorders such as PD. Here, we show that flies lacking the Gba1b gene, the main fly orthologue of GBA1, display widespread NF-kB signalling activation, including gut inflammation, and brain glial activation. We also demonstrate intestinal autophagic defects, gut dysfunction, and microbiome dysbiosis. Remarkably, modulating the microbiome of Gba1b knockout flies, by raising them under germ-free conditions, partially ameliorates lifespan, locomotor and immune phenotypes. Moreover, we show that modulation of the immune deficiency (IMD) pathway is detrimental to the survival of Gba1 deficient flies. We also reveal that direct stimulation of autophagy by rapamycin treatment achieves similar benefits to germ-free conditions independent of gut bacterial load. Consistent with this, we show that pharmacologically blocking autophagosomal-lysosomal fusion, mimicking the autophagy defects of Gba1 depleted cells, is sufficient to stimulate intestinal immune activation. Overall, our data elucidate a mechanism whereby an altered microbiome, coupled with defects in autophagy, drive chronic activation of NF-kB signaling in a Gba1 loss-of-function model. It also highlights that elimination of the microbiota or stimulation of autophagy to remove immune mediators, rather than prolonged immunosuppression, may represent effective therapeutic avenues for GBA1-associated disorders.",PLoS genetics,2023,Magda L Atilano; Alexander Hull; Catalina-Andreea Romila; Mirjam L Adams; Jacob Wildfire; Enric UreÃ±a; Miranda Dyson; Jorge Ivan-Castillo-Quan; Linda Partridge; Kerri J Kinghorn
37334756,Fibroblast growth factor 21 ameliorates behavior deficits in Parkinson's disease mouse model via modulating gut microbiota and metabolic homeostasis.,"The effects of FGF21 on Parkinson's disease (PD) and its relationship with gut microbiota have not been elucidated. This study aimed to investigate whether FGF21 would attenuate behavioral impairment through microbiota-gut-brain metabolic axis in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) induced PD mice model.Male C57BL/6 mice were rendomized into 3 groups: vehicle (CON); MPTP 30âmg/kg/dayâi.p. injection (MPTP); FGF21 1.5âmg/kg/d i.p. injection plus MPTP 30âmg/kg/dayâi.p. injection (FGF21â+âMPTP). The behavioral features, metabolimics profiling, and 16âs rRNA sequencing were performed after FGF21 treatment for 7âdays.MPTP-induced PD mice showed motor and cognitive deficits accompanied by gut microbiota dysbiosis and brain-region-specific metabolic abnormalities. FGF21 treatment dramatically attenuated motor and cognitive dysfunction in PD mice. FGF21 produced a region-specific alteration in the metabolic profile in the brain in ways indicative of greater ability in neurotransmitter metabolism and choline production. In addition, FGF21 also re-structured the gut microbiota profile and increased the relative abundance of Clostridiales, Ruminococcaceae, and Lachnospiraceae, thereby rescuing the PD-induced metabolic disorders in the colon.These findings indicate that FGF21 could affect behavior and brain metabolic homeostasis in ways that promote a favorable colonic microbiota composition and through effects on the microbiota-gut-brain metabolic axis.",CNS neuroscience & therapeutics,2023,Changwei Yang; Wuqiong Wang; Pengxi Deng; Xinyi Wang; Lin Zhu; Liangcai Zhao; Chen Li; Hongchang Gao
38357211,Gut microbiota and metabolite variations in a migraine mouse model.,"Migraine is a prevalent clinical disorder characterized by recurrent unilateral throbbing headache episodes accompanied by symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia. Despite its common occurrence, the diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment of migraine remain controversial. Extensive research has implicated the gut microbiota in various central nervous system disorders, including anxiety disorders, depression, and Parkinson's disease. Some studies have also suggested that migraine may stem from disruptions to neurohormones and metabolism. This study aimed to investigate the disparities in gut microbiota and metabolites between migraine mice model and normal mice to shed light on the underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutic approaches. Distinct differences in gut microbial composition were observed between the migraine mouse model and normal mouse, indicating a potential correlation between these variations and the pathogenesis of migraine. This study provides evidence of differences in gut microbiota composition and metabolites between a migraine mouse model and normal mice, which showed that Akkermansiaceae constituted the most abundant taxon in the sham injection mouse group, while Lachnospiraceae constituted the most prevalent group in the migraine mouse model group. The associations between the abundances of <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> and Lachnospiraceae bacteria and metabolites suggested their potential roles in the pathogenesis of migraine. The altered abundance of Lachnospiraceae observed in migraine-afflicted mice and its correlations with changes in metabolites suggest that it may affect the host's health. Thus, probiotic therapy emerges as a possible treatment for migraine. Moreover, significant disparities in gut metabolites were observed between the migraine mouse model and normal mice. These alterations encompass multiple metabolic pathways, suggesting that metabolic disturbances may also contribute to the development of migraines.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2023,Dan Wang; Xu Liu; Suming Shi; Tongli Ren; Wuqing Wang

37323145,Therapies for Parkinson's disease and the gut microbiome: evidence for bidirectional connection.,"The gut brain axis (GBA), a bidirectional communication pathway has often been linked to health and disease, and gut microbiota (GM), a key component of this pathway shown to be altered in Parkinson's disease (PD), are suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis of PD. There are few studies that report the impact of oral medication therapy on GM, however, there are even fewer studies that discuss the impact of other treatments such as device assisted therapies (DAT) including deep brain stimulation (DBS), levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel infusion (LCIG) and photobiomodulation (PBM) and how these might impact GM. Here, we review the literature and summarize findings of the potential contributions of GM to the heterogenous clinical response to pharmaceutical therapies among individuals with PD. We also discuss the potential interactions between the GM and DATs such as DBS and LCIG and present evidence for alterations in GM in response to DATs. Given the complexity and highly individual nature of the GM of patients with PD and the potential influence that other external factors such as diet, lifestyle, medications, stage of the disease and other comorbidities, further investigations into the response of GM to therapies are worthy of future study in prospective, controlled trials as well as medication naÃ¯ve individuals. Such detailed studies will help us further comprehend the relationship between GM in PD patients, and will help investigate the potential of targeting GM associated changes as a treatment avenue for PD.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2023,Grace Hey; Navya Nair; Emily Klann; Anjela Gurrala; Delaram Safarpour; Volker Mai; Adolfo Ramirez-Zamora; Vinata Vedam-Mai
37049578,<i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> CCFM405 against Rotenone-Induced Parkinson's Disease Mice via Regulating Gut Microbiota and Branched-Chain Amino Acids Biosynthesis.,"Recent studies have demonstrated that disturbances in the gut microbiota and microbiota -derived metabolites contribute to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), suggesting that probiotic treatments that restore them may delay disease progression. This study aimed to examine the attenuating efficacy of <i>L. plantarum</i> CCFM405 and the potential mechanisms in mice with rotenone-induced PD. Our results indicate that <i>L. plantarum</i> CCFM405 ameliorated rotenone-induced motor deficits and constipation, decreased dopaminergic neuronal death, reduced intestinal inflammation and neuroinflammation, and raised dopamine levels, 5-HT, and associated metabolites in the striatal region of the brain in mice with PD. Sequencing of 16S rRNA from fecal microbiota revealed that <i>L. plantarum</i> CCFM405 normalized the gut bacterial composition in mice with PD, as evidenced by the increased relative abundance of the following genus, <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, <i>Turicibacter</i>, and <i>Faecalibaculum</i>, and decreased relative abundance of <i>Alistipes</i>, <i>Bilophila</i>, <i>Akkermansia</i>, and <i>Escherichia-Shigella</i>. The PICRUSt-predicted gut microbiota function revealed that <i>L. plantarum</i> CCFM405 enhanced the biosynthesis of amino acid pathways, particularly valine, leucine, and isoleucine (branched-chain amino acids, BCAAs). A non-metabolomic analysis of the serum and feces showed that <i>L. plantarum</i> CCFM405 markedly increased the levels of BCAAs. Pathway enrichment analysis based on the KEGG database further suggested that <i>L. plantarum</i> CCFM405 supplementation can promote BCAAs biosynthesis. Collectively, <i>L. plantarum</i> CCFM405 can help to prevent rotenone-induced PD by modulating the gut microbiota-metabolite axis. BCAAs may play a dominant role in <i>L. plantarum</i> CCFM405-associated neuroprotection in PD mice. This probiotic could be utilized as a potential food supplement in the management of PD.",Nutrients,2023,Chuanqi Chu; Leilei Yu; Yiwen Li; Hang Guo; Qixiao Zhai; Wei Chen; Fengwei Tian
36761177,Sodium butyrate ameliorates gut dysfunction and motor deficits in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease by regulating gut microbiota.,"A growing body of evidence showed that gut microbiota dysbiosis might be associated with the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Microbiota-targeted interventions could play a protective role in PD by regulating the gut microbiota-gut-brain axis. Sodium butyrate (NaB) could improve gut microbiota dysbiosis in PD and other neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the potential mechanism associated with the complex interaction between NaB and gut microbiota-gut-brain communication in PD needs further investigation.C57BL/6 mice were subjected to a rotenone-induced PD model and were treated intragastrically with NaB for 4âweeks. The gut function and motor function were evaluated. The Î±-synuclein expression in colon and substantia nigra were detected by western blotting. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons in substantia nigra were measured by immunofluorescence. Moreover, gut microbiota composition was analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing. Fecal short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) levels were determined by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The levels of glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) in tissues and serum were evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).NaB ameliorated gut dysfunction and motor deficits in rotenone-induced mice. Meanwhile, NaB protected against rotenone-induced Î±-synuclein expression in colon and substantia nigra, and prevented the loss of TH-positive neurons. In addition, NaB could remodel gut microbiota composition, and regulate gut SCFAs metabolism, and restore GLP-1 levels in colon, serum, and substantia nigra in PD mice.NaB could ameliorate gut dysfunction and motor deficits in rotenone-induced PD mice, and the mechanism might be associated with the regulation of gut microbiota dysbiosis.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2023,Yi Zhang; Shaoqing Xu; Yiwei Qian; Chengjun Mo; Penghui Ai; Xiaodong Yang; Qin Xiao
37460569,Association of fecal short-chain fatty acids with clinical severity and gut microbiota in essential tremor and its difference from Parkinson's disease.,"Diagnosis of essential tremor (ET) at an early stage can be difficult, especially when distinguishing it from healthy controls (HCs) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Recently, stool sample analysis of gut microbiota and its metabolites provides new ways to detect novel biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), as the main metabolites of gut microbiota, were reduced in the feces of PD. However, fecal SCFAs in ET have never been investigated. We aimed to investigate the fecal SCFA levels in ET, assess their relationships with clinical symptoms and gut microbiota, and identify their potential diagnostic abilities. Fecal SCFAs and gut microbiota in 37 ET, 37 de novo PD and 35 HC were measured. Constipation, autonomic dysfunction and tremor severity were evaluated by scales. ET had lower fecal propionic, butyric and isobutyric acid levels than HC. Combined propionic, butyric and isobutyric acid distinguished ET from HC with an AUC of 0.751 (95% CI: 0.634-0.867). ET had lower fecal isovaleric and isobutyric acid levels than PD. Isovaleric and isobutyric acid differentiated ET from PD with an AUC of 0.743 (95% CI: 0.629-0.857). Fecal propionic acid was negatively correlated with constipation and autonomic dysfunction. Isobutyric and isovaleric acid were negatively associated with tremor severity. Lowered fecal SCFAs were related to a decreased abundance of Faecalibacterium and Catenibacterium in ET. In conclusion, fecal SCFAs were decreased in ET and correlated with clinical severity and gut microbiota changes. Fecal propionic, butyric, isobutyric and isovaleric acid might be potential diagnostic and differential diagnostic biomarkers for ET.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2023,Pei Huang; Pingchen Zhang; Juanjuan Du; Chao Gao; Jin Liu; Yuyan Tan; Shengdi Chen
37754772,The impact of Parkinson's disease-associated gut microbiota on the transcriptome in <i>Drosophila</i>.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease in middle-aged and elderly people, and many studies have confirmed that the disorder of gut microbiota is involved in the pathophysiological process of PD. However, the molecular mechanism of gut microbiota in regulating the pathogenesis of PD is still lacking. In this study, to investigate the impact of PD-associated gut microbiota on host transcriptome, we established various PD models with fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in the model organism <i>Drosophila</i> followed by integrative data analysis of microbiome and transcriptome. We first constructed rotenone-induced PD models in <i>Drosophila</i> followed by FMT in different groups. Microbial analysis by 16S rDNA sequencing showed that gut microbiota from PD <i>Drosophila</i> could affect bacterial structure of normal <i>Drosophila</i>, and gut microbiota from normal <i>Drosophila</i> could affect bacterial structure of PD <i>Drosophila</i>. Transcriptome analysis revealed that PD-associated gut microbiota influenced expression patterns of genes enriched in neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, lysosome, and diverse metabolic pathways. Importantly, to verify our findings, we transplanted <i>Drosophila</i> with fecal samples from clinical PD patients. Compared to the control, <i>Drosophila</i> transplanted with fecal samples from PD patients had reduced microbiota <i>Acetobacter</i> and <i>Lactobacillus</i>, and differentially expressed genes enriched in diverse metabolic pathways. In summary, our results reveal the influence of PD-associated gut microbiota on host gene expression, and this study can help better understand the link between gut microbiota and PD pathogenesis through gut-brain axis. IMPORTANCE Gut microbiota plays important roles in regulating host gene expression and physiology through complex mechanisms.

37863655,Regulation of Pain Perception by Microbiota in Parkinson Disease.,"Pain perception involves current stimulation in peripheral nociceptive nerves and the subsequent stimulation of postsynaptic excitatory neurons in the spinal cord. Importantly, in chronic pain, the neural activity of both peripheral nociceptors and postsynaptic neurons in the central nervous system is influenced by several inflammatory mediators produced by the immune system. Growing evidence has indicated that the commensal microbiota plays an active role in regulating pain perception by either acting directly on nociceptors or indirectly through the modulation of the inflammatory activity on immune cells. This symbiotic relationship is mediated by soluble bacterial mediators or intrinsic structural components of bacteria that act on eukaryotic cells, including neurons, microglia, astrocytes, macrophages, T cells, enterochromaffin cells, and enteric glial cells. The molecular mechanisms involve bacterial molecules that act directly on neurons, affecting their excitability, or indirectly on non-neuronal cells, inducing changes in the production of proinflammatory or anti-inflammatory mediators. Importantly, Parkinson disease, a neurodegenerative and inflammatory disorder that affects mainly the dopaminergic neurons implicated in the control of voluntary movements, involves not only a motor decline but also nonmotor symptomatology, including chronic pain. Of note, several recent studies have shown that Parkinson disease involves a dysbiosis in the composition of the gut microbiota. In this review, we first summarize, integrate, and classify the molecular mechanisms implicated in the microbiota-mediated regulation of chronic pain. Second, we analyze the changes on the commensal microbiota associated to Parkinson disease and propose how these changes affect the development of chronic pain in this pathology. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The microbiota regulates chronic pain through the action of bacterial signals into two main locations: the peripheral nociceptors and the postsynaptic excitatory neurons in the spinal cord. The dysbiosis associated to Parkinson disease reveals increased representation of commensals that potentially exacerbate chronic pain and reduced levels of bacteria with beneficial effects on pain. This review encourages further research to better understand the signals involved in bacteria-bacteria and bacteria-host communication to get the clues for the development of probiotics with therapeutic potential.",Pharmacological reviews,2023,Zulmary Manjarres; Margarita Calvo; Rodrigo Pacheco
35830286,Gut microbiota: a new insight into neurological diseases.,"In the last decade, it has become increasingly recognized that a balanced gut microbiota plays an important role in maintaining the health of the host. Numerous clinical and preclinical studies have shown that changes in gut microbiota composition are associated with a variety of neurological diseases, e.g., Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and myasthenia gravis. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are complex and remain unclear. Behavioral phenotypes can be transmitted from humans to animals through gut microbiota transplantation, indicating that the gut microbiota may be an important regulator of neurological diseases. However, further research is required to determine whether animal-based findings can be extended to humans and to elucidate the relevant potential mechanisms by which the gut microbiota regulates neurological diseases. Such investigations may aid in the development of new microbiota-based strategies for diagnosis and treatment and improve the clinical management of neurological disorders. In this review, we describe the dysbiosis of gut microbiota and the corresponding mechanisms in common neurological diseases, and discuss the potential roles that the intestinal microbiome may play in the diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders.",Chinese medical journal,2023,Lanxiang Liu; Haiyang Wang; Xueyi Chen; Peng Xie
36839287,Neuroprotective Effects of Sodium Butyrate by Restoring Gut Microbiota and Inhibiting TLR4 Signaling in Mice with MPTP-Induced Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent type of neurodegenerative disease. There is mounting evidence that the gut microbiota is involved in the pathogenesis of PD. Sodium butyrate (NaB) can regulate gut microbiota and improve brain functioning in neurological disorders. Hence, we examined whether the neuroprotective function of NaB on PD was mediated by the modulation of gut microbial dysbiosis and revealed its possible mechanisms. Mice were administered 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) for 7 consecutive days to construct the PD model. NaB gavage was given 2 h after the daily MPTP injections for 21 days. NaB improved the motor functioning of PD mice, increased striatal neurotransmitter levels, and reduced the death of dopaminergic neurons. The 16S rRNA sequencing analysis revealed that NaB restored the gut microbial dysbiosis. NaB also attenuated the intestinal barrier's disruption and reduced serum, colon, and striatal pro-inflammatory cytokines, along with inhibiting the overactivation of glial cells, suggesting an inhibitory effect on inflammation from NaB throughout the gut-brain axis of the PD mice. Mechanistic studies revealed that NaB treatment suppressed the TLR4/MyD88/NF-kB pathway in the colon and striatum. In summary, NaB had a neuroprotective impact on the PD mice, likely linked to its regulation of gut microbiota to inhibit gut-brain axis inflammation.",Nutrients,2023,Tong-Tong Guo; Zheng Zhang; Yan Sun; Rui-Yang Zhu; Fei-Xia Wang; Lian-Ju Ma; Lin Jiang; Han-Deng Liu
37418977,Low and high doses of oral maslinic acid protect against Parkinson's disease via distinct gut microbiota-related mechanisms.,"The use of oral agents that can modify the gut microbiota (GM) could be a novel preventative or therapeutic option for Parkinson's disease (PD). Maslinic acid (MA), a pentacyclic triterpene acid with GM-dependent biological activities when it is taken orally, has not yet been reported to be effective against PD. The present study found both low and high dose MA treatment significantly prevented dopaminergic neuronal loss in a classical chronic PD mouse model by ameliorating motor functions and improving tyrosine hydroxylase expressions in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and increasing dopamine and its metabolite homovanillic acid levels in the striatum. However, the effects of MA in PD mice were not dose-responsive, since similar beneficial effects for low and high doses of MA were observed. Further mechanism studies indicated that low dose MA administration favored probiotic bacterial growth in PD mice, which helped to increase striatal serotonin, 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid, and Î³-aminobutyric acid levels. High dose MA treatment did not influence GM composition in PD mice but significantly inhibited neuroinflammation as indicated by reduced levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 1Î² in the SNpc; moreover, these effects were mainly mediated by microbially-derived acetic acid in the colon. In conclusion, oral MA at different doses protected against PD via distinct mechanisms related to GM. Nevertheless, our study lacked in-depth investigations of the underlying mechanisms involved; future studies will be designed to further delineate the signaling pathways involved in the interactive actions between different doses of MA and GM.",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2023,Xu Cao; Zhong-Rui Du; Xin Liu; Xiong Wang; Chong Li; Sai-Nan Zhou; Jia-Rui Liu; Ping-Yi Xu; Jun-Li Ye; Qing Zhao; Fang Zhao; Ka-Hing Wong; Xiao-Li Dong

36901907,What the Gut Tells the Brain-Is There a Link between Microbiota and Huntington's Disease?,"The human intestinal microbiota is a diverse and dynamic microenvironment that forms a complex, bi-directional relationship with the host. The microbiome takes part in the digestion of food and the generation of crucial nutrients such as short chain fatty acids (SCFA), but is also impacts the host's metabolism, immune system, and even brain functions. Due to its indispensable role, microbiota has been implicated in both the maintenance of health and the pathogenesis of many diseases. Dysbiosis in the gut microbiota has already been implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, not much is known about the microbiome composition and its interactions in Huntington's disease (HD). This dominantly heritable, incurable neurodegenerative disease is caused by the expansion of CAG trinucleotide repeats in the huntingtin gene (<i>HTT</i>). As a result, toxic RNA and mutant protein (mHTT), rich in polyglutamine (polyQ), accumulate particularly in the brain, leading to its impaired functions. Interestingly, recent studies indicated that mHTT is also widely expressed in the intestines and could possibly interact with the microbiota, affecting the progression of HD. Several studies have aimed so far to screen the microbiota composition in mouse models of HD and find out whether observed microbiome dysbiosis could affect the functions of the HD brain. This review summarizes ongoing research in the HD field and highlights the essential role of the intestine-brain axis in HD pathogenesis and progression. The review also puts a strong emphasis on indicating microbiome composition as a future target in the urgently needed therapy for this still incurable disease.",International journal of molecular sciences,2023,Dorota Wronka; Anna Karlik; Julia O Misiorek; Lukasz Przybyl
37470081,Effect of <i>Lacticaseibacillus paracasei</i> strain Shirota supplementation on clinical responses and gut microbiome in Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor issues and a range of non-motor symptoms. Microbial therapy may be a useful approach for the treatment of PD. However, comprehensive analyses of the impact of probiotic supplementation on motor and non-motor symptoms are still lacking and the mechanisms whereby the treatment works remain unclear. This study investigated <i>Lacticaseibacillus paracasei</i> strain Shirota (LcS) supplementation on clinical responses, gut microbiota and faecal metabolites in PD patients. Patients (<i>n</i> = 128) were randomised to receive either probiotics (LcS-fermented milk, containing 1 Ã 10<sup>10</sup> living LcS cells) or placebo for 12 weeks. All participants were examined and the basic clinical features were recorded using questionnaires. Fecal and blood samples were collected at the baseline and after 12 weeks for further omics analysis. We found that LcS intervention significantly alleviated patients' constipation-related symptoms and non-motor symptoms. We found no significant shifts in the composition of gut microbiota or faecal metabolites. Several taxa were differentially abundant between the groups, especially with regard to LcS intake, which increased the abundance of the genus <i>Lacticaseibacillus</i> in the probiotic group compared with those at the baseline and in the placebo group. The faecal concentration of L-tyrosine was significantly decreased and the plasma concentration of L-tyrosine was increased in the probiotic group compared with the placebo group. Our study demonstrated that although supplementation with LcS did not induce major changes in the global gut microbiome, the probiotic had favorable effects in managing constipation and other non-motor symptoms in PD patients.

37693045,Neuroprotective effects of an engineered <i>Escherichia coli</i> Nissle 1917 on Parkinson's disease in mice by delivering GLP-1 and modulating gut microbiota.,"Considerable evidence suggests that insulin resistance is closely linked to Parkinson's disease (PD), leading to agents aiming at treating diabetes can be regarded as new neuroprotective strategies in PD, notably glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). However, the extremely short half-life of GLP-1 due to degradation by the ubiquitous proteolytic enzyme limits its clinical application. In this study, we engineered the recombinant integrant probiotic strain <i>Escherichia coli</i> Nissle 1917 (EcN) to create a strain EcN-GLP-1 that effectively delivers the heterologous GLP-1 molecule. Subsequently, we assessed its neuroprotective effects on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mice. We demonstrated that EcN-GLP-1 treatment could improve motor deficits, increase tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons, suppress microglia and astrocyte activation, reduce brain and colon inflammation, and ameliorate colonic barrier function damaged by MPTP induction. Meanwhile, we confirmed that the oral administration of EcN-GLP-1 could restore the disturbance of gut microbiota in the MPTP-induced PD mice, by reducing the relative abundances of <i>Akkermansia</i> and <i>Oscillospira</i>, and increasing the level of <i>Prevotella</i> in the gut.

38098666,Exploring the role of gut microbiota in advancing personalized medicine.,"Ongoing extensive research in the field of gut microbiota (GM) has highlighted the crucial role of gut-dwelling microbes in human health. These microbes possess 100 times more genes than the human genome and offer significant biochemical advantages to the host in nutrient and drug absorption, metabolism, and excretion. It is increasingly clear that GM modulates the efficacy and toxicity of drugs, especially those taken orally. In addition, intra-individual variability of GM has been shown to contribute to drug response biases for certain therapeutics. For instance, the efficacy of cyclophosphamide depends on the presence of <i>Enterococcus hirae</i> and <i>Barnesiella intestinihominis</i> in the host intestine. Conversely, the presence of inappropriate or unwanted gut bacteria can inactivate a drug. For example, dehydroxylase of <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> and <i>Eggerthella lenta</i> A2 can metabolize L-dopa before it converts into the active form (dopamine) and crosses the blood-brain barrier to treat Parkinson's disease patients. Moreover, GM is emerging as a new player in personalized medicine, and various methods are being developed to treat diseases by remodeling patients' GM composition, such as prebiotic and probiotic interventions, microbiota transplants, and the introduction of synthetic GM. This review aims to highlight how the host's GM can improve drug efficacy and discuss how an unwanted bug can cause the inactivation of medicine.",Frontiers in microbiology,2023,Gouxin Huang; Raees Khan; Yilin Zheng; Ping-Chin Lee; Qingnan Li; Imran Khan

37147392,Gastrointestinal disorders in Parkinson's disease and other Lewy body diseases.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is pathologically characterized by the abnormal accumulation of Î±-synuclein fibrils (Lewy bodies) in the substantia nigra and other brain regions, although the role of Lewy bodies remains elusive. Constipation usually precedes the motor symptoms in PD, which is in accordance with the notion that Î±-synuclein fibrils start from the intestinal neural plexus and ascend to the brain in at least half of PD patients. The gut microbiota is likely to be involved in intestinal and brain pathologies. Analyses of the gut microbiota in PD, rapid-eye-movement sleep behavior disorder, and dementia with Lewy bodies suggest three pathological pathways. First, Akkermansia, which is increased in PD, degrades the intestinal mucus layer and increases intestinal permeability, which triggers inflammation and oxidative stress in the intestinal neural plexus. Second, decreased short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producing bacteria in PD reduce the number of regulatory T cells. Third, SCFAs also aggravate microglial activation with an unelucidated pathway. In addition, in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), which is another form of Î±-synucleinopathies, increased genera, Ruminococcus torques and Collinsella, may mitigate neuroinflammation in the substantia nigra by increasing secondary bile acids. Interventions for the gut microbiota and their metabolites may potentially delay or mitigate the development and progression of PD and other Lewy body diseases.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2023,Masaaki Hirayama; Hiroshi Nishiwaki; Tomonari Hamaguchi; Kinji Ohno

We aimed to determine whether gut microbiota is altered in PD patients and whether non-motor symptoms of PD and disease duration had any relation with alterations of microbiota profiles among patients.Microbial taxa in stool samples obtained from 84 subjects (42-PD patients and 42-healthy spouses) were analyzed using 16S rRNA amplicon-sequencing.We observed a significant decrease of Firmicutes and a significant increase of Verrucomicrobiota at the phylum level. At the family level, Lactobacillaceae and Akkermansiaceae were significantly increased and Coriobacteriales Incertae Sedis were significantly decreased in the PD patients compared to their healthy spouses. Genus level comparison inferred significant increase in abundance only in Lactobacillus while the abundance of Lachnospiraceae ND3007 group, Tyzzerella, Fusicatenibacter, Eubacterium hallii group and Ruminococcus gauvreauii group were all decreased. We determined that the abundance of Prevotella genus decreased, but not significantly in PD patients. In addition, we found differences in microbiota composition between patients with and without non-motor symptoms.We observed differences in gut microbiota composition between PD patients and their healthy spouses. Our findings suggest that disease duration influenced microbiota composition, which in turn influenced development of non-motor symptoms in PD.

37047769,Neuroprotective Effects of <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> PS128 in a Mouse Model of Parkinson's Disease: The Role of Gut Microbiota and MicroRNAs.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor deficits and marked neuroinflammation in various brain regions. The pathophysiology of PD is complex and mounting evidence has suggested an association with the dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) and gut dysbiosis. Using a rotenone-induced PD mouse model, we observed that administration of <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> PS128 (PS128) significantly improved motor deficits in PD-like mice, accompanied by an increased level of dopamine, reduced dopaminergic neuron loss, reduced microglial activation, reduced levels of inflammatory factors, and enhanced expression of neurotrophic factor in the brain. Notably, the inflammation-related expression of miR-155-5p was significantly upregulated in the proximal colon, midbrain, and striatum of PD-like mice. PS128 reduced the level of miR-155-5p, whereas it increased the expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1), a direct target of miR-155-5p and a critical inhibitor of the inflammatory response in the brain. Alteration of the fecal microbiota in PD-like mice was partially restored by PS128 administration. Among them, <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, <i>Ruminiclostridium</i>_6, <i>Bacteroides</i>, and <i>Alistipes</i> were statistically correlated with the improvement of rotenone-induced motor deficits and the expression of miR-155-5p and SOCS1. Our findings suggested that PS128 ameliorates motor deficits and exerts neuroprotective effects by regulating the gut microbiota and miR-155-5p/SOCS1 pathway in rotenone-induced PD-like mice.",International journal of molecular sciences,2023,Yan Zhang Lee; Shih-Hsuan Cheng; Min-Yu Chang; Yu-Fen Lin; Chien-Chen Wu; Ying-Chieh Tsai
37897083,Gut microbiota-derived short chain fatty acids act as mediators of the gut-brain axis targeting age-related neurodegenerative disorders: a narrative review.,"Neurodegenerative diseases associated with aging are often accompanied by cognitive decline and gut microbiota disorder. But the impact of gut microbiota on these cognitive disturbances remains incompletely understood. Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are major metabolites produced by gut microbiota during the digestion of dietary fiber, serving as an energy source for gut epithelial cells and/or circulating to other organs, such as the liver and brain, through the bloodstream. SCFAs have been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier and played crucial roles in brain metabolism, with potential implications in mediating Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the underlying mechanisms that SCFAs might influence psychological functioning, including affective and cognitive processes and their neural basis, have not been fully elucidated. Furthermore, the dietary sources which determine these SCFAs production was not thoroughly evaluated yet. This comprehensive review explores the production of SCFAs by gut microbiota, their transportation through the gut-brain axis, and the potential mechanisms by which they influence age-related neurodegenerative disorders. Also, the review discusses the importance of dietary fiber sources and the challenges associated with harnessing dietary-derived SCFAs as promoters of neurological health in elderly individuals. Overall, this study suggests that gut microbiota-derived SCFAs and/or dietary fibers hold promise as potential targets and strategies for addressing age-related neurodegenerative disorders.",Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2023,Bingbing Guo; Jingyi Zhang; Weihao Zhang; Feng Chen; Bin Liu

Current pharmacological treatments have limited efficacy and potential side effects. Acupuncture has shown promise as an alternative or adjunct therapy by modulating the brain-gut axis, gastrointestinal hormones, and autonomic function. Preliminary randomized trials have shown that acupuncture significantly improves constipation symptoms, bowel movements, and comfort compared to sham or drug treatments and is well-tolerated. The mechanisms of action may involve regulating the gut microbiota and mucosal immunity to improve dysbiosis and gastrointestinal motility. However, more rigorous studies are required to optimize acupuncture protocols and determine long-term efficacy and safety. In summary, acupuncture shows promise as an adjunct therapy for PDC, but further research is needed to confirm its efficacy and safety.",Frontiers in neurology,2023,Jiale Zhang; Xiaolei Ge; Kaiqi Zhang; Yun Qi; Shuo Ren; Xu Zhai
37571393,Underlying Mechanisms of Brain Aging and Neurodegenerative Diseases as Potential Targets for Preventive or Therapeutic Strategies Using Phytochemicals.,"During aging, several tissues and biological systems undergo a progressive decline in function, leading to age-associated diseases such as neurodegenerative, inflammatory, metabolic, and cardiovascular diseases and cancer. In this review, we focus on the molecular underpinning of senescence and neurodegeneration related to age-associated brain diseases, in particular, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, along with introducing nutrients or phytochemicals that modulate age-associated molecular dysfunctions, potentially offering preventive or therapeutic benefits. Based on current knowledge, the dysregulation of microglia genes and neuroinflammation, telomere attrition, neuronal stem cell degradation, vascular system dysfunction, reactive oxygen species, loss of chromosome X inactivation in females, and gut microbiome dysbiosis have been seen to play pivotal roles in neurodegeneration in an interactive manner. There are several phytochemicals (e.g., curcumin, EGCG, fucoidan, galangin, astin C, apigenin, resveratrol, phytic acid, acacetin, daucosterol, silibinin, sulforaphane, withaferin A, and betulinic acid) that modulate the dysfunction of one or several key genes (e.g., TREM2, C3, C3aR1, TNFA, NF-kb, TGFB1&2, SIRT1&6, HMGB1, and STING) affected in the aged brain. Although phytochemicals have shown promise in slowing down the progression of age-related brain diseases, more studies to identify their efficacy, alone or in combinations, in preclinical systems can help to design novel nutritional strategies for the management of neurodegenerative diseases in humans.",Nutrients,2023,Hamid Mostafavi Abdolmaleky; Jin-Rong Zhou

37150399,Differences in the gut microbiome across typical ageing and in Parkinson's disease.,"The microbiota-gut-brain axis' role in Parkinson's disease (PD) pathophysiology, and how this differs from typical ageing, is poorly understood. Presently, gut-bacterial diversity, taxonomic abundance and metabolic bacterial pathways were compared across healthy young (nÂ =Â 22, 18-35 years), healthy older (nÂ =Â 33, 50-80 years), and PD groups (nÂ =Â 18, 50-80 years) using shotgun sequencing and compositional data analysis. Associations between the gut-microbiome and PD symptoms, and between lifestyle factors (fibre intake, physical activity, and sleep) and the gut-microbiome were conducted. Alpha-diversity did not differ between PD participants and older adults, whilst beta-diversity differed between these groups. Lower abundance of Butyricimonas synergistica, a butyrate-producer, was associated with worse PD non-motor symptoms in the PD group. Regarding typical ageing, Bifidobacterium bifidum, was greater in the younger compared to older group, with no difference between the older and PD group. Abundance of metabolic pathways related to butyrate production did not differ among the groups, while other metabolic pathways differed among the three groups. Sleep efficiency was positively associated with Roseburia inulinivorans in the older group. These results highlight the relevance of gut-microbiota to PD and that reduced butyrate-production may be involved with PD pathophysiology. Future studies should account for lifestyle factors when investigating gut-microbiomes across ageing and in PD.

38115597,Gut microbiota modification by diosgenin mediates antiepileptic effects in a mouse model of epilepsy.,"Diosgenin, a natural steroid saponin, holds promise as a multitarget therapeutic for various diseases, including neurodegenerative conditions. Its efficacy in slowing Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and stroke progression has been demonstrated. However, the role of diosgenin in anti-epilepsy and its potential connection to the modulation of the intestinal microbiota remain poorly understood. In this study, exogenous diosgenin significantly mitigated pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures, learning and memory deficits, and hippocampal neuronal injury. 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) sequencing revealed a reversal in the decrease of Bacteroides and Parabacteroides genera in the PTZ-induced mouse epileptic model following diosgenin treatment. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiments illustrated the involvement of diosgenin in modulating gut microbiota and providing neuroprotection against epilepsy. Our results further indicated the repression of enteric glial cells (EGCs) activation and the TLR4-MyD88 pathway, coupled with reduced production of inflammatory cytokines in the colonic lumen, and improved intestinal barrier function in epilepsy mice treated with diosgenin or FMT. This study suggests that diosgenin plays a role in modifying gut microbiota, contributing to the alleviation of intestinal inflammation and neuroinflammation, ultimately inhibiting epilepsy progression in a PTZ-induced mouse model.

36278467,Relationship Between Gut Bacteria and Levodopa Metabolism.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, characterized by the reduction of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra. Levodopa, as a dopamine supplement, is the gold-standard therapeutic drug for PD. The metabolism of levodopa in the periphery not only decreases its bioavailability but also affects its efficacy. Thus, it is necessary to investigate how levodopa is metabolized. A growing number of studies have shown that intestinal bacteria, such as Enterococcus faecalis, Eggerthella lenta and Clostridium sporogenes, could metabolize levodopa in different ways. In addition, several pathways to reduce levodopa metabolism by gut microbiota were confirmed to improve levodopa efficacy. These pathways include aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) inhibitors, antibiotics, pH and (S)-Î±-fluoromethyltyrosine (AFMT). In this review, we have summarized the metabolic process of levodopa by intestinal bacteria and analyzed potential approaches to reduce the metabolism of levodopa by gut microbiota, thus improving the efficacy of levodopa.",Current neuropharmacology,2023,Kaifei Xu; Shuo Sheng; Feng Zhang
37191418,Gut Microbiota is an Impact Factor based on the Brain-Gut Axis to Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative disease of the central nervous system. The pathogenesis of AD has been explained using cholinergic, Î²-amyloid toxicity, tau protein hyperphosphorylation, and oxidative stress theories. However, an effective treatment method has not been developed. In recent years, with the discovery of the brain-gut axis (BGA) and breakthroughs made in Parkinson's disease, depression, autism, and other diseases, BGA has become a hotspot in AD research. Several studies have shown that gut microbiota can affect the brain and behavior of patients with AD, especially their cognitive function. Animal models, fecal microbiota transplantation, and probiotic intervention also provide evidence regarding the correlation between gut microbiota and AD. This article discusses the relationship and related mechanisms between gut microbiota and AD based on BGA to provide possible strategies for preventing or alleviating AD symptoms by regulating gut microbiota.",Aging and disease,2023,Bin Zou; Jia Li; Rui-Xia Ma; Xiao-Yu Cheng; Rui-Yin Ma; Ting-Yuan Zhou; Zi-Qi Wu; Yao Yao; Juan Li
38488556,Unraveling the gut-brain axis: the impact of steroid hormones and nutrition on Parkinson's disease.,"This comprehensive review explores the intricate relationship between nutrition, the gut microbiome, steroid hormones, and Parkinson's disease within the context of the gut-brain axis. The gut-brain axis plays a pivotal role in neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease, encompassing diverse components such as the gut microbiota, immune system, metabolism, and neural pathways. The gut microbiome, profoundly influenced by dietary factors, emerges as a key player. Nutrition during the first 1000 days of life shapes the gut microbiota composition, influencing immune responses and impacting both child development and adult health. High-fat, high-sugar diets can disrupt this delicate balance, contributing to inflammation and immune dysfunction. Exploring nutritional strategies, the Mediterranean diet's anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties show promise in reducing Parkinson's disease risk. Microbiome-targeted dietary approaches and the ketogenic diet hold the potential in improving brain disorders. Beyond nutrition, emerging research uncovers potential interactions between steroid hormones, nutrition, and Parkinson's disease. Progesterone, with its anti-inflammatory properties and presence in the nervous system, offers a novel option for Parkinson's disease therapy. Its ability to enhance neuroprotection within the enteric nervous system presents exciting prospects. The review addresses the hypothesis that Î±-synuclein aggregates originate from the gut and may enter the brain via the vagus nerve. Gastrointestinal symptoms preceding motor symptoms support this hypothesis. Dysfunctional gut-brain signaling during gut dysbiosis contributes to inflammation and neurotransmitter imbalances, emphasizing the potential of microbiota-based interventions. In summary, this review uncovers the complex web of interactions between nutrition, the gut microbiome, steroid hormones, and Parkinson's disease within the gut-brain axis framework. Understanding these connections not only offers novel therapeutic insights but also illuminates the origins of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease.",Neural regeneration research,2024,Paula Maria Neufeld; Ralf A Nettersheim; Veronika Matschke; Matthias Vorgerd; Sarah Stahlke; Carsten Theiss

37782386,5-HT4 Receptor is Protective for MPTP-induced Parkinson's Disease Mice Via Altering Gastrointestinal Motility or Gut Microbiota.,"Serotonergic dysfunction is related to both motor and nonmotor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). As a 5-HT receptor, 5-HT4 receptor (5-HT4R) is well-studied and already-used in clinical therapy of constipation, which is a typical non-motor symptom in PD. In this study, we investigated the role of 5-HT4R as a regulator of gut function in MPTP-induced acute PD mice model. Daily intraperitoneal injection of GR 125487 (5-HT4R antagonist) was administered 3 days before MPTP treatment until sacrifice. Seven days post-MPTP treatment, feces were collected and gastrointestinal transit time (GITT) was measured, 8 days post-MPTP treatment, behavioral tests were performed, and then animals were sacrificed for the further analysis. We found GR 125487 pretreatment not only increased GITT, but also aggravated MPTP-induced motor bradykinesia. In addition, GR 125487 pretreatment exacerbated the loss of dopaminergic neurons probably by suppressing JAK2/PKA/CREB signaling pathway and increased reactive glia and neuroinflammation in the striatum. 16Â S rRNA sequencing of fecal microbiota showed that GR 125487 pretreatment altered the composition of gut microbiota, in which the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila and Clostridium clostridioforme was increased, whereas that of Parabacteroides distasonis and Bacteroides fragilis was decreased, which are closely associated with inflammation condition. Taken together, we demonstrated that GR 125487 pretreatment exacerbates MPTP-induced striatal neurodegenerative processes possibly via the JAK2/PKA/CREB pathway and neuroinflammation by altering gut microbiota composition. In the microbiota-gut-brain axis of PD, 5-HT4R should be further explored and might serve as a target for PD diagnosis and treatment.",Journal of neuroimmune pharmacology : the official journal of the Society on NeuroImmune Pharmacology,2023,Chun Cui; Yun Shi; Hui Hong; Yu Zhou; Chenmeng Qiao; Liping Zhao; Xuebing Jia; Weijiang Zhao; Yanqin Shen
36993742,Gut microbiota and fecal short chain fatty acids differ with adiposity and country of origin: The METS-Microbiome Study.,"The relationship between the gut microbiota, short chain fatty acid (SCFA) metabolism, and obesity remains unclear due to conflicting reports from studies with limited statistical power. Additionally, this association has rarely been explored in large scale diverse populations. Here, we investigated associations between fecal microbial composition, predicted metabolic potential, SCFA concentrations, and obesity in a large ( <i>N</i> = 1,934) adult cohort of African-origin spanning the epidemiologic transition, from Ghana, South Africa, Jamaica, Seychelles, and the United States (US). The greatest gut microbiota diversity and total fecal SCFA concentration was found in the Ghanaian population, while the lowest levels were found in the US population, respectively representing the lowest and the highest end of the epidemiologic transition spectrum. Country-specific bacterial taxa and predicted-functional pathways were observed, including an increased prevalence of <i>Prevotella</i> , <i>Butyrivibrio</i> , <i>Weisella</i> and <i>Romboutsia</i> in Ghana and South Africa, while <i>Bacteroides</i> and <i>Parabacteroides</i> were enriched in Jamaican and the US populations. Importantly, 'VANISH' taxa, including <i>Butyricicoccus and Succinivibrio</i> , were significantly enriched in the Ghanaian cohort, reflecting the participants' traditional lifestyles. Obesity was significantly associated with lower SCFA concentrations, a decrease in microbial richness, and dissimilarities in community composition, and reduction in the proportion of SCFA synthesizing bacteria including <i>Oscillospira</i> , <i>Christensenella</i> , <i>Eubacterium</i> , <i>Alistipes</i> , <i>Clostridium</i> and <i>Odoribacter</i> . Further, the predicted proportions of genes in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) synthesis pathway were enriched in obese individuals, while genes associated with butyrate synthesis via the dominant pyruvate pathway were significantly reduced in obese individuals. Using machine learning, we identified features predictive of metabolic state and country of origin. Country of origin could accurately be predicted by the fecal microbiota (AUC = 0.97), whereas obesity could not be predicted as accurately (AUC = 0.65). Participant sex (AUC = 0.75), diabetes status (AUC = 0.63), hypertensive status (AUC = 0.65), and glucose status (AUC = 0.66) could all be predicted with different success. Interestingly, within country, the predictive accuracy of the microbiota for obesity was inversely correlated to the epidemiological transition, being greatest in Ghana (AUC = 0.57). Collectively, our findings reveal profound variation in the gut microbiota, inferred functional pathways, and SCFA synthesis as a function of country of origin. While obesity could be predicted accurately from the microbiota, the variation in accuracy in parallel with the epidemiological transition suggests that differences in the microbiota between obesity and non-obesity may be larger in low-to-middle countries compared to high-income countries. Further examination of independent study populations using multi-omic approaches will be necessary to determine the factors that drive this association.",bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,2023,Gertrude Ecklu-Mensah; Candice Choo-Kang; Maria Gjerstad Maseng; Sonya Donato; Pascal Bovet; Kweku Bedu-Addo; Jacob Plange-Rhule; Terrence E Forrester; Estelle V Lambert; Dale Rae; Amy Luke; Brian T Layden; Stephen O'Keefe; Jack A Gilbert; Lara R Dugas

37978405,Oral pathogens exacerbate Parkinson's disease by promoting Th1 cell infiltration in mice.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common chronic neurological disorder with a high risk of disability and no cure. Periodontitis is an infectious bacterial disease occurring in periodontal supporting tissues. Studies have shown that periodontitis is closely related to PD. However, direct evidence of the effect of periodontitis on PD is lacking. Here, we demonstrated that ligature-induced periodontitis with application of subgingival plaque (LIP-SP) exacerbated motor dysfunction, microglial activation, and dopaminergic neuron loss in 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mice.The 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that LIP-SP induced oral and gut dysbiosis. Particularly, Veillonella parvula (V. parvula) and Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) from oral ligatures were increased in the fecal samples of MPTPâ+âLIP-SP treated mice. We further demonstrated that V. parvula and S. mutans played crucial roles in LIP-SP mediated exacerbation of motor dysfunction and neurodegeneration in PD mice. V. parvula and S. mutans caused microglial activation in the brain, as well as T helper 1 (Th1) cells infiltration in the brain, cervical lymph nodes, ileum and colon in PD mice. Moreover, we observed a protective effect of IFNÎ³ neutralization on dopaminergic neurons in V. parvula- and S. mutans-treated PD mice.Our study demonstrates that oral pathogens V. parvula and S. mutans necessitate the existence of periodontitis to exacerbate motor dysfunction and neurodegeneration in MPTP-induced PD mice. The underlying mechanisms include alterations of oral and gut microbiota, along with immune activation in both brain and peripheral regions.

Neuromodulation encompasses a wide range of stimulation techniques and is used to treat neurological, psychiatric and metabolic disorders, like Parkinson's Disease, depression and obesity.

Seven studies were identified. Neuromodulation was associated with changes in relative bacterial abundances, but not with (changes in) Î±-diversity or Î²-diversity. Summarizing, currently reported findings suggest that neuromodulation interventions are associated with moderate changes in the gut microbiome.

Its high socio-economic impact and difficulties in diagnosis and treatment are of increasing concern to an aging world population. In recent years, the study of the relationship between gut microbiota and different neurocognitive disorders has gained a considerable interest.

37375632,The Impact of a Very-Low-Calorie Ketogenic Diet in the Gut Microbiota Composition in Obesity.,"The very-low-calorie KD (VLCKD) is characterized by a caloric intake of under 800 kcal/day divided into less than 50 g/day of carbohydrate (13%) and 1 to 1.5 g of protein/kg of body weight (44%) and 43% of fat. This low carbohydrate intake changes the energy source from glucose to ketone bodies. Moreover, clinical trials have consistently shown a beneficial effect of VLCKD in several diseases, such as heart failure, schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's, and obesity, among others. The gut microbiota has been associated with the metabolic conditions of a person and is regulated by diet interactions; furthermore, it has been shown that the microbiota has a role in body weight homeostasis by regulating metabolism, appetite, and energy. Currently, there is increasing evidence of an association between gut microbiota dysbiosis and the pathophysiology of obesity. In addition, the molecular pathways, the role of metabolites, and how microbiota modulation could be beneficial remain unclear, and more research is needed. The objective of the present article is to contribute with an overview of the impact that VLCKD has on the intestinal microbiota composition of individuals with obesity through a literature review describing the latest research regarding the topic and highlighting which bacteria phyla are associated with obesity and VLCKD.",Nutrients,2023,Ana Karina Zambrano; Santiago Cadena-Ullauri; Patricia Guevara-RamÃ­rez; Evelyn Frias-Toral; Viviana A Ruiz-Pozo; Elius Paz-Cruz; Rafael Tamayo-Trujillo; SebastiÃ¡n Chapela; Martha MontalvÃ¡n; Gerardo Sarno; Claudia V Guerra; Daniel Simancas-Racines
37674043,Gut microbiota-induced CXCL1 elevation triggers early neuroinflammation in the substantia nigra of Parkinsonian mice.,"Gut microbiota disturbance and systemic inflammation have been implicated in the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD). How the alteration of gut microbiota results in neuropathological events in PD remains elusive. In this study, we explored whether and how environmental insults caused early neuropathological events in the substantia nigra (SN) of a PD mouse model. Aged (12-month-old) mice were orally administered rotenone (6.25âmgÂ·kg<sup>-1</sup>Â·d<sup>-1</sup>) 5 days per week for 2 months. We demonstrated that oral administration of rotenone to ageing mice was sufficient to establish a PD mouse model and that microglial activation and iron deposition selectively appeared in the SN of the mice prior to loss of motor coordination and dopaminergic neurons, and these events could be fully blocked by microglial elimination with a PLX5622-formulated diet. 16âS rDNA sequencing analysis showed that the gut microbiota in rotenone-treated mice was altered, and mice receiving faecal microbial transplantation (FMT) from ageing mice treated with rotenone for 2 months exhibited the same pathology in the SN. We demonstrated that C-X-C motif chemokine ligand-1 (CXCL1) was an essential molecule, as intravenous injection of CXCL1 mimicked almost all the pathology in serum and SN induced by oral rotenone and FMT. Using metabolomics and transcriptomics analyses, we identified the PPAR pathway as a key pathway involved in rotenone-induced neuronal damage. Inhibition of the PPARÎ³ pathway was consistent in the above models, whereas its activation by linoleic acid (60Â mgÂ·kg<sup>-1</sup>Â·d<sup>-1</sup>, i.g. for 1 week) could block these pathological events in mice intravenously injected with CXCL1. Altogether, these results reveal that the altered gut microbiota resulted in neuroinflammation and iron deposition occurring early in the SN of ageing mice with oral administration of rotenone, much earlier than motor symptoms and dopaminergic neuron loss. We found that CXCL1 plays a crucial role in this process, possibly via PPARÎ³ signalling inhibition. This study may pave the way for understanding the ""brain-gut-microbiota"" molecular regulatory networks in PD pathogenesis. The aged C57BL/6 male mice with rotenone intragastric administration showed altered gut microbiota, which caused systemic inflammation, PPARÎ³ signalling inhibition and neuroinflammation, brain iron deposition and ferroptosis, and eventually dopaminergic neurodegeneration in PD.",Acta pharmacologica Sinica,2024,Xi-Zhen Ma; Lei-Lei Chen; Le Qu; Hui Li; Jun Wang; Ning Song; Jun-Xia Xie

Using metabolomics and transcriptomics analyses, we identified the PPAR pathway as a key pathway involved in rotenone-induced neuronal damage. Inhibition of the PPARÎ³ pathway was consistent in the above models, whereas its activation by linoleic acid (60Â mgÂ·kg<sup>-1</sup>Â·d<sup>-1</sup>, i.g. for 1 week) could block these pathological events in mice intravenously injected with CXCL1. Altogether, these results reveal that the altered gut microbiota resulted in neuroinflammation and iron deposition occurring early in the SN of ageing mice with oral administration of rotenone, much earlier than motor symptoms and dopaminergic neuron loss. We found that CXCL1 plays a crucial role in this process, possibly via PPARÎ³ signalling inhibition. This study may pave the way for understanding the ""brain-gut-microbiota"" molecular regulatory networks in PD pathogenesis. The aged C57BL/6 male mice with rotenone intragastric administration showed altered gut microbiota, which caused systemic inflammation, PPARÎ³ signalling inhibition and neuroinflammation, brain iron deposition and ferroptosis, and eventually dopaminergic neurodegeneration in PD.",Acta pharmacologica Sinica,2024,Xi-Zhen Ma; Lei-Lei Chen; Le Qu; Hui Li; Jun Wang; Ning Song; Jun-Xia Xie
37404573,Parkinson's Disease Related Depression and Anxiety: A 22-Year Bibliometric Analysis (2000-2022).,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the common neurodegenerative diseases. Depression and anxiety are the most common psychiatric symptoms of PD. It is important to study the potential relationship between PD and depression or anxiety.This study aimed to use bibliometrics to analyze the papers about parkinson's disease related depression and anxiety over the last 22 years, and to characterize the current status of research and predict future hotspots.In the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) from 2000 to 2022, documents are searched according to specific subject words. The selected literature was retrospectively analyzed and mapped using CiteSpace and Vosviewer software. We analyzed countries, institutions, journals, authors, references and keywords.A total of 7368 papers were included from 2000 to 2022, and the number of publications has shown an upward trend year by year.

37034781,Machine learning based gut microbiota pattern and response to fiber as a diagnostic tool for chronic inflammatory diseases.,"Gut microbiota has been implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple gastrointestinal (GI) and systemic metabolic and inflammatory disorders where disrupted gut microbiota composition and function (dysbiosis) has been found in multiple studies. Thus, human microbiome data has a potential to be a great source of information for the diagnosis and disease characteristics (phenotypes, disease course, therapeutic response) of diseases with dysbiotic microbiota community. However, multiple attempts to leverage gut microbiota taxonomic data for diagnostic and disease characterization have failed due to significant inter-individual variability of microbiota community and overlap of disrupted microbiota communities among multiple diseases. One potential approach is to look at the microbiota community pattern and response to microbiota modifiers like dietary fiber in different disease states. This approach is now feasible by availability of machine learning that is able to identify hidden patterns in the human microbiome and predict diseases. Accordingly, the aim of our study was to test the hypothesis that application of machine learning algorithms can distinguish stool microbiota pattern and microbiota response to fiber between diseases where overlapping dysbiotic microbiota have been previously reported. Here, we have applied machine learning algorithms to distinguish between Parkinson's disease, Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), human immune deficiency virus (HIV), and healthy control (HC) subjects in the presence and absence of fiber treatments. We have shown that machine learning algorithms can classify diseases with accuracy as high as 95%. Furthermore, machine learning methods applied to the microbiome data to predict UC vs CD led to prediction accuracy as high as 90%.",bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,2023,Miad Boodaghidizaji; Thaisa Jungles; Tingting Chen; Bin Zhang; Alan Landay; Ali Keshavarzian; Bruce Hamaker; Arezoo Ardekani
36543925,Helicobacter hepaticus augmentation triggers Dopaminergic degeneration and motor disorders in mice with Parkinson's disease.,"Gut dysbiosis contributes to Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis. Gastrointestinal disturbances in PD patients, along with gut leakage and intestinal inflammation, take place long before motor disorders. However, it remains unknown what bacterial species in gut microbiomes play the key role in driving PD pathogenesis. Here we show that Helicobacter hepaticus (H. hepaticus), abundant in gut microbiota from rotenone-treated human Î±-Synuclein gene (SNCA) transgenic mice and PD patients, initiates Î±-Synuclein pathology and motor deficits in an AEP-dependent manner in SNCA mice. Chronic Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) treatment, an inflammatory inducer in the gut, activates AEP (asparagine endopeptidase) that cleaves Î±-Synuclein N103 and triggers its aggregation, promoting inflammation in the gut and the brain and motor defects in SNCA mice. PD fecal microbiota transplant or live H. hepaticus administration into antibiotics cocktail (Abx)-pretreated SNCA mice induces Î±-Synuclein pathology, inflammation in the gut and brain, and motor dysfunctions, for which AEP is indispensable.

37561259,Compound Dihuang Granule Changes Gut Microbiota of MPTP-Induced Parkinson's Disease Mice via Inhibiting TLR4/NF-ÎºB Signaling.,"Intestinal microbiota was connected to Parkinson's Disease (PD) pathology. The ancient Chinese medication for PD is Compound Dihuang Granule (CDG), and we found a neuroprotective function in treating the constipation of PD patients. Nevertheless, the mechanism of action still needs to be clarified. We predicted the probable targets of CDG against PD through Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) network pharmacology and verified the analysis through animal experiments in vivo. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis screened PD-related genes, including Toll-like receptor 4(TLR4), TANK-binding kinase 1(TBK1), Nuclear Factor- Kappa B (NF-ÎºB), and Tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses proved that the NF-ÎºB and toll-like receptor signaling pathways serve a key function in CDG therapy of PD. Molecular docking analysis demonstrated that CDG strongly connected to TLR4/NF-ÎºB. Experiments findings indicated that CDG improved the damage of dopaminergic neurons and gut microbial dysbiosis, ameliorated motor impairments, and suppressed the PD-associated inflammation and oxidative stress in mice induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahy dropyridine (MPTP). CDG suppressed the inflammatory proteins in the colon and protected the intestinal barrier. Overall, CDG improved gut microbial in PD by blocking the pathway of TLR4/NF-ÎºB.",Neurochemical research,2023,Zhu-Qing He; Peng-Fei Huan; Li Wang; Jian-Cheng He
36805171,The importance of gut-brain axis and use of probiotics as a treatment strategy for multiple sclerosis.,"It has been shown that the dysbiosis of the gut's microbes substantially impacts CNS illnesses, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, autism, and autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is a CNS-affected autoimmune demyelination condition. Through a two-way communication pathway known as the gut-brain axis, gut microbes communicate with the CNS. When there is a disruption in the gut microbiome, cytokines and other immune cells are secreted, which affects the BBB and gastrointestinal permeability. Recent research using animal models has revealed that the gut microbiota may greatly influence the pathophysiology of EAE/MS. Any change in the gut might increase inflammatory cytokinesand affect the quantity of SCFAs, and other metabolites that cause neuroinflammation and demyelination. In- vivo and in-vitro studies have concluded that probiotics affect the immune system and can be utilized to treat gastrointestinal dysbiosis. Any alteration in the gut microbial composition caused by probiotic intake may serve as a preventive and treatment strategy for MS. The major goal of this review is to emphasize an overview of recent research on the function of gut microbiota in the onset of MS and how probiotics have a substantial impact on gastrointestinal disruption in MS and other neuro disorders. It will be easier to develop new therapeutic approaches, particularly probiotic-based supplements, for treating multiple sclerosis (MS) if we know the link between the gut and CNS.",Multiple sclerosis and related disorders,2023,Nitish Kumar; Nalini Kanta Sahoo; Sidharth Mehan; Bharti Verma
37647997,Biomarkers of aging in frailty and age-associated disorders: State of the art and future perspective.,"According to the Geroscience concept that organismal aging and age-associated diseases share the same basic molecular mechanisms, the identification of biomarkers of age that can efficiently classify people as biologically older (or younger) than their chronological (i.e. calendar) age is becoming of paramount importance. These people will be in fact at higher (or lower) risk for many different age-associated diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, neurodegeneration, cancer, etc. In turn, patients suffering from these diseases are biologically older than healthy age-matched individuals. Many biomarkers that correlate with age have been described so far. The aim of the present review is to discuss the usefulness of some of these biomarkers (especially soluble, circulating ones) in order to identify frail patients, possibly before the appearance of clinical symptoms, as well as patients at risk for age-associated diseases. An overview of selected biomarkers will be discussed in this regard, in particular we will focus on biomarkers related to metabolic stress response, inflammation, and cell death (in particular in neurodegeneration), all phenomena connected to inflammaging (chronic, low-grade, age-associated inflammation). In the second part of the review, next-generation markers such as extracellular vesicles and their cargos, epigenetic markers and gut microbiota composition, will be discussed. Since recent progresses in omics techniques have allowed an exponential increase in the production of laboratory data also in the field of biomarkers of age, making it difficult to extract biological meaning from the huge mass of available data, Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches will be discussed as an increasingly important strategy for extracting knowledge from raw data and providing practitioners with actionable information to treat patients.",Ageing research reviews,2023,Stefano Salvioli; Maria Sofia Basile; Leonardo Bencivenga; Sara Carrino; Maria Conte; Sarah Damanti; Rebecca De Lorenzo; Eleonora Fiorenzato; Alessandro Gialluisi; Assunta Ingannato; Angelo Antonini; Nicola Baldini; Miriam Capri; Simone Cenci; Licia Iacoviello; Benedetta Nacmias; Fabiola Olivieri; Giuseppe Rengo; Patrizia Rovere Querini; Fabrizia Lattanzio

37171224,Possible Signaling Pathways in the Gut Microbiota-Brain Axis for the Development of Parkinson's Disease Caused by Chronic Consumption of Food Additives.,"It is well-known that consumption of synthetic and natural food additives has both positive and negative effects in the human body. However, it is not clear yet how food additives are related to the development of Parkinson's disease. Therefore, in this review work, the food additive effects related to the gut microbiota-brain axis and the processes that are carried out to develop Parkinson's disease are studied. To this end, a systematic literature analysis is performed with the selected keywords and the food additive effects are studied to draw possible routes of action. This analysis leads to the proposition of a model that explains the pathways that relate the ingestion of food additives to the development of Parkinson's disease.

37771782,Oral [60]fullerene reduces neuroinflammation to alleviate Parkinson's disease via regulating gut microbiome.,"Neuroinflammation is considered to drive the pathogenic process of neuronal degeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, effective anti-neuroinflammation therapeutics for PD still remain dissatisfactory. Here we explore a robust therapeutic strategy for PD using anti-neuroinflammatory fullerenes. <b>Methods:</b> Oral fullerene was prepared by a ball-milling method. 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse model was used to investigate the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of it. The gut microenvironment was evaluated by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR), and western blot (WB). The neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration were evaluated by pathological analysis, Elisa kits, transmission electron microscopy, Q-PCR, WB and so on. Toxicity was assessed by weight, blood test and hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. <b>Results:</b> Oral fullerene therapeutic system that dissolved [60]fullerene into olive oil (abbreviated as OFO) was dexterously designed, which could reduce neuroinflammation via regulating the diversity of gut microbiome, increasing the contents of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and recovering the integrity of gut barrier. Accordingly, the reduction of neuroinflammation prevented dopaminergic neuronal degeneration. And thus, OFO significantly ameliorated motor deficits and fundamentally reversed dopamine (DA) loss in MPTP-induced PD mice. Of note, OFO exhibited low toxicity towards the living body. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our findings suggest that OFO is a safe-to-use, easy-to-apply, and prospective candidate for PD treatment in clinic, opening a therapeutic window for neuroinflammation-triggered neurodegeneration.",Theranostics,2023,Xue Li; Ruijun Deng; Jie Li; Hui Li; Zhe Xu; Lei Zhang; Linyin Feng; Chunying Shu; Mingming Zhen; Chunru Wang
37630539,Personalized Response of Parkinson's Disease Gut Microbiota to Nootropic Medicinal Herbs In Vitro: A Proof of Concept.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons. Although the etiology of PD remains elusive, it has been hypothesized that initial dysregulation may occur in the gastrointestinal tract and may be accompanied by gut barrier defects. A strong clinical interest in developing therapeutics exists, including for the treatment of gut microbiota and physiology. We previously reported the impact of healthy fecal microbiota anaerobic cultures supplemented with nootropic herbs. Here, we evaluated the effect of nootropic Ayurvedic herbs on fecal microbiota derived from subjects with PD in vitro using 16S rRNA sequencing. The microbiota underwent substantial change in response to each treatment, comparable in magnitude to that observed from healthy subjects. However, the fecal samples derived from each participant displayed unique changes, consistent with a personalized response. We used genome-wide metabolic reconstruction to predict the community's metabolic potential to produce products relevant to PD pathology, including SCFAs, vitamins and amino acid degradation products. These results suggest the potential value of conducting in vitro cultivation and analyses of PD stool samples as a means of prescreening patients to select the medicinal herbs for which that individual is most likely to respond and derive benefit.",Microorganisms,2023,Christine Tara Peterson; Stanislav N Iablokov; Dmitry A Rodionov; Scott N Peterson
37267589,"A Low-Protein, High-Carbohydrate Diet Exerts a Neuroprotective Effect on Mice with 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-Induced Parkinson's Disease by Regulating the Microbiota-Metabolite-Brain Axis and Fibroblast Growth Factor 21.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is closely linked to lifestyle factors, particularly dietary patterns, which have attracted interest as potential disease-modifying factors. Eating a low-protein, high-carbohydrate (LPHC) diet is a promising dietary intervention against brain aging; however, its protective effect on PD remains elusive. Here, we found that an LPHC diet ameliorated 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrathydropyridine (MPTP)-induced motor deficits, decreased dopaminergic neuronal death, and increased the levels of striatal dopamine, serotonin, and their metabolites in PD mice. Levels of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF-21), a member of the fibroblast growth factor family, were elevated in PD mice following LPHC treatment. Furthermore, the administration of FGF-21 exerted a protective effect on MPTP-induced PC12 cells, similar to the effect of an LPHC diet in MPTP-induced mice. Sequencing of the 16S rDNA from fecal microbiota revealed that an LPHC diet normalized the gut bacterial composition imbalance in PD mice, as evidenced by the increased abundance of the genera <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, <i>Ileibacterium</i>, <i>Turicibacter</i>, and <i>Blautia</i> and decreased abundance of <i>Bilophila, Alistipes</i>, and <i>Bacteroides</i>. PICRUSt-predicted fecal microbiome function revealed that an LPHC diet suppressed lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and the citrate cycle (TCA cycle), biosynthesis of ubiquinone and other terpenoid-quinones, and oxidative phosphorylation pathways caused by MPTP, and enhanced the biosynthesis of amino acids, carbohydrate metabolism, and biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites. A nonmetabolomic analysis of the serum and feces showed that an LPHC diet significantly increased the levels of aromatic amino acids (AAAs), including tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine. In addition, an LPHC diet elevated the serum concentrations of bile acids (BAs), particularly tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) and taurine. Collectively, our current findings point to the potential mechanism of administering an LPHC diet in attenuating movement impairments in MPTP-induced PD mice, with AAAs, microbial metabolites (TUDCA and taurine), and FGF-21 as key mediators along the gut-microbiota-brain axis.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2023,Chuanqi Chu; Tiantian Li; Leilei Yu; Yiwen Li; Miaoyu Li; Min Guo; Jianxin Zhao; Qixiao Zhai; Fengwei Tian; Wei Chen
36676436,Latent Potential of Multifunctional Selenium Nanoparticles in Neurological Diseases and Altered Gut Microbiota.,"Neurological diseases remain a major concern due to the high world mortality rate and the absence of appropriate therapies to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Therefore, the major focus is on the development of such strategies that not only enhance the efficacy of drugs but also increase their permeability in the BBB. Currently, nano-scale materials seem to be an appropriate approach to treating neurological diseases based on their drug-loading capacity, reduced toxicity, targeted delivery, and enhanced therapeutic effect. Selenium (Se) is an essential micronutrient and has been of remarkable interest owing to its essential role in the physiological activity of the nervous system, i.e., signal transmission, memory, coordination, and locomotor activity. A deficiency of Se leads to various neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, and Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, owing to the neuroprotective role of Se (selenium) nanoparticles (SeNPs) are of particular interest to treat neurological diseases. To date, many studies investigate the role of altered microbiota with neurological diseases; thus, the current review focused not only on the recent advancement in the field of nanotechnology, considering SeNPs to cure neurological diseases, but also on investigating the potential role of SeNPs in altered microbiota.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,Hajra Ashraf; Davide Cossu; Stefano Ruberto; Marta Noli; Seyedesomaye Jasemi; Elena Rita Simula; Leonardo A Sechi
37458987,Dissecting the Relationship Between Neuropsychiatric and Neurodegenerative Disorders.,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) and neuropsychiatric disorders (NPDs) are two common causes of death in elderly people, which includes progressive neuronal cell death and behavioral changes. NDDs include Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and motor neuron disease, characterized by cognitive defects and memory impairment, whereas NPDs include depression, seizures, migraine headaches, eating disorders, addictions, palsies, major depressive disorders, anxiety, and schizophrenia, characterized by behavioral changes. Mounting evidence demonstrated that NDDs and NPDs share an overlapping mechanism, which includes post-translational modifications, the microbiota-gut-brain axis, and signaling events. Mounting evidence demonstrated that various drug molecules, namely, natural compounds, repurposed drugs, multitarget directed ligands, and RNAs, have been potentially implemented as therapeutic agents against NDDs and NPDs. Herein, we highlighted the overlapping mechanism, the role of anxiety/stress-releasing factors, cytosol-to-nucleus signaling, and the microbiota-gut-brain axis in the pathophysiology of NDDs and NPDs. We summarize the therapeutic application of natural compounds, repurposed drugs, and multitarget-directed ligands as therapeutic agents. Lastly, we briefly described the application of RNA interferences as therapeutic agents in the pathogenesis of NDDs and NPDs. Neurodegenerative diseases and neuropsychiatric diseases both share a common signaling molecule and molecular phenomenon, namely, pro-inflammatory cytokines, Î³CaMKII and MAPK/ERK, chemokine receptors, BBB permeability, and the gut-microbiota-brain axis. Studies have demonstrated that any alterations in the signaling mentioned above molecules and molecular phenomena lead to the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases, namely, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and neuropsychiatric disorders, such as bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, autism spectrum disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder.",Molecular neurobiology,2023,Rohan Gupta; Dia Advani; Divya Yadav; Rashmi K Ambasta; Pravir Kumar
38024855,Protective effects of dioscin against Parkinson's disease via regulating bile acid metabolism through remodeling gut microbiome/GLP-1 signaling.,"It is necessary to explore potent therapeutic agents via regulating gut microbiota and metabolism to combat Parkinson's disease (PD). Dioscin, a bioactive steroidal saponin, shows various activities. However, its effects and mechanisms against PD are limited. In this study, dioscin dramatically alleviated neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, and restored the disorders of mice induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). 16Â S rDNA sequencing assay demonstrated that dioscin reversed MPTP-induced gut dysbiosis to decrease <i>Firmicutes</i>-to-<i>Bacteroidetes</i> ratio and the abundances of <i>Enterococcus</i>, <i>Streptococcus</i>, <i>Bacteroides</i> and <i>Lactobacillus genera</i>, which further inhibited bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity and blocked bile acid (BA) deconjugation. Fecal microbiome transplantation test showed that the <i>anti</i>-PD effect of dioscin was gut microbiota-dependent. In addition, non-targeted fecal metabolomics assays revealed many differential metabolites in adjusting steroid biosynthesis and primary bile acid biosynthesis. Moreover, targeted bile acid metabolomics assay indicated that dioscin increased the levels of ursodeoxycholic acid, tauroursodeoxycholic acid, taurodeoxycholic acid and Î²-muricholic acid in feces and serum. In addition, ursodeoxycholic acid administration markedly improved the protective effects of dioscin against PD in mice. Mechanistic test indicated that dioscin significantly up-regulated the levels of takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R), GLP-1, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and down-regulated NADPH oxidases 2 (NOX2) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-ÎºB) levels. Our data indicated that dioscin ameliorated PD phenotype by restoring gut dysbiosis and regulating bile acid-mediated oxidative stress and neuroinflammation via targeting GLP-1 signal in MPTP-induced PD mice, suggesting that the compound should be considered as a prebiotic agent to treat PD in the future.",Journal of pharmaceutical analysis,2023,Zhang Mao; Haochen Hui; Xuerong Zhao; Lina Xu; Yan Qi; Lianhong Yin; Liping Qu; Lan Han; Jinyong Peng

37460539,Neuroprotective effect of a medium-chain triglyceride ketogenic diet on MPTP-induced Parkinson's disease mice: a combination of transcriptomics and metabolomics in the substantia nigra and fecal microbiome.,"The ketogenic diet (KD) is a low carbohydrate and high-fat protein diet. It plays a protective role in neurodegenerative diseases by elevating the levels of ketone bodies in blood, regulating central and peripheral metabolism and mitochondrial functions, inhibiting neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, and altering the gut microbiota. However, studies on ketogenic therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD) are still in their infancy. Therefore, we examined the possible protective effect of KD in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse model, examined the mouse gut microbiota and its metabolites, and performed transcriptomics and metabolomics on the substantia nigra of mice. Our results showed that a long-term medium-chain triglyceride KD (MCT-KD) significantly reduced MPTP-induced damage to dopaminergic (DA) neurons, exerted antioxidant stress through the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 pathway, and reversed oxidative stress in DA neurons. The MCT-KD also reduced mitochondrial loss, promoted ATP production, and inhibited the activation of microglia to protect DA neurons in MPTP-induced PD mice. MCT-KD altered the gut microbiota and consequently changed the metabolism of substantia nigra neurons through gut microbiota metabolites. Compared to the MPTP group, MCT-KD increased the abundance of gut microbiota, including Blautia and Romboutsia. MCT-KD also affects purine metabolism in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) by altering fecal metabolites. This study shows that MCT-KD has multiple protective effects against PD.",Cell death discovery,2023,Wenlong Zhang; Shiyu Chen; Xingting Huang; Huichun Tong; Hongxin Niu; Lingli Lu
37107583,Role of Microbiota-Modified Bile Acids in the Regulation of Intracellular Organelles and Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Bile acids (BAs) are amphiphilic steroidal molecules generated from cholesterol in the liver and facilitate the digestion and absorption of fat-soluble substances in the gut. Some BAs in the intestine are modified by the gut microbiota. Because BAs are modified in a variety of ways by different types of bacteria present in the gut microbiota, changes in the gut microbiota can affect the metabolism of BAs in the host. Although most BAs absorbed from the gut are transferred to the liver, some are transferred to the systemic circulation. Furthermore, BAs have also been detected in the brain and are thought to migrate into the brain through the systemic circulation. Although BAs are known to affect a variety of physiological functions by acting as ligands for various nuclear and cell-surface receptors, BAs have also been found to act on mitochondria and autophagy in the cell. This review focuses on the BAs modified by the gut microbiota and their roles in intracellular organelles and neurodegenerative diseases.",Genes,2023,Yoshimitsu Kiriyama; Hiromi Nochi
37589449,"Communal interaction of glycation and gut microbes in diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease pathogenesis.","Diabetes and its complications, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD) are increasing gradually, reflecting a global threat vis-Ã -vis expressing the essentiality of a substantial paradigm shift in research and remedial actions. Protein glycation is influenced by several factors, like time, temperature, pH, metal ions, and the half-life of the protein. Surprisingly, most proteins associated with metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders are generally long-lived and hence susceptible to glycation. Remarkably, proteins linked with diabetes, AD, and PD share this characteristic. This modulates protein's structure, aggregation tendency, and toxicity, highlighting renovated attention.

37589449,"Communal interaction of glycation and gut microbes in diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease pathogenesis.","Diabetes and its complications, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD) are increasing gradually, reflecting a global threat vis-Ã -vis expressing the essentiality of a substantial paradigm shift in research and remedial actions. Protein glycation is influenced by several factors, like time, temperature, pH, metal ions, and the half-life of the protein. Surprisingly, most proteins associated with metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders are generally long-lived and hence susceptible to glycation. Remarkably, proteins linked with diabetes, AD, and PD share this characteristic. This modulates protein's structure, aggregation tendency, and toxicity, highlighting renovated attention.

37496895,<i>Acanthopanax senticosus</i> Harms improves Parkinson's disease by regulating gut microbial structure and metabolic disorders.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, with an increasing prevalence as the population ages, posing a serious threat to human health, but the pathogenesis remains uncertain. <i>Acanthopanax senticosus</i> (Rupr. et Maxim.) Harms (ASH) (aqueous ethanol extract), a Chinese herbal medicine, provides obvious and noticeable therapeutic effects on PD. To further investigate the ASH's mechanism of action in treating PD, the structural and functional gut microbiota, as well as intestinal metabolite before and after ASH intervention in the PD mice model, were examined utilizing metagenomics and fecal metabolomics analysis. Î±-syn transgenic mice were randomly divided into a model and ASH groups, with C57BL/6 mice as a control. The ASH group was gavaged with ASH (45.5Â mg/kg/d for 20d). The time of pole climbing and autonomous activity were used to assess motor ability. The gut microbiota's structure, composition, and function were evaluated using Illumina sequencing. Fecal metabolites were identified using UHPLC-MS/MS to construct intestinal metabolites. The findings of this experiment demonstrate that ASH may reduce the climbing time of PD model mice while increasing the number of autonomous movements. The results of metagenomics analysis revealed that ASH could up-regulated <i>Firmicutes</i> and down-regulated <i>Actinobacteria</i> at the phylum level, while <i>Clostridium</i> was up-regulated and <i>Akkermansia</i> was down-regulated at the genus level; it could also recall 49 species from the phylum <i>Firmicutes</i>, <i>Actinobacteria</i>, and <i>Tenericutes</i>. Simultaneously, metabolomics analysis revealed that alpha-Linolenic acid metabolism might be a key metabolic pathway for ASH to impact in PD. Furthermore, metagenomics function analysis and metabolic pathway enrichment analysis revealed that ASH might influence unsaturated fatty acid synthesis and purine metabolism pathways. These metabolic pathways are connected to ALA, Palmitic acid, Adenine, and 16 species of <i>Firmicutes</i>, <i>Actinobacteria</i>, and <i>Tenericutes</i>. Finally, these results indicate that ASH may alleviate the movement disorder of the PD model, which may be connected to the regulation of gut microbiota structure and function as well as the modulation of metabolic disorders by ASH.",Heliyon,2023,Yi Lu; Xin Gao; Yang Nan; Shadi A D Mohammed; Jiaqi Fu; Tianyu Wang; Chongzhi Wang; Chunsu Yuan; Fang Lu; Shumin Liu
38078745,Microbiota-mediated effects of Parkinson's disease medications on Parkinsonian non-motor symptoms in male transgenic mice.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by motor symptoms and a loss of dopaminergic neurons, as well as a variety of non-motor symptoms, including constipation, depression, and anxiety. Recently, evidence has also accumulated for a link between gut microbiota and PD. Most PD patients are on dopamine replacement therapy, primarily a combination of L-DOPA and carbidopa; however, the effect of these medications on the microbiota and non-motor symptoms in PD is still unclear. In this study, we explored the effects of chronic oral treatment with L-DOPA plus carbidopa (LDCD) on the gut microbiota and non-motor symptoms in males of a transgenic mouse model of PD (dbl-PAC-Tg(<i>SNCA</i><sup>A53T</sup>);<i>Snca</i>-/-). To further test whether the effects of these PD medications were mediated by the gut microbiota, oral antibiotic treatment (Abx; vancomycin and neomycin) was included both with and without concurrent LDCD treatment. Post-treatment, the gastrointestinal, motor, and behavioral phenotypes were profiled, and fecal, ileal, and jejunal samples were analyzed for gut microbiota composition by 16S sequencing. LDCD treatment was found to improve symptoms of constipation and depression in this model, concurrent with increases in <i>Turicibacter</i> abundance in the ileum. Abx treatment worsened the symptoms of constipation, possibly through decreased levels of short-chain fatty acids and disrupted gut barrier function. LDCD + Abx treatment showed an interaction effect on behavioral symptoms that was also associated with ileal <i>Turicibacter</i> levels. This study demonstrates that, in a mouse model, PD medications and antibiotics affect PD-related non-motor symptoms potentially <i>via</i> the gut microbiota.IMPORTANCEThe motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) are caused by a loss of dopamine-producing neurons and are commonly treated with dopamine replacement therapy (L-DOPA plus carbidopa).

36803806,Disease mechanisms as subtypes: Microbiome.,"Abnormalities in gut microbiota have been suggested to be involved in the pathophysiology and progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). Gastrointestinal nonmotor symptoms often precede the onset of motor features in PD, suggesting a role for gut dysbiosis in neuroinflammation and Î±-synuclein (Î±-syn) aggregation. In the first part of this chapter, we analyze critical features of healthy gut microbiota and factors (environmental and genetic) that modify its composition. In the second part, we focus on the mechanisms underlying the gut dysbiosis and how it alters anatomically and functionally the mucosal barrier, triggering neuroinflammation and subsequently Î±-syn aggregation. In the third part, we describe the most common alterations in the gut microbiota of PD patients, dividing the gastrointestinal system in higher and lower tract to examine the association between microbiota abnormalities and clinical features. In the final section, we report on current and future therapeutic approaches to gut dysbiosis aiming to either reduce the risk for PD, modify the disease course, or improve the pharmacokinetic profile of dopaminergic therapies. We also suggest that further studies will be needed to clarify the role of the microbiome in PD subtyping and of pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions in modifying specific microbiota profiles in individualizing disease-modifying treatments in PD.",Handbook of clinical neurology,2023,Salvatore Bonvegna; Roberto Cilia
36671785,"Parkinson's Disease, It Takes Guts: The Correlation between Intestinal Microbiome and Cytokine Network with Neurodegeneration.","Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with motor, physical and behavioral symptoms that can have a profound impact on the patient's quality of life. Most cases are idiopathic, and the exact mechanism of the disease's cause is unknown. The current hypothesis focuses on the gut-brain axis and states that gut microbiota dysbiosis can trigger inflammation and advances the development of Parkinson's disease. This systematic review presents the current knowledge of gut microbiota analysis and inflammation based on selected studies on Parkinson's patients and experimental animal models. Changes in gut microbiota correlate with Parkinson's disease, but only a few studies have considered inflammatory modulators as important triggers of the disease. Nevertheless, it is evident that proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines are induced in the gut, the circulation, and the brain before the development of the disease's neurological symptoms and exacerbate the disease. Increased levels of tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1Î², interleukin-6, interleukin-17A and interferon-Î³ can correlate with altered gut microbiota. Instead, treatment of gut dysbiosis is accompanied by reduced levels of inflammatory mediators in specific tissues, such as the colon, brain and serum and/or cerebrospinal fluid. Deciphering the role of the immune responses and the mechanisms of the PD-associated gut microbiota will assist the interpretation of the pathogenesis of Parkinson's and will elucidate appropriate therapeutic strategies.",Biology,2023,Georgia Xiromerisiou; Chrysoula Marogianni; Anastasia Androutsopoulou; Panagiotis Ntavaroukas; Dimitrios Mysiris; Stamatia Papoutsopoulou
38146566,Effectiveness of the Combination of Probiotic Supplementation on Motor Symptoms and Constipation in Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) reflects the second most common neurodegenerative disorder and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Besides the motor features, non-motor symptoms, such as constipation, are very common. There is accumulating evidence that neuroinflammation is associated with the PD pathological processes. Alterations of gut microbiota and microbial metabolites have been linked to the pathogenesis of PD. Previous research has shown that probiotic supplementation has beneficial effects on motor and non-motor symptoms and especially on constipation.In this study, we examine the effectiveness of a combination of probiotic supplementation (butyrate triglyceride 302.86 mg, <i>Crocus sativus L.</i> 30 mg, and vitamin D3 100 mcg), on constipation and motor symptoms in PD.The present study is a retrospective study that examined the existing medical records of patients with diagnosed PD, having chronic constipation and used the probiotic supplementation for its management. A total of 41 existing medical records were screened. Medical records were excluded in the case of participation in another study for PD, suffering from irritable bowel syndrome, organic constipation, long-term laxative use changes in the standard dopaminergic treatment, Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) score<24, hospitalization and antibiotic medication, and diarrheal syndrome. Nine medical records were excluded, and a final number of 32 medical records was finally examined. All 32 patients had evaluations carried out at baseline and three months after supplement administration. A stool diary questionnaire, the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III (UPDRS III), and the Schwab and England and the Hoehn and Yahr scales were used for the evaluation.The median defecation frequency was significantly improved. The supplementation administration significantly improved UPDRS IIIÂ by 7.7% (from 35.72Â±15.51 to 32.97Â±15.71, p = 0.005) at month three, as compared to baseline.Â A positive effect was also seen in the Schwab and England scale. There was no effect on the Hoehn and Yahr scale.The enteric microbiome composition is altered in PD, and there is accumulating evidence that probiotic supplementation could alleviate disease symptoms in neuroinflammatory disorders.",Cureus,2023,Athanasia Alexoudi; Lydia Kesidou; Stylianos Gatzonis; Christos Charalampopoulos; Areti Tsoga
37298727,Zooming into Gut Dysbiosis in Parkinson's Disease: New Insights from Functional Mapping.,"Gut dysbiosis has been involved in the pathogenesis and progression of Parkinson's disease (PD), but the mechanisms through which gut microbiota (GM) exerts its influences deserve further study. Recently, we proposed a two-hit mouse model of PD in which ceftriaxone (CFX)-induced dysbiosis amplifies the neurodegenerative phenotype generated by striatal 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) injection in mice. Low GM diversity and the depletion of key gut colonizers and butyrate producers were the main signatures of GM alteration in this model. Here, we used the phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states (PICRUSt2) to unravel candidate pathways of cell-to-cell communication associated with dual-hit mice and potentially involved in PD progression. We focused our analysis on short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) metabolism and quorum sensing (QS) signaling. Based on linear discriminant analysis, combined with the effect size results, we found increased functions linked to pyruvate utilization and a depletion of acetate and butyrate production in 6-OHDA+CFX mice. The specific arrangement of QS signaling as a possible result of the disrupted GM structure was also observed. With this exploratory study, we suggested a scenario in which SCFAs metabolism and QS signaling might represent the effectors of gut dysbiosis potentially involved in the designation of the functional outcomes that contribute to the exacerbation of the neurodegenerative phenotype in the dual-hit animal model of PD.",International journal of molecular sciences,2023,Luigia Turco; Nicola Opallo; Elisabetta Buommino; Carmen De Caro; Claudio Pirozzi; Giuseppina Mattace Raso; Francesca Lembo; Lorena Coretti
37562163,Effects of a high saturated fatty acid diet on the intestinal microbiota modification and associated impacts on Parkinson's disease development.,"Recent research has focused on the link between diet, intestinal microbiota, and the impact of excessive consumption of saturated fatty acids. Saturated fatty acids, found in animal fats, dairy, and processed foods, contribute to dysbiosis, increase intestinal barrier permeability, chronic low-grade inflammation, oxidative stress, and dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier, affecting the central nervous system. High intake of saturated fatty acids is associated with an increased risk of developing Parkinson's disease (PD). Diets low in saturated fats, rich in fibers, promote microbial diversity, improve gut health, and potentially reduce the risk of neurodegenerative diseases like PD.",Journal of neuroimmunology,2023,Sophia Alexandre de Queiroz Cavalcanti; Leonardo Augusto de Almeida; Juciano Gasparotto
37239020,The Impact of microRNAs on Mitochondrial Function and Immunity: Relevance to Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's Disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, is characterised by the severe loss of dopaminergic neurons in the Substantia Nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and by the presence of Lewy bodies. PD is diagnosed upon the onset of motor symptoms, such as bradykinesia, resting tremor, rigidity, and postural instability. It is currently accepted that motor symptoms are preceded by non-motor features, such as gastrointestinal dysfunction. In fact, it has been proposed that PD might start in the gut and spread to the central nervous system. Growing evidence reports that the gut microbiota, which has been found to be altered in PD patients, influences the function of the central and enteric nervous systems. Altered expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) in PD patients has also been reported, many of which regulate key pathological mechanisms involved in PD pathogenesis, such as mitochondrial dysfunction and immunity. It remains unknown how gut microbiota regulates brain function; however, miRNAs have been highlighted as important players. Remarkably, numerous studies have depicted the ability of miRNAs to modulate and be regulated by the host's gut microbiota. In this review, we summarize the experimental and clinical studies implicating mitochondrial dysfunction and immunity in PD. Moreover, we gather recent data on miRNA involvement in these two processes. Ultimately, we discuss the reciprocal crosstalk between gut microbiota and miRNAs. Studying the bidirectional interaction of gut microbiome-miRNA might elucidate the aetiology and pathogenesis of gut-first PD, which could lead to the application of miRNAs as potential biomarkers or therapeutical targets for PD.",Biomedicines,2023,Beatriz F S Guedes; Sandra Morais Cardoso; Ana Raquel Esteves
37834373,Impact of Microbiome-Brain Communication on Neuroinflammation and Neurodegeneration.,"The gut microbiome plays a pivotal role in maintaining human health, with numerous studies demonstrating that alterations in microbial compositions can significantly affect the development and progression of various immune-mediated diseases affecting both the digestive tract and the central nervous system (CNS). This complex interplay between the microbiota, the gut, and the CNS is referred to as the gut-brain axis. The role of the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases has gained increasing attention in recent years, and evidence suggests that gut dysbiosis may contribute to disease development and progression. Clinical studies have shown alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota in multiple sclerosis patients, with a decrease in beneficial bacteria and an increase in pro-inflammatory bacteria. Furthermore, changes within the microbial community have been linked to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Microbiota-gut-brain communication can impact neurodegenerative diseases through various mechanisms, including the regulation of immune function, the production of microbial metabolites, as well as modulation of host-derived soluble factors. This review describes the current literature on the gut-brain axis and highlights novel communication systems that allow cross-talk between the gut microbiota and the host that might influence the pathogenesis of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.",International journal of molecular sciences,2023,Iris Stolzer; Eveline Scherer; Patrick SÃ¼Ã; Veit Rothhammer; Beate Winner; Markus F Neurath; Claudia GÃ¼nther

37628082,Dietary Polysaccharides Exert Anti-Fatigue Functions via the Gut-Muscle Axis: Advances and Prospectives.,"Due to today's fast-paced lifestyle, most people are in a state of sub-health and face ""unexplained fatigue"", which can seriously affect their health, work efficiency, and quality of life. Fatigue is also a common symptom of several serious diseases such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, cancer, etc. However, the contributing mechanisms are not clear, and there are currently no official recommendations for the treatment of fatigue. Some dietary polysaccharides are often used as health care supplements; these have been reported to have specific anti-fatigue effects, with minor side effects and rich pharmacological activities. Dietary polysaccharides can be activated during food processing or during gastrointestinal transit, exerting unique effects. This review aims to comprehensively summarize and evaluate the latest advances in the biological processes of exercise-induced fatigue, to understand dietary polysaccharides and their possible molecular mechanisms in alleviating exercise-induced fatigue, and to systematically elaborate the roles of gut microbiota and the gut-muscle axis in this process. From the perspective of the gut-muscle axis, investigating the relationship between polysaccharides and fatigue will enhance our understanding of fatigue and may lead to a significant breakthrough regarding the molecular mechanism of fatigue. This paper will provide new perspectives for further research into the use of polysaccharides in food science and food nutrition, which could help develop potential anti-fatigue agents and open up novel therapies for sub-health conditions.","Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,Yaping Zhou; Zhongxing Chu; Yi Luo; Feiyan Yang; Fuliang Cao; Feijun Luo; Qinlu Lin
37747555,Diet-gutÂ microbiome interaction and ferulic acid bioavailability: implications on neurodegenerative disorders.,"Ferulic acid (FA), which occurs naturally as the feruloylated sugar ester in grains, fruits, and vegetables, is critical for combating oxidative stress and alleviating neurodegenerative diseases resulting from free radical-generated protein aggregates in brain cells. However, FA cannot be absorbed in conjugated form. Therefore, strategies to improve the bioavailability of FA are gaining more importance. Ferulic acid esterases (FAE) of the gut microbiota are critical enzymes that facilitate FA release from feruloylated sugar ester conjugates and influence systemic health. This review provides insight into a nutrition-based approach to preventing neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's by altering the diversity of FAE-producing gut microbiota.The human gut is a niche for a highly dense microbial population. Nutrient components and the quality of food shape the gut microbiota. Microbiota-diet-host interaction primarily involves an array of enzymes that hydrolyse complex polysaccharides and release covalently attached moieties, thereby increasing their bio-accessibility. Moreover, genes encoding polysaccharide degrading enzymes are substrate inducible, giving selective microorganisms a competitive advantage in scavenging nutrients.

35091889,Vancomycin Pretreatment on MPTP-Induced Parkinson's Disease Mice Exerts Neuroprotection by Suppressing Inflammation Both in Brain and Gut.,"A growing body of evidence implies that gut microbiota was involved in pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), but the mechanism is still unclear. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of antibiotics pretreatment on the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mice. In this study, vancomycin pretreatment was given by gavage once daily with either vancomycin or distilled water for 14Â days to mice, then mice were administered with MPTP (20Â mg/kg, i.p) for four times in one day to establish an acute PD model. Results show that vancomycin pretreatment significantly improved motor dysfunction of mice in pole and traction tests. Although vancomycinÂ pretreatment had no effect on dopamine (DA) or the process of DA synthesis, it inhibited the metabolism of DA by suppressing the expression of striatal monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B). Furthermore, vancomycin pretreatment reduced the number of astrocytes and microglial cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) to alleviate neuroinflammation, decreased the expression of TLR4/MyD88/NF-ÎºB/TNF-Î± signaling pathway in both brain and gut. Meanwhile, vancomycin pretreatment changed gut microbiome composition and the levels of fecal short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). The abundance of Akkermansia and Blautia increased significantly after vancomycin pretreatment, which might be related to inflammation and inhibition of TLR4 signaling pathway.

35091889,Vancomycin Pretreatment on MPTP-Induced Parkinson's Disease Mice Exerts Neuroprotection by Suppressing Inflammation Both in Brain and Gut.,"A growing body of evidence implies that gut microbiota was involved in pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), but the mechanism is still unclear. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of antibiotics pretreatment on the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mice. In this study, vancomycin pretreatment was given by gavage once daily with either vancomycin or distilled water for 14Â days to mice, then mice were administered with MPTP (20Â mg/kg, i.p) for four times in one day to establish an acute PD model. Results show that vancomycin pretreatment significantly improved motor dysfunction of mice in pole and traction tests. Although vancomycinÂ pretreatment had no effect on dopamine (DA) or the process of DA synthesis, it inhibited the metabolism of DA by suppressing the expression of striatal monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B). Furthermore, vancomycin pretreatment reduced the number of astrocytes and microglial cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) to alleviate neuroinflammation, decreased the expression of TLR4/MyD88/NF-ÎºB/TNF-Î± signaling pathway in both brain and gut. Meanwhile, vancomycin pretreatment changed gut microbiome composition and the levels of fecal short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). The abundance of Akkermansia and Blautia increased significantly after vancomycin pretreatment, which might be related to inflammation and inhibition of TLR4 signaling pathway. In summary, these results demonstrate that the variation of gut microbiota and its metabolites induced by vancomycin pretreatment might decrease dopamine metabolic rate and relieve inflammation in both gut and brain via the microbiota-gut-brain axis in MPTP-induced PD mice. The neuroprotection of vancomycin pretreatment on MPTP-induced Parkinson's disease mice The alterations of gut microbiota and SCFAs induced by vancomycin pretreatment might not only improve motor dysfunction, but also decrease dopamine metabolism and relieve inflammation in both brain and gut via TLR4/MyD88/NF-ÎºB/TNF-Î± pathway in MPTP-induced PD mice.",Journal of neuroimmune pharmacology : the official journal of the Society on NeuroImmune Pharmacology,2023,Chun Cui; Hui Hong; Yun Shi; Yu Zhou; Chen-Meng Qiao; Wei-Jiang Zhao; Li-Ping Zhao; Jian Wu; Wei Quan; Gu-Yu Niu; Yi-Bo Wu; Chao-Sheng Li; Li Cheng; Yan Hong; Yan-Qin Shen

37487923,Metals linked with the most prevalent primary neurodegenerative dementias in the elderly: A narrative review.,"The ageing population has been steadily increasing worldwide, leading to a higher risk of cognitive decline and dementia. Environmental toxicants, particularly metals, have been identified as modifiable risk factors for cognitive impairment. Continuous exposure to metals occurs mainly through dietary sources, with older adults being particularly vulnerable. However, imbalances in the gut microbiota, known as dysbiosis, have also been associated with dementia. A literature review was conducted to explore the potential role of metals in the development of cognitive decline and the most prevalent primary neurodegenerative dementias, as well as their interaction with the gut microbiota. High levels of iron (Fe) and copper (Cu) are associated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), while low selenium (Se) levels are linked to poor cognitive status. Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) is associated with elevated levels of iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and zinc (Zn), but the role of copper (Cu) remains unclear. The relationship between metals and Lewy body dementia (LBD) requires further investigation. High aluminium (Al) exposure is associated with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and elevated selenium (Se) levels may be linked to its onset. Challenges in comparing studies arise from the heterogeneity of metal analysis matrices and analytical techniques, as well as the limitations of small study cohorts. More research is needed to understand the influence of metals on cognition through the gut microbiota (GMB) and its potential relevance in the development of these diseases.",Environmental research,2023,David Mateo; Montse MarquÃ¨s; Margarita Torrente
37851313,Gut-Brain Axis a Key Player to Control Gut Dysbiosis in Neurological Diseases.,"Parkinson's disease is a chronic neuropathy characterised by the formation of Lewy bodies (misfolded alpha-synuclein) in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra and other parts of the brain. Dopaminergic neurons play a vital role in generating both motor and non-motor symptoms. Finding therapeutic targets for Parkinson's disease (PD) is hindered due to an incomplete understanding of the disease's pathophysiology. Existing evidence suggests that the gut microbiota participates in the pathogenesis of PD via immunological, neuroendocrine, and direct neural mechanisms. Gut microbial dysbiosis triggers the loss of dopaminergic neurons via mitochondrial dysfunction. Gut dysbiosis triggers bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine, which increases the permeability barrier and induces systemic inflammation. It results in excessive stimulation of the innate immune system. In addition to that, activation of enteric neurons and enteric glial cells initiates the aggregation of alpha-synuclein. This alpha-synucleinopathy thus affects all levels of the brain-gut axis, including the central, autonomic, and enteric nervous systems. Though the neurobiological signaling cascade between the gut microbiome and the central nervous system is poorly understood, gut microbial metabolites may serve as a promising therapeutic strategy for PD. This article summarises all the known possible ways of bidirectional signal communication, i.e., the ""gut-brain axis,"" where microbes from the middle gut interact with the brain and vice versa, and highlights a unique way to treat neurodegenerative diseases by maintaining homeostasis. The tenth cranial nerve (vagus nerve) plays a significant part in this signal communication. However, the leading regulatory factor for this axis is a diet that helps with microbial colonisation and brain function. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), derived from microbially fermented dietary fibres, link host nutrition to maintain intestinal homeostasis. In addition to that, probiotics modulate cognitive function and the metabolic and behavioural conditions of the body. As technology advances, new techniques will emerge to study the tie-up between gut microbes and neuronal diseases.",Molecular neurobiology,2023,Ieshita Pan; Praveen Kumar Issac; Md Mostafizur Rahman; Ajay Guru; Jesu Arockiaraj

The diverse molecular mechanisms involved in cross-talk between gut and brain provide insight into importance of this communication in maintenance of brain homeostasis. It has also been observed that disturbed gut microbiota contributes to neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and aging. Recently, gut microbiome-derived exosomes have also been reported to play an essential role in the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases and could thereby act as a therapeutic target. Further, pharmacological interventions including antibiotics, prebiotics and probiotics can influence gut microbiome-mediated management of neurological diseases. However, extensive research is warranted to better comprehend this interconnection in maintenance of brain homeostasis and its implication in neurological diseases.

36708421,Gut Microbial Alteration in MPTP Mouse Model of Parkinson Disease is Administration Regimen Dependent.,"Parkinson Disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons involved in motor functions. Growing evidence indicates that gut microbiota communicates with the brain known as the gut-brain axis (GBA). Mitochondrial toxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) is commonly used in animal studies to investigate the GBA in PD. Various MPTP administration regimens are performed in PD mouse models involving one to multiple injections in 1 day or one injection per day for several days. The aim of this study is to investigate if the impact of MPTP on gut microbiota differs depending on the administration regimen. C57BL/6 mice were treated with acute or subchronic regimens of MPTP. Motor functions were assessed by open-field, catalepsy, and wire hanging tests. The cecum and the brain samples were obtained for microbiota and gene expression analyses, respectively. MPTP administration regimens differed in their ability to alter the gut microbiota. Firmicutes and Bacteroidota were both increased in subchronic mice while did not change and decreased, respectively, in acute mice. Verrucomicrobiota was elevated in acute MPTP mice but dropped in subchronic MPTP mice. Muribaculaceae was the predominant genus in all groups but acute mice. In acute mice, Akkermansia was increased and Colidextribacter was decreased; however, they showed an opposite trend in subchronic mice. These data suggest that MPTP mouse model cause a gut microbiota dysbiosis in an administration regimen dependent manner, and it is important to take consideration of mouse model to investigate the GBA in neurodegenerative diseases including PD.",Cellular and molecular neurobiology,2023,Busra Aktas
37481569,Study of the gut microbiome in Egyptian patients with Parkinson's Disease.,"Recently, an important relationship between Parkinson's disease and the gut microbiota, through the brain-gut axis interactions, has been established. Previous studies have declared that alterations in the gut microbiota have a great impact on the pathogenesis and clinical picture of Parkinson's disease (PD). The present study aimed to identify the gut microbiome that is likely related to Parkinson's disease as well as their possible relation to clinical phenotypes.Thirty patients with Parkinson's disease, who presented to the Parkinson's disease Neurology Clinic of Alexandria University Hospital were enrolled in our study. A cross-matching control group of 35 healthy subjects of similar age and sex were included. Stool specimens were taken from each. Quantitative SYBR Green Real-Time PCR was done for the identification and quantitation of selected bacterial phyla, genera and/or species.There was a significant increase in Bacteroides and a significant decrease of Firmicutes and Firmicutes / Bacteroidetes ratio and Bifidobacteria in PD patients. Although Prevotella was decreased among PD patients relative to the healthy control, the difference was not statistically significant. Comparing the PD clinical phenotypes with the control group, the Mixed phenotype had significantly higher Bacteroides, Tremors predominant had lower Firmicutes and Firmicutes / Bacteroidetes ratio, and both tremors and postural instability and gait disability (PIGD) phenotypes had lower Bifidobacteria. However, there was no statistically significant difference between these phenotypes. Furthermore, when comparing tremors and non-tremors predominant phenotypes; Lactobacilli showed a significant decrease in non-tremors predominant phenotypes.The current study showed evidence of changes in the gut microbiome of Parkinson's disease patients compared to the healthy controls. These observations may highlight the importance of the identification of microbiome and specific bacterial changes that can be targeted for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.",BMC microbiology,2023,Mohammad Mehanna; Suzan AbuRaya; Shwikar Mahmoud Ahmed; Ghada Ashmawy; Ahmed Ibrahim; Essameldin AbdelKhaliq
37102320,The protective role of microbiota in the prevention of MPTP/P-induced Parkinson's disease by resveratrol.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a tricky neurodegenerative disease characterized with motor deficits and gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction. Gut microbiota disturbance is reported to be involved in the clinical phenotypes of PD and its pathogenesis through the brain-gut-microbiota axis. Resveratrol is a natural polyphenol that possesses various biological activities in alleviating many diseases, including PD. The present study was aimed to investigate the role of gut microbiota in resveratrol-treated PD mice. A chronic mouse model of PD was generated <i>via</i> the injection of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and probenecid (MPTP/P) for 5 consecutive weeks. Resveratrol was orally administered once a day (30 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>) for a total of 8 weeks. From the 6<sup>th</sup> week to the 8<sup>th</sup> week, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) was performed from resveratrol-treated PD mice to PD mice to evaluate the contribution of resveratrol-shaped microbiota in the alleviation of PD. The results showed that FMT from resveratrol-shaped microbiota remarkably alleviated the mice phenotype from PD progression, including increased latency in the rotarod, shortened beam walking time, increased the number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and enriched TH-positive fiber density in the striatum. Further experiments revealed that FMT could ameliorate the GI dysfunction by increasing the small intestinal transport rate and the colon length, decreasing the relative abundances of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-Î±, IL-6 and IL-1Î²) in colon epithelial tissue. The 16S rDNA sequencing indicated that FMT attenuated the gut microbial dysbiosis in PD mice by increasing the abundances of Prevotellaceae, Rikenellaceae, Erysipelotrichaceae, <i>Blautia</i> and <i>Alistipes</i>, lowering the ratio of Fimicutes/Bacteroidetes, and decreasing the abundances of Lachnospiraceae and <i>Akkermansia</i>. Therefore, results in this study demonstrated that gut microbiota played a vital role in the prevention of PD progression, and the shaping of the gut microbiota was the pharmacological mechanism of resveratrol in alleviating the phenotype of Parkinson's disease in PD mice.",Food & function,2023,Jing Tao; Yunying An; Lingyun Xu; Yuxin Wang; Chaowei Wang; Puze Li; Min Li; Dong Yan; Mingyong Wang; Genshen Zhong; Minna Wu
37968765,Compositional changes in fecal microbiota in a new Parkinson's disease model: C57BL/6-Tg(NSE-haSyn) mice.,"The gut-brain axis (GBA) in Parkinson's disease (PD) has only been investigated in limited mice models despite dysbiosis of the gut microbiota being considered one of the major treatment targets for neurodegenerative disease. Therefore, this study examined the compositional changes of fecal microbiota in novel transgenic (Tg) mice overexpressing human Î±-synuclein (hÎ±Syn) proteins under the neuron-specific enolase (NSE) to analyze the potential as GBA model.The expression level of the Î±Syn proteins was significantly higher in the substantia nigra and striatum of NSE-hÎ±Syn Tg mice than the Non-Tg mice, while those of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) were decreased in the same group. In addition, a decrease of 72.7% in the fall times and a 3.8-fold increase in the fall number was detected in NSE-hÎ±Syn Tg mice. The villus thickness and crypt length on the histological structure of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract decreased in NSE-hÎ±Syn Tg mice. Furthermore, the NSE-hÎ±Syn Tg mice exhibited a significant increase in 11 genera, including Scatolibacter, Clostridium, Feifania, Lachnoclostridium, and Acetatifactor population, and a decrease in only two genera in Ligilactobacillus and Sangeribacter population during enhancement of microbiota richness and diversity.The motor coordination and balance dysfunction of NSE-hÎ±Syn Tg mice may be associated with compositional changes in gut microbiota. In addition, these mice have potential as a GBA model.",Laboratory animal research,2023,Ji Eun Kim; Ki Chun Kwon; You Jeong Jin; Ayun Seol; Hee Jin Song; Yu Jeong Roh; Tae Ryeol Kim; Eun Seo Park; Gi Ho Park; Ji Won Park; Young Suk Jung; Joon Yong Cho; Dae Youn Hwang
37562867,Immunology and microbiome: Implications for motor systems.,"Immune-inflammatory mechanisms seem to play a relevant role in neurodegenerative disorders affecting motor systems, particularly Parkinson's disease, where activity changes in inflammatory cells and evidence of neuroinflammation in experimental models and patients is available. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is also characterized by neuroinflammatory changes that involve primarily glial cells, both microglia and astrocytes, as well as systemic immune dysregulation associated with more rapid progression. Similarly, the exploration of gut dysbiosis in these two prototypical neurodegenerative motor disorders is advancing rapidly. Altered composition of gut microbial constituents and related metabolic and putative functional pathways is supporting a pathophysiological link that is currently explored in preclinical, germ-free animal models. Less compelling, but still intriguing, evidence suggests that motor neurodevelopmental disorders, e.g., Tourette syndrome, are associated with abnormal trajectories of maturation that include also immune system development. Microglia has a key role also in these disorders, and new therapeutic avenues aiming at its modulation are exciting prospects. Preclinical and clinical research on the role of gut dysbiosis in Tourette syndrome and related behavioral disorders is still in its infancy, but early findings support the rationale to delve deeper into its contribution to neural and immune maturation abnormalities in its spectrum.",Handbook of clinical neurology,2023,Yasamin Mahjoub; Davide Martino
37266763,Orally Induced High Serum Level of Trimethylamine N-oxide Worsened Glial Reaction and Neuroinflammation on MPTP-Induced Acute Parkinson's Disease Model Mice.,"Neuroinflammation mediated by brain glial cells is one of the pathological drivers of Parkinson's disease (PD). Recent studies have shown that higher circulating trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO, a gut microbiota-derived metabolite) can induce neuroinflammation and are strongly related to a variety of central nervous system diseases and adverse brain events. Herein, we explored the effect of pre-existing higher circulating TMAO on dopamine system and neuroinflammation in acute PD model mice induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydroxypyridine (MPTP). TMAO pretreatment was given by adding 3% (w/v) TMAO to drinking water of mice for 21Â days to induce higher circulating TMAO status, then mice were administered with MPTP (20Â mg/kg, i.p) for four times in one day to construct an acute PD model mice and treated with TMAO continuously until the end of the experiment. Results demonstrated that TMAO treatment significantly increased serum TMAO levels. Moreover, high serum TMAO significantly increased activation of microglia and astrocytes both in striatum and in substantia nigra. And strikingly, high serum TMAO significantly promoted the metabolism of striatal dopamine (DA) of PD model mice, although it had no significant effect on the number of dopaminergic neurons or the content of DA. Furthermore, immunofluorescence, ELISA, and RT-qPCR results of the hippocampus also showed that high serum TMAO significantly promoted the activation of microglia and astrocytes in the dentate gyrus, increased the levels of TNF-Î± and IL-1Î², and upregulated gene expression of M1 microglia-related markers (including CD16, CD32, and iNOS) and A2 astrocyte-related markers (including S100a10, Ptx3, and Emp1) in mRNA levels. In summary, we found that pre-existing high serum levels of TMAO worsened the PD-related brain pathology by promoting DA metabolism, aggravating neuroinflammation and regulating glial cell polarization.",Molecular neurobiology,2023,Chen-Meng Qiao; Wei Quan; Yu Zhou; Gu-Yu Niu; Hui Hong; Jian Wu; Li-Ping Zhao; Ting Li; Chun Cui; Wei-Jiang Zhao; Yan-Qin Shen
36824263,Effects of levodopa on gut bacterial antibiotic resistance in Parkinson's disease rat.,"The second most prevalent neurodegenerative ailment, Parkinson's disease (PD), is characterized by both motor and non-motor symptoms. Levodopa is the backbone of treatment for PD at the moment. However, levodopa-induced side effects, such as dyskinesia, are commonly seen in PD patients. Recently, several antibiotics were found to present neuroprotective properties against neurodegenerative and neuro-inflammatory processes, which might be developed to effective therapies against PD. In this study, we aimed to identify if levodopa treatment could influence the gut bacterial antibiotic resistance in PD rat. Fecal samples were collected from healthy rats and 6-OHDA induced PD rats treated with different doses of levodopa, metagenomic sequencing data showed that levodopa resulted in gut bacteria composition change, the biomarkers of gut bacteria analyzed by LEfSe changed as well. More interestingly, compared with levodopa (5âmg/kg)-treated or no levodopa-treated PD rats, levodopa (10âmg/kg) caused a significant decrease in the abundance of tetW and vanTG genes in intestinal bacteria, which were related to tetracycline and vancomycin resistance, while the abundance of AAC6-lb-Suzhou gene increased apparently, which was related to aminoglycosides resistance, even though the total quantity of Antibiotic Resistance Gene (ARG) and Antibiotic Resistance Ontology (ARO) among all groups did not significantly differ. Consequently, our results imply that the combination of levodopa and antibiotics, such as tetracycline and vancomycin, in the treatment of PD may decrease the amount of corresponding antibiotic resistance genes in gut bacteria, which would give a theoretical basis for treating PD with levodopa combined with tetracycline and vancomycin in the future.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2023,Shuo Sheng; Xianwei Li; Shuo Zhao; Changqing Zheng; Feng Zhang
38075226,Unveiling the neuroprotective potential of dietary polysaccharides: a systematic review.,"Central nervous system (CNS) disorders present a growing and costly global health challenge, accounting for over 11% of the diseases burden in high-income countries. Despite current treatments, patients often experience persistent symptoms that significantly affect their quality of life. Dietary polysaccharides have garnered attention for their potential as interventions for CNS disorders due to their diverse mechanisms of action, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects. Through an analysis of research articles published between January 5, 2013 and August 30, 2023, encompassing the intervention effects of dietary polysaccharides on Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, depression, anxiety disorders, autism spectrum disorder, epilepsy, and stroke, we have conducted a comprehensive review with the aim of elucidating the role and mechanisms of dietary polysaccharides in various CNS diseases, spanning neurodegenerative, psychiatric, neurodevelopmental disorders, and neurological dysfunctions. At least four categories of mechanistic bases are included in the dietary polysaccharides' intervention against CNS disease, which involves oxidative stress reduction, neuronal production, metabolic regulation, and gut barrier integrity. Notably, the ability of dietary polysaccharides to resist oxidation and modulate gut microbiota not only helps to curb the development of these diseases at an early stage, but also holds promise for the development of novel therapeutic agents for CNS diseases. In conclusion, this comprehensive review strives to advance therapeutic strategies for CNS disorders by elucidating the potential of dietary polysaccharides and advocating interdisciplinary collaboration to propel further research in this realm.",Frontiers in nutrition,2023,Rui Guo; Jingxi Pang; Junhe Zhao; Xiao Xiao; Jing Li; Jingmeng Li; Wenxiu Wang; Shuang Zhou; Yu Zhao; Zilong Zhang; Hongwang Chen; Tian Yuan; Shan Wu; Zhigang Liu

Currently, Medication for PD has numerous limitations. Baichanting Compound (BCT) is a Chinese herbal prescription, a Combination of Acanthopanax senticosus (Rupr. and Maxim.) Harms, Paeonia lactiflora Pall and Uncaria rhynchophylla (Miq.) Miq. ex Havil, that was developed to treat PD and holds a national patent (ZL, 201110260536.3).To clarify the therapeutic effect of BCT on PD and explore its possible mechanism based on metabolomics and metagenomics.C57BL/6 mice were used as a control group, and Î±-syn transgenic C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to the PD (without treatment) or BCT (with BCT treatment) group. UPLC-MS was performed to detect dopamine levels in brain tissue, while ELISA was used to determine inflammatory factors such as IL-1Î², IL-6, TNF-Î±, IFN-Î³ and NO, and oxidative stress indicators such as malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase enzyme activity. Fecal metabolomics was used to detect fecal metabolic profiles, screen differential metabolic markers, and predict metabolic pathways by KEGG enrichment analysis. Metagenomics was used to determine the intestinal microbial composition, and KO enrichment analysis was performed to predict the potential function of different gut microbiota. Finally, Spearman correlation analysis was used to find the possible relationships among intestinal flora, metabolic markers, inflammatory factors, oxidative stress and dopamine levels.BCT increased the superoxide dismutase activity of Î±-Syn transgenic C57BL/6 mice (PÂ <Â 0.01), decreased the levels of TNF-Î±, IFN-Î³, IL-1Î², IL-6, NO and malondialdehyde (PÂ <Â 0.01, 0.05), and increased the release of dopamine (PÂ <Â 0.01). Metabolomics results show that BCT could regulate Acetatifactor, Marvinbryantia, Faecalitalea, Anaeromassilibacillus, Anaerobium, Pseudobutyrivibrio and Lachnotalea and Acetatifactor_muris, Marvinbryantia_formatexigens, Lachnotalea_sp_AF33_28, Faecalitalea_sp_Marseille_P3755 and Anaerobium_acetethylicum, Gemmiger_sp_An120 abundance to restore intestinal flora function, and reverse fecal metabolism trend, restoring the content of Î±-D-glucose, cytidine, L-glutamate, L-glutamine, N-acetyl-L-glutamate, raffinose and uracil.

Miq. ex Havil, on Parkinson's disease based on metagenomics and metabolomics.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is a rapidly progressing neurological disorder. Currently, Medication for PD has numerous limitations. Baichanting Compound (BCT) is a Chinese herbal prescription, a Combination of Acanthopanax senticosus (Rupr. and Maxim.) Harms, Paeonia lactiflora Pall and Uncaria rhynchophylla (Miq.) Miq. ex Havil, that was developed to treat PD and holds a national patent (ZL, 201110260536.3).To clarify the therapeutic effect of BCT on PD and explore its possible mechanism based on metabolomics and metagenomics.C57BL/6 mice were used as a control group, and Î±-syn transgenic C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to the PD (without treatment) or BCT (with BCT treatment) group. UPLC-MS was performed to detect dopamine levels in brain tissue, while ELISA was used to determine inflammatory factors such as IL-1Î², IL-6, TNF-Î±, IFN-Î³ and NO, and oxidative stress indicators such as malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase enzyme activity. Fecal metabolomics was used to detect fecal metabolic profiles, screen differential metabolic markers, and predict metabolic pathways by KEGG enrichment analysis. Metagenomics was used to determine the intestinal microbial composition, and KO enrichment analysis was performed to predict the potential function of different gut microbiota. Finally, Spearman correlation analysis was used to find the possible relationships among intestinal flora, metabolic markers, inflammatory factors, oxidative stress and dopamine levels.BCT increased the superoxide dismutase activity of Î±-Syn transgenic C57BL/6 mice (PÂ <Â 0.01), decreased the levels of TNF-Î±, IFN-Î³, IL-1Î², IL-6, NO and malondialdehyde (PÂ <Â 0.01, 0.05), and increased the release of dopamine (PÂ <Â 0.01). Metabolomics results show that BCT could regulate Acetatifactor, Marvinbryantia, Faecalitalea, Anaeromassilibacillus, Anaerobium, Pseudobutyrivibrio and Lachnotalea and Acetatifactor_muris, Marvinbryantia_formatexigens, Lachnotalea_sp_AF33_28, Faecalitalea_sp_Marseille_P3755 and Anaerobium_acetethylicum, Gemmiger_sp_An120 abundance to restore intestinal flora function, and reverse fecal metabolism trend, restoring the content of Î±-D-glucose, cytidine, L-glutamate, L-glutamine, N-acetyl-L-glutamate, raffinose and uracil.

37110302,Gut Dysbiosis: A Target for Protective Interventions against Parkinson's Disease.,"Sub-chronic inflammation, caused by age-related dysbiosis, primes the brain to neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative diseases. Evidence revealed that Parkinson's disease (PD) might originate in the gut, demonstrating gastro-intestinal disturbances, as reported by PD patients long before developing motor symptoms. In this study, we conducted comparative analyses in relatively young and old mice maintained in conventional or gnotobiotic conditions. We aimed to confirm that the effects induced by age-related dysbiosis, rather than aging itself, sensitize to PD onset. This hypothesis was confirmed in germ-free (GF) mice, which proved resistant to the pharmacological induction of PD, regardless of their age. Contrary to conventional animals, old GF mice did not develop an inflammatory phenotype or an accumulation of iron in the brain, two catalysts sensitizing to disease onset. The resistance of GF mice to PD is reverted when colonized with stool collected from conventional old animals, but not if receiving bacterial content from young mice. Hence, changes in gut microbiota composition are a risk factor for PD development and can be targeted preventively by iron chelators, shown to protect the brain from pro-inflammatory intestinal priming that sensitizes to neuroinflammation and the development of severe PD.",Microorganisms,2023,Illyane S Lima; Ana C PÃªgo; Ana C Martins; Ana R Prada; JoÃ£o TomÃ¡s Barros; Gracelino Martins; Raffaella Gozzelino
37761988,"Age-Related Cognitive Decline, Focus on Microbiome: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.","Aging is a complex process influenced by genetics and the environment, leading to physiological decline and increased susceptibility to diseases. Cognitive decline is a prominent feature of aging, with implications for different neurodegenerative disorders. The gut microbiome has gained attention for its potential impact on health and disease, including cognitive function. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the relationship between the gut microbiome and cognitive function in the context of aging. Following PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive search strategy was employed in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Studies exploring the role of the microbiome in cognition and neurodegenerative disorders, published between 2013 and 2023, were included. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed. Quantitative synthesis using statistical analyses was performed to examine microbial diversity and relative abundance in various cognitive conditions. Sixteen studies involving a total of 1303 participants were included in the analysis. The gut microbiota's relative abundance was different in individuals with cognitive impairments such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and dementia, compared to the healthy controls. The most prevalent phyla affected were Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria. Meta-analyses indicated substantial heterogeneity among studies focusing on Alzheimer's disease. The overall quality of evidence related to microbial analysis was moderate. The gut microbiome's role in cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disorders warrants investigation. Altered microbial abundance, particularly in specific phyla, is associated with cognitive impairments. However, variations in study findings and methodologies highlight the complexity of the relationship between the gut microbiome and cognitive function. Further studies are needed to better understand the mechanisms underlying this connection and its potential implications for aging and cognitive health.",International journal of molecular sciences,2023,Donatella Coradduzza; Stefania Sedda; Sara Cruciani; Maria Rosaria De Miglio; Carlo Ventura; Alessandra Nivoli; Margherita Maioli
37436588,The critical role of gut-brain axis microbiome in mental disorders.,"The Gut-brain axis is a bidirectional neural and humoral signaling that plays an important role in mental disorders and intestinal health and connects them as well. Over the past decades, the gut microbiota has been explored as an important part of the gastrointestinal tract that plays a crucial role in the regulation of most functions of various human organs. The evidence shows several mediators such as short-chain fatty acids, peptides, and neurotransmitters that are produced by the gut may affect the brain's function directly or indirectly. Thus, dysregulation in this microbiome community can give rise to several diseases such as Parkinson's disease, depression, irritable bowel syndrome, and Alzheimer's disease. So, the interactions between the gut and the brain are significantly considered, and also it provides a prominent subject to investigate the causes of some diseases. In this article, we reviewed and focused on the role of the largest and most repetitive bacterial community and their relevance with some diseases that they have mentioned previously.",Metabolic brain disease,2023,Kimia Basiji; Azadeh Aghamohammadi Sendani; Shaghayegh Baradaran Ghavami; Maryam Farmani; Nesa Kazemifard; Amir Sadeghi; Ensieh Lotfali; Hamid Asadzadeh Aghdaei
37199590,Healthy Human Fecal Microbiota Transplantation into Mice Attenuates MPTP-Induced Neurotoxicity via AMPK/SOD2 Pathway.,"Increasing evidence has shown that gut dysbacteriosis may play a crucial role in neuroinflammation in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the specific mechanisms that link gut microbiota to PD remain unexplored. Given the critical roles of blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction and mitochondrial dysfunction in the development of PD, we aimed to evaluate the interactions among the gut microbiota, BBB, and mitochondrial resistance to oxidation and inflammation in PD. We investigated the effects of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) on the physiopathology of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated mice. The aim was to explore the role of fecal microbiota from PD patients and healthy human controls in neuroinflammation, BBB components, and mitochondrial antioxidative capacity via the AMPK/SOD2 pathway. Compared to control mice, MPTP-treated mice exhibited elevated levels of Desulfovibrio, whereas mice given FMT from PD patients exhibited enriched levels of Akkermansia and mice given FMT from healthy humans showed no significant alterations in gut microbiota. Strikingly, FMT from PD patients to MPTP-treated mice significantly aggravated motor impairments, dopaminergic neurodegeneration, nigrostriatal glial activation and colonic inflammation, and inhibited the AMPK/SOD2 signaling pathway. However, FMT from healthy human controls greatly improved the aforementioned MPTP-caused effects. Surprisingly, the MPTP-treated mice displayed a significant loss in nigrostriatal pericytes, which was restored by FMT from healthy human controls. Our findings demonstrate that FMT from healthy human controls can correct gut dysbacteriosis and ameliorate neurodegeneration in the MPTP-induced PD mouse model by suppressing microgliosis and astrogliosis, ameliorating mitochondrial impairments via the AMPK/SOD2 pathway, and restoring the loss of nigrostriatal pericytes and BBB integrity. These findings raise the possibility that the alteration in the human gut microbiota may be a risk factor for PD and provide evidence for potential application of FMT in PD preclinical treatment.",Aging and disease,2023,Zhenchao Xie; Mahui Zhang; Yuqi Luo; Dana Jin; Xingfang Guo; Wanlin Yang; Jialing Zheng; Hongfei Zhang; Lu Zhang; Chao Deng; Wenhua Zheng; Eng-King Tan; Kunlin Jin; Shuzhen Zhu; Qing Wang

37750713,Oh my gut! Is the microbial origin of neurodegenerative diseases real?,"There is no cure or effective treatment for neurodegenerative protein conformational diseases (PCDs), such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's diseases, mainly because the etiology of these diseases remains elusive. Recent data suggest that unique changes in the gut microbial composition are associated with these ailments; however, our current understanding of the bacterial role in the pathogenesis of PCDs is hindered by the complexity of the microbial communities associated with specific microbiomes, such as the gut, oral, or vaginal microbiota. The composition of these specific microbiomes is regarded as a unique fingerprint affected by factors such as infections, diet, lifestyle, and antibiotics. All of these factors also affect the severity of neurodegenerative diseases. The majority of studies that reveal microbial contribution are correlational, and various models, including worm, fly, and mouse, are being utilized to decipher the role of individual microbes that may affect disease onset and progression. Recent evidence from across model organisms and humans shows a positive correlation between the presence of gram-negative enteropathogenic bacteria and the pathogenesis of PCDs. While these correlational studies do not provide a mechanistic explanation, they do reveal contributing bacterial species and provide an important basis for further investigation. One of the lurking concerns related to the microbial contribution to PCDs is the increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance and poor antibiotic stewardship, which ultimately select for proteotoxic bacteria, especially the gram-negative species that are known for intrinsic resistance. In this review, we summarize what is known about individual microbial contribution to PCDs and the potential impact of increasing antimicrobial resistance.",Infection and immunity,2023,Alyssa Walker; Daniel M Czyz
37579888,N-acetyl-L-leucine protects MPTP-treated Parkinson's disease mouse models by suppressing Desulfobacterota via the gut-brain axis.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, and communication between the gut and brain (the gut-brain axis) has been found to be essential in behavior and cognitive function. However, the exact mechanisms underlying microbiota dysbiosis in PD progression have not yet been elucidated. Our study aimed to investigate the correlation between gut microbiota disturbances and feces metabolic disorders in PD. We used 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to induce PD models and observed mice's motor symptoms, dopaminergic (DA) neuron death, and gastrointestinal dysfunction. To identify alterations in microbiota and metabolome, feces were collected from mice and analyzed using 16Â S ribosomal RNA sequencing feces metabolomics. Pearson analysis was utilized to investigate correlations between the abundances of gut microbiota components and the levels of gut microbiota metabolites, displaying their interaction networks. Our findings revealed a significant increase in Desulfobacterota in the PD mouse model and 151 differentially expressed fecal metabolites between PD and vehicle mice. Moreover, Pearson correlation analysis suggested that the protective factor N-acetyl-L-leucine (NALL) may be associated with neuroinflammation in the striatum and substantia nigra, which also had a negative relationship with the concentration of Desulfobacterota. Additionally, we found that oral administration of NALL alleviated MPTP-induced Motor Impairments and DA neuronal deï¬cits. All in all, we concluded that the decrease of NALL might lead to a significant increase of Desulfobacterota in the MPTP model mouse and subsequently result in the damage of DA neurons via the gut-brain aix pathway.",Brain research bulletin,2023,Zhifeng Xu; Changlin Lian; Lixin Pan; Wenjie Lai; Fen Zhang; Lingmei Peng; Sijie Zhou; Guanghua Zhao; Xuezhu Yang; Guohua Zhang; Zefeng Tan; Yukai Wang
36983960,Infectious Microorganisms Seen as Etiologic Agents in Parkinson's Disease.,"Infections represent a possible risk factor for parkinsonism and Parkinson's disease (PD) based on information from epidemiology and fundamental science. The risk is unclear for the majority of agents. Moreover, the latency between infection and PD seems to be very varied and often lengthy. In this review, the evidence supporting the potential involvement of infectious microorganisms in the development of Parkinson's disease is examined. Consequently, it is crucial to determine the cause and give additional treatment accordingly. Infection is an intriguing suggestion regarding the cause of Parkinson's disease. These findings demonstrate that persistent infection with viral and bacterial microorganisms might be a cause of Parkinson's disease. As an initiating factor, infection may generate a spectrum of gut microbiota dysbiosis, engagement of glial tissues, neuroinflammation, and alpha-synuclein accumulation, all of which may trigger and worsen the onset in Parkinson's disease also contribute to its progression. Still uncertain is the primary etiology of PD with infection. The possible pathophysiology of PD infection remains a matter of debate. Furthermore, additional study is required to determine if PD patients develop the disease due to infectious microorganisms or solely since they are more sensitive to infectious causes.","Life (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,Stuparu Alina Zorina; Sanda Jurja; Mihaela Mehedinti; Ana-Maria Stoica; Dana Simona Chita; Stuparu Alexandru Floris; Any Axelerad
37321369,Casein Reactivates Dopaminergic Nerve Injury and Intestinal Inflammation with Disturbing Intestinal Microflora and Fecal Metabolites in a Convalescent Parkinson's Disease Mouse Model.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the fastest-growing neurodegenerative disease, with pathogenic causes elusive and short of effective treatment options. Investigations have found that dairy products positively correlate with the onset of PD, but the mechanisms remain unexplored. As casein is an antigenic component in dairy products, this study assessed if casein could exacerbate PD-related symptoms by stimulating intestinal inflammation and unbalanced intestinal flora and be a risk factor for PD. Using a convalescent PD mouse model induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), the results showed casein reduced motor coordination, caused gastrointestinal dysfunction, reduced dopamine content, and induced intestinal inflammation. Meanwhile, casein disturbed gut microbiota homeostasis by increasing the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, decreasing Î±-diversity, and caused abnormal alterations in fecal metabolites. However, these adverse effects of casein attenuated much when it had hydrolyzed by acid or when antibiotics inhibited the intestinal microbiota of the mice. Therefore, our results suggested that casein could reactivate dopaminergic nerve injury and intestinal inflammation and exacerbate intestinal flora disorder and its metabolites in convalescent PD mice. These damaging effects might be related to disordered protein digestion and gut microbiota in these mice. These findings will provide new insights into the impact of milk/dairy products on PD progression and supply information on dietary options for PD patients.",Neuroscience,2023,Zhengjia Pu; Shuya Liu; Zeming Guo; Xuemei Zhang; Jie Yan; Yong Tang; Hong Xiao; Jieying Gao; Yingli Li; Qunhua Bai
37932328,A novel pathway of levodopa metabolism by commensal Bifidobacteria.,"The gold-standard treatment for Parkinson's disease is levodopa (L-DOPA), which is taken orally and absorbed intestinally. L-DOPA must reach the brain intact to exert its clinical effect; peripheral metabolism by host and microbial enzymes is a clinical management issue. The gut microbiota is altered in PD, with one consistent and unexplained observation being an increase in Bifidobacterium abundance among patients. Recently, certain Bifidobacterium species were shown to have the ability to metabolize L-tyrosine, an L-DOPA structural analog. Using both clinical cohort data and in vitro experimentation, we investigated the potential for commensal Bifidobacteria to metabolize this drug. In PD patients, Bifidobacterium abundance was positively correlated with L-DOPA dose and negatively with serum tyrosine concentration. In vitro experiments revealed that certain species, including B. bifidum, B. breve, and B. longum, were able to metabolize this drug via deamination followed by reduction to the compound 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl lactic acid (DHPLA) using existing tyrosine-metabolising genes. DHPLA appears to be a waste product generated during regeneration of NADâ+. This metabolism occurs at low levels in rich medium, but is significantly upregulated in nutrient-limited minimal medium. Discovery of this novel metabolism of L-DOPA to DHPLA by a common commensal may help inform medication management in PD.",Scientific reports,2023,M S Cirstea; A Creus-Cuadros; C Lo; A C Yu; A Serapio-Palacios; S Neilson; S Appel-Cresswell; B B Finlay
37537902,Neurodevelopmental toxicity induced by PM2.5 Exposure and its possible role in Neurodegenerative and mental disorders.,"Recent extensive evidence suggests that ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5, with an aerodynamic diameter â¤2.5 Î¼m) may be neurotoxic to the brain and cause central nervous system damage, contributing to neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, and mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder. PM2.5 can enter the brain via various pathways, including the blood-brain barrier, olfactory system, and gut-brain axis, leading to adverse effects on the CNS. Studies in humans and animals have revealed that PM2.5-mediated mechanisms, including neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, and gut flora dysbiosis, play a crucial role in CNS damage. Additionally, PM2.5 exposure can induce epigenetic alterations, such as hypomethylation of DNA, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of some CNS damage. Through literature analysis, we suggest that promising therapeutic targets for alleviating PM2.5-induced neurological damage include inhibiting microglia overactivation, regulating gut microbiota with antibiotics, and targeting signaling pathways, such as PKA/CREB/BDNF and WNT/Î²-catenin. Additionally, several studies have observed an association between PM2.5 exposure and epigenetic changes in neuropsychiatric disorders.

Mesenchymal stem-cell-derived microvesicles (MSC-MVs) have emerged as a therapeutic potential for neurological disorders over the last years.The objective of this study was to investigate whether MSC-MVs could improve PD-like neurotoxicity in mice after administration of MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine).MPTP-induced reductions in the dopamine transporter and tyrosine hydroxylase expressions in the striatum and substantia nigra (SNr) were attenuated after a subsequent single administration of MSC-MVs. Increases in the phosphorylated Î±-synuclein (p-Î±-Syn)/Î±-Syn ratio in the striatum, SNr, and colon after MPTP injection were also attenuated after MSC-MVs injection. Furthermore, MSC-MVs restored MPTP-induced abnormalities of the gut microbiota composition. Interestingly, positive correlations between the genus Dubosiella and the p-Î±-Syn/Î±-Syn ratio were observed in the brain and colon, suggesting their roles in the gut-microbiota-brain communication.

Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disease that causes recurrent and unprovoked seizures, and numerous risk factors are implicated in developing epilepsy. Advanced consideration of the gut-microbiota-brain axis can reduce ambiguity about epilepsy pathology, antiepileptic drugs, and effective therapeutic targets. Gut microbiota sequencing analysis reported that the level of Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Fusobacteria, and Firmicutes was increased and the level of Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes was decreased in epilepsy patients. Clinical and preclinical studies also indicated that probiotics, ketogenic diet, faecal microbiota transplantation, and antibiotics can improve gut dysbiosis and alleviate seizure by enhancing the abundance of healthy biota. This study aims to give an overview of the connection between gut microbiota, and epilepsy, how gut microbiome changes may cause epilepsy, and whether gut microbiome restoration could be used as a treatment for epilepsy.",European journal of neurology,2023,Snehashis Kundu; Sudipta Nayak; Debarati Rakshit; Tanveer Singh; Rahul Shukla; Dharmendra Kumar Khatri; Awanish Mishra
37703887,An Overview of Gastrointestinal Dysfunction in Parkinsonian Syndromes.,"Gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction is a common nonmotor symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD) as well as other parkinsonian syndromes and may precede the onset of motor symptoms by decades. Involvement of all segments of the GI tract can lead to altered responses to medications and worsened quality of life for patients. While some GI symptoms occur in isolation, others overlap. Therefore, understanding the changes in different segments of the GI tract and how they relate to altered responses to PD treatment can guide both diagnostic and pharmacological interventions. Gut microbiota plays a critical role in immune activity and modulation of the enteric and central nervous systems. Understanding this bidirectional relationship helps to elucidate the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration. This review will describe the current understanding of how GI dysfunction develops in parkinsonian syndromes, common symptoms in PD and related disorders, and available treatments.",Seminars in neurology,2023,Lauren Talman; Delaram Safarpour

PD is characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms. Non-motor symptoms such as constipation and dysfunction of gastrointestinal tract (GIT) motility together with medications used in the management of PD affect gut microbiota. Alterations of gut microbiota with development of gut dyspiosis can induce momentous changes in gut barrier with subsequent systemic inflammation and induction of neuroinflammation. It has been shown that calprotectin which reflect intestinal inflammation and gut barrier injury are augmented in PD. Therefore, this review aims to elucidate the possible role of gut barrier injury and associated dysbiois in PD neuropathology, and how calprotectin reflects gut barrier injury in PD. Benefit of this review was to elucidate that high fecal calprotectin level in PD patients indicated gut dysbiosis and intestinal inflammation. Early increment of fecal calprotectin indicates the development of gut dysbiosis and/or gut-barrier injury which may precede motor symptoms by decades. Thus, fecal calprotectin could be a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in PD. preclinical and clinical studies are warranted in this regard to emphasize the potential role of fecal calprotectin in PD neuropathology.",Ageing research reviews,2024,Hayder M Al-Kuraishy; Ali I Al-Gareeb; Ayah Talal Zaidalkiani; Athanasios Alexiou; Marios Papadakis; Mostafa M Bahaa; Ammar Al-Faraga; Gaber El-Saber Batiha

At present, engineered microorganisms are attracting increasing attention. In this study, we constructed an engineered strain of <i>Clostridium butyricum</i>-GLP-1, a <i>C. butyricum</i> (a probiotic) that consistently expresses glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1, a peptide-based hormone with neurological advantage) in anticipation of its use in PD treatment. We further investigated the neuroprotective mechanism of <i>C. butyricum</i>-GLP-1 on PD mice models induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. The results indicated that <i>C. butyricum</i>-GLP-1 could improve motor dysfunction and ameliorate neuropathological changes by increasing TH expression and reducing the expression of Î±-syn. Moreover, we confirmed that <i>C. butyricum</i>-GLP-1 improved microbiome imbalance of PD mice by decreasing the relative abundance of <i>Bifidobacterium</i> at the genus level, improved gut integrity, and upregulated the levels of GPR41/43. Surprisingly, we found it could exert its neuroprotective effects via promoting PINK1/Parkin mediated mitophagy and attenuating oxidative stress. Together, our work showed that <i>C. butyricum</i>-GLP-1 improves PD by promoting mitophagy, which provides an alternative therapeutic modality for PD.",Bioengineering & translational medicine,2023,Yun Wang; Wen-Jie Chen; Yi-Yang Han; Xuan Xu; Ai-Xia Yang; Jing Wei; Dao-Jun Hong; Xin Fang; Ting-Tao Chen

37630602,Could the Urease of the Gut Bacterium <i>Proteus mirabilis</i> Play a Role in the Altered Gut-Brain Talk Associated with Parkinson's Disease?,"Intestinal dysbiosis seems to play a role in neurodegenerative pathologies. Parkinson's disease (PD) patients have an altered gut microbiota. Moreover, mice treated orally with the gut microbe <i>Proteus mirabilis</i> developed Parkinson's-like symptoms. Here, the possible involvement of <i>P. mirabilis</i> urease (PMU) and its B subunit (PmUreÎ²) in the pathogenesis of PD was assessed. Purified proteins were given to mice intraperitoneally (20 Î¼g/animal/day) for one week. Behavioral tests were conducted, and brain homogenates of the treated animals were subjected to immunoassays. After treatment with PMU, the levels of TNF-Î± and IL-1Î² were measured in Caco2 cells and cellular permeability was assayed in Hek 293. The proteins were incubated in vitro with Î±-synuclein and examined via transmission electron microscopy. Our results showed that PMU treatment induced depressive-like behavior in mice. No motor deficits were observed. The brain homogenates had an increased content of caspase-9, while the levels of Î±-synuclein and tyrosine hydroxylase decreased. PMU increased the pro-inflammatory cytokines and altered the cellular permeability in cultured cells. The urease, but not the PmUreÎ², altered the morphology of Î±-synuclein aggregates in vitro, forming fragmented aggregates. We concluded that PMU promotes pro-inflammatory effects in cultured cells. In vivo, PMU induces neuroinflammation and a depressive-like phenotype compatible with the first stages of PD development.",Microorganisms,2023,Matheus V C Grahl; Brenda da Silva Andrade; Ana Paula A Perin; Gilda A Neves; Laura de Souza Duarte; Augusto Frantz Uberti; Kelvin Siqueira Hohl; Cristian Follmer; Celia Regina Carlini
37212075,IgA-Biome Profiles Correlate with Clinical Parkinson's Disease Subtypes.,"Parkinson's disease is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder with distinctive gut microbiome patterns suggesting that interventions targeting the gut microbiota may prevent, slow, or reverse disease progression and severity.Because secretory IgA (SIgA) plays a key role in shaping the gut microbiota, characterization of the IgA-Biome of individuals classified into either the akinetic rigid (AR) or tremor dominant (TD) Parkinson's disease clinical subtypes was used to further define taxa unique to these distinct clinical phenotypes.Flow cytometry was used to separate IgA-coated and -uncoated bacteria from stool samples obtained from AR and TD patients followed by amplification and sequencing of the V4 region of the 16âS rDNA gene on the MiSeq platform (Illumina).IgA-Biome analyses identified significant alpha and beta diversity differences between the Parkinson's disease phenotypes and the Firmicutes/Bacteroides ratio was significantly higher in those with TD compared to those with AR. In addition, discriminant taxa analyses identified a more pro-inflammatory bacterial profile in the IgA+ fraction of those with the AR clinical subclass compared to IgA-Biome analyses of those with the TD subclass and with the taxa identified in the unsorted control samples.IgA-Biome analyses underscores the importance of the host immune response in shaping the gut microbiome potentially affecting disease progression and presentation. In the present study, IgA-Biome analyses identified a unique proinflammatory microbial signature in the IgA+ fraction of those with AR that would have otherwise been undetected using conventional microbiome analysis approaches.",Journal of Parkinson's disease,2023,Eric L Brown; Heather T Essigmann; Kristi L Hoffman; Ashley S Alexander; Michael Newmark; Zhi-Dong Jiang; Jessika Suescun; Mya C Schiess; Craig L Hanis; Herbert L DuPont

Accumulating evidence indicated <i>Akkermansia</i> as a promising therapeutic probiotic against metabolic disorders such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. However, in specific intestinal microenvironments, its excessive enrichment may be not beneficial. Conditions like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i> infection or post-antibiotic reconstitution may not benefit from <i>Akkermansia</i> supplementation. Furthermore, using <i>Akkermansia</i> in patients with endocrine and gynecological disorders-such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or endometriosis-that have a higher risk of developing IBD, should be critically evaluated. In addition, a cautionary note comes from the neurological field, as the gut microbiota of patients suffering from Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis exhibits a characteristic signature of <i>Akkermansia municiphila</i> abundance. Overall, considering these controversial points, the use of <i>Akkermansia</i> should be evaluated on an individual basis, avoiding risking unexpected effects.","Life (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,Vito Chiantera; Antonio Simone LaganÃ ; Sabrina Basciani; Maurizio Nordio; Mariano Bizzarri
37827233,TLR2 deficiency is beneficial at the late phase in MPTP-induced Parkinson' disease mice.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. The etiology of PD is still elusive but neuroinflammation is proved to be an important contributor. Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) involves in the release of several inflammatory cytokines. Whether TLR2 serves as a mediator contributing to the damage of DA system in PD remain unclear.Tlr2 knockout (Tlr2<sup>-/-</sup>) and wild-type (WT) mice were treated with a subacute regimen of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). At 3, 7 and 14Â days after MPTP injection, the behavioral performance, including the Pole test, the Rotarod test, the Rearing test and the Wire hang test was evaluated. Moreover, the PD-like phenotypes, including dopaminergic degeneration, the activation of glial cells and the Î±-Syn expression were systematically analyzed in the nigrostriatal pathway. Finally, the composition of gut microbiota in the MPTP-treated groups were assessed.TLR2 deficiency had no obvious impact on the dopaminergic injury at 3 and 7Â days following MPTP administration. On the contrary, at 14Â days post injection, TLR2 deficiency not only significantly attenuated motor deficits in the Pole test and the Rotarod test, and the nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration, but also mitigated Î±-Syn abnormality, astrocyte activation and neuroinflammation through the suppressed TLR2/MyD88/TRAF6/NF-ÎºB signaling pathways. Additionally, the alteration of gut microbiota was also detected in the mutant mice.These findings highlight the neuroprotective effect of TLR2-pathways at the late phase in the MPTP-induced PD mouse model.",Life sciences,2023,Yongtao He; Jiayin Zhao; Hongtian Dong; Xiaoshuang Zhang; Yufei Duan; Yuanyuan Ma; Mei Yu; Jian Fei; Fang Huang

36694359,Elevated serum anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody accompanied by gut mycobiota dysbiosis as a biomarker of diagnosis in patients with de novo Parkinson disease.,"Intestinal inflammation and gut microbiota dysbiosis contribute to Parkinson disease (PD) pathogenesis, and growing evidence suggests associations between inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and PD. Considered as markers of chronic gastrointestinal inflammation, elevated serum anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody (ASCA) levels, against certain gut fungal components, are related to IBD, but their effect on PD is yet to be investigated.Serum ASCA IgG and IgA levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the gut mycobiota communities were investigated using ITS2 sequencing and analyzed using the Qiime pipeline.The study included 393 subjects (148 healthy controls [HCs], 140 with PD, and 105 with essential tremor [ET]). Both serum ASCA IgG and IgA levels were significantly higher in the PD group than in the ET and HC groups. Combining serum ASCA levels and the occurrence of constipation could discriminate patients with PD from controls (area under the curve [AUC]Â =Â 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] =â0.76-0.86) and from patients with ET (AUCÂ =Â 0.85, 95% CIÂ =Â 0.79-0.89). Furthermore, the composition of the gut fungal community differed between the PD and HC groups. The relative abundances of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Aspergillus, Candida solani, Aspergillus flavus, ASV601_Fungi, ASV866_Fungi, and ASV755_Fungi were significantly higher in the PD group, and enriched Malassezia restricta was found in the HC group.Our study identified elevated serum ASCA levels and enriched gut Saccharomyces cerevisiae in de novo PD.",European journal of neurology,2023,Ying Chen; Li-Ying Zhang; Yi Fang; Chuan Li; Dan-Dan Xia; Gong Zhang; Yi Wen; Song-Zhao Zhang; Liu Hu; Lu-Yan Gu; Yi Liu; Jun Tian; Ya-Ping Yan; Xin-Zhen Yin; Zhi-Hua Tao; Bao-Rong Zhang; Jia-Li Pu
37239262,Trimethylamine N-Oxide Exacerbates Neuroinflammation and Motor Dysfunction in an Acute MPTP Mice Model of Parkinson's Disease.,"Observational studies have shown abnormal changes in trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) levels in the peripheral circulatory system of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. TMAO is a gut microbiota metabolite that can cross the blood-brain barrier and is strongly related to neuroinflammation. Neuroinflammation is one of the pathological drivers of PD. Herein, we investigated the effect of TMAO on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD model mice. TMAO pretreatment was given by adding 1.5% (<i>w</i>/<i>v</i>) TMAO to the drinking water of the mice for 21 days; then, the mice were administered MPTP (20 mg/kg, i.p.) four times a day to construct an acute PD model. Their serum TMAO concentrations, motor function, dopaminergic network integrity, and neuroinflammation were then assayed. The results showed that TMAO partly aggravated the motor dysfunction of the PD mice. Although TMAO had no effect on the dopaminergic neurons, TH protein content, and striatal DA level in the PD mice, it significantly reduced the striatal 5-HT levels and aggravated the metabolism of DA and 5-HT. Meanwhile, TMAO significantly activated glial cells in the striatum and the hippocampi of the PD mice and promoted the release of inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus. In summary, higher-circulating TMAO had adverse effects on the motor capacity, striatum neurotransmitters, and striatal and hippocampal neuroinflammation in PD mice.",Brain sciences,2023,Wei Quan; Chen-Meng Qiao; Gu-Yu Niu; Jian Wu; Li-Ping Zhao; Chun Cui; Wei-Jiang Zhao; Yan-Qin Shen

Neuropeptide-binding immunoglobulins (Igs) are present in humans and can be involved in both physiological and pathological processes. Considering the functional link between NTS and dopamine neurons, we studied the occurrence of NTS-binding IgG autoantibodies in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).Plasma levels of NTS-binding IgG were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in both male and female PD patents and in age-matched healthy controls. Possible microbial origin of NTS cross-reactive IgG was analyzed by sequence alignment of the 6-amino acid C-terminal NTS pharmacophore with bacterial and viral proteins from the public NCBI database.NTS-binding IgG were detected in the plasma of all study subjects, while their levels were consistently lower in PD patients versus controls (p = 0.0001), independently from age or sex of the study participants. Moreover, PD patients with a more severe stage (2.5-3.0) of the disease had lower levels of NTS-binding IgG (p = 0.0004) than those with a milder stage (1.0-2.0). Furthermore, PD patients taking amantadine or high doses of levodopa had higher levels of NTS-binding IgG than those without medication.

Polyphenols have diverse biological activities, such as anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and Î±-synuclein aggregation inhibitory effects, which could ameliorate PD pathogenesis. Studies have shown that polyphenols are capable of regulating the gut microbiota (GM) and its metabolites; in turn, polyphenols are extensively metabolized by the GM, resulting in the generation of bioactive secondary metabolites. These metabolites may regulate various physiological processes, including inflammatory responses, energy metabolism, intercellular communication, and host immunity.

37158925,"The PROB-PD trial: a pilot, randomised, placebo-controlled study protocol to evaluate the feasibility and potential efficacy of probiotics in modulating peripheral immunity in subjects with Parkinson's disease.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease. No disease-modifying treatment is available, and therapy is symptomatic. The histopathologic hallmark is the loss of dopaminergic neurons and accumulation of Î±-synuclein (Î±-syn) in surviving neurons, but the underlying pathophysiology is unclear. Inflammatory mechanisms seem to play a prominent role, with an imbalance of immune functions and neurotoxicity caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Involvement of peripheral adaptive immunity, with an imbalance in T cell subpopulations and in the expression of transcriptional factors in CD4+ T cells, has also been reported. Although clinical presentation is defined by motor symptoms, patients also report non-motor symptoms, often before the onset of a clinically established disease. Etiopathogenesis of PD is unknown, but an initial aggregation of Î±-syn in the gut, with subsequent propagation along the vagus nerve to the brain has been hypothesised. Interestingly, in an Î±-syn overexpressing murine model, the absence of gut microbiota prevented both microglia activation and motor impairment, thus pointing to a fundamental role of microbiota in the development of PD. Magistrelli et al. showed that in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of PD patients, probiotics modulate the in vitro production of cytokines toward an anti-inflammatory profile and reduce the production of ROS.This is a pilot randomised placebo-controlled clinical trial protocol for a 12-week treatment with probiotics. At least 80 patients affected by PD will be recruited and randomly allocated to either the treatment or placebo group in a 1:1 ratio. General inclusion criteria will be the onset of PD 2 to 5 years before the trial and absence of autoimmune comorbidities or immunomodulating therapy. Our primary endpoint is the assessment of changes in extracellular cytokine levels (Interferon (IFN)-Î³, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-Î±, interleukin (IL)-4, and IL-10) and ROS production. Secondary outcomes include changes in lymphocyte subpopulations and transcriptional factors mRNA levels.This study is designed to highlight the potential beneficial role of probiotics administration on peripheral immunity through the modulation of gut microbiota.

38045857,Metabolomic analysis of serum short-chain fatty acid concentrations in a mouse of MPTP-induced Parkinson's disease after dietary supplementation with branched-chain amino acids.,"The gut microbiota and microbial metabolites influence the enteric nervous system and the central nervous system via the microbial-gut-brain axis. Increasing body of evidence suggests that disturbances in the metabolism of peripheral branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) can contribute to the development of neurodegenerative diseases through neuroinflammatory signaling. Preliminary research has shown that longitudinal changes in serum amino acid levels in mouse models of Parkinson's disease (PD) are negatively correlated with disease progression. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine the changes in serum levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in a mouse model of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD after dietary BCAA supplementation. In our research, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to detect serum SCFA concentrations. The data were then analyzed with principal component analysis and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis. Finally, the correlations of serum SCFA levels with gut and motor function in MPTP-induced PD mice were explored. Propionic acid, acetic acid, butyric acid, and isobutyric acid concentrations were elevated in MPTP + H-BCAA mice compared with MPTP mice. Propionic acid concentration was increased the most, while the isovaleric acid concentration was decreased. Propionic acid concentration was positively correlated with fecal weight and water content and negatively correlated with the pole-climbing duration. In conclusion, these results not only suggest that propionic acid may be a potential biomarker for PD, but also indicate the possibility that PD may be treated by altering circulating levels of SCFA.","Open medicine (Warsaw, Poland)",2023,Na Mi; Lili Ma; Xueying Li; Jia Fu; Xinxin Bu; Fei Liu; Fan Yang; Yali Zhang; Lifen Yao

Finally, the ROC curve was drawn based on the metagenomic validation results.The meta-analysis showed a lower relative abundance of <i>Prevotellaceae</i> (<i>p</i> < 0.00001) and <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.002), and a higher of <i>Ruminococcaceae</i> (<i>p</i> < 0.00001), <i>Christensenellaceae</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.03), <i>Bifidobacteriaceae</i> (<i>p</i> < 0.00001), and <i>Verrucomicrobiaceae</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.02) in patients with PD. Only <i>Bifidobacteriaceae</i> was also at high levels in the validation cohort of the metagenome. Meanwhile, three species from the <i>Bifidobacteriaceae</i>, including <i>Scardovia_inopinata</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.022), <i>Bifidobacterium_dentium</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.005), and <i>Scardovia_wiggsiae</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.024) were also high. The ROC curve showed that the three species (71.2%) from <i>Bifidobacteriaceae</i> had good predictive efficiency for PD.Elevated <i>Bifidobacteriaceae</i> may be associated with PD. Elevated three species from the <i>Bifidobacteriaceae</i>, including <i>Scardovia_inopinata</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium_dentium</i> and <i>Scardovia_wiggsiae</i> may provide new potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of PD.",Frontiers in integrative neuroscience,2022,ShuJia Zuo; HaiJing Wang; Qiang Zhao; Jie Tang; Min Wang; Yu Zhang; Ming Sang; Jing Tian; Puqing Wang

36776226,"A review article on neuroprotective, immunomodulatory, and anti-inflammatory role of vitamin-D3 in elderly COVID-19 patients.","Vitamin D3 is a secosteroid, broad-spectrum immunomodulatory, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory hormone produced either by the internal subcutaneous pathway in the presence of ultraviolet B (UVB) rays or by the external pathway in the form of supplements. Vitamin D3 deficiency is a common and reversible contributor to mortality and morbidity among critically ill patients, including Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and other viral infections. The major functions of vitamin D3 are inhibiting the proinflammatory pathways, including nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB), inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (ILs-6), interleukin-18 (ILs-18), and tumour necrosis factor (TNF), preventing the loss of neural sensation in COVID-19, maintaining respiratory homeostasis, and acting as an antiviral, antimalarial, and antihypertensive agent. Vitamin D3 has an important role in reversing the COVID-19 infection in patients who have previously suffered from a neurological disease, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson disease, motor neuron disease, multiple sclerosis, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, stroke, cardiovascular problems, headache, sleep-associated disorder, and others. Moreover, vitamin D3 plays a key role in regulating the gene expression of different pro-inflammatory cytokines. In addition to the information provided above, the current review article provides the most recent information on Vitamin D against COVID-19 with comorbid neurological disorders. Furthermore, we present the most recent advancement and molecular mechanism of action of vitamin D3. Diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and neurological disorders are comorbid conditions, and vitamin D3 is a critical regulator of COVID-19 infection during these conditions. In the midst of the COVID-19 epidemic, factors such as sex, latitudes, nutrition, demography, pollution, and gut microbiota warrants for additional research on vitamin D supplements.","The Egyptian journal of neurology, psychiatry and neurosurgery",2023,Amit Kumar Tripathi; Sunil Kumar Mishra
36516898,Effects of molecular hydrogen intervention on the gut microbiome in methamphetamine abusers with mental disorder.,"Methamphetamine (METH) is a potent and highly addictive psychostimulant and one of the most widely used illicit drugs, the abuse of which has become a severe public health problem worldwide. A growing amount of evidence has indicated potential connections between gut microbiota and mental disorders induced by METH and associations with neural and metabolic pathways. The present study aimed to explore the relationship between fecal microbial alterations and neuropsychiatric diseases in METH addictions. Thus, mental disorders and gut microbial alterations were analyzed by self-rating depression (SDS) and anxiety (SAS) scales and 16Â S rRNA gene sequencing, respectively. Our results showed that increased SDS and SAS indices and decreased alpha diversity indicated more serious mental disorders and lower bacterial diversity in METH users than in the age-matched healthy control group. The gut microbial composition in female METH users was also significantly altered, with reductions in hydrogen-producing bacteria, including Bacteroides and Roseburia. Molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) is spontaneously produced by intestinal bacteria in the process of anaerobic metabolism, which is the main pathway for H<sub>2</sub> production in vivo. Numerous studies have shown that hydrogen intervention can significantly improve neuropsychiatric diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Our results showed that hydrogen intervention, including drinking and inhaling, significantly alleviated mental disorders induced by METH abuse, and the inhalation of hydrogen also altered gut microbiota profiles in the METH abusers. These results suggest that hydrogen intervention has potential therapeutic applicability in the treatment of mental disorders in METH abusers.",Brain research bulletin,2023,Yong Wang; Mengmeng Wang; Bing Xie; Di Wen; Wenbo Li; Meiqi Zhou; Xintao Wang; Yun Lu; Bin Cong; Zhiyu Ni; Chunling Ma

37596429,Fecal Microbiota Transplantation from Aged Mice Render Recipient Mice Resistant to MPTP-Induced Nigrostriatal Degeneration Via a Neurogenesis-Dependent but Inflammation-Independent Manner.,"Accumulating data support a crucial role of gut microbiota in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, gut microbiota vary with age and, thus, will affect PD in an age-dependent, but unknown manner. We examined the effects of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) pretreatment, using fecal microbiota from young (7Â weeks) or aged mice (23Â months), on MPTP-induced PD model. Motor function, pathological changes, striatal neurotransmitters, neuroinflammation, gut inflammation and gut permeability were examined. Gut microbiota composition and metabolites, namely short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), were analyzed. Neurogenesis was also evaluated by measuring the number of doublecortin-positive (DCX<sup>+</sup>) neurons and Ki67-positive (Ki67<sup>+</sup>) cells in the hippocampus. Expression of Cd133 mRNA, a cellular stemness marker, in the hippocampus was also examined. Mice who received FMT from young mice showed MPTP-induced motor dysfunction, and reduction of striatal dopamine (DA), dopaminergic neurons and striatal tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) levels. Interestingly and unexpectedly, mice that received FMT from aged mice showed recovery of motor function and rescue of dopaminergic neurons and striatal 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), as well as decreased DA metabolism after MPTP challenge. Further, they showed improved metabolic profiling and a decreased amount of fecal SCFAs. High-throughput sequencing revealed that FMT remarkably reshaped the gut microbiota of recipient mice. For instance, levels of genus Akkermansia and Candidatus Saccharimonas were elevated in fecal samples of recipient mice receiving aged microbiota (AMâ+âMPTP mice) than YMâ+âMPTP mice. Intriguingly, both young microbiota and aged microbiota had no effect on neuroinflammation, gut inflammation or gut permeability. Notably, AMâ+âMPTP mice showed a marked increase in DCX<sup>+</sup> neurons, as well as Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells and Cd133 expression in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) compared to YMâ+âMPTP mice. These results suggest that FMT from aged mice augments neurogenesis, improves motor function and restores dopaminergic neurons and neurotransmitters in PD model mice, possibly through increasing neurogenesis.",Neurotherapeutics : the journal of the American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics,2023,Chen-Meng Qiao; Yu Zhou; Wei Quan; Xiao-Yu Ma; Li-Ping Zhao; Yun Shi; Hui Hong; Jian Wu; Gu-Yu Niu; Yu-Nuo Chen; Shan Zhu; Chun Cui; Wei-Jiang Zhao; Yan-Qin Shen
37961318,Identification of proteotoxic and proteoprotective bacteria that non-specifically affect proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases.,"Neurodegenerative protein conformational diseases (PCDs), such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's, are a leading cause of death and disability worldwide and have no known cures or effective treatments. Emerging evidence suggests a role for the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative PCDs; however, the influence of specific bacteria on the culprit proteins associated with each of these diseases remains elusive, primarily due to the complexity of the microbiota. In the present study, we employed a single-strain screening approach to identify human bacterial isolates that enhance or suppress the aggregation of culprit proteins and the associated toxicity in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> expressing AÎ²<sub>1-42</sub>, Î±-synuclein, and polyglutamine tracts. Here, we reveal the first comprehensive analysis of the human microbiome for its effect on proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Our results suggest that bacteria affect the aggregation of metastable proteins by modulating host proteostasis rather than selectively targeting specific disease-associated proteins. These results reveal bacteria that potentially influence the pathogenesis of PCDs and open new promising prevention and treatment opportunities by altering the abundance of beneficial and detrimental microbes.",bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,2023,Alyssa C Walker; Rohan Bhargava; Michael Bucher; Amanda S Brust; Daniel M Czy
36742204,Effects of a probiotic suspension Symproveâ¢ on a rat early-stage Parkinson's disease model.,"An increasing number of studies in recent years have focused on the role that the gut may play in Parkinson's Disease (PD) pathogenesis, suggesting that the maintenance of a healthy gut may lead to potential treatments of the disease. The health of microbiota has been shown to be directly associated with parameters that play a potential role in PD including gut barrier integrity, immunity, function, metabolism and the correct functioning of the gut-brain axis. The gut microbiota (GM) may therefore be employed as valuable indicators for early diagnosis of PD and potential targets for preventing or treating PD symptoms. Preserving the gut homeostasis using probiotics may therefore lead to a promising treatment strategy due to their known benefits in improving constipation, motor impairments, inflammation, and neurodegeneration. However, the mechanisms underlying the effects of probiotics in PD are yet to be clarified. In this project, we have tested the efficacy of an oral probiotic suspension, Symproveâ¢, on an established animal model of PD. Symproveâ¢, unlike many commercially available probiotics, has been shown to be resistant to gastric acidity, improve symptoms in gastrointestinal diseases and improve gut integrity in an <i>in vitro</i> PD model. In this study, we used an early-stage PD rat model to determine the effect of Symproveâ¢ on neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in the brain and on plasma cytokine levels, GM composition and short chain fatty acid (SCFA) release. Symproveâ¢ was shown to significantly influence both the gut and brain of the PD model. It preserved the gut integrity in the PD model, reduced plasma inflammatory markers and changed microbiota composition. The treatment also prevented the reduction in SCFAs and striatal inflammation and prevented tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive cell loss by 17% compared to that observed in animals treated with placebo. We conclude that Symproveâ¢ treatment may have a positive influence on the symptomology of early-stage PD with obvious implications for the improvement of gut integrity and possibly delaying/preventing the onset of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in human PD patients.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2022,Marco Sancandi; Carmen De Caro; Neringa Cypaite; Nadia Marascio; Carmen Avagliano; Carmela De Marco; Emilio Russo; Andrew Constanti; Audrey Mercer

37895965,Profiling Analysis of Tryptophan Metabolites in the Urine of Patients with Parkinson's Disease Using LC-MS/MS.,"Although Parkinson's disease (PD) is a representative neurodegenerative disorder and shows characteristic motor impediments, the pathophysiological mechanisms and treatment targets for PD have not yet been clearly identified. Since several tryptophan metabolites produced by gut microbiota could pass the blood-brain barrier and, furthermore, might influence the central nervous system, tryptophan metabolites within the indole, kynurenine, and serotonin metabolic pathways might be the most potent targets for PD development. Furthermore, most metabolites are circulated via the blood, play roles in and/or are metabolized via the host organs, and finally are excreted into the urine. Therefore, profiling the overall tryptophan metabolic pathways in urine samples of patients with PD is important to understanding the pathological mechanisms, finding biomarkers, and discovering therapeutic targets for PD. However, the development of profiling analysis based on tryptophan metabolism pathways in human urine samples is still challenging due to the wide physiological ranges, the varied signal response, and the structural diversity of tryptophan metabolites in complicated urine matrices. In this study, an LC-MS/MS method was developed to profile 21 tryptophan metabolites within the indole, kynurenine, and serotonin metabolic pathways in human urine samples using ion-pairing chromatography and multiple reaction monitoring determination. The developed method was successfully applied to urine samples of PD patients (<i>n</i> = 41) and controls (<i>n</i> = 20). Further, we investigated aberrant metabolites to find biomarkers for PD development and therapeutic targets based on the quantitative results. Unfortunately, most tryptophan metabolites in the urine samples did not present significant differences between control and PD patients, except for indole-3-acetic acid. Nonetheless, indole-3-acetic acid was reported for the first time for its aberrant urinary levels in PD patients and tentatively selected as a potential biomarker for PD. This study provides accurate quantitative results for 21 tryptophan metabolites in biological samples and will be helpful in revealing the pathological mechanisms of PD development, discovering biomarkers for PD, and further providing therapeutic targets for various PD symptoms. In the near future, to further investigate the relationship between gut microbial metabolites and PD, we will employ studies on microbial metabolites using plasma and stool samples from control and PD patients.","Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,So Hyeon Chung; Dallah Yoo; Tae-Beom Ahn; Wonwoong Lee; Jongki Hong
37196855,Kanamycin treatment in the pre-symptomatic stage of a Drosophila PD model prevents the onset of non-motor alterations.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor alterations, which is preceded by a prodromal stage where non-motor symptoms are observed. Over recent years, it has become evident that this disorder involves other organs that communicate with the brain like the gut. Importantly, the microbial community that lives in the gut plays a key role in this communication, the so-called microbiota-gut-brain axis. Alterations in this axis have been associated to several disorders including PD. Here we proposed that the gut microbiota is different in the presymptomatic stage of a Drosophila model for PD, the Pink1<sup>B9</sup> mutant fly, as compared to that observed in control animals. Our results show this is the case: there is basal dysbiosis in mutant animals evidenced by substantial difference in the composition of midgut microbiota in 8-9 days old Pink1<sup>B9</sup> mutant flies as compared with control animals. Further, we fed young adult control and mutant flies kanamycin and analyzed motor and non-motor behavioral parameters in these animals. Data show that kanamycin treatment induces the recovery of some of the non-motor parameters altered in the pre-motor stage of the PD fly model, while there is no substantial change in locomotor parameters recorded at this stage. On the other hand, our results show that feeding young animals the antibiotic, results in a long-lasting improvement of locomotion in control flies. Our data support that manipulations of gut microbiota in young animals could have beneficial effects on PD progression and age-dependent motor impairments.

38106542,Sex Differences in the Allele Distribution of <i>PGLYRP2</i> Variant rs892145 in Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex multifactorial disease, involving genetic susceptibility, environmental risk factors, and gene-environmental interactions. The microbiota-gut-brain axis is hypothesized to play a role in the pathophysiology of PD, and peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGLYRPs), which modulate the gut microbiota, are, therefore, relevant candidate genes for PD.Using quantitative real-time PCR, we genotyped three <i>PGLYRP</i> variants (rs892145, rs959117, and rs10888557) and performed an association analysis in 508 PD patients and 585 control individuals. We further conducted a meta-analysis of rs892145 and analyzed <i>PGLYRP2</i> gene expression in lymphocytes from patients with PD and controls.Although initial analysis of the three variants rs892145, rs959117, and rs10888557 and a meta-analysis of rs892145 did not reveal any association between the selected variants and PD, we found an interaction between sex and genotype for rs892145, with a marked difference in the allele distribution of rs892145 between male and female patients. As compared to controls, the T allele was less common in female patients (odds ratioâ=â0.76, <i>P</i>â=â0.04) and more common in male patients (odds ratioâ=â1.29, <i>P</i>â=â0.04). No difference was found in <i>PGLYRP2</i> gene expression between PD patients and controls (<i>P</i>â=â0.38), nor between sexes (<i>P</i>â=â0.07). <i>Discussion</i>. Overall, this genetic screening in Swedish PD patients does not support previous results demonstrating associations of <i>PGLYRP</i> variants with the risk of PD. Meta-analysis of rs892145 revealed pronounced heterogeneity between previously published studies which is likely to have influenced the results. Taken together, the genetic and gene expression analyses suggest a possible link between genetic variants in <i>PGLYRP2</i> and sex differences in PD. Because of the limited sample size in our study, these results need to be verified in independent cohorts before concluding.",Parkinson's disease,2023,Caroline Ran; Karin Wirdefeldt; Olof Sydow; Per Svenningsson; Rochellys Diaz Heijtz
36918961,NEMoE: a nutrition aware regularized mixture of experts model to identify heterogeneous diet-microbiome-host health interactions.,"Unrevealing the interplay between diet, the microbiome, and the health state could enable the design of personalized intervention strategies and improve the health and well-being of individuals. A common approach to this is to divide the study population into smaller cohorts based on dietary preferences in the hope of identifying specific microbial signatures. However, classification of patients based solely on diet is unlikely to reflect the microbiome-host health relationship or the taxonomic microbiome makeup.We present a novel approach, the Nutrition-Ecotype Mixture of Experts (NEMoE) model, for establishing associations between gut microbiota and health state that accounts for diet-specific cohort variability using a regularized mixture of experts model framework with an integrated parameter sharing strategy to ensure data-driven diet-cohort identification consistency across taxonomic levels. The success of our approach was demonstrated through a series of simulation studies, in which NEMoE showed robustness with regard to parameter selection and varying degrees of data heterogeneity. Further application to real-world microbiome data from a Parkinson's disease cohort revealed that NEMoE is capable of not only improving predictive performance for Parkinson's Disease but also for identifying diet-specific microbial signatures of disease.In summary, NEMoE can be used to uncover diet-specific relationships between nutritional-ecotype and patient health and to contextualize precision nutrition for different diseases.

Increasing research found that a diet with poor quality such as western diet disrupts gut microbiota and increases the susceptibility to various neurological and mental disorders, while a balanced diet regulates gut microbiota and prevents and alleviates the neurological and mental disorders. Yet, there is limited research on the association between the disease burden expanding of neurological and mental disorders with a dietary transition.We compared the disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) trend by age for neurological and mental disorders in China, in the United States of America (USA), and across the world from 1990 to 2019, evaluated the dietary transition in the past 60 years, and analyzed the association between the burden trend of the two disorders with the changes in diet composition and food production.We identified an age-related upward pattern in disease burden in China. Compared with the USA and the world, the Chinese neurological and mental disorders DALY percent was least in the generation over 75 but rapidly increased in younger generations and surpassed the USA and/or the world in the last decades. The age-related upward pattern in Chinese disease burdens had not only shown in the presence of cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms, and diabetes mellitus but also appeared in the presence of depressive disorders, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, schizophrenia, headache disorders, anxiety disorders, conduct disorders, autism spectrum disorders, and eating disorders, successively. Additionally, the upward trend was associated with the dramatic dietary transition including a reduction in dietary quality and food production sustainability, during which the younger generation is more affected than the older. Following the increase in total calorie intake, alcohol intake, ratios of animal to vegetal foods, and poultry meat to pulses, the burdens of the above diseases continuously rose. Then, following the rise of the ratios of meat to pulses, eggs to pulses, and pork to pulses, the usage of fertilizers, the farming density of pigs, and the burdens of the above disease except diabetes mellitus were also ever-increasing. Even the usage of pesticides was positively correlated with the burdens of Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, cardiovascular diseases, and neoplasms. Contrary to China, the corresponding burdens of the USA trended to reduce with the improvements in diet quality and food production sustainability.Our results suggest that improving diet quality and food production sustainability might be a promising way to stop the expanding burdens of neurological and mental disorders.",Frontiers in nutrition,2022,Shan Liang; Li Wang; Xiaoli Wu; Xu Hu; Tao Wang; Feng Jin

The age-related upward pattern in Chinese disease burdens had not only shown in the presence of cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms, and diabetes mellitus but also appeared in the presence of depressive disorders, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, schizophrenia, headache disorders, anxiety disorders, conduct disorders, autism spectrum disorders, and eating disorders, successively. Additionally, the upward trend was associated with the dramatic dietary transition including a reduction in dietary quality and food production sustainability, during which the younger generation is more affected than the older. Following the increase in total calorie intake, alcohol intake, ratios of animal to vegetal foods, and poultry meat to pulses, the burdens of the above diseases continuously rose. Then, following the rise of the ratios of meat to pulses, eggs to pulses, and pork to pulses, the usage of fertilizers, the farming density of pigs, and the burdens of the above disease except diabetes mellitus were also ever-increasing. Even the usage of pesticides was positively correlated with the burdens of Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, cardiovascular diseases, and neoplasms.

38958636,Pesticides and the Gut Microbiota: Implications for Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) affects more people worldwide than just aging alone can explain. This is likely due to environmental influences, genetic makeup, and changes in daily habits. The disease develops in a complex way, with movement problems caused by Lewy bodies and the loss of dopamine-producing neurons. Some research suggests Lewy bodies might start in the gut, hinting at a connection between these structures and gut health in PD patients. These patients often have different gut bacteria and metabolites. Pesticides are known to increase the risk of PD, with evidence showing they harm more than just dopamine neurons. Long-term exposure to pesticides in food might affect the gut barrier, gut bacteria, and the blood-brain barrier, but the exact link is still unknown. This review looks at how pesticides and gut bacteria separately influence PD development and progression, highlighting the harmful effects of pesticides and changes in gut bacteria. We have examined the interaction between pesticides and gut bacteria in PD patients, summarizing how pesticides cause imbalances in gut bacteria, the resulting changes, and their overall effects on the PD prognosis.",Chemical research in toxicology,2024,Nabanita Ghosh; Krishnendu Sinha; Parames C Sil

However, evidence for the role of the MedDiet in the relief of motor and non-motor symptoms in patients with PD remains limited and inconclusive. We provide a systematic review of the effects of the MedDiet on the clinical features of PD using data from randomised controlled trials (RCT) and prospective observational studies.We searched MEDLINE, EMCare, EMBASE, Scopus and PubMed from inception until June 2023. Reference lists and the grey literature were also searched. Human studies with no restriction on language or publication date, examining associations between MedDiet adherence and the symptoms of PD, were included. We employed standard methodological procedures for data extraction and evidence synthesis and used the Quality Criteria Checklist for assessing the studies included.Four studies from three unique cohorts, including two observational studies (n = 1213) and one RCT (n = 70), met the inclusion criteria. Despite the short study duration reported in all included reports, high MedDiet adherence was associated with changes in the gut microbiota (e.g., increased abundance of short-chain fatty acids producers). These outcomes correlated with a significant improvement in several non-motor symptoms including cognitive dysfunction, dyspepsia and constipation. However, there were no significant changes in diarrhoea, gastrointestinal reflux, abdominal pain and motor symptoms.High MedDiet adherence may be associated with significant improvement in global cognition and several gastrointestinal symptoms, possibly associated to changes in gut microbiota composition.

38652236,Modulation of Gut Microbiota Through Dietary Intervention in Neuroinflammation and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases.,"The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of neuroinflammation and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. One of the main modulators of the gut microbiota is the diet, which directly influences host homeostasis and biological processes. Some dietary patterns can affect neurodegenerative diseases' progression through gut microbiota composition, gut permeability, and the synthesis and secretion of microbial-derived neurotrophic factors and neurotransmitters. This comprehensive review critically assesses existing studies investigating the impact of dietary interventions on the modulation of the microbiota in relation to neurodegenerative diseases and neuroinflammation.There are limited studies on the effects of specific diets, such as the ketogenic diet, Mediterranean diet, vegetarian diet, and Western diet, on the progression of neuroinflammation and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases through the gut-brain axis. The ketogenic diet displays promising potential in ameliorating the clinical trajectory of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. However, conflicting outcomes were observed among various studies, highlighting the need to consider diverse types of ketogenic diets and their respective effects on clinical outcomes and gut microbiota composition. Vegetarian and Mediterranean diets, known for their anti-inflammatory properties, can be effective against Parkinson's disease, which is related to inflammation in the gut environment. On the other hand, the westernization of dietary patterns was associated with reduced gut microbial diversity and metabolites, which ultimately contributed to the development of neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment. Various studies examining the impact of dietary interventions on the gut-brain axis with regard to neuroinflammation and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases are thoroughly reviewed in this article. A strong mechanistic explanation is required to fully understand the complex interactions between various dietary patterns, gut microbiota, and microbial metabolites and the effects these interactions have on cognitive function and the progression of these diseases.",Current nutrition reports,2024,Åerife Ayten; Saniye Bilici
37843219,Correlation between the gut microbiome and neurodegenerative diseases: a review of metagenomics evidence.,"A growing body of evidence suggests that the gut microbiota contributes to the development of neurodegenerative diseases via the microbiota-gut-brain axis. As a contributing factor, microbiota dysbiosis always occurs in pathological changes of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. High-throughput sequencing technology has helped to reveal that the bidirectional communication between the central nervous system and the enteric nervous system is facilitated by the microbiota's diverse microorganisms, and for both neuroimmune and neuroendocrine systems. Here, we summarize the bioinformatics analysis and wet-biology validation for the gut metagenomics in neurodegenerative diseases, with an emphasis on multi-omics studies and the gut virome. The pathogen-associated signaling biomarkers for identifying brain disorders and potential therapeutic targets are also elucidated.

38867886,The interplay between gut microbiota and the brain-gut axis in Parkinson's disease treatment.,"This study delves into the pivotal role of the gut microbiota and the brain-gut axis in Parkinson's Disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder with significant motor and non-motor implications. It posits that disruptions in gut microbiota-dysbiosis-and alterations in the brain-gut axis contribute to PD's pathogenesis. Our findings highlight the potential of the gastrointestinal system's early involvement in PD, suggested by the precedence of gastrointestinal symptoms before motor symptoms emerge. This observation implies a possible gut-originated disease pathway. The analysis demonstrates that dysbiosis in PD patients leads to increased intestinal permeability and systemic inflammation, which in turn exacerbates neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Such insights into the interaction between gut microbiota and the brain-gut axis not only elucidate PD's underlying mechanisms but also pave the way for novel therapeutic interventions. We propose targeted treatment strategies, including dietary modifications and fecal microbiota transplantation, aimed at modulating the gut microbiota. These approaches hold promise for augmenting current PD treatment modalities by alleviating both motor and non-motor symptoms, thereby potentially improving patient quality of life. This research underscores the significance of the gut microbiota in the progression and treatment of PD, advocating for an integrated, multidisciplinary approach to develop personalized, efficacious management strategies for PD patients, combining insights from neurology, microbiology, and nutritional science.",Frontiers in neurology,2024,Xi Jia; Qin Wang; Meilingzi Liu; Jia-Yuan Ding
38570412,The Gut Microbiota in Parkinson Disease: Interactions with Drugs and Potential for Therapeutic Applications.,"The concept of a 'microbiota-gut-brain axis' has recently emerged as an important player in the pathophysiology of Parkinson disease (PD), not least because of the reciprocal interaction between gut bacteria and medications. The gut microbiota can influence levodopa kinetics, and conversely, drugs administered for PD can influence gut microbiota composition. Through a two-step enzymatic pathway, gut microbes can decarboxylate levodopa to dopamine in the small intestine and then dehydroxylate it to m-tyramine, thus reducing availability. Inhibition of bacterial decarboxylation pathways could therefore represent a strategy to increase levodopa absorption. Other bacterial perturbations common in PD, such as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and Helicobacter pylori infection, can also modulate levodopa metabolism, and eradication therapies may improve levodopa absorption. Interventions targeting the gut microbiota offer a novel opportunity to manage disabling motor complications and dopa-unresponsive symptoms. Mediterranean diet-induced changes in gut microbiota composition might improve a range of non-motor symptoms. Prebiotics can increase levels of short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria and decrease pro-inflammatory species, with positive effects on clinical symptoms and levodopa kinetics. Different formulations of probiotics showed beneficial outcomes on constipation, with some of them improving dopamine levels; however, the most effective dosage and duration and long-term effects of these treatments remain unknown. Data from faecal microbiota transplantation studies are preliminary, but show encouraging trends towards improvement in both motor and non-motor outcomes.This article summarises the most up-to-date knowledge in pharmacomicrobiomics in PD, and discusses how the manipulation of gut microbiota represents a potential new therapeutic avenue for PD.",CNS drugs,2024,Elisa Menozzi; Anthony H V Schapira

Polyphenols, which are rich in fruits and vegetables, are drawing attention for their potential role in this context. In this paper, we reviewed how polyphenols influence the composition and functional capabilities of the gut microbiota and how the resulting microbial metabolites of polyphenols may potentially enhance the modulation of Î±-synuclein aggregation.

38279293,From the Gut to the Brain: The Role of Enteric Glial Cells and Their Involvement in the Pathogenesis of Parkinson's Disease.,"The brain-gut axis has been identified as an important contributor to the physiopathology of Parkinson's disease. In this pathology, inflammation is thought to be driven by the damage caused by aggregation of Î±-synuclein in the brain. Interestingly, the Braak's theory proposes that Î±-synuclein misfolding may originate in the gut and spread in a ""prion-like"" manner through the vagus nerve into the central nervous system. In the enteric nervous system, enteric glial cells are the most abundant cellular component. Several studies have evaluated their role in Parkinson's disease. Using samples obtained from patients, cell cultures, or animal models, the studies with specific antibodies to label enteric glial cells (GFAP, Sox-10, and S100Î²) seem to indicate that activation and reactive gliosis are associated to the neurodegeneration produced by Parkinson's disease in the enteric nervous system. Of interest, Toll-like receptors, which are expressed on enteric glial cells, participate in the triggering of immune/inflammatory responses, in the maintenance of intestinal barrier integrity and in the configuration of gut microbiota; thus, these receptors might contribute to Parkinson's disease. External factors like stress also seem to be relevant in its pathogenesis. Some authors have studied ways to reverse changes in EGCs with interventions such as administration of Tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase inhibitors, nutraceuticals, or physical exercise. Some researchers point out that beyond being activated during the disease, enteric glial cells may contribute to the development of synucleinopathies. Thus, it is still necessary to further study these cells and their role in Parkinson's disease.",International journal of molecular sciences,2024,Alba MontalbÃ¡n-RodrÃ­guez; Raquel Abalo; Laura LÃ³pez-GÃ³mez

However, the source of seeding-capable Î±-synuclein in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) has not been fully investigated. Additionally, the mechanism by which the GIT microbiome contributes to PD pathogenesis remains to be characterized.We aimed to investigate whether blood-derived Î±-synuclein might contribute to PD pathology via a gut-driven pathway and involve GIT microbiota.The GIT expression of Î±-synuclein and the transmission of extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from erythrocytes/red blood cells (RBCs), with their cargo Î±-synuclein, to the GIT were explored with various methods, including radioactive labeling of RBC-EVs and direct analysis of the transfer of Î±-synuclein protein. The potential role of microbiota on the EVs transmission was further investigated by administering butyrate, the short-chain fatty acids produced by gut microbiota and studying mice with different Î±-synuclein genotypes.This study demonstrated that RBC-EVs can effectively transport Î±-synuclein to the GIT in a region-dependent manner, along with variations closely associated with regional differences in the expression of gut-vascular barrier markers. The investigation further revealed that the infiltration of Î±-synuclein into the GIT was influenced significantly by butyrate and Î±-synuclein genotypes, which may also affect the GIT microbiome directly.By demonstrating the transportation of Î±-synuclein through RBC-EVs to the GIT, and its potential association with gut-vascular barrier markers and gut microbiome, this work highlights a potential mechanism by which RBC Î±-synuclein may impact PD initiation and/or progression.

38587699,The Interaction Between Nutraceuticals and Gut Microbiota: a Novel Therapeutic Approach to Prevent and Treatment Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons, leading to motor and non-motor symptoms. Emerging research has shed light on the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis and progression of PD. Nutraceuticals such as curcumin, berberine, phytoestrogens, polyphenols (e.g., resveratrol, EGCG, and fisetin), dietary fibers have been shown to influence gut microbiota composition and function, restoring microbial balance and enhancing the gut-brain axis. The mechanisms underlying these benefits involve microbial metabolite production, restoration of gut barrier integrity, and modulation of neuroinflammatory pathways. Additionally, probiotics and prebiotics have shown potential in promoting gut health, influencing the gut microbiome, and alleviating PD symptoms. They can enhance the gut's antioxidant capacity of the gut, reduce inflammation, and maintain immune homeostasis, contributing to a neuroprotective environment. This paper provides an overview of the current state of knowledge regarding the potential of nutraceuticals and gut microbiota modulation in the prevention and management of Parkinson's disease, emphasizing the need for further research and clinical trials to validate their effectiveness and safety.

The results of the included studies were analyzed using a random effects model with calculation of the mean difference (MD) with the 95Â % confidence interval to quantify the incidence of differences in abundance of various bacterial families in PD patients. Continuous models were used to analyze the extracted data.A total of 14 studies with 1045 PD cases and 821 healthy controls were included for data extraction and meta-analysis. All the included studies exhibited reasonable quality. The included studies reported the data on the ratios of 10 families of GM. Of these 10 microbiota families, Bifidobacteriaceae, Ruminococcaceae, Rikenellaceae, Lactobacillaceae, Verrucomicrobiaceae and Christensenellaceae were found to have increased ratios according to the pooled ratios, while Prevotellaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Erysipelotrichaceae and Faecalibacterium were decreased in PD cases.Patients in the PD cohort exhibited distinctive microbiota compositions compared to healthy individuals, with unique differential patterns in gut microbiome abundance at the phylum, family, and genus levels that may be associated wtih PD pathogenesis.",Experimental gerontology,2024,Fusheng Bai; Lin You; Hongyan Lei; Xinming Li
38852651,Study on the mechanism of gut microbiota in the pathogenetic interaction between depression and Parkinson 's disease.,"Depression and Parkinson's disease share pathogenetic characteristics, meaning that they can impact each other and exacerbate their respective progression. From a pathogenetic perspective, depression can develop into Parkinson's disease and is a precursor symptom of Parkinson's disease; Parkinson's disease is also often accompanied by depression. From a pharmacological perspective, the use of antidepressants increases the risk of developing Parkinson's disease, and therapeutic medications for Parkinson's disease can exacerbate symptoms of depression. Therefore, identifying how Parkinson's disease and depression impact each other in their development is key to formulating preventive measures and targeted treatment. One commonality in the pathogenesis of depression and Parkinson's disease are alterations in the gut microbiota, with mechanisms interacting in neural, immune inflammatory, and neuroendocrine pathways. This paper reviews the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of depression and Parkinson's disease; conducts a study of the relationship between both conditions and medication; and suggests that dysregulated gut microbiota may be a key factor in explaining the relationship between Parkinson's disease and depression. Finally, on the basis of these findings, this article hopes to provide suggestions that new ideas for the prevention and treatment of depression and Parkinson's disease.",Brain research bulletin,2024,Peiyun Zhang; Wei Jin; Zhaoshun Lyu; Xinxuan Lyu; Lihong Li
37690584,An updated overview on the relationship between human gut microbiome dysbiosis and psychiatric and psychological disorders.,"There is a lot of evidence establishing that nervous system development is related to the composition and functions of the gut microbiome. In addition, the central nervous system (CNS) controls the imbalance of the intestinal microbiota, constituting a bidirectional communication system. At present, various gut-brain crosstalk routes have been described, including immune, endocrine and neural circuits via the vagal pathway. Several empirical data have associated gut microbiota alterations (dysbiosis) with neuropsychiatric diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, autism and Parkinson's disease, and with other psychological disorders, like anxiety and depression. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) therapy has shown that the gut microbiota can transfer behavioral features to recipient animals, which provides strong evidence to establish a causal-effect relationship. Interventions, based on prebiotics, probiotics or synbiotics, have demonstrated an important influence of microbiota on neurological disorders by the synthesis of neuroactive compounds that interact with the nervous system and by the regulation of inflammatory and endocrine processes.

In particular, little is known about the role of gut microbiota.We aimed to reveal the alterations and functions of gut microbiota and its correlation with the liver metabolome in the process of improving PD with BHD.The cecal contents were collected from PD mice treated with or without BHD. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiSeq-PE250 platform, and the ecological structure, dominant taxa, co-occurrence patterns, and function prediction of the gut microbial community were analyzed by multivariate statistical methods. The correlation between differential microbial communities in the gut and differentially accumulated metabolites in the liver was analyzed using Spearman's correlation analysis.The abundance of Butyricimonas, Christensenellaceae, Coprococcus, Peptococcaceae, Odoribacteraceae, and Roseburia was altered significantly in the model group, which was by BHD.

38785512,The Effect of Gut Microbiota-Targeted Interventions on Neuroinflammation and Motor Function in Parkinson's Disease Animal Models-A Systematic Review.,"Gut microbiome-targeted interventions such as fecal transplant, prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics, and antibiotic gut depletion are speculated to be of potential use in delaying the onset and progression of Parkinson's disease by rebalancing the gut microbiome in the context of the gut-brain axis. Our study aims to organize recent findings regarding these interventions in Parkinson's disease animal models to identify how they affect neuroinflammation and motor outcomes. A systematic literature search was applied in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and SCOPUS for gut microbiome-targeted non-dietary interventions. Studies that investigated gut-targeted interventions by using in vivo murine PD models to follow dopaminergic cell loss, motor tests, and neuroinflammatory markers as outcomes were considered to be eligible. A total of 1335 studies were identified in the databases, out of which 29 were found to be eligible. A narrative systematization of the resulting data was performed, and the effect direction for the outcomes was represented. Quality assessment using the SYRCLE risk of bias tool was also performed. Out of the 29 eligible studies, we found that a significant majority report that the intervention reduced the dopaminergic cell loss (82.76%, 95% CI [64.23%, 94.15%]) produced by the induction of the disease model. Also, most studies reported a reduction in microglial (87.5%, 95% CI [61.65%, 98.45%]) and astrocytic activation (84,62%, 95% CI [54.55%, 98.08%]) caused by the induction of the disease model. These results were also mirrored in the majority (96.4% 95% CI [81.65%, 99.91%]) of the studies reporting an increase in performance in behavioral motor tests. A significant limitation of the study was that insufficient information was found in the studies to assess specific causes of the risk of bias. These results show that non-dietary gut microbiome-targeted interventions can improve neuroinflammatory and motor outcomes in acute Parkinson's disease animal models. Further studies are needed to clarify if these benefits transfer to the long-term pathogenesis of the disease, which is not yet fully understood. The study had no funding source, and the protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database with the ID number CRD42023461495.",Current issues in molecular biology,2024,Paul-Ètefan Panaitescu; Vlad RÄzniceanu; Ètefania-Maria Mocrei-Rebrean; Vlad Sever Neculicioiu; Hanna-Maria DragoÈ; Carmen Costache; Gabriela Adriana Filip
39177611,"The Associations Among Gut Microbiota, Branched Chain Amino Acids, and Parkinson's Disease: Mendelian Randomization Study.","In experimental and observational studies, the characteristics of gut microbiota have been associated with Parkinson's disease (PD), among which metabolic pathways played an important role. However, the causality remained unclear.Herein, we aimed to determine the potential impact of gut microbiota and gut microbiota-derived metabolites on PD risk using a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach.We included as exposures gut microbial taxa abundance and gut-derived metabolites (branched chain amino acids [BCAAs]), with PD as the outcome. In addition, we explored whether BCAAs act as a mediating factor in the pathway from gut microbiota to PD.We found evidence of a causality of 15 microbial taxa and PD before and after sensitivity analyses, but not after multiple testing correction. There was significant association between BCAAs levels and the risk of PD, especially isoleucine (ORâ=â0.995, 95% CI 0.992-0.999, pâ=â0.004, pFDRâ=â0.012). In addition, the causality of gut microbiota and BCAAs was also explored that the increased g_Coprococcus abundance can result in the decrease in isoleucine level (ORâ=â1.046; 95% CI, 1.009-1.085; pâ=â0.016).Our findings indicated suggestive association between gut microbiota and its metabolites and PD. Furthermore, higher BCAAs levels were associated with the decreased PD risk. This study may provide new targets for PD treatment, such as dietary BCAAs supplementation.",Journal of Parkinson's disease,2024,Zhenzhen Yan; Guohua Zhao
39168575,Coffee and Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disease marked by dopaminergic neuronal loss and misfolded alpha-synuclein (Î±-syn) accumulation, which results in both motor and cognitive symptoms. Its occurrence grows with age, with a larger prevalence among males. Despite substantial study, effective medicines to reduce or stop the progression of diseases remain elusive. Interest has grown in examining dietary components, such as caffeine present in coffee, for potential medicinal effects. Epidemiological studies imply a lower incidence of PD with coffee drinking, attributable to caffeine's neuroprotective abilities. Beyond caffeine, coffee constituent like chlorogenic acid and cafestol have anti-Parkinsonian benefits. Moreover, coffee use has been related with variations in gut microbiota composition, which may reduce intestinal inflammation and prevent protein misfolding in enteric nerves, perhaps through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. This review gives a summary of the neuroprotective effects of coffee, investigating both its motor and non-motor advantages in individuals with PD as well as in experimental models of PD. We reviewed some bioactive constituents of coffee, their respective interactions with misfolded Î±-syn accumulation, and its emerging mechanisms associated to the gut microbiome.",Progress in brain research,2024,Abraham Olufemi Asuku; Maryam Tayo Ayinla; Tobiloba Samuel Olajide; Toheeb O Oyerinde; Joshua Ayodele Yusuf; Adedamola Aminat Bayo-Olugbami; Grace Ayobami Fajemidagba
38237261,"Rubusoside mitigates neuroinflammation and cellular apoptosis in Parkinson's disease, and alters gut microbiota and metabolite composition.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons within the substantia nigra. Neuroinflammation plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of PD, involving the activation of microglia cells, heightened production of proinflammatory cytokines, and perturbations in the composition of the gut microbiota. Rubusoside (Ru), the principal steviol bisglucoside present in Rubus chingii var. suavissimus (S.K.Lee) L.T.Lu (Rosaceae), has been documented for its anti-inflammatory properties in diverse disease models. Nonetheless, there is an imperative need to comprehensively assess and elucidate the protective and anti-inflammatory attributes of Ru concerning PD, as well as to uncover the underlying mechanism involved.The aim of this study is to evaluate the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of Ru on PD and investigate its potential mechanisms associated with microbes.We pre-treated mice and cell lines with Ru in order to simulate the progression of PD and the neuroinflammatory state. The mouse model was induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), SN4741 cells were induced by 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridine (mpp<sup>+</sup>), and BV-2 cells were induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We assessed the impact of Ru on motor function, neuroinflammation, neuron apoptosis, the composition of gut microbes, and their metabolites.Ru treatment reduces the release of pro-inflammatory mediators by inhibiting microglia activation. It also prevents neuronal apoptosis, thereby safeguarding dopaminergic neurons and ameliorating motor dysfunction. Furthermore, it induces alterations in the fecal microbiota composition and metabolites profile in PD mice. In vitro experiments have demonstrated that Ru inhibits neuronal apoptosis in SN4741 cells induced by mpp<sup>+</sup>, suppresses the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, and activates the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-ÎºB) signaling pathways.Ru exhibits inhibitory effects on the MPTP-induced PD model by mitigating neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis while also inducing changes in the gut microbiota and metabolite composition.",Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,2024,Tianyu Meng; Yufei Zhang; Jing Huang; Vijay Pandey; Shoupeng Fu; Shaohua Ma

38974034,Gut-directed therapy in Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common and slow-progressing neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms, including gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunctions. Over the last years, the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis is emerging as a bacterial-neuro-immune ascending pathway that contributes to the progression of PD. Indeed, PD patients are characterized by changes in gut microbiota composition, alterations of intestinal epithelial barrier (IEB) and enteric neurogenic/inflammatory responses that, besides determining intestinal disturbances, contribute to brain pathology. In this context, despite the causal relationship between gut dysbiosis, impaired MGB axis and PD remains to be elucidated, emerging evidence shows that MGB axis modulation can represent a suitable therapeutical strategy for the treatment of PD. This review provides an overview of the available knowledge about the beneficial effects of gut-directed therapies, including dietary interventions, prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), in both PD patients and animal models. In this context, particular attention has been devoted to the mechanisms by which the modulation of MGB axis could halt or slow down PD pathology and, most importantly, how these approaches can be included in the clinical practice.",Frontiers in pharmacology,2024,Laura Benvenuti; Clelia Di Salvo; Gabriele Bellini; Luisa Seguella; Francesco Rettura; Giuseppe Esposito; Luca Antonioli; Roberto Ceravolo; Nunzia Bernardini; Carolina Pellegrini; Matteo Fornai
39036341,The gut microbiota-brain axis in neurological disorders.,"Previous studies have shown a bidirectional communication between human gut microbiota and the brain, known as the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA). The MGBA influences the host's nervous system development, emotional regulation, and cognitive function through neurotransmitters, immune modulation, and metabolic pathways. Factors like diet, lifestyle, genetics, and environment shape the gut microbiota composition together. Most research have explored how gut microbiota regulates host physiology and its potential in preventing and treating neurological disorders. However, the individual heterogeneity of gut microbiota, strains playing a dominant role in neurological diseases, and the interactions of these microbial metabolites with the central/peripheral nervous systems still need exploration. This review summarizes the potential role of gut microbiota in driving neurodevelopmental disorders (autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder), neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease), and mood disorders (anxiety and depression) in recent years and discusses the current clinical and preclinical gut microbe-based interventions, including dietary intervention, probiotics, prebiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation. It also puts forward the current insufficient research on gut microbiota in neurological disorders and provides a framework for further research on neurological disorders.",MedComm,2024,Mingming You; Nan Chen; Yuanyuan Yang; Lingjun Cheng; Hongzhang He; Yanhua Cai; Yating Liu; Haiyue Liu; Guolin Hong
37307829,Relationships Between Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder and Parkinson's Disease: Indication from Gut Microbiota Alterations.,"Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) has a close relationship with Parkinson's disease (PD) and was even regarded as the most reliable hallmark of prodromal PD. RBD might have similar changes in gut dysbiosis to PD, but the relationship between RBD and PD in gut microbial alterations is rarely studied. In this study, we aim to investigate whether there were consistent changes between RBD and PD in gut microbiota, and found some specific biomarkers in RBD that might indicate phenoconversion to PD. Alpha-diversity showed no remarkable difference and beta-diversity showed significant differences based on the unweighted (R = 0.035, P = 0.037) and weighted (R = 0.0045, P = 0.008) UniFrac analysis among idiopathic RBD (iRBD), PD with RBD, PD without RBD and normal controls (NC). Enterotype distribution indicated iRBD, PD with RBD and PD without RBD were Ruminococcus-dominant while NC were Bacteroides-dominant. 7 genera (4 increased: Aerococcus, Eubacterium, Gordonibacter and Stenotrophomonas, 3 decreased: Butyricicoccus, Faecalibacterium and Haemophilus) were consistently changed in iRBD and PD with RBD. Among them, 4 genera (Aerococcus, Eubacterium, Butyricicoccus, Faecalibacterium) remained distinctive in the comparison between PD with RBD and PD without RBD. Through clinical correlation analysis, Butyricicoccus and Faecalibacterium were found negatively correlated with the severity of RBD (RBD-HK). Functional analysis showed iRBD had similarly increased staurosporine biosynthesis to PD with RBD. Our study indicates that RBD had similar gut microbial changes to PD. Decreased Butyricicoccus and Faecalibacterium might be potential hallmarks of phenoconversion of RBD to PD.",Aging and disease,2024,Pingchen Zhang; Pei Huang; Yuanyuan Li; Juanjuan Du; Ningdi Luo; Yixi He; Jin Liu; Guiying He; Shishuang Cui; Weishan Zhang; Gen Li; Xin Shen; Liu Jun; Shengdi Chen
39134825,Gut Microbiota-Induced Modulation of the Central Nervous System Function in Parkinson's Disease Through the Gut-Brain Axis and Short-Chain Fatty Acids.,"Recent insights into Parkinson's disease (PD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, suggest a significant influence of the gut microbiome on its pathogenesis and progression through the gut-brain axis. This study integrates 16S rRNA sequencing, high-throughput transcriptomic sequencing, and animal model experiments to explore the molecular mechanisms underpinning the role of gut-brain axis in PD, with a focus on short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) mediated by the SCFA receptors FFAR2 and FFAR3. Our findings highlighted prominent differences in the gut microbiota composition between PD patients and healthy individuals, particularly in taxa such as Escherichia_Shigella and Bacteroidetes, which potentially impact SCFA levels through secondary metabolite biosynthesis. Notably, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from healthy to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse models significantly improved motor function, enhanced dopamine and serotonin levels in the striatum, and increased the number of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra while reducing glial cell activation. This therapeutic effect was associated with increased levels of SCFAs such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate in the gut of MPTP-lesioned mice. Moreover, transcriptomic analyses revealed upregulated expression of FFAR2 and FFAR3 in MPTP-lesioned mice, indicating their crucial role in mediating the benefits of FMT on the central nervous system. These results provide compelling evidence that gut microbiota and SCFAs play a critical role in modulating the gut-brain axis, offering new insights into PD's etiology and potential targets for therapeutic intervention.",Molecular neurobiology,2024,Yiting Ni; Qiaowen Tong; Mengying Xu; Jiayi Gu; Hua Ye
38649365,Diet and the gut microbiome in patients with Parkinson's disease.,"It has been suggested that gut microbiota influence Parkinson's disease (PD) via the gut-brain axis. Here, we examine associations between diet and gut microbiome composition and its predicted functional pathways in patients with PD. We assessed gut microbiota in fecal samples from 85 PD patients in central California using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Diet quality was assessed by calculating the Healthy Eating Index 2015 (HEI-2015) based on the Diet History Questionnaire II. We examined associations of diet quality, fiber, and added sugar intake with microbial diversity, composition, taxon abundance, and predicted metagenomic profiles, adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and sequencing platform. Higher HEI scores and fiber intake were associated with an increase in putative anti-inflammatory butyrate-producing bacteria, such as the genera Butyricicoccus and Coprococcus 1. Conversely, higher added sugar intake was associated with an increase in putative pro-inflammatory bacteria, such as the genera Klebsiella. Predictive metagenomics suggested that bacterial genes involved in the biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharide decreased with higher HEI scores, whereas a simultaneous decrease in genes involved in taurine degradation indicates less neuroinflammation. We found that a healthy diet, fiber, and added sugar intake affect the gut microbiome composition and its predicted metagenomic function in PD patients. This suggests that a healthy diet may support gut microbiome that has a positive influence on PD risk and progression.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2024,Dayoon Kwon; Keren Zhang; Kimberly C Paul; Aline D Folle; Irish Del Rosario; Jonathan P Jacobs; Adrienne M Keener; Jeff M Bronstein; Beate Ritz

Extensive research has implicated the gut microbiota in various central nervous system disorders, including anxiety disorders, depression, and Parkinson's disease. Some studies have also suggested that migraine may stem from disruptions to neurohormones and metabolism. This study aimed to investigate the disparities in gut microbiota and metabolites between migraine mice model and normal mice to shed light on the underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutic approaches. Distinct differences in gut microbial composition were observed between the migraine mouse model and normal mouse, indicating a potential correlation between these variations and the pathogenesis of migraine. This study provides evidence of differences in gut microbiota composition and metabolites between a migraine mouse model and normal mice, which showed that Akkermansiaceae constituted the most abundant taxon in the sham injection mouse group, while Lachnospiraceae constituted the most prevalent group in the migraine mouse model group. The associations between the abundances of <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> and Lachnospiraceae bacteria and metabolites suggested their potential roles in the pathogenesis of migraine. The altered abundance of Lachnospiraceae observed in migraine-afflicted mice and its correlations with changes in metabolites suggest that it may affect the host's health. Thus, probiotic therapy emerges as a possible treatment for migraine. Moreover, significant disparities in gut metabolites were observed between the migraine mouse model and normal mice. These alterations encompass multiple metabolic pathways, suggesting that metabolic disturbances may also contribute to the development of migraines.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2023,Dan Wang; Xu Liu; Suming Shi; Tongli Ren; Wuqing Wang

38989933,Gut microbiota-astrocyte axis: new insights into age-related cognitive decline.,"With the rapidly aging human population, age-related cognitive decline and dementia are becoming increasingly prevalent worldwide. Aging is considered the main risk factor for cognitive decline and acts through alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota, microbial metabolites, and the functions of astrocytes. The microbiota-gut-brain axis has been the focus of multiple studies and is closely associated with cognitive function. This article provides a comprehensive review of the specific changes that occur in the composition of the gut microbiota and microbial metabolites in older individuals and discusses how the aging of astrocytes and reactive astrocytosis are closely related to age-related cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases. This article also summarizes the gut microbiota components that affect astrocyte function, mainly through the vagus nerve, immune responses, circadian rhythms, and microbial metabolites. Finally, this article summarizes the mechanism by which the gut microbiota-astrocyte axis plays a role in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Our findings have revealed the critical role of the microbiota-astrocyte axis in age-related cognitive decline, aiding in a deeper understanding of potential gut microbiome-based adjuvant therapy strategies for this condition.",Neural regeneration research,2025,Lan Zhang; Jingge Wei; Xilei Liu; Dai Li; Xiaoqi Pang; Fanglian Chen; Hailong Cao; Ping Lei
38344171,The interplay between microbiota and brain-gut axis in epilepsy treatment.,"The brain-gut axis plays a vital role in connecting the cognitive and emotional centers of the brain with the intricate workings of the intestines. An imbalance in the microbiota-mediated brain-gut axis extends far beyond conditions like Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and obesity, playing a critical role in the development and progression of various neurological disorders, including epilepsy, depression, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD). Epilepsy, a brain disorder characterized by unprovoked seizures, affects approximately 50 million people worldwide. Accumulating evidence suggests that rebuilding the gut microbiota through interventions such as fecal microbiota transplantation, probiotics, and ketogenic diets (KD) can benefit drug-resistant epilepsy. The disturbances in the gut microbiota could contribute to the toxic side effects of antiepileptic drugs and the development of drug resistance in epilepsy patients. These findings imply the potential impact of the gut microbiota on epilepsy and suggest that interventions targeting the microbiota, such as the KD, hold promise for managing and treating epilepsy. However, the full extent of the importance of microbiota in epilepsy treatment is not yet fully understood, and many aspects of this field remain unclear. Therefore, this article aims to provide an overview of the clinical and animal evidence supporting the regulatory role of gut microbiota in epilepsy, and of potential pathways within the brain-gut axis that may be influenced by the gut microbiota in epilepsy. Furthermore, we will discuss the recent advancements in epilepsy treatment, including the KD, fecal microbiota transplantation, and antiseizure drugs, all from the perspective of the gut microbiota.",Frontiers in pharmacology,2024,Hanxiao Zhu; Wei Wang; Yun Li
38237031,The contribution of age-related changes in the gut-brain axis to neurological disorders.,"Trillions of microbes live symbiotically in the host, specifically in mucosal tissues such as the gut. Recent advances in metagenomics and metabolomics have revealed that the gut microbiota plays a critical role in the regulation of host immunity and metabolism, communicating through bidirectional interactions in the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA). The gut microbiota regulates both gut and systemic immunity and contributes to the neurodevelopment and behaviors of the host. With aging, the composition of the microbiota changes, and emerging studies have linked these shifts in microbial populations to age-related neurological diseases (NDs). Preclinical studies have demonstrated that gut microbiota-targeted therapies can improve behavioral outcomes in the host by modulating microbial, metabolomic, and immunological profiles. In this review, we discuss the pathways of brain-to-gut or gut-to-brain signaling and summarize the role of gut microbiota and microbial metabolites across the lifespan and in disease. We highlight recent studies investigating 1) microbial changes with aging; 2) how aging of the maternal microbiome can affect offspring health; and 3) the contribution of the microbiome to both chronic age-related diseases (e.g., Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and cerebral amyloidosis), and acute brain injury, including ischemic stroke and traumatic brain injury.",Gut microbes,2024,Romeesa Khan; Claudia M Di GesÃ¹; Juneyoung Lee; Louise D McCullough
38848023,The connection between gut microbiota and its metabolites with neurodegenerative diseases in humans.,"The aging of populations is a global phenomenon that follows a possible increase in the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases. Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Multiple Sclerosis, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and Huntington's diseases are some neurodegenerative disorders that aging could initiate or aggravate. Recent research has indicated that intestinal microbiota dysbiosis can trigger metabolism and brain functioning, contributing to the etiopathogenesis of those neurodegenerative diseases. The intestinal microbiota and its metabolites show significant functions in various aspects, such as the immune system modulation (development and maturation), the maintenance of the intestinal barrier integrity, the modulation of neuromuscular functions in the intestine, and the facilitation of essential metabolic processes for both the microbiota and humans. The primary evidence supporting the connection between intestinal microbiota and its metabolites with neurodegenerative diseases are epidemiological observations and animal models experimentation. This paper reviews up-to-date evidence on the correlation between the microbiota-gut-brain axis and neurodegenerative diseases, with a specially focus on gut metabolites. Dysbiosis can increase inflammatory cytokines and bacterial metabolites, altering intestinal and blood-brain barrier permeability and causing neuroinflammation, thus facilitating the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Clinical data supporting this evidence still needs to be improved. Most of the works found are descriptive and associated with the presence of phyla or species of bacteria with neurodegenerative diseases. Despite the limitations of recent research, the potential for elucidating clinical questions that have thus far eluded clarification within prevailing pathophysiological frameworks of health and disease is promising through investigation of the interplay between the host and microbiota.",Metabolic brain disease,2024,JoÃ£o Paulo Fabi
39113894,Exploring Causal Links Between Gut Microbiota and Geriatric Syndromes: A Two-Sample Mendelian Randomization Analysis.,"<b>Background:</b> Both observational studies and clinical trials have demonstrated a link between the gut microbiota and the geriatric syndrome. Nevertheless, the exact nature of this relationship, particularly concerning causality, remains elusive. Mendelian randomization (MR) is a method of inference based on genetic variation to assess the causal relationship between an exposure and an outcome. In this study, we conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (TSMR) study to fully reveal the potential genetic causal effects of gut microbiota on geriatric syndromes. <b>Methods:</b> This study used data from genome wide association studies (GWAS) to investigate causal relationships between the gut microbiota and geriatric syndromes, including frailty, Parkinson's disease (PD), delirium, insomnia, and depression. The primary causal relationships were evaluated using the inverse-variance weighted method, MR Egger, simple mode, weighted mode and weighted median. To assess the robustness of the results, horizontal pleiotropy was examined through MR-Egger intercept and MR-presso methods. Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran's Q test, and sensitivity was evaluated via the leave-one-out method. <b>Results:</b> We identified 41 probable causal relationships between gut microbiota and five geriatric syndrome-associated illnesses using the inverse-variance weighted method. Frailty showed five positive and two negative causal relationships, while PD revealed three positive and four negative causal connections. Delirium showed three positive and two negative causal relationships. Similarly, insomnia demonstrated nine positive and two negative causal connections, while depression presented nine positive and two negative causal relationships. <b>Conclusions:</b> Using the TSMR method and data from the public GWAS database and, we observed associations between specific microbiota groups and geriatric syndromes. These findings suggest a potential role of gut microbiota in the development of geriatric syndromes, providing valuable insights for further research into the causal relationship between gut microbiota and these syndromes.",International journal of medical sciences,2024,Qiuru Yao; Ling Chen; Yuxin Cai; Changxi Li; Shuyang Wen; Chun Yang; Qi Zhang; Yuting Zeng; Shuqi Zheng; Jihua Zou; Guozhi Huang; Qing Zeng
38409641,Neuroprotective Effects of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis NJ241 in a Mouse Model of Parkinson's Disease: Implications for Gut Microbiota and PGC-1Î±.,"Intestinal dysbiosis plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), and probiotics have emerged as potential modulators of central nervous system function through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. This study aimed to elucidate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of the probiotic strain Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis NJ241 (NJ241) in a mouse model of PD induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). The impact of NJ241 was comprehensively assessed in PD mice through behavioral tests, immunofluorescence, Western blotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), 16S rRNA sequencing, and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) detection. NJ241 exhibited notable efficacy in mitigating MPTP-induced weight loss, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and behavioral deficits in mice. Furthermore, it demonstrated protected against MPTP-induced dopaminergic neuron death and inhibited the activation of glial cells in the substantia nigra (SN). NJ241 demonstrated the ability to normalized dysbiosis in the intestinal microbiota and elevate SCFA levels in PD mice. Additionally, NJ241 reversed MPTP-induced reductions in colonic GLP-1 levels and the expression of GLP-1R and PGC-1Î± in the SN. Notably, GLP-1R antagonists partially reversed the inhibitory effects of NJ241 on the activation of glial cells in the SN. In summary, NJ241 exerts a neuroprotective effect against MPTP-induced neuroinflammation by enhancing intestinal GLP-1 levels and activating nigral PGC-1Î± signaling. These findings provide a rationale for the exploration and development of probiotic-based therapeutic strategies for PD.",Molecular neurobiology,2024,Yuxuan Dong; Yueyan Qi; Jinhu Chen; Siyuan Han; Wenjing Su; Xin Ma; Yang Yu; Yanqin Wang
38686220,"Safety and efficacy of faecal microbiota transplantation in patients with mild to moderate Parkinson's disease (GUT-PARFECT): a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, phase 2 trial.","Dysregulation of the gut microbiome has been implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD). This study aimed to evaluate the clinical effects and safety of a single faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in patients with early-stage PD.The GUT-PARFECT trial, a single-centre randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at Ghent University Hospital between December 01, 2020 and December 12, 2022. Participants (aged 50-65 years, Hoehn and Yahr stage 2) were randomly assigned to receive nasojejunal FMT with either healthy donor stool or their own stool. Computer-generated randomisation was done in a 1:1 ratio through permutated-block scheduling. Treatment allocation was concealed for participants and investigators. The primary outcome measure at 12 months was the change in the Movement Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) motor score obtained during off-medication evaluations. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed using a mixed model for repeated measures analysis. This completed trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03808389).Between December 2020 and December 2021, FMT procedures were conducted on 46 patients with PD: 22 in the healthy donor group and 24 in the placebo group. Clinical evaluations were performed at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months post-FMT. Full data analysis was possible for 21 participants in the healthy donor group and 22 in the placebo group. After 12 months, the MDS-UPDRS motor score significantly improved by a mean of 5.8 points (95% CIÂ -11.4 toÂ -0.2) in the healthy donor group and by 2.7 points (-8.3 to 2.9) in the placebo group (pÂ =Â 0.0235). Adverse events were limited to temporary abdominal discomfort.Our findings suggested a single FMT induced mild, but long-lasting beneficial effects on motor symptoms in patients with early-stage PD. These findings highlight the potential of modulating the gut microbiome as a therapeutic approach and warrant a further exploration of FMT in larger cohorts of patients with PD in various disease stages.Flemish PD patient organizations (VPL and Parkili), Research Foundation Flanders (FWO), Biocodex Microbiota Foundation.",EClinicalMedicine,2024,Arnout Bruggeman; Charysse Vandendriessche; Hannelore Hamerlinck; Danny De Looze; David J Tate; Marnik Vuylsteke; Lindsey De Commer; Lindsay Devolder; Jeroen Raes; Bruno Verhasselt; Debby Laukens; Roosmarijn E Vandenbroucke; Patrick Santens
38385354,<i>Gastrodia elata</i> polysaccharide alleviates Parkinson's disease <i>via</i> inhibiting apoptotic and inflammatory signaling pathways and modulating the gut microbiota.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common, chronic, and progressive degenerative disease of the central nervous system for which there is no effective treatment. <i>Gastrodia elata</i> is a well-known food and medicine homologous resource with neuroprotective potential. <i>Gastrodia elata</i> polysaccharide (GEP), which is a highly active and safe component in <i>Gastrodia elata</i>, is an important ingredient in the development of functional products. In this study, GEP was administered to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced mice over 3 weeks to investigate its neuroprotective effects. The results showed that GEP significantly alleviated the motor dysfunction of PD mice, inhibited the accumulation of Î±-synuclein, and reduced the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the brain. Moreover, GEP increased the Bcl-2/Bax ratio and decreased the cleaved-caspase-3 level, suggesting that GEP may ameliorate PD by preventing MPTP-induced mitochondrial apoptosis. GEP also significantly inhibited the increase of GFAP and decreased the levels of TNF-Î±, IL-1Î², and IL-6 in the brain of PD mice, which may be the result of the inhibition of neuroinflammation by the inactivation of the TLR4/NF-ÎºB pathway. Furthermore, the neuroprotective effects of GEP involve the gut-brain axis, as it has been shown that GEP regulated the dysbiosis of PD-related gut microbiota such as <i>Akkermansia</i>, <i>Lactobacillus</i>, <i>Bacteroides</i>, <i>Prevotella</i>, and <i>Faecalibacterium</i>, increased the content of microbial metabolites SCFAs in the colon and increased the level of occludin that repairs the intestinal barrier of PD mice. In conclusion, this study is expected to provide a theoretical basis for the development and application of functional products with GEP from the perspective of neuroprotective effects.",Food & function,2024,Qing-Xia Gan; Mao-Yao Peng; Hao-Bo Wei; Lin-Lin Chen; Xiao-Yan Chen; Zi-Han Li; Guang-Qin An; Yun-Tong Ma
38211635,Microbiota-microglia crosstalk between Blautia producta and neuroinflammation of Parkinson's disease: A bench-to-bedside translational approach.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is intricately linked to abnormal gut microbiota, yet the specific microbiota influencing clinical outcomes remain poorly understood. Our study identified a deficiency in the microbiota genus Blautia and a reduction in fecal short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) butyrate level in PD patients compared to healthy controls. The abundance of Blautia correlated with the clinical severity of PD. Supplementation with butyrate-producing bacterium B. producta demonstrated neuroprotective effects, attenuating neuroinflammation and dopaminergic neuronal death in mice, consequently ameliorating motor dysfunction. A pivotal inflammatory signaling pathway, the RAS-related pathway, modulated by butyrate, emerged as a key mechanism inhibiting microglial activation in PD. The change of RAS-NF-ÎºB pathway in PD patients was observed. Furthermore, B. producta-derived butyrate demonstrated the inhibition of microglial activation in PD through regulation of the RAS-NF-ÎºB pathway. These findings elucidate the causal relationship between specific gut microbiota and PD, presenting a novel microbiota-based treatment perspective for PD.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2024,Jiaming Liu; Xinhuang Lv; Tao Ye; Ming Zhao; Zhibo Chen; Yang Zhang; Wenwen Yang; Huijia Xie; Lu Zhan; Liuzhu Chen; Wen-Chun Liu; Kuan-Pin Su; Jing Sun

38755164,Gut microbiota produces biofilm-associated amyloids with potential for neurodegeneration.,"Age-related neurodegenerative diseases involving amyloid aggregation remain one of the biggest challenges of modern medicine. Alterations in the gastrointestinal microbiome play an active role in the aetiology of neurological disorders. Here, we dissect the amyloidogenic properties of biofilm-associated proteins (BAPs) of the gut microbiota and their implications for synucleinopathies. We demonstrate that BAPs are naturally assembled as amyloid-like fibrils in insoluble fractions isolated from the human gut microbiota. We show that BAP genes are part of the accessory genomes, revealing microbiome variability. Remarkably, the abundance of certain BAP genes in the gut microbiome is correlated with Parkinson's disease (PD) incidence. Using cultured dopaminergic neurons and Caenorhabditis elegans models, we report that BAP-derived amyloids induce Î±-synuclein aggregation. Our results show that the chaperone-mediated autophagy is compromised by BAP amyloids. Indeed, inoculation of BAP fibrils into the brains of wild-type mice promote key pathological features of PD. Therefore, our findings establish the use of BAP amyloids as potential targets and biomarkers of Î±-synucleinopathies.",Nature communications,2024,Ariadna FernÃ¡ndez-Calvet; Leticia Matilla-Cuenca; MarÃ­a Izco; Susanna Navarro; Miriam Serrano; Salvador Ventura; Javier Blesa; Maite HerrÃ¡iz; Gorka Alkorta-Aranburu; Sergio Galera; Igor Ruiz de Los Mozos; MarÃ­a Luisa Mansego; Alejandro Toledo-Arana; Lydia Alvarez-Erviti; Jaione Valle

It is known for its essential biological effects, such as antioxidant activity, circadian rhythm regulator, and immunomodulatory effects. The gut is one of the primary known sources of melatonin. The gut microbiota helps produce melatonin from tryptophan, and melatonin has been shown to have a beneficial effect on gut barrier function and microbial population. Dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota is associated with bacterial imbalance and decreased beneficial microbial metabolites, including melatonin. In this way, low melatonin levels may be related to several human diseases. Melatonin has shown both preventive and therapeutic effects against various conditions, including neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis.

38244807,Potential effects of the most prescribed drugs on the microbiota-gut-brain-axis: A review.,"The link between drug-induced dysbiosis and its influence on brain diseases through gut-residing bacteria and their metabolites, named the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA), remains largely unexplored. This review investigates the effects of commonly prescribed drugs (metformin, statins, proton-pump-inhibitors, NSAIDs, and anti-depressants) on the gut microbiota, comparing the findings with altered bacterial populations in major brain diseases (depression, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's). The report aims to explore whether drugs can influence the development and progression of brain diseases via the MGBA. Central findings indicate that all explored drugs induce dysbiosis. These dysbiosis patterns were associated with brain disorders. The influence on brain diseases varied across different bacterial taxa, possibly mediated by direct effects or through bacterial metabolites. Each drug induced both positive and negative changes in the abundance of bacteria, indicating a counterbalancing effect. Moreover, the above-mentioned drugs exhibited similar effects, suggesting that they may counteract or enhance each other's effects on brain diseases when taken together by comorbid patients. In conclusion, the interplay of bacterial species and their abundances may have a greater impact on brain diseases than individual drugs or bacterial strains. Future research is needed to better understand drug-induced dysbiosis and the implications for brain disease pathogenesis, with the potential to develop more effective therapeutic options for patients with brain-related diseases.",Brain research bulletin,2024,Kirti Garg; M Hasan Mohajeri
38435303,Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota and its effect on Î±-synuclein and prion protein misfolding: consequences for neurodegeneration.,"Abnormal behavior of Î±-synuclein and prion proteins is the hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD) and prion illnesses, respectively, being complex neurological disorders. A primary cause of protein aggregation, brain injury, and cognitive loss in prion illnesses is the misfolding of normal cellular prion proteins (PrP<sup>C</sup>) into an infectious form (PrP<sup>Sc</sup>). Aggregation of Î±-synuclein causes disruptions in cellular processes in Parkinson's disease (PD), leading to loss of dopamine-producing neurons and motor symptoms. Alteration in the composition or activity of gut microbes may weaken the intestinal barrier and make it possible for prions to go from the gut to the brain. The gut-brain axis is linked to neuroinflammation; the metabolites produced by the gut microbiota affect the aggregation of Î±-synuclein, regulate inflammation and immunological responses, and may influence the course of the disease and neurotoxicity of proteins, even if their primary targets are distinct proteins. This thorough analysis explores the complex interactions that exist between the gut microbiota and neurodegenerative illnesses, particularly Parkinson's disease (PD) and prion disorders. The involvement of the gut microbiota, a complex collection of bacteria, archaea, fungi, viruses etc., in various neurological illnesses is becoming increasingly recognized. The gut microbiome influences neuroinflammation, neurotransmitter synthesis, mitochondrial function, and intestinal barrier integrity through the gut-brain axis, which contributes to the development and progression of disease. The review delves into the molecular mechanisms that underlie these relationships, emphasizing the effects of microbial metabolites such as bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in regulating brain functioning. Additionally, it looks at how environmental influences and dietary decisions affect the gut microbiome and whether they could be risk factors for neurodegenerative illnesses. This study concludes by highlighting the critical role that the gut microbiota plays in the development of Parkinson's disease (PD) and prion disease. It also provides a promising direction for future research and possible treatment approaches.

The gut microbiome, profoundly influenced by dietary factors, emerges as a key player. Nutrition during the first 1000 days of life shapes the gut microbiota composition, influencing immune responses and impacting both child development and adult health. High-fat, high-sugar diets can disrupt this delicate balance, contributing to inflammation and immune dysfunction. Exploring nutritional strategies, the Mediterranean diet's anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties show promise in reducing Parkinson's disease risk. Microbiome-targeted dietary approaches and the ketogenic diet hold the potential in improving brain disorders. Beyond nutrition, emerging research uncovers potential interactions between steroid hormones, nutrition, and Parkinson's disease. Progesterone, with its anti-inflammatory properties and presence in the nervous system, offers a novel option for Parkinson's disease therapy. Its ability to enhance neuroprotection within the enteric nervous system presents exciting prospects. The review addresses the hypothesis that Î±-synuclein aggregates originate from the gut and may enter the brain via the vagus nerve. Gastrointestinal symptoms preceding motor symptoms support this hypothesis. Dysfunctional gut-brain signaling during gut dysbiosis contributes to inflammation and neurotransmitter imbalances, emphasizing the potential of microbiota-based interventions. In summary, this review uncovers the complex web of interactions between nutrition, the gut microbiome, steroid hormones, and Parkinson's disease within the gut-brain axis framework. Understanding these connections not only offers novel therapeutic insights but also illuminates the origins of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease.",Neural regeneration research,2024,Paula Maria Neufeld; Ralf A Nettersheim; Veronika Matschke; Matthias Vorgerd; Sarah Stahlke; Carsten Theiss

39300699,Microbiota-gut-brain axis in health and neurological disease: Interactions between gut microbiota and the nervous system.,"Along with mounting evidence that gut microbiota and their metabolites migrate endogenously to distal organs, the 'gut-lung axis,' 'gut-brain axis,' 'gut-liver axis' and 'gut-renal axis' have been established. Multiple animal recent studies have demonstrated gut microbiota may also be a key susceptibility factor for neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and autism. The gastrointestinal tract is innervated by the extrinsic sympathetic and vagal nerves and the intrinsic enteric nervous system, and the gut microbiota interacts with the nervous system to maintain homeostatic balance in the host gut. A total of 1507 publications on the interactions between the gut microbiota, the gut-brain axis and neurological disorders are retrieved from the Web of Science to investigate the interactions between the gut microbiota and the nervous system and the underlying mechanisms involved in normal and disease states. We provide a comprehensive overview of the effects of the gut microbiota and its metabolites on nervous system function and neurotransmitter secretion, as well as alterations in the gut microbiota in neurological disorders, to provide a basis for the possibility of targeting the gut microbiota as a therapeutic agent for neurological disorders.",Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,2024,Yuhong He; Ke Wang; Niri Su; Chongshan Yuan; Naisheng Zhang; Xiaoyu Hu; Yunhe Fu; Feng Zhao
39161161,Fecal microbiota from patients with Parkinson's disease intensifies inflammation and neurodegeneration in A53T mice.,"We evaluated the potential of Parkinson's disease (PD) fecal microbiota transplantation to initiate or exacerbate PD pathologies and investigated the underlying mechanisms.We transplanted the fecal microbiota from PD patients into mice by oral gavage and assessed the motor and intestinal functions, as well as the inflammatory and pathological changes in the colon and brain. Furthermore, 16S rRNA gene sequencing combined with metabolomics analysis was conducted to assess the impacts of fecal delivery on the fecal microbiota and metabolism in recipient mice.The fecal microbiota from PD patients increased intestinal inflammation, deteriorated intestinal barrier function, intensified microglia and astrocyte activation, abnormal deposition of Î±-Synuclein, and dopaminergic neuronal loss in the brains of A53T mice. A mechanistic study revealed that the fecal microbiota of PD patients stimulated the TLR4/NF-ÎºB/NLRP3 pathway in both the brain and colon. Additionally, multiomics analysis found that transplantation of fecal microbiota from PD patients not only altered the composition of the gut microbiota but also influenced the fecal metabolic profile of the recipient mice.The fecal microbiota from PD patients intensifies inflammation and neurodegeneration in A53T mice.

38314132,"Relationship among Parkinson's disease, constipation, microbes, and microbiological therapy.","This comprehensive review elucidates the complex interplay between gut microbiota and constipation in Parkinson's disease (PD), a prevalent non-motor symptom contributing significantly to patients' morbidity. A marked alteration in the gut microbiota, predominantly an increase in the abundance of <i>Proteobacteria</i> and <i>Bacteroidetes</i>, is observed in PD-related constipation. Conventional treatments, although safe, have failed to effectively alleviate symptoms, thereby necessitating the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Microbiological interventions such as prebiotics, probiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) hold therapeutic potential. While prebiotics improve bowel movements, probiotics are effective in enhancing stool consistency and alleviating abdominal discomfort. FMT shows potential for significantly alleviating constipation symptoms by restoring gut microbiota balance in patients with PD. Despite promising developments, the causal relationship between changes in gut microbiota and PD-related constipation remains elusive, highlighting the need for further research in this expanding field.",World journal of gastroenterology,2024,Xin-Yang Yuan; Yu-Sen Chen; Zhou Liu

39064171,"The Brain-Gut Axis, an Important Player in Alzheimer and Parkinson Disease: A Narrative Review.","Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), are severe age-related disorders with complex and multifactorial causes. Recent research suggests a critical link between neurodegeneration and the gut microbiome, via the gut-brain communication pathway. This review examines the role of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a gut microbiota-derived metabolite, in the development of AD and PD, and investigates its interaction with microRNAs (miRNAs) along this bidirectional pathway. TMAO, which is produced from dietary metabolites like choline and carnitine, has been linked to increased neuroinflammation, protein misfolding, and cognitive decline. In AD, elevated TMAO levels are associated with amyloid-beta and tau pathologies, blood-brain barrier disruption, and neuronal death. TMAO can cross the blood-brain barrier and promote the aggregation of amyloid and tau proteins. Similarly, TMAO affects alpha-synuclein conformation and aggregation, a hallmark of PD. TMAO also activates pro-inflammatory pathways such as NF-kB signaling, exacerbating neuroinflammation further. Moreover, TMAO modulates the expression of various miRNAs that are involved in neurodegenerative processes. Thus, the gut microbiome-miRNA-brain axis represents a newly discovered mechanistic link between gut dysbiosis and neurodegeneration. MiRNAs regulate the key pathways involved in neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and neuronal death, contributing to disease progression. As a direct consequence, specific miRNA signatures may serve as potential biomarkers for the early detection and monitoring of AD and PD progression. This review aims to elucidate the complex interrelationships between the gut microbiota, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), microRNAs (miRNAs), and the central nervous system, and the implications of these connections in neurodegenerative diseases. In this context, an overview of the current neuroradiology techniques available for studying neuroinflammation and of the animal models used to investigate these intricate pathologies will also be provided. In summary, a bulk of evidence supports the concept that modulating the gut-brain communication pathway through dietary changes, the manipulation of the microbiome, and/or miRNA-based therapies may offer novel approaches for implementing the treatment of debilitating neurological disorders.",Journal of clinical medicine,2024,Eugenio Caradonna; Raffaello Nemni; Angelo Bifone; Patrizia Gandolfo; Lucy Costantino; Luca Giordano; Elisabetta Mormone; Anna Macula; Mariarosa Cuomo; Rossana Difruscolo; Camilla Vanoli; Emilio Vanoli; Fulvio Ferrara
38727306,From the Gut to the Brain: Is Microbiota a New Paradigm in Parkinson's Disease Treatment?,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is recognized as the second most prevalent primary chronic neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system. Clinically, PD is characterized as a movement disorder, exhibiting an incidence and mortality rate that is increasing faster than any other neurological condition. In recent years, there has been a growing interest concerning the role of the gut microbiota in the etiology and pathophysiology of PD. The establishment of a brain-gut microbiota axis is now real, with evidence denoting a bidirectional communication between the brain and the gut microbiota through metabolic, immune, neuronal, and endocrine mechanisms and pathways. Among these, the vagus nerve represents the most direct form of communication between the brain and the gut. Given the potential interactions between bacteria and drugs, it has been observed that the therapies for PD can have an impact on the composition of the microbiota. Therefore, in the scope of the present review, we will discuss the current understanding of gut microbiota on PD and whether this may be a new paradigm for treating this devastating disease.",Cells,2024,Cristiana Vilela; Bruna AraÃºjo; Carla Soares-Guedes; Rita Caridade-Silva; Joana Martins-Macedo; Catarina Teixeira; Eduardo D Gomes; Cristina PrudÃªncio; MÃ³nica Vieira; FÃ¡bio G Teixeira
38817603,The microbiota-gut-brain-immune interface in the pathogenesis of neuroinflammatory diseases: a narrative review of the emerging literature.,"Research is beginning to elucidate the sophisticated mechanisms underlying the microbiota-gut-brain-immune interface, moving from primarily animal models to human studies. Findings support the dynamic relationships between the gut microbiota as an ecosystem (microbiome) within an ecosystem (host) and its intersection with the host immune and nervous systems. Adding this to the effects on epigenetic regulation of gene expression further complicates and strengthens the response. At the heart is inflammation, which manifests in a variety of pathologies including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Multiple Sclerosis (MS).Generally, the research to date is limited and has focused on bacteria, likely due to the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of 16s rRNA sequencing, despite its lower resolution and inability to determine functional ability/alterations. However, this omits all other microbiota including fungi, viruses, and phages, which are emerging as key members of the human microbiome. Much of the research has been done in pre-clinical models and/or in small human studies in more developed parts of the world. The relationships observed are promising but cannot be considered reliable or generalizable at this time. Specifically, causal relationships cannot be determined currently. More research has been done in Alzheimer's disease, followed by Parkinson's disease, and then little in MS. The data for MS is encouraging despite this.While the research is still nascent, the microbiota-gut-brain-immune interface may be a missing link, which has hampered our progress on understanding, let alone preventing, managing, or putting into remission neurodegenerative diseases. Relationships must first be established in humans, as animal models have been shown to poorly translate to complex human physiology and environments, especially when investigating the human gut microbiome and its relationships where animal models are often overly simplistic. Only then can robust research be conducted in humans and using mechanistic model systems.",Frontiers in immunology,2024,Alison Warren; Yvonne Nyavor; Nikkia Zarabian; Aidan Mahoney; Leigh A Frame

38873926,Associations between gut microbiota characteristics and non-motor symptoms following pharmacological and surgical treatments in Parkinson's disease patients.,"The gut microbiota has been implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD), with alterations observed in microbial composition and reduced microbial species richness, which may influence gastrointestinal symptoms in PD patients. It remains to be determined whether the severity of gastrointestinal symptoms correlates with microbiota variations in PD patients treated pharmacologically or with subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) therapy. This study aims to explore how these treatments affect gut microbiota and gastrointestinal symptoms in PD, identifying specific microbial differences associated with each treatment modality.A total of 42 individuals diagnosed with PD, along with 38 age-matched household control participants, contributed stool samples for microbiota characterization. Differences in the gut microbiota across various groups of PD patients and their households were identified through comprehensive sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing.Differences in microbial communities were observed between PD patients and controls, as well as between PD patients receiving pharmacological treatment and those with STN-DBS. Pharmacologically treated advanced PD patients have higher gastrointestinal dysfunctions. Gut microbiota profile linked to STN-DBS and reduced levodopa consumption, characterized by its anti-inflammatory properties, might play a role in diminishing gastrointestinal dysfunction relative to only pharmacological treatments.Advanced PD patients on medication exhibit more gastrointestinal issues, despite relatively stable microbial diversity, indicating a complex interaction between gut microbiota, PD progression, and treatment effects. An imbalanced gut-brain axis, particularly due to reduced butyrate production, may lead to constipation by affecting the enteric nervous system, which emphasizes the need to incorporate gut microbiome insights into treatment strategies.",Neurogastroenterology and motility,2024,Agnieszka Gorecka-Mazur; Anna Krygowska-Wajs; Agata Furgala; Jiaqi Li; Benjamin Misselwitz; Wojciech Pietraszko; Borys Kwinta; Bahtiyar Yilmaz
37674043,Gut microbiota-induced CXCL1 elevation triggers early neuroinflammation in the substantia nigra of Parkinsonian mice.,"Gut microbiota disturbance and systemic inflammation have been implicated in the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD). How the alteration of gut microbiota results in neuropathological events in PD remains elusive. In this study, we explored whether and how environmental insults caused early neuropathological events in the substantia nigra (SN) of a PD mouse model. Aged (12-month-old) mice were orally administered rotenone (6.25âmgÂ·kg<sup>-1</sup>Â·d<sup>-1</sup>) 5 days per week for 2 months. We demonstrated that oral administration of rotenone to ageing mice was sufficient to establish a PD mouse model and that microglial activation and iron deposition selectively appeared in the SN of the mice prior to loss of motor coordination and dopaminergic neurons, and these events could be fully blocked by microglial elimination with a PLX5622-formulated diet. 16âS rDNA sequencing analysis showed that the gut microbiota in rotenone-treated mice was altered, and mice receiving faecal microbial transplantation (FMT) from ageing mice treated with rotenone for 2 months exhibited the same pathology in the SN. We demonstrated that C-X-C motif chemokine ligand-1 (CXCL1) was an essential molecule, as intravenous injection of CXCL1 mimicked almost all the pathology in serum and SN induced by oral rotenone and FMT. Using metabolomics and transcriptomics analyses, we identified the PPAR pathway as a key pathway involved in rotenone-induced neuronal damage. Inhibition of the PPARÎ³ pathway was consistent in the above models, whereas its activation by linoleic acid (60Â mgÂ·kg<sup>-1</sup>Â·d<sup>-1</sup>, i.g. for 1 week) could block these pathological events in mice intravenously injected with CXCL1. Altogether, these results reveal that the altered gut microbiota resulted in neuroinflammation and iron deposition occurring early in the SN of ageing mice with oral administration of rotenone, much earlier than motor symptoms and dopaminergic neuron loss. We found that CXCL1 plays a crucial role in this process, possibly via PPARÎ³ signalling inhibition. This study may pave the way for understanding the ""brain-gut-microbiota"" molecular regulatory networks in PD pathogenesis.

38694925,Buty and the beast: the complex role of butyrate in Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease which is often associated with gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction. The GI tract is home to a wide range of microorganisms, among which bacteria, that can influence the host through various mechanisms. Products produced by these bacteria can act in the gut but can also exert effects in the brain via what is now well established to be the microbiota-gut-brain axis. In those with PD the gut-bacteria composition is often found to be different to that of non-PD individuals. In addition to compositional changes, the metabolic activity of the gut-microbiota is also changed in PD. Specifically, it is often reported that key producers of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) as well as the concentration of SCFAs themselves are altered in the stool and blood of those with PD. These SCFAs, among which butyrate, are essential nutrients for the host and are a major energy source for epithelial cells of the GI tract. Additionally, butyrate plays a key role in regulating various host responses particularly in relation to inflammation. Studies have demonstrated that a reduction in butyrate levels can have a critical role in the onset and progression of PD. Furthermore, it has been shown that restoring butyrate levels in those with PD through methods such as probiotics, prebiotics, sodium butyrate supplementation, and fecal transplantation can have a beneficial effect on both motor and non-motor outcomes of the disease. This review presents an overview of evidence for the altered gut-bacteria composition and corresponding metabolite production in those with PD, with a particular focus on the SCFA butyrate. In addition to presenting current studies regarding SCFA in clinical and preclinical reports, evidence for the possibility to target butyrate production using microbiome based approaches in a therapeutic context is discussed.",Frontiers in pharmacology,2024,Joshua D Elford; Nanette Becht; Johan Garssen; Aletta D Kraneveld; Paula Perez-Pardo
38449863,Protective effects of fecal microbiota transplantation against ischemic stroke and other neurological disorders: an update.,"The bidirectional communication between the gut and brain or gut-brain axis is regulated by several gut microbes and microbial derived metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids, trimethylamine N-oxide, and lipopolysaccharides. The Gut microbiota (GM) produce neuroactives, specifically neurotransmitters that modulates local and central neuronal brain functions. An imbalance between intestinal commensals and pathobionts leads to a disruption in the gut microbiota or dysbiosis, which affects intestinal barrier integrity and gut-immune and neuroimmune systems. Currently, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is recommended for the treatment of recurrent <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> infection. FMT elicits its action by ameliorating inflammatory responses through the restoration of microbial composition and functionality. Thus, FMT may be a potential therapeutic option in suppressing neuroinflammation in post-stroke conditions and other neurological disorders involving the neuroimmune axis. Specifically, FMT protects against ischemic injury by decreasing IL-17, IFN-Î³, Bax, and increasing Bcl-2 expression. Interestingly, FMT improves cognitive function by lowering amyloid-Î² accumulation and upregulating synaptic marker (PSD-95, synapsin-1) expression in Alzheimer's disease.

39334720,"Redox Homeostasis, Gut Microbiota, and Epigenetics in Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Systematic Review.","Neurodegenerative diseases encompass a spectrum of disorders marked by the progressive degeneration of the structure and function of the nervous system. These conditions, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Multiple sclerosis (MS), often lead to severe cognitive and motor deficits. A critical component of neurodegenerative disease pathologies is the imbalance between pro-oxidant and antioxidant mechanisms, culminating in oxidative stress. The brain's high oxygen consumption and lipid-rich environment make it particularly vulnerable to oxidative damage. Pro-oxidants such as reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are continuously generated during normal metabolism, counteracted by enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant defenses. In neurodegenerative diseases, this balance is disrupted, leading to neuronal damage. This systematic review explores the roles of oxidative stress, gut microbiota, and epigenetic modifications in neurodegenerative diseases, aiming to elucidate the interplay between these factors and identify potential therapeutic strategies. We conducted a comprehensive search of articles published in 2024 across major databases, focusing on studies examining the relationships between redox homeostasis, gut microbiota, and epigenetic changes in neurodegeneration. A total of 161 studies were included, comprising clinical trials, observational studies, and experimental research. Our findings reveal that oxidative stress plays a central role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, with gut microbiota composition and epigenetic modifications significantly influencing redox balance. Specific bacterial taxa and epigenetic markers were identified as potential modulators of oxidative stress, suggesting novel avenues for therapeutic intervention. Moreover, recent evidence from human and animal studies supports the emerging concept of targeting redox homeostasis through microbiota and epigenetic therapies. Future research should focus on validating these targets in clinical settings and exploring the potential for personalized medicine strategies based on individual microbiota and epigenetic profiles.","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2024,Constantin Munteanu; Anca Irina Galaction; Marius Turnea; Corneliu Dan Blendea; Mariana Rotariu; MÄdÄlina PoÈtaru
38227539,Gut microbiota dysbiosis contributes to Î±-synuclein-related pathology associated with C/EBPÎ²/AEP signaling activation in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease.,"JOURNAL/nrgr/04.03/01300535-202409000-00042/figure1/v/2024-01-16T170235Z/r/image-tiff Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor and gastrointestinal dysfunction. Gastrointestinal dysfunction can precede the onset of motor symptoms by several years. Gut microbiota dysbiosis is involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease, whether it plays a causal role in motor dysfunction, and the mechanism underlying this potential effect, remain unknown. CCAAT/enhancer binding protein Î²/asparagine endopeptidase (C/EBPÎ²/AEP) signaling, activated by bacterial endotoxin, can promote Î±-synuclein transcription, thereby contributing to Parkinson's disease pathology. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of the gut microbiota in C/EBPÎ²/AEP signaling, Î±-synuclein-related pathology, and motor symptoms using a rotenone-induced mouse model of Parkinson's disease combined with antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion and fecal microbiota transplantation. We found that rotenone administration resulted in gut microbiota dysbiosis and perturbation of the intestinal barrier, as well as activation of the C/EBP/AEP pathway, Î±-synuclein aggregation, and tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neuron loss in the substantia nigra in mice with motor deficits. However, treatment with rotenone did not have any of these adverse effects in mice whose gut microbiota was depleted by pretreatment with antibiotics. Importantly, we found that transplanting gut microbiota derived from mice treated with rotenone induced motor deficits, intestinal inflammation, and endotoxemia. Transplantation of fecal microbiota from healthy control mice alleviated rotenone-induced motor deficits, intestinal inflammation, endotoxemia, and intestinal barrier impairment. These results highlight the vital role that gut microbiota dysbiosis plays in inducing motor deficits, C/EBPÎ²/AEP signaling activation, and Î±-synuclein-related pathology in a rotenone-induced mouse model of Parkinson's disease. Additionally, our findings suggest that supplementing with healthy microbiota may be a safe and effective treatment that could help ameliorate the progression of motor deficits in patients with Parkinson's disease.",Neural regeneration research,2024,Xiaoli Fang; Sha Liu; Bilal Muhammad; Mingxuan Zheng; Xing Ge; Yan Xu; Shu Kan; Yang Zhang; Yinghua Yu; Kuiyang Zheng; Deqin Geng; Chun-Feng Liu
38840699,Correlation between dietary factors and Parkinson's disease revealed by the analysis of Mendelian randomization.,"The intricate interplay between dietary habits and the development of Parkinson's Disease (PD) has long been a subject of scientific inquiry. Mendelian Randomization (MR) emerges as a potent tool, harnessing genetic variants to infer causality in observational data. While evidence links diet to Parkinson's Disease (PD) etiology, a thorough MR exploration of dietary impacts on PD, particularly involving gut microbiota, is still emerging.This research leverages the IEU Open GWAS project's vast GWAS database to address the knowledge gap in understanding diet's influence on PD, employing a diverse range of dietary variables. Our holistic dataset includes various foods like processed fava beans, bap, red wine, to cheese, reflecting a commitment to untangling dietary complexities in PD etiology. Advancing from initial dietary-PD associations, we innovatively explore the gut microbiota, focusing on <i>Parabacteroides goldsteinii,</i> in relation to bap intake and PD, employing MR. Utilizing weighted median, MR-Egger, and inverse variance weighting methods, we ensure rigorous causality assessments, meticulously mitigating pleiotropy and heterogeneity biases to uphold finding validity.Our findings indicate red wine (OR: 1.031; 95% CI 1.001-1.062; <i>p</i>â=â0.044) and dried fruit consumption (OR: 2.019; 95% CI 1.052-3.875; <i>p</i>â=â0.035) correlate with increased PD risk, whereas broad beans (OR: 0.967; 95% CI 0.939-0.996; <i>p</i>â=â0.024) and bap intake (OR: 0.922; 95% CI 0.860-0.989; <i>p</i>â=â0.023) show protective effects against PD. Employing MR, specifically the IVW method, revealed a significant inverse association between bap intake and gut microbiota, marked by an 8.010-fold decrease in <i>Parabacteroides goldsteinii</i> per standard deviation increase in bap intake (95% CI 1.005-63.818, <i>p</i>â=â0.049). Furthermore, a connection between PD and <i>Parabacteroides goldsteinii</i> was observed (OR: 0.810; 95% CI 0.768-0.999; <i>p</i>â=â0.049), suggesting a potential microbiota-mediated pathway in PD etiology.Our study links dietary habits to PD risk, showing higher PD risk with red wine and dried fruit consumption, and a protective effect from broad beans and bap. Using MR, we found bap intake inversely correlates with <i>Parabacteroides goldsteinii</i> in the gut, suggesting bap influences microbiota. Further, higher <i>Parabacteroides goldsteinii</i> levels correlate with lower PD risk, highlighting a complex interplay of diet, gut microbiome, and neurological health. These insights shed light on potential dietary interventions for PD.",Frontiers in nutrition,2024,Shan Zeng; Aishanjiang Yusufujiang; Chunli Zhang; Chen Yang; Hongyan Li
38957302,Mild cognitive impairment and microbiota: what is known and future perspectives.,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a heterogeneous condition definable as the intermediate clinical state between normal aging and dementia. As a pre-dementia condition, there is a recent growing interest in the identification of non-invasive markers able to predict the progression from MCI to a more advanced stage of the disease. Previous evidence showed the close link between gut microbiota and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Conversely, the actual relationship between gut microbiota and MCI is yet to be clarified. In this work, we provide an overview about the current knowledge regarding the role of gut microbiota in the context of MCI, also assessing the potential for microbiota-targeted therapies. Through the review of the most recent studies focusing on this topic, we found evidence of an increase of Bacteroidetes at phylum level and Bacteroides at genus level in MCI subjects with respect to healthy controls and patients with AD. Despite such initial evidence, the definitive identification of a typical microbiota profile associated with MCI is still far from being achieved. These preliminary results, however, are growingly encouraging research on the role of gut microbiota modulation in improving the cognitive status of pre-dementia subjects. To date, few studies evaluated the role of probiotics in MCI subjects, and they showed favorable results, although still biased by small sample size, heterogeneity of study design and short follow-up.",Frontiers in medicine,2024,Antonella Gallo; Anna Maria Martone; Rosa Liperoti; Maria Camilla Cipriani; Francesca Ibba; Sara Camilli; Fiammetta Maria Rognoni; Francesco Landi; Massimo Montalto
38773112,Meta-analysis of shotgun sequencing of gut microbiota in Parkinson's disease.,"We aimed to identify gut microbial features in Parkinson's disease (PD) across countries by meta-analyzing our fecal shotgun sequencing dataset of 94 PD patients and 73 controls in Japan with five previously reported datasets from USA, Germany, China1, China2, and Taiwan. GC-MS and LC-MS/MS assays were established to quantify fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and fecal polyamines, respectively. Î±-Diversity was increased in PD across six datasets. Taxonomic analysis showed that species Akkermansia muciniphila was increased in PD, while species Roseburia intestinalis and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were decreased in PD. Pathway analysis showed that genes in the biosyntheses of riboflavin and biotin were markedly decreased in PD after adjusting for confounding factors. Five out of six categories in carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) were decreased in PD. Metabolomic analysis of our fecal samples revealed that fecal SCFAs and polyamines were significantly decreased in PD. Genes in the riboflavin and biotin biosyntheses were positively correlated with the fecal concentrations of SCFAs and polyamines. Bacteria that accounted for the decreased riboflavin biosynthesis in Japan, the USA, and Germany were different from those in China1, China2, and Taiwan. Similarly, different bacteria accounted for decreased biotin biosynthesis in the two country groups. We postulate that decreased SCFAs and polyamines reduce the intestinal mucus layer, which subsequently facilitates the formation of abnormal Î±-synuclein fibrils in the intestinal neural plexus in PD, and also cause neuroinflammation in PD.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2024,Hiroshi Nishiwaki; Jun Ueyama; Mikako Ito; Tomonari Hamaguchi; Keiichi Takimoto; Tetsuya Maeda; Kenichi Kashihara; Yoshio Tsuboi; Hiroshi Mori; Ken Kurokawa; Masahisa Katsuno; Masaaki Hirayama; Kinji Ohno
39377830,Gut-Brain Axis and Neuroinflammation: The Role of Gut Permeability and the Kynurenine Pathway in Neurological Disorders.,"The increasing prevalence of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and multiple sclerosis presents a significant global health challenge. Despite extensive research, the precise mechanisms underlying these conditions remain elusive, with current treatments primarily addressing symptoms rather than root causes. Emerging evidence suggests that gut permeability and the kynurenine pathway are involved in the pathogenesis of these neurological conditions, offering promising targets for novel therapeutic and preventive strategies. Gut permeability refers to the intestinal lining's ability to selectively allow essential nutrients into the bloodstream while blocking harmful substances. Various factors, including poor diet, stress, infections, and genetic predispositions, can compromise gut integrity, leading to increased permeability. This condition facilitates the translocation of toxins and bacteria into systemic circulation, triggering widespread inflammation that impacts neurological health via the gut-brain axis. The gut-brain axis (GBA) is a complex communication network between the gut and the central nervous system. Dysbiosis, an imbalance in the gut microbiota, can increase gut permeability and systemic inflammation, exacerbating neuroinflammation-a key factor in neurological disorders. The kynurenine pathway, the primary route for tryptophan metabolism, is significantly implicated in this process. Dysregulation of the kynurenine pathway in the context of inflammation leads to the production of neurotoxic metabolites, such as quinolinic acid, which contribute to neuronal damage and the progression of neurological disorders. This narrative review highlights the potential and progress in understanding these mechanisms. Interventions targeting the kynurenine pathway and maintaining a balanced gut microbiota through diet, probiotics, and lifestyle modifications show promise in reducing neuroinflammation and supporting brain health. In addition, pharmacological approaches aimed at modulating the kynurenine pathway directly, such as inhibitors of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, offer potential avenues for new treatments. Understanding and targeting these interconnected pathways are crucial for developing effective strategies to prevent and manage neurological disorders.",Cellular and molecular neurobiology,2024,Rowan Kearns
39071627,Gut-brain axis: A cutting-edge approach to target neurological disorders and potential synbiotic application.,"The microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) represents a sophisticated communication network between the brain and the gut, involving immunological, endocrinological, and neural mediators. This bidirectional interaction is facilitated through the vagus nerve, sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers, and is regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Evidence shows that alterations in gut microbiota composition, or dysbiosis, significantly impact neurological disorders (NDs) like anxiety, depression, autism, Parkinson's disease (PD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Dysbiosis can affect the central nervous system (CNS) via neuroinflammation and microglial activation, highlighting the importance of the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) in disease pathogenesis. The microbiota influences the immune system by modulating chemokines and cytokines, impacting neuronal health. Synbiotics have shown promise in treating NDs by enhancing cognitive function and reducing inflammation. The gut microbiota's role in producing neurotransmitters and neuroactive compounds, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), is critical for CNS homeostasis. Therapeutic interventions targeting the MGBA, including dietary modulation and synbiotic supplementation, offer potential benefits for managing neurodegenerative disorders. However, more in-depth clinical studies are necessary to fully understand and harness the therapeutic potential of the MGBA in neurological health and disease.",Heliyon,2024,Sumel Ashique; Sourav Mohanto; Mohammed Gulzar Ahmed; Neeraj Mishra; Ashish Garg; Dinesh Kumar Chellappan; Timothy Omara; Shabnoor Iqbal; Ivan Kahwa
39449004,Gut-first Parkinson's disease is encoded by gut dysbiome.,"In Parkinson's patients, intestinal dysbiosis can occur years before clinical diagnosis, implicating the gut and its microbiota in the disease. Recent evidence suggests the gut microbiota may trigger body-first Parkinson Disease (PD), yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aims to elucidate how a dysbiotic microbiome through intestinal immune alterations triggers PD-related neurodegeneration.To determine the impact of gut dysbiosis on the development and progression of PD pathology, wild-type male C57BL/6 mice were transplanted with fecal material from PD patients and age-matched healthy donors to challenge the gut-immune-brain axis.This study demonstrates that patient-derived intestinal microbiota caused midbrain tyrosine hydroxylase positive (THâ+) cell loss and motor dysfunction. Ileum-associated microbiota remodeling correlates with a decrease in Th17 homeostatic cells. This event led to an increase in gut inflammation and intestinal barrier disruption. In this regard, we found a decrease in CD4â+âcells and an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines in the blood of PD transplanted mice that could contribute to an increase in the permeabilization of the blood-brain-barrier, observed by an increase in mesencephalic Ig-G-positive microvascular leaks and by an increase of mesencephalic IL-17 levels, compatible with systemic inflammation. Furthermore, alpha-synuclein aggregates can spread caudo-rostrally, causing fragmentation of neuronal mitochondria. This mitochondrial damage subsequently activates innate immune responses in neurons and triggers microglial activation.We propose that the dysbiotic gut microbiome (dysbiome) in PD can disrupt a healthy microbiome and Th17 homeostatic immunity in the ileum mucosa, leading to a cascade effect that propagates to the brain, ultimately contributing to PD pathophysiology. Our landmark study has successfully identified new peripheral biomarkers that could be used to develop highly effective strategies to prevent the progression of PD into the brain.",Molecular neurodegeneration,2024,MÃ¡rio F Munoz-Pinto; Emanuel Candeias; InÃªs Melo-Marques; A Raquel Esteves; Ana Maranha; JoÃ£o D MagalhÃ£es; Diogo Reis Carneiro; Mariana Sant'Anna; A Raquel Pereira-Santos; AntÃ³nio E Abreu; Daniela Nunes-Costa; Susana Alarico; Igor Tiago; Ana Morgadinho; JoÃ£o Lemos; Pedro N Figueiredo; Cristina JanuÃ¡rio; Nuno Empadinhas; Sandra Morais Cardoso
36200211,Targeting Gut Dysbiosis and Microbiome Metabolites for the Development of Therapeutic Modalities for Neurological Disorders.,"The gut microbiota, composed of numerous species of microbes, works in synergy with the various organ systems in the body to bolster our overall health and well-being. The most well-known function of the gut microbiome is to facilitate the metabolism and absorption of crucial nutrients, such as complex carbohydrates, while also generating vitamins. In addition, the gut microbiome plays a crucial role in regulating the functioning of the central nervous system (CNS). Host genetics, including specific genes and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), have been implicated in the pathophysiology of neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The gut microbiome dysbiosis also plays a role in the pathogenesis of these neurodegenerative disorders, thus perturbing the gut-brain axis. Overproduction of certain metabolites synthesized by the gut microbiome, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and p-cresyl sulfate, are known to interfere with microglial function and trigger misfolding of alpha-synuclein protein, which can build up inside neurons and cause damage. By determining the association of the gut microbiome and its metabolites with various diseases, such as neurological disorders, future research will pave the way for the development of effective preventive and treatment modalities.",Current neuropharmacology,2024,Matthew D Wiefels; Emily Furar; Rebecca S Eshraghi; Jeenu Mittal; Idil Memis; Moeed Moosa; Rahul Mittal; Adrien A Eshraghi
38265387,"Bridging the Mind and Gut: Uncovering the Intricacies of Neurotransmitters, Neuropeptides, and their Influence on Neuropsychiatric Disorders.","The gut-brain axis (GBA) is a bidirectional signaling channel that facilitates communication between the gastrointestinal tract and the brain. Recent research on the gut-brain axis demonstrates that this connection enables the brain to influence gut function, which in turn influences the brain and its cognitive functioning. It is well established that malfunctioning of this axis adversely affects both systems' ability to operate effectively.Dysfunctions in the GBA have been associated with disorders of gut motility and permeability, intestinal inflammation, indigestion, constipation, diarrhea, IBS, and IBD, as well as neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders like depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, autism, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease. Multiple research initiatives have shown that the gut microbiota, in particular, plays a crucial role in the GBA by participating in the regulation of a number of key neurochemicals that are known to have significant effects on the mental and physical well-being of an individual.Several studies have investigated the relationship between neuropsychiatric disorders and imbalances or disturbances in the metabolism of neurochemicals, often leading to concomitant gastrointestinal issues and modifications in gut flora composition. The interaction between neurological diseases and gut microbiota has been a focal point within this research. The novel therapeutic interventions in neuropsychiatric conditions involving interventions such as probiotics, prebiotics, and dietary modifications are outlined in this review.The findings of multiple studies carried out on mice show that modulating and monitoring gut microbiota can help treat symptoms of such diseases, which raises the possibility of the use of probiotics, prebiotics, and even dietary changes as part of a new treatment strategy for neuropsychiatric disorders and their symptoms.The bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain through the gut-brain axis has revealed profound implications for both gastrointestinal and neurological health. Malfunctions in this axis have been connected to a range of disorders affecting gut function as well as cognitive and neuropsychiatric well-being. The emerging understanding of the role of gut microbiota in regulating key neurochemicals opens up possibilities for novel treatment approaches for conditions like depression, anxiety, and neurodegenerative diseases.",Central nervous system agents in medicinal chemistry,2024,Saumya Gupta; Susha Dinesh; Sameer Sharma
38965287,A neurotherapeutic approach with Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus E9 on gut microbiota and intestinal barrier in MPTP-induced mouse model of Parkinson's disease.,"The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in neural development and progression of neural disorders like Parkinson's disease (PD). Probiotics have been suggested to impact neurodegenerative diseases via gut-brain axis. This study aims to investigate the therapeutic potential of Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus E9, a high exopolysaccharide producer, on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine(MPTP)-induced mouse model of PD. C57BL/6 mice subjected to MPTP were fed L. rhamnosus E9 for fifteen days and sacrificed after the last administration. Motor functions were determined by open-field, catalepsy, and wire-hanging tests. The ileum and the brain tissues were collected for ELISA, qPCR, and immunohistochemistry analyses. The cecum content was obtained for microbiota analysis. E9 supplementation alleviated MPTP-induced motor dysfunctions accompanied by decreased levels of striatal TH and dopamine. E9 also reduced the level of ROS in the striatum and decreased the DAT expression while increasing the DR1. Furthermore, E9 improved intestinal integrity by enhancing ZO-1 and Occludin levels and reversed the dysbiosis of the gut microbiota induced by MPTP. In conclusion, E9 supplementation improved the MPTP-induced motor deficits and neural damage as well as intestinal barrier by modulating the gut microbiota in PD mice. These findings suggest that E9 supplementation holds therapeutic potential in managing PD through the gut-brain axis.",Scientific reports,2024,Busra Aktas; Belma Aslim; Deniz Ates Ozdemir
39042202,Semaglutide Attenuates Anxious and Depressive-Like Behaviors and Reverses the Cognitive Impairment in a Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Mouse Model Via the Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis.,"Newly conducted research suggests that metabolic disorders, like diabetes and obesity, play a significant role as risk factors for psychiatric disorders. This connection presents a potential avenue for creating novel antidepressant medications by repurposing drugs originally developed to address antidiabetic conditions. Earlier investigations have shown that GLP-1 (Glucagon-like Peptide-1) analogs exhibit neuroprotective qualities in various models of neurological diseases, encompassing conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and stroke. Moreover, GLP-1 analogs have demonstrated the capability to enhance neurogenesis, a process recognized for its significance in memory formation and the cognitive and emotional aspects of information processing. Nonetheless, whether semaglutide holds efficacy as both an antidepressant and anxiolytic agent remains uncertain. To address this, our study focused on a mouse model of depression linked to type 2 diabetes induced by a High Fat Diet (HFD). In this model, we administered semaglutide (0.05Â mg/Kg intraperitoneally) on a weekly basis to evaluate its potential as a therapeutic option for depression and anxiety. Diabetic mice had higher blood glucose, lipidic profile, and insulin resistance. Moreover, mice fed HFD showed higher serum interleukin (IL)-1Î² and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) associated with impaired humor and cognition. The analysis of behavioral responses revealed that the administration of semaglutide effectively mitigated depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors, concurrently demonstrating an enhancement in cognitive function. Additionally, semaglutide treatment protected synaptic plasticity and reversed the hippocampal neuroinflammation induced by HFD fed, improving activation of the insulin pathway, demonstrating the protective effects of semaglutide. We also found that semaglutide treatment decreased astrogliosis and microgliosis in the dentate gyrus region of the hippocampus. In addition, semaglutide prevented the DM2-induced impairments of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), and G-protein-coupled receptor 43 (GPR43) and simultaneously increased the NeuNâ+âand Glucagon-like Peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R+) neurons in the hippocampus. Our data also showed that semaglutide increased the serotonin (5-HT) and serotonin transporter (5-HTT) and glutamatergic receptors in the hippocampus. At last, semaglutide changed the gut microbiota profile (increasing Bacterioidetes, Bacteroides acidifaciens, and Blautia coccoides) and decreased leaky gut, improving the gut-brain axis. Taken together, semaglutide has the potential to act as a therapeutic tool for depression and anxiety.",Journal of neuroimmune pharmacology : the official journal of the Society on NeuroImmune Pharmacology,2024,Igor Henrique Rodrigues de Paiva; Rodrigo Soares da Silva; Ingrid Prata MendonÃ§a; JosÃ© Roberto Botelho de Souza; Christina Alves Peixoto
39189380,"Allantoin ameliorates dopaminergic neuronal damage in MPTP-induced Parkinson's disease mice <i>via</i> regulating oxidative damage, inflammation, and gut microbiota disorder.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic progressive neurodegenerative disease that often occurs in older people. Neuroinflammation and oxidative stress are important factors in the development of PD. Gastrointestinal dysfunction is the most common non-motor symptom, and inflammation of the gut, which activates the gut-brain axis, maybe a pathogenic factor. Previous studies have attributed anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects to Allantoin, but its function and mechanism of action in PD are unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effect and mechanism of Allantoin on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD in mice. Our results showed that Allantoin administration ameliorated motor dysfunction and neuronal damage in mice injected with MPTP by inhibiting neuroinflammation and oxidative damage. Mechanistic studies showed that Allantoin suppresses inflammatory responses by inhibiting the overactivation of the NF-ÎºB and MAPK signaling pathways, as well as oxidative stress by regulating the AKT/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. Notably, Allantoin also restored intestinal barrier function by modulating the gut microbiota and improving antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacities to alleviate MPTP-induced motor deficits. In conclusion, the present study shows that the administration of Allantoin attenuated neurodegeneration in mice injected with MPTP by inhibiting neuroinflammation and oxidative stress and modulating the composition of the gut microbiome.",Food & function,2024,Shuo Yang; Xiaojia Sun; Dianfeng Liu; Yiming Zhang; Xiyu Gao; Jiangmei He; Mingchi Cui; Shoupeng Fu; Dewei He

39070266,Gut microbiota from patients with Parkinson's disease causes motor deficits in honeybees.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is possibly caused by genetic factors, environmental factors, and gut microbiota dysbiosis. This study aims to explore whether the microbiota contributes to the behavior abnormalities of PD.We transplanted gut microbiota from patients with PD or healthy controls (HC) into microbiota-free honeybees. We also established two more groups, namely the rotenone (ROT) group, in which PD-like symptoms of honeybees were induced by rotenone, and the conventional (CV) group, in which honeybees were colonized with conventional gut microbiota. The climbing assay was performed to assess the motor capabilities of honeybees. Histopathological examination was conducted to evaluate the integrity of gut mucosa. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene expression levels and dopamine (DA) concentrations in the brain were also examined. Additionally, metagenomics and full-length 16S rRNA analyses were performed to identify alterations in gut microbiota profiles, both in PD patients and honeybees.Honeybees in the PD and ROT groups exhibited slower climbing speeds, downregulated TH gene expression, and impaired gut barriers. Both the HC and PD groups of honeybees successfully harbored a portion of gut microbiota from corresponding human donors, and differences in microbial composition were identified. <i>Morganella morganii</i> and <i>Erysipelatoclostridium ramosum</i> exhibited significantly increased relative abundance in the HC group, while <i>Dorea longicatena</i>, <i>Collinsella aerofaciens</i>, <i>Lactococcus garvieae</i>, <i>Holdemanella biformis</i>, <i>Gemmiger formicilis</i>, and <i>Blautia obeum</i> showed significantly increased relative abundance in the PD group. Functional predictions of microbial communities in the PD group indicated an increased synthesis of hydrogen sulfide and methane.A novel PD model was induced in honeybees with rotenone and gut microbiota from PD patients. This study linked PD-related behaviors to altered gut microbiota, highlighting a potential gut microbiota-brain axis involvement in PD pathogenesis. We identify previously unrecognized associations of <i>Dorea longicatena</i>, <i>Collinsella aerofaciens</i>, <i>Lactococcus garvieae</i>, <i>Holdemanella biformis</i>, <i>Gemmiger formicilis</i>, and <i>Blautia obeum</i> with PD. Additionally, pathways related to hydrogen sulfide and methane synthesis have been previously suggested as potential contributors to the development of PD, and our research further supports this hypothesis.",Frontiers in microbiology,2024,Jiaqi Zeng; Yiyuan Li; Jingshuang Yan; Ruqi Chang; Mengqi Xu; Guanzhou Zhou; Jie Meng; Di Liu; Zhiqi Mao; Yunsheng Yang

37589449,"Communal interaction of glycation and gut microbes in diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease pathogenesis.","Diabetes and its complications, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD) are increasing gradually, reflecting a global threat vis-Ã -vis expressing the essentiality of a substantial paradigm shift in research and remedial actions. Protein glycation is influenced by several factors, like time, temperature, pH, metal ions, and the half-life of the protein. Surprisingly, most proteins associated with metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders are generally long-lived and hence susceptible to glycation. Remarkably, proteins linked with diabetes, AD, and PD share this characteristic. This modulates protein's structure, aggregation tendency, and toxicity, highlighting renovated attention. Gut microbes and microbial metabolites marked their importance in human health and diseases.

37589449,"Communal interaction of glycation and gut microbes in diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease pathogenesis.","Diabetes and its complications, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD) are increasing gradually, reflecting a global threat vis-Ã -vis expressing the essentiality of a substantial paradigm shift in research and remedial actions. Protein glycation is influenced by several factors, like time, temperature, pH, metal ions, and the half-life of the protein. Surprisingly, most proteins associated with metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders are generally long-lived and hence susceptible to glycation. Remarkably, proteins linked with diabetes, AD, and PD share this characteristic. This modulates protein's structure, aggregation tendency, and toxicity, highlighting renovated attention. Gut microbes and microbial metabolites marked their importance in human health and diseases.

38078745,Microbiota-mediated effects of Parkinson's disease medications on Parkinsonian non-motor symptoms in male transgenic mice.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by motor symptoms and a loss of dopaminergic neurons, as well as a variety of non-motor symptoms, including constipation, depression, and anxiety. Recently, evidence has also accumulated for a link between gut microbiota and PD. Most PD patients are on dopamine replacement therapy, primarily a combination of L-DOPA and carbidopa; however, the effect of these medications on the microbiota and non-motor symptoms in PD is still unclear. In this study, we explored the effects of chronic oral treatment with L-DOPA plus carbidopa (LDCD) on the gut microbiota and non-motor symptoms in males of a transgenic mouse model of PD (dbl-PAC-Tg(<i>SNCA</i><sup>A53T</sup>);<i>Snca</i>-/-). To further test whether the effects of these PD medications were mediated by the gut microbiota, oral antibiotic treatment (Abx; vancomycin and neomycin) was included both with and without concurrent LDCD treatment. Post-treatment, the gastrointestinal, motor, and behavioral phenotypes were profiled, and fecal, ileal, and jejunal samples were analyzed for gut microbiota composition by 16S sequencing. LDCD treatment was found to improve symptoms of constipation and depression in this model, concurrent with increases in <i>Turicibacter</i> abundance in the ileum. Abx treatment worsened the symptoms of constipation, possibly through decreased levels of short-chain fatty acids and disrupted gut barrier function. LDCD + Abx treatment showed an interaction effect on behavioral symptoms that was also associated with ileal <i>Turicibacter</i> levels. This study demonstrates that, in a mouse model, PD medications and antibiotics affect PD-related non-motor symptoms potentially <i>via</i> the gut microbiota.IMPORTANCEThe motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) are caused by a loss of dopamine-producing neurons and are commonly treated with dopamine replacement therapy (L-DOPA plus carbidopa). PD has also been associated with altered gut microbiota composition. However, the effects of these PD medications on PD-related non-motor symptoms and the gut microbiota have not been well characterized. This study uses a transgenic mouse model of PD to help resolve medication-induced microbiota alterations from those that are potentially disease relevant within a PD context, and explores how long-term treatment may interact with the gut microbiota to impact non-motor symptoms.",mSphere,2024,Nina Radisavljevic; Avril Metcalfe-Roach; Mihai Cirstea; M Mahebali Tabusi; Tahereh Bozorgmehr; Haggai Bar-Yoseph; B Brett Finlay

39065820,Sika Deer Velvet Antler Peptide Exerts Neuroprotective Effect in a Parkinson's Disease Model via Regulating Oxidative Damage and Gut Microbiota.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder globally. Recognizing the potential of velvet antler in the nervous system, as shown in numerous studies, this research was aimed at evaluating the neuroprotective effects of Sika Deer velvet antler peptide (VAP), along with the underlying mechanisms in neurotoxin-induced PD models. Initially, a peptidomic analysis of the VAP, which comprised 189 varieties of peptides, was conducted using LC-MS. Nine sequences were identified as significant using Proteome Discoverer 2.5 software. In a cellular model of PD, where PC12 cells are treated with the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP<sup>+</sup>), the administration of the VAP reduced the cell damage and apoptosis induced by MPP<sup>+</sup>. This protective effect was associated with a decrease in oxidative stress. This protective mechanism was found to be mediated through the activation of the SIRT1-dependent Akt/Nrf2/HO-1-signaling pathway. In animal models, specifically in mice with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD, the administration of the VAP effectively reduced the dopaminergic neuron damage and reversed the neurobehavioral deficits. They also diminished microglia activation and apoptosis, all without any noticeable adverse effects. Additionally, the VAP was observed to beneficially alter the gut microbiota, as marked by an increase in the abundances of <i>Prevotellaceae</i>, <i>Helicobacteraceae</i>, and <i>Prevotella</i>. These findings suggest that VAP exerts its neuroprotective effect against neurodegeneration by inhibiting oxidative stress and modulating gut microbiota.","Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)",2024,Ying Liu; Hongyuan Li; Min Yang; Jia Guo; Zepeng Sun; Shuyue Wang; Ru Li; Xin Pang; Yumi Kim; Xiaohui Wang; Yinghua Peng
38515447,Analyzing the bibliometrics of brain-gut axis and Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD), characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons, is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Recent research has revealed a significant connection between gut microbiota and PD. To gain insight into research interests, disciplinary contexts, and potential future directions, a comprehensive bibliometric analysis was conducted on the brain-gut axis and PD literature published between 2014 and 2023.Relevant literature records were gathered from the Web of Science Core Collection on August 11, 2023. The data were then analyzed by Biblioshiny R packages and VOSviewer (version 1.6.19).The dataset revealed an upward trend in annual scientific publications on the brain-gut axis and PD, with an annual growth rate of 50.24%. China, the United States, and Italy were the top three most productive countries/regions. The journal ""International Journal Of Molecular Sciences"" published the most articles, while ""Movement Disorders"" received the highest number of citations. Professor Keshavarzian A emerged as the most prolific author, while Professor Scheperjans F held the highest h-index. Keyword analysis highlighted ""alpha-synuclein"" as the most frequent term, with ""mouse model,"" ""inflammation,"" and ""risk"" as emerging research topics. Additionally, ""central nervous system"" and ""intestinal bacterial overgrowth"" attracted increasing attention.This study examined current trends and hotspots in the bibliometric landscape of the brain-gut axis and PD research. Future research directions should explore the functional and metabolic activities of gut microbiota. Additionally, transitioning from observational to interventional study designs offers the potential for personalized interventions and disease prediction.

39078158,Meta-analysis of the human gut microbiome uncovers shared and distinct microbial signatures between diseases.,"Microbiome studies have revealed gut microbiota's potential impact on complex diseases. However, many studies often focus on one disease per cohort. We developed a meta-analysis workflow for gut microbiome profiles and analyzed shotgun metagenomic data covering 11 diseases. Using interpretable machine learning and differential abundance analysis, our findings reinforce the generalization of binary classifiers for Crohn's disease (CD) and colorectal cancer (CRC) to hold-out cohorts and highlight the key microbes driving these classifications. We identified high microbial similarity in disease pairs like CD vs ulcerative colitis (UC), CD vs CRC, Parkinson's disease vs type 2 diabetes (T2D), and schizophrenia vs T2D. We also found strong inverse correlations in Alzheimer's disease vs CD and UC. These findings, detected by our pipeline, provide valuable insights into these diseases.Assessing disease similarity is an essential initial step preceding a disease-based approach for drug repositioning. Our study provides a modest first step in underscoring the potential of integrating microbiome insights into the disease similarity assessment. Recent microbiome research has predominantly focused on analyzing individual diseases to understand their unique characteristics, which by design excludes comorbidities in individuals. We analyzed shotgun metagenomic data from existing studies and identified previously unknown similarities between diseases. Our research represents a pioneering effort that utilizes both interpretable machine learning and differential abundance analysis to assess microbial similarity between diseases.",mSystems,2024,Dong-Min Jin; James T Morton; Richard Bonneau
38450172,Electroacupuncture at ST25 corrected gut microbial dysbiosis and SNpc lipid peroxidation in Parkinson's disease rats.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) remains one kind of a complex, progressive neurodegenerative disease. Levodopa and dopamine agonists as widely utilized PD therapeutics have not shown significant positive long-term outcomes. Emerging evidences indicate that electroacupuncture (EA) have potential effects on the therapy of nervous system disorders, particularly PD, but its specific underlying mechanism(s) remains poorly understood, leading to the great challenge of clinical application and management. Previous study has shown that acupuncture ameliorates PD motor symptoms and dopaminergic neuron damage by modulating intestinal dysbiosis, but its intermediate pathway has not been sufficiently investigated.A rat model of PD was induced using rotenone. The therapeutic effect of EA on PD was assessed using the pole and rotarod tests and immunohistostaining for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the substantia nigra (SN) of brain. The role of gut microbiota was explored using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metabonomic analysis. PICRUSt2 analysis, lipidomic analysis, LPS and inflammatory factor assays were used for subsequent exploration and validation. Correlation analysis was used to identify the key bacteria that EA regulates lipid metabolism to improve PD.The present study firstly reappeared the effects of EA on protecting motor function and dopaminergic neurons and modulation of gut microbial dysbiosis in rotenone-induced PD rat model. EA improved motor dysfunction (via the pole and rotarod tests) and protected TH+ neurons in PD rats. EA increased the abundance of beneficial bacteria such as Lactobacillus, Dubosiella and Bifidobacterium and decreased the abundance of Escherichia-Shigella and Morganella belonging to Pseudomonadota, suggesting that the modulation of gut microbiota by EA improving the symptoms of PD motility via alleviating LPS-induced inflammatory response and oxidative stress, which was also validated by various aspects such as microbial gene functional analysis, fecal metabolomics analysis, LPS and inflammatory factor assays and SNpc lipidomics analysis. Moreover, correlation analyses also verified strong correlations of Escherichia-Shigella and Morganella with motor symptoms and SNpc lipid peroxidation, explicating targets and intermediate pathways through which EA improve PD exercise symptom.Our results indicate that the improvement of motor function in PD model by EA may be mediated in part by restoring the gut microbiota, which intermediate processes involve circulating endotoxins and inflammatory mediators, SNpc oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. The gut-microbiome - brain axis may be a potential mechanism of EA treatment for the PD.",Frontiers in microbiology,2024,Xuan-Ming Hu; Li-Zhe-Xiong Song; Zhi-Zi Zhang; Xi Ruan; Hai-Chang Li; Zhi Yu; Lin Huang
39417117,Toxic Metals Impact Gut Microbiota and Metabolic Risk in Five African-Origin Populations.,"Exposure to toxic metals impacts obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) risk. Yet, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Gut microbiota has been strongly associated with progression of cardiometabolic risk. To determine whether high metal exposures and gut dysbiosis interact to promote metabolic dysregulation and cardiometabolic risk, we assessed relationships between these factors. We analyzed cross-sectional associations between arsenic, lead, mercury, cadmium, and cardiometabolic health markers in 178 randomly selected African-origin adults (52% female, 51% obese, mean age=43.0Â±6.4 years) from Ghana, South Africa, Seychelles, Jamaica, and USA. Metal levels were dichotomized to high or low at the median level of each metal. We analyzed associations between gut microbiome taxa, metal levels, clinical measures (BMI, fasting blood glucose, and blood pressure) and diagnoses (hypertension, obesity, and diabetes status). High vs. low lead and arsenic exposures had a significant effect on beta diversity (p <0.05). 71 taxa were associated with high lead levels: 30 with elevated BMI, 22 with T2DM, and 23 with elevated fasting blood glucose (p<0.05). 115 taxa were associated with high arsenic levels: 32 with elevated BMI, 33 with T2DM, and 26 with elevated blood glucose (p<0.05). Of the taxa associated with high lead and arsenic exposure and either elevated BMI or fasting blood glucose, porphyrin metabolism was the most enriched metabolic pathway. These data collectively provide the first findings in a human study that the gut microbiome may drive the association between lead and arsenic exposure and obesity and T2DM risk.",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,2024,Julianne A Jorgensen; Candice Choo-Kang; Luyu Wang; Lina Issa; Jack A Gilbert; Gertrude Ecklu-Mensah; Amy Luke; Kweku Bedu-Addo; Terrence Forrester; Pascal Bovet; Estelle V Lambert; Dale Rae; Maria Argos; Tanika N Kelly; Robert M Sargis; Lara R Dugas; Yang Dai; Brian T Layden

Technological advancements in high-throughput sequencing and multi-omics have unveiled significant alterations in gut microbiota and their metabolites in various neurological disorders. This review provides a thorough analysis of the role of microbiome-gut-brain axis in neurodegenerative disease pathology, linking it to reduced age-associated proteostasis. We discuss evidences that substantiate the existence of a gut-brain cross talk ranging from early clinical accounts of James Parkinson to Braak's hypothesis. In addition to understanding of microbes, the review particularly entails specific metabolites which are altered in neurodegenerative diseases. The regulatory effects of microbial metabolites on protein clearance mechanisms, proposing their potential therapeutic implications, are also discussed. By integrating this information, we advocate for a combinatory therapeutic strategy that targets early intervention, aiming to restore proteostasis and ameliorate disease progression.

38898687,Gut Microbiota Metabolite Messengers in Brain Function and Pathology at a View of Cell Type-Based Receptor and Enzyme Reaction.,"The human gastrointestinal (GI) tract houses a diverse microbial community, known as the gut microbiome comprising bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa. The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in maintaining the body's equilibrium and has recently been discovered to influence the functioning of the central nervous system (CNS). The communication between the nervous system and the GI tract occurs through a two-way network called the gut-brain axis. The nervous system and the GI tract can modulate each other through activated neuronal cells, the immune system, and metabolites produced by the gut microbiome. Extensive research both in preclinical and clinical realms, has highlighted the complex relationship between the gut and diseases associated with the CNS, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

38774094,Electroacupuncture blocked motor dysfunction and gut barrier damage by modulating intestinal NLRP3 inflammasome in MPTP-induced Parkinson's disease mice.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder commonly accompanied by gut dysfunction. EA has shown anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. Here, we aim to explore whether EA can treat Parkinson's disease by restoring the intestinal barrier and modulating NLRP3 inflammasome. We applied 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to establish a PD mouse model and EA at the GV16, LR3, and ST36 for 12 consecutive days. The open-field test results indicated that EA alleviated depression and behavioral defects, upregulated the expressions of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and blocked the accumulation of Î±-synuclein (Î±-syn) in the midbrain. Moreover, EA blocked the damage to intestinal tissues of PD mice, indicative of suppressed NLRP3 inflammasome activation and increased gut barrier integrity. Notably, the antibiotic-treated mouse experiment validated that the gut microbiota was critical in alleviating PD dyskinesia and intestinal inflammation by EA. In conclusion, this study suggested that EA exhibited a protective effect against MPTP-induced PD by alleviating behavioral defects, reversing the block of motor dysfunction, and improving the gut barrier by modulating intestinal NLRP3 inflammasome. Above all, this study could provide novel insights into the pathogenesis and therapy of PD.",Heliyon,2024,Lei Guo; Haiming Hu; Nan Jiang; Huabing Yang; Xiongjie Sun; Hui Xia; Jun Ma; Hongtao Liu
37747555,Diet-gutÂ microbiome interaction and ferulic acid bioavailability: implications on neurodegenerative disorders.,"Ferulic acid (FA), which occurs naturally as the feruloylated sugar ester in grains, fruits, and vegetables, is critical for combating oxidative stress and alleviating neurodegenerative diseases resulting from free radical-generated protein aggregates in brain cells. However, FA cannot be absorbed in conjugated form. Therefore, strategies to improve the bioavailability of FA are gaining more importance. Ferulic acid esterases (FAE) of the gut microbiota are critical enzymes that facilitate FA release from feruloylated sugar ester conjugates and influence systemic health. This review provides insight into a nutrition-based approach to preventing neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's by altering the diversity of FAE-producing gut microbiota.The human gut is a niche for a highly dense microbial population. Nutrient components and the quality of food shape the gut microbiota. Microbiota-diet-host interaction primarily involves an array of enzymes that hydrolyse complex polysaccharides and release covalently attached moieties, thereby increasing their bio-accessibility. Moreover, genes encoding polysaccharide degrading enzymes are substrate inducible, giving selective microorganisms a competitive advantage in scavenging nutrients. Nutraceutical therapy using specific food components holds promise as a prophylactic agent and as an adjunctive treatment strategy in neurotherapeutics, as it results in upregulation of polysaccharide utilisation loci containing fae genes in the gut microbiota, thereby increasing the release of FA and other antioxidant molecules and combat neurodegenerative processes.",European journal of nutrition,2024,Saarika Pothuvan Kunnummal; Mahejibin Khan

38447734,Melatonin mitigates manganese-induced neural damage via modulation of gut microbiota-metabolism in mice.,"Manganese (Mn), a common environmental and occupational risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD), can cause central nervous system damage and gastrointestinal dysfunction. The melatonin has been shown to effectively improve neural damage and intestinal microbiota disturbances in animal models. This research investigated the mechanism by which exogenous melatonin prevented Mn-induced neurogenesis impairment and neural damage. Here, we established subchronic Mn-exposed mice model and melatonin supplement tests to evaluate the role of melatonin in alleviating Mn-induced neurogenesis impairment. Mn induced neurogenesis impairment and microglia overactivation, behavioral dysfunction, gut microbiota dysbiosis and serum metabolic disorder in mice. All these events were reversed with the melatonin supplement. The behavioral tests revealed that melatonin group showed approximately 30Â % restoration of motor activity. According to quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) results, melatonin group showed remarkable restoration of the expression of dopamine neurons and neurogenesis markers, approximately 46.4Â % (TH), 68.4Â % (DCX in hippocampus) and 48Â % (DCX in striatum), respectively. Interestingly, melatonin increased neurogenesis probably via the gut microbiota and metabolism modulation. The correlation analysis of differentially expressed genes associated with hippocampal neurogenesis indicated that Firmicutes-lipid metabolism might mediate the critical repair role of melatonin in neurogenesis in Mn-exposed mice. In conclusion, exogenous melatonin supplementation can promote neurogenesis, and restore neuron loss and neural function in Mn-exposed mice, and the multi-omics results provide new research ideas for future mechanistic studies.",The Science of the total environment,2024,Weifeng He; Xueting Wang; Xin Yang; Gaoman Zhang; Junrou Zhang; Li Chen; Piye Niu; Tian Chen

38648770,Role of the Gut Microbiome and Bacterial Amyloids in the Development of Synucleinopathies.,"Less than ten years ago, evidence began to accumulate about association between the changes in the composition of gut microbiota and development of human synucleinopathies, in particular sporadic form of Parkinson's disease. We collected data from more than one hundred and thirty experimental studies that reported similar results and summarized the frequencies of detection of different groups of bacteria in these studies. It is important to note that it is extremely rare that a unidirectional change in the population of one or another group of microorganisms (only an elevation or only a reduction) was detected in the patients with Parkinson's disease. However, we were able to identify several groups of bacteria that were overrepresented in the patients with Parkinson's disease in the analyzed studies. There are various hypotheses about the molecular mechanisms that explain such relationships. Usually, Î±-synuclein aggregation is associated with the development of inflammatory processes that occur in response to the changes in the microbiome. However, experimental evidence is accumulating on the influence of bacterial proteins, including amyloids (curli), as well as various metabolites, on the Î±-synuclein aggregation.

39173756,Fecal microbiome transplantation alleviates manganese-induced neurotoxicity by altering the composition and function of the gut microbiota via the cGAS-STING/NLRP3 pathway.,"Manganese (Mn) is an environmental pollutant, and overexposure can cause neurodegenerative disorders similar to Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease that are characterized by Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) overexpression, Tau hyperphosphorylation and neuroinflammation. However, the mechanisms of Mn neurotoxicity are not clearly defined. In our study, a knockout mouse model of Mn exposure combined with gut flora-induced neurotoxicity was constructed to investigate the effect of gut flora on Mn neurotoxicity. The results showed that the levels of Tau, p-Tau and AÎ² in the hippocampus of C57BL/6 mice were greater than those in the hippocampus of control mice after 5Â weeks of continuous exposure to manganese chloride (Mn content of 200Â mg/L). Transplanted normal and healthy fecal microbiota from mice significantly downregulated Tau, p-Tau and AÎ² expression and ameliorated brain pathology. Moreover, Mn exposure activated the cGAS-STING pathway and altered the cecal microbiota profile, characterized by an increase in Clostridiales, Pseudoflavonifractor, Ligilactobacillus and Desulfovibrio, and a decrease in Anaerotruncus, Eubacterium_ruminantium_group, Fusimonas and Firmicutes, While fecal microbiome transplantation (FMT) treatment inhibited this pathway and restored the microbiota profile. FMT alleviated Mn exposure-induced neurotoxicity by inhibiting activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome triggered by overactivation of the cGAS-STING pathway. Deletion of the cGAS and STING genes and FMT altered the gut microbiota composition and its predictive function. Phenotypic prediction revealed that FMT markedly decreased the abundances of anaerobic and stress-tolerant bacteria and significantly increased the abundances of facultative anaerobic bacteria and biofilm-forming bacteria after blocking the cGAS-STING pathway compared to the Mn-exposed group. FMT from normal and healthy mice ameliorated the neurotoxicity of Mn exposure, possibly through alterations in the composition and function of the microbiome associated with the cGAS-STING/NLRP3 pathway. This study provides a prospective direction for future research on the mechanism of Mn neurotoxicity.",The Science of the total environment,2024,Jingjing Liu; Zhimin Zhang; Shiyin Zhong; Xin Zhang; Jirui Yang; Qiongli Zhou; Diya Wang; Xuhong Chang; Hui Wang

While research conventionally focused on brain pathology, there is growing interest in peripheral alterations. Erythrocytes, which are rich in Î±-syn, have emerged as a compelling site for synucleinopathies-related alterations. Erythrocyte-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs), containing pathological Î±-syn species, can traverse the blood-brain barrier (BBB) under certain conditions and the gastrointestinal tract, where Î±-syn and gut microbiota interact extensively. This review explores the accumulating evidence of erythrocyte involvement in synucleinopathies, as well as their potential in disease pathogenesis and diagnosis. Given their unique properties, erythrocytes and erythrocyte-derived EVs may also serve as an ideal therapeutic platform for treating synucleinopathies and beyond.",Trends in neurosciences,2024,Ying Yang; Xiaoqian Nie; Yajie Wang; Jie Sun; Xiaofei Gao; Jing Zhang
38399728,Changes in Bacterial Gut Composition in Parkinson's Disease and Their Metabolic Contribution to Disease Development: A Gut Community Reconstruction Approach.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disease with the major symptoms comprising loss of movement coordination (motor dysfunction) and non-motor dysfunction, including gastrointestinal symptoms. Alterations in the gut microbiota composition have been reported in PD patients vs. controls. However, it is still unclear how these compositional changes contribute to disease etiology and progression. Furthermore, most of the available studies have focused on European, Asian, and North American cohorts, but the microbiomes of PD patients in Latin America have not been characterized. To address this problem, we obtained fecal samples from Colombian participants (<i>n</i> = 25 controls, <i>n</i> = 25 PD idiopathic cases) to characterize the taxonomical community changes during disease via 16S rRNA gene sequencing. An analysis of differential composition, diversity, and personalized computational modeling was carried out, given the fecal bacterial composition and diet of each participant. We found three metabolites that differed in dietary habits between PD patients and controls: carbohydrates, trans fatty acids, and potassium. We identified six genera that changed significantly in their relative abundance between PD patients and controls, belonging to the families <i>Lachnospiraceae</i>, <i>Lactobacillaceae</i>, <i>Verrucomicrobioaceae</i>, <i>Peptostreptococcaceae</i>, and <i>Streptococcaceae</i>. Furthermore, personalized metabolic modeling of the gut microbiome revealed changes in the predicted production of seven metabolites (Indole, tryptophan, fructose, phenylacetic acid, myristic acid, 3-Methyl-2-oxovaleric acid, and N-Acetylneuraminic acid). These metabolites are associated with the metabolism of aromatic amino acids and their consumption in the diet. Therefore, this research suggests that each individual's diet and intestinal composition could affect host metabolism. Furthermore, these findings open the door to the study of microbiome-host interactions and allow us to contribute to personalized medicine.",Microorganisms,2024,Johanna Forero-RodrÃ­guez; Johannes Zimmermann; Jan Taubenheim; Natalia Arias-RodrÃ­guez; Juan David Caicedo-Narvaez; Lena Best; Cindy V Mendieta; Julieth LÃ³pez-Castiblanco; Laura Alejandra GÃ³mez-MuÃ±oz; Janneth Gonzalez-Santos; Humberto Arboleda; William Fernandez; Christoph Kaleta; AndrÃ©s PinzÃ³n
39155987,HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder: key implications of the microbiota-gut-brain axis.,"HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) is now recognized to be relatively common in people living with HIV (PLWH), and remains a common cause of cognitive impairment. Unfortunately, the fundamental pathogenic processes underlying this specific outcome of HIV infection have not as yet been fully elucidated. With increased interest in research related to the microbiota-gut-brain axis, the gut-brain axis has been shown to play critical roles in regulating central nervous system disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. PLWH are characterized by a particular affliction, referred to as gut-associated dysbiosis syndrome, which provokes an alteration in microbial composition and diversity, and of their associated metabolite composition within the gut. Interestingly, the gut microbiota has also been recognized as a key element, which both positively and negatively influences human brain health, including the functioning and development of the central nervous system (CNS). In this review, based on published evidence, we critically discuss the relevant interactions between the microbiota-gut-brain axis and the pathogenesis of HAND in the context of HIV infection. It is likely that HAND manifestation in PLWH mainly results from (i) gut-associated dysbiosis syndrome and a leaky gut on the one hand and (ii) inflammation on the other hand. In other words, the preceding features of HIV infection negatively alter the composition of the gut microbiota (microbes and their associated metabolites) and promote proinflammatory immune responses which singularly or in tandem damage neurons and/or induce inadequate neuronal signaling. Thus, HAND is fairly prevalent in PLWH. This work aims to demonstrate that in the quest to prevent and possibly treat HAND, the gut microbiota may ultimately represent a therapeutically targetable ""host factor.""",Frontiers in microbiology,2024,Aizhen Hu; Silvere D Zaongo; Vijay Harypursat; Xin Wang; Jing Ouyang; Yaokai Chen

38287859,The Neuroprotective Effects of Electroacupuncture on Parkinson's Disease and the Underlying Molecular Mechanisms.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease whose main pathological features are the degeneration of dopamine neurons and deposition of Î±-synuclein in neurons. At present, the most important treatment strategy for PD is drugs, and one of the most used drugs is levodopa. However, this therapy shows many problems, such as tolerance and long-term effects, so other treatment strategies need to be explored. As a traditional Chinese medicine treatment method with effective and few side effects, electroacupuncture is considered a non-drug therapy. It serves as a novel, promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of PD. In this review, the application and the effects of electroacupuncture on PD have been described. Besides, the underlying molecular mechanisms of electroacupuncture on PD that contribute to protecting dopaminergic neurons and reducing Î±-synuclein levels have been illustrated, including â  anti-oxidant stress response, â¡ anti-neuroinflammatory response, â¢ up-regulation of neurotrophic factors and reduction of nerve cell apoptosis, â£ down-regulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress and improvement of mitochondrial function, â¤ improvement of the function of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, â¥ anti-excitatory toxicity response, â¦ activation of autophagy, and â§ modulation of gut microbiota.

The gut microbiota is extremely important in maintaining the body's homeostasis, shaping the human immune system and the proper functioning of the brain. The intestinal microflora affects the processes of neuroplasticity, synaptogenesis, and neuronal regeneration. This review aims to explain changes in the composition of the bacterial population of the intestinal microflora among patients with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Abnormalities in gut microflora composition are also noted in stress, depression, or autism spectrum development.

39408276,Oral Trehalose Intake Modulates the Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis and Is Neuroprotective in a Synucleinopathy Mouse Model.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal and gastrointestinal tracts, causing both motor and non-motor symptoms. This study examined the neuroprotective effects of trehalose. This sugar is confined in the gut due to the absence of transporters, so we hypothesized that trehalose might exert neuroprotective effects on PD through its action on the gut microbiota. We used a transgenic mouse model of PD (PrP-A53T G2-3) overexpressing human Î±-synuclein and developing GI dysfunctions. Mice were given water with trehalose, maltose, or sucrose (2% <i>w</i>/<i>v</i>) for 6.5 m. Trehalose administration prevented a reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the substantia nigra (-25%), striatum (-38%), and gut (-18%) in PrP-A53T mice. It also modulated the gut microbiota, reducing the loss of diversity seen in PrP-A53T mice and promoting bacteria negatively correlated with PD in patients. Additionally, trehalose treatment increased the intestinal secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) by 29%. Maltose and sucrose, which break down into glucose, did not show neuroprotective effects, suggesting glucose is not involved in trehalose-mediated neuroprotection. Since trehalose is unlikely to cross the intestinal barrier at the given dose, the results suggest its effects are mediated indirectly through the gut microbiota and GLP-1.",Nutrients,2024,SolÃ¨ne Pradeloux; Katherine Coulombe; Alexandre Jules Kennang Ouamba; Amandine Isenbrandt; FrÃ©dÃ©ric Calon; Denis Roy; Denis Soulet
38770370,"Iron toxicity, ferroptosis and microbiota in Parkinson's disease: Implications for novel targets.","Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Iron (Fe)-dependent programmed cell death known as ferroptosis, plays a crucial role in the etiology and progression of PD. Since SNpc is particularly vulnerable to Fe toxicity, a central role for ferroptosis in the etiology and progression of PD is envisioned. Ferroptosis, characterized by reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent accumulation of lipid peroxides, is tightly regulated by a variety of intracellular metabolic processes. Moreover, the recently characterized bi-directional interactions between ferroptosis and the gut microbiota, not only provides another window into the mechanistic underpinnings of PD but could also suggest novel interventions in this devastating disease. Here, following a brief discussion of PD, we focus on how our expanding knowledge of Fe-induced ferroptosis and its interaction with the gut microbiota may contribute to the pathophysiology of PD and how this knowledge may be exploited to provide novel interventions in PD.",Advances in neurotoxicology,2024,Fernanda Vidal Carvalho; Harold E Landis; Bruk Getachew; Victor Diogenes Amaral Silva; Paulo R Ribeiro; Michael Aschner; Yousef Tizabi
38311217,"Supplementation of probiotic Bifidobacterium breve Bif11 reverses neurobehavioural deficits, inflammatory changes and oxidative stress in Parkinson's disease model.","Human gut microbiota are thought to affect different physiological processes in the body, including brain functions. Gut dysbiosis has been linked to the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD) and thus, restoring the healthy gut microbiota with supplementation of putative probiotic strains can confer some benefits in PD. In the current study, we explored the neuroprotective potential of Bifidobacterium breve Bif11 supplementation in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine hydrochloride (MPTP) treated female Sprague Dawley rats. This study investigated the behavioural, molecular and biochemical parameters in the MPTP rat model. A pharmacological intervention of Bif11 at doses of 1Â ÃÂ 10<sup>10</sup>Â CFU and 2Â ÃÂ 10<sup>10</sup>Â CFU for 21 days was found to attenuate the cognitive and motor changes in the MPTP rat model. Furthermore, it also increased the tyrosine hydroxylase levels, reduced pro-inflammatory markers and decreased oxidative and nitrosative stress in the mid brain of MPTP-lesioned rats. Bif11 supplementation even restored the levels of short-chain fatty acids and decreased intestinal epithelial permeability in MPTP-induced PD model rats. In summary, these findings demonstrate that B. breve Bif11 has the potential to ameliorate symptoms of PD. However, this therapy needs to be further investigated with in-depth mechanistic insights in the future for the treatment of PD.",Neurochemistry international,2024,Sonali Valvaikar; Bhupesh Vaidya; Shikha Sharma; Mahendra Bishnoi; Kanthi Kiran Kondepudi; Shyam S Sharma

39062985,Exploring Fecal Microbiota Transplantation for Modulating Inflammation in Parkinson's Disease: A Review of Inflammatory Markers and Potential Effects.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by numerous motor and non-motor symptoms. Recent data highlight a potential interplay between the gut microbiota and the pathophysiology of PD. The degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in PD leads to motor symptoms (tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia), with antecedent gastrointestinal manifestations, most notably constipation. Consequently, the gut emerges as a plausible modulator in the neurodegenerative progression of PD. Key molecular changes in PD are discussed in the context of the gut-brain axis. Evidence suggests that the alterations in the gut microbiota composition may contribute to gastroenteric inflammation and influence PD symptoms. Disturbances in the levels of inflammatory markers, including tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF Î±), interleukin -1Î² (IL-1Î²), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), have been observed in PD patients. These implicate the involvement of systemic inflammation in disease pathology. Fecal microbiota transplantation emerges as a potential therapeutic strategy for PD. It may mitigate inflammation by restoring gut homeostasis. Preclinical studies in animal models and initial clinical trials have shown promising results. Overall, understanding the interplay between inflammation, the gut microbiota, and PD pathology provides valuable insights into potential therapeutic interventions. This review presents recent data about the bidirectional communication between the gut microbiome and the brain in PD, specifically focusing on the involvement of inflammatory biomarkers.",International journal of molecular sciences,2024,Karol Sadowski; Weronika ZajÄc; Åukasz Milanowski; Dariusz Koziorowski; Monika Figura
38490348,Dietary polyphenols represent a phytotherapeutic alternative for gut dysbiosis associated neurodegeneration: A systematic review.,"Globally, neurodegeneration and cerebrovascular disease are common and growing causes of morbidity and mortality. Pathophysiology of this group of diseases encompasses various factors from oxidative stress to gut microbial dysbiosis. The study of the etiology and mechanisms of oxidative stress as well as gut dysbiosis-induced neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, autism spectrum disorder, and Huntington's disease has recently received a lot of attention. Numerous studies lend credence to the notion that changes in the intestinal microbiota and enteric neuroimmune system have an impact on the initiation and severity of these diseases. The prebiotic role of polyphenols can influence the makeup of the gut microbiota in neurodegenerative disorders by modulating intracellular signalling pathways. Metabolites of polyphenols function directly as neurotransmitters by crossing the blood-brain barrier or indirectly via influencing the cerebrovascular system. This assessment aims to bring forth an interlink between the consumption of polyphenols biotransformed by gut microbiota which in turn modulate the gut microbial diversity and biochemical changes in the brain.

39191336,Metformin: From diabetes to cancer to prolongation of life.,"The metformin molecule dates back to over a century, but its clinical use started in the '50s. Since then, its use in diabetics has grown constantly, with over 150 million users today. The therapeutic profile also expanded, with improved understanding of novel mechanisms. Metformin has a major activity on insulin resistance, by acting on the insulin receptors and mitochondria, most likely by activation of the adenosine monophosphate-activated kinase. These and associated mechanisms lead to significant lipid lowering and body weight loss. An anti-cancer action has come up in recent years, with mechanisms partly dependent on the mitochondrial activity and also on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase resistance occurring in some malignant tumors. The potential of metformin to raise life-length is the object of large ongoing studies and of several basic and clinical investigations. The present review article will attempt to investigate the basic mechanisms behind these diverse activities and the potential clinical benefits. Metformin may act on transcriptional activity by histone modification, DNA methylation and miRNAs. An activity on age-associated inflammation (inflammaging) may occur via activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor and changes in gut microbiota. A senolytic activity, leading to reduction of cells with the senescent associated secretory phenotype, may be crucial in lifespan prolongation as well as in ancillary properties in age-associated diseases, such as Parkinson's disease. Telomere prolongation may be related to the activity on mitochondrial respiratory factor 1 and on peroxisome gamma proliferator coactivator 1-alpha. Very recent observations on the potential to act on the most severe neurological disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia, have raised considerable hope.",Pharmacological research,2024,Cesare R Sirtori; Sofia Castiglione; Chiara Pavanello

38008941,Intestinal Barrier Function and Neurodegenerative Disease.,"Neurodegenerative diseases are caused by the loss of neurons and/or their myelin sheaths, which deteriorate over time and become dysfunctional. Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis are among the most prominent neurodegenerative diseases that affect millions of older adults worldwide. Despite extensive research over several decades, controversies still surround the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases, and many of them remain incurable. Meanwhile, an increasing number of new mechanistic studies related to the microbiota-gut-brain axis have emerged, among which the relationship between the function of the intestinal barrier and neurodegenerative diseases has received widespread attention. As one of the first lines of defense between the body and the external environment, the impaired function of the intestinal barrier is closely related to the development of neurodegenerative pathologies. Among them, the microbiota-gut-brain axis disorder characterized by intestinal barrier disruption mainly includes impaired function of the intestinal microbial barrier, chemical barrier, mechanical barrier, and immune barrier. This review focuses on the structure and molecular mechanisms of the various layers of the intestinal barrier as well as their relationship with neurodegenerative lesions. In recent years, intestinal barrier repair therapies have provided new ideas for the studied disease treatment modalities. We believe that a better understanding of the role of the intestinal barrier in neurodegenerative diseases would provide new insights for the development of viable therapeutic strategies for patients.",CNS & neurological disorders drug targets,2024,Shijing Wu; Liangfang Yang; Yiwei Fu; Zhimin Liao; De Cai; Zhou Liu

These prodromal dysfunctions comprise a wide array of autonomic issues, including severe gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders such as dysphagia, delayed gastric emptying, and chronic constipation. Indeed, strong evidence from studies in humans and animal models suggests that the GI tract and its neural, mainly vagal, connection to the central nervous system (CNS) could have a major role in the etiology of PD. In fact, misfolded Î±-synuclein aggregates that form Lewy bodies and neurites, i.e., the histological hallmarks of PD, are detected in the enteric nervous system (ENS) before clinical diagnosis of PD. The aim of the present review is to provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of GI dysmotility in PD, focusing our attention on functional, neurochemical, and molecular alterations in animal models.",American journal of physiology.

This makes AHR essential for various cellular responses during aging, especially those governing inflammation and immunity. In this review, we provided an overview of the mechanisms by which the AHR mediates inflammatory response at gut and brain level through signals from intestinal microbes. The age-related reduction of gut microbiota functions is perceived as a trigger of aberrant immune responses linking gut and brain inflammation to neurodegeneration. Thus, we explored gut microbiome impact on the nature and availability of AHR ligands and outcomes for several signaling pathways involved in neurodegenerative diseases and age-associated decline of brain functions, with an insight on Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, the most common neurodegenerative diseases in the elderly. Specifically, we focused on microbial tryptophan catabolism responsible for the production of several AHR ligands. Perspectives for the development of microbiota-based interventions targeting AHR activity are presented for a healthy aging.",Frontiers in cellular neuroscience,2024,Lorena Coretti; Elisabetta Buommino; Francesca Lembo
38227477,Integrated multi-omics profiling highlights the benefits of resveratrol hydroxypropyl-Î²-cyclodextrin inclusion complex for A53T transgenic mice through the microbiota-gut-brain axis.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological disorder characterized by motor and gastrointestinal dysfunctions. Resveratrol is a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory phytoalexin known for its health-promoting benefits. However, little is known about its potential in treating PD by modulating the microbial gut-brain axis, and its clinical application has been limited due to poor water solubility, rapid metabolism, and limited systemic bioavailability. Our study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of RHSD, a resveratrol-cyclodextrin inclusion complex, in treating PD through the gut-brain axis in human SNCA-transgenic (A53T) mice PD models. Building on our previous study, we prepared RHSD and compared its efficacy with uncoated resveratrol for PD treatment. The study results demonstrated that RHSD exhibited several advantages in improving motor function, alleviating cognitive impairment, restoring intestinal barrier function, and inhibiting neuropathy. Subsequently, a series of analyses, including fecal microbiota metagenomic sequencing, non-target metabolic assays, host transcriptome sequencing, and integrative analysis were performed to reveal the potential therapeutic pathways of RHSD in A53T mice. The metagenomic sequencing results indicated a significant increase in the levels of <i>Lactobacillus murinus</i>, <i>Lactobacillus reuteri</i>, <i>Enterorhabduscaecimuris</i>, <i>Lactobacillus taiwanensis</i>, and <i>Lactobacillus animals</i> following RHSD administration. Furthermore, metabolomics profiling showed that the levels of gut microbiome metabolites were reversed after RHSD treatment, and differential metabolites were significantly correlated with motor function and intestinal function in PD mice. The integrated analysis of microbial metabolites and host transcriptomics suggested that abnormal amino acid metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation in the PD model were associated with the diffusion of abnormal metabolites. This study illustrates the profound impact of RHSD administration on rectifying gut microbiota dysbiosis and improving the A53T mouse model. Notably, we observed significant alterations in the proliferation and metabolism of multiple probiotic strains of Lactobacillus. Furthermore, our research supports the hypothesis that microbiota-related metabolites may regulate the transcription of host genes, including dopamine receptors and calcium stabilization. Consequently, our findings underscore the potential of RHSD as a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of PD through the modulation of several signaling pathways within the microbiota-gut-brain axis.",Food & function,2024,Xiaodong Sun; Shenglan Feng; Bingqing Qin; Junjie Ye; Lixia Xie; Jianjun Gui; Ming Sang
38610012,Peripheral extracellular vesicles in neurodegeneration: pathogenic influencers and therapeutic vehicles.,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis epitomize a class of insidious and relentless neurological conditions that are difficult to cure. Conventional therapeutic regimens often fail due to the late onset of symptoms, which occurs well after irreversible neurodegeneration has begun. The integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) further impedes efficacious drug delivery to the central nervous system, presenting a formidable challenge in the pharmacological treatment of NDDs. Recent scientific inquiries have shifted focus toward the peripheral biological systems, investigating their influence on central neuropathology through the lens of extracellular vesicles (EVs). These vesicles, distinguished by their ability to breach the BBB, are emerging as dual operatives in the context of NDDs, both as conveyors of pathogenic entities and as prospective vectors for therapeutic agents. This review critically summarizes the burgeoning evidence on the role of extracerebral EVs, particularly those originating from bone, adipose tissue, and gut microbiota, in modulating brain pathophysiology. It underscores the duplicity potential of peripheral EVs as modulators of disease progression and suggests their potential as novel vehicles for targeted therapeutic delivery, positing a transformative impact on the future landscape of NDD treatment strategies. Search strategy A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus from January 2000 to December 2023. The search combined the following terms using Boolean operators: ""neurodegenerative disease"" OR ""Alzheimer's disease"" OR ""Parkinson's disease"" OR ""Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis"" AND ""extracellular vesicles"" OR ""exosomes"" OR ""outer membrane vesicles"" AND ""drug delivery systems"" AND ""blood-brain barrier"". MeSH terms were employed when searching PubMed to refine the results. Studies were included if they were published in English, involved human subjects, and focused on the peripheral origins of EVs, specifically from bone, adipose tissue, and gut microbiota, and their association with related diseases such as osteoporosis, metabolic syndrome, and gut dysbiosis. Articles were excluded if they did not address the role of EVs in the context of NDDs or did not discuss therapeutic applications. The titles and abstracts of retrieved articles were screened using a dual-review process to ensure relevance and accuracy. The reference lists of selected articles were also examined to identify additional relevant studies.",Journal of nanobiotechnology,2024,Xixi Liu; Lu Shen; Meidan Wan; Hui Xie; Zhenxing Wang
38786584,Optimization of the Preparation Process of Glucuronomannan Oligosaccharides and Their Effects on the Gut Microbiota in MPTP-Induced PD Model Mice.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, and accumulating evidence suggests a link between dysbiosis of the gut microbiota and the onset and progression of PD. In our previous investigations, we discovered that intraperitoneal administration of glucuronomannan oligosaccharides (GMn) derived from <i>Saccharina japonica</i> exhibited neuroprotective effects in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse model. However, the complicated preparation process, difficulties in isolation, and remarkably low yield have constrained further exploration of GMn. In this study, we optimized the degradation conditions in the preparation process of GMn through orthogonal experiments. Subsequently, an MPTP-induced PD model was established, followed by oral administration of GMn. Through a stepwise optimization, we successfully increased the yield of GMn, separated from crude fucoidan, from 1~2/10,000 to 4~8/1000 and indicated the effects on the amelioration of MPTP-induced motor deficits, preservation of dopamine neurons, and elevation in striatal neurotransmitter levels. Importantly, GMn mitigated gut microbiota dysbiosis induced by MPTP in mice. In particular, GM2 significantly reduced the levels of <i>Akkermansia</i>, Verrucomicrobiota, and <i>Lactobacillus</i>, while promoting the abundance of <i>Roseburia</i> and <i>Prevotella</i> compared to the model group. These findings suggest that GM2 can potentially suppress PD by modulating the gut microbiota, providing a foundation for the development of a novel and effective anti-PD marine drug.",Marine drugs,2024,Baoxiang Wang; Lihua Geng; Jing Wang; Yuxi Wei; Changhui Yan; Ning Wu; Yang Yue; Quanbin Zhang
38316462,Stability of gut microbiome after COVID-19 vaccination in healthy and immuno-compromised individuals.,"Bidirectional interactions between the immune system and the gut microbiota are key contributors to various physiological functions. Immune-associated diseases such as cancer and autoimmunity, and efficacy of immunomodulatory therapies, have been linked to microbiome variation. Although COVID-19 infection has been shown to cause microbial dysbiosis, it remains understudied whether the inflammatory response associated with vaccination also impacts the microbiota. Here, we investigate the temporal impact of COVID-19 vaccination on the gut microbiome in healthy and immuno-compromised individuals; the latter included patients with primary immunodeficiency and cancer patients on immunomodulating therapies. We find that the gut microbiome remained remarkably stable post-vaccination irrespective of diverse immune status, vaccine response, and microbial composition spanned by the cohort. The stability is evident at all evaluated levels including diversity, phylum, species, and functional capacity. Our results indicate the resilience of the gut microbiome to host immune changes triggered by COVID-19 vaccination and suggest minimal, if any, impact on microbiome-mediated processes. These findings encourage vaccine acceptance, particularly when contrasted with the significant microbiome shifts observed during COVID-19 infection.",Life science alliance,2024,Rebecca H Boston; Rui Guan; Lajos Kalmar; Sina Beier; Emily C Horner; Nonantzin Beristain-Covarrubias; Juan Carlos Yam-Puc; PehuÃ©n Pereyra Gerber; Luisa Faria; Anna Kuroshchenkova; Anna E Lindell; Sonja Blasche; Andrea Correa-Noguera; Anne Elmer; Caroline Saunders; Areti Bermperi; Sherly Jose; Nathalie Kingston; ; Sofia Grigoriadou; Emily Staples; Matthew S Buckland; Sara Lear; Nicholas J Matheson; Vladimir Benes; Christine Parkinson; James Ed Thaventhiran; Kiran R Patil
38008403,Calprotectin in Parkinsonian disease: Anticipation and dedication.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease due to degeneration of dopaminergic neurons (DNs) in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). PD is characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms. Non-motor symptoms such as constipation and dysfunction of gastrointestinal tract (GIT) motility together with medications used in the management of PD affect gut microbiota. Alterations of gut microbiota with development of gut dyspiosis can induce momentous changes in gut barrier with subsequent systemic inflammation and induction of neuroinflammation. It has been shown that calprotectin which reflect intestinal inflammation and gut barrier injury are augmented in PD. Therefore, this review aims to elucidate the possible role of gut barrier injury and associated dysbiois in PD neuropathology, and how calprotectin reflects gut barrier injury in PD. Benefit of this review was to elucidate that high fecal calprotectin level in PD patients indicated gut dysbiosis and intestinal inflammation. Early increment of fecal calprotectin indicates the development of gut dysbiosis and/or gut-barrier injury which may precede motor symptoms by decades.

38565567,Gamma-aminobutyric acid as a potential postbiotic mediator in the gut-brain axis.,"Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) plays a crucial role in the central nervous system as an inhibitory neurotransmitter. Imbalances of this neurotransmitter are associated with neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, and psychological disorders, including anxiety, depression, and stress. Since GABA has long been believed to not cross the blood-brain barrier, the effects of circulating GABA on the brain are neglected. However, emerging evidence has demonstrated that changes in both circulating and brain levels of GABA are associated with changes in gut microbiota composition and that changes in GABA levels and microbiota composition play a role in modulating mental health.

The therapeutic potential of probiotics, due to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and gut microbiota modulatory properties, is explored herein as a means to improve gut health and influence the gut-brain-microbiota axis in the context of PD. In this study, we investigated the role and possible mechanism of <i>Bifidobacterium animalis</i> subsp. <i>lactis</i> MH-022 (<i>B. lactis</i> MH-022) supplementation in a 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced rat model of PD. Findings demonstrated that <i>B. lactis</i> MH-022 supplementation markedly ameliorated motor deficits, preserved dopaminergic neurons, enhanced the antioxidant capacity, and mitigated inflammation through restoring mitochondrial function. Furthermore, <i>B. lactis</i> MH-022 supplementation significantly altered the gut microbiota composition, augmenting the production of short-chain fatty acids and promoting the proliferation of beneficial bacterial taxa, thereby reinforcing their anti-inflammatory properties. Correlation analyses established strong associations between specific bacterial taxa and improvements in motor function, antioxidant levels, and reductions in inflammation markers. These insights emphasize the therapeutic potential of <i>B. lactis</i> MH-022 in modulating diverse aspects of PD, particularly highlighting its role in reducing inflammation, restoring mitochondrial function, enhancing antioxidant capacity, and reshaping the gut microbiota. This multifaceted approach underscores the probiotic's potential in reducing neuroinflammation and protecting dopaminergic neurons, thus offering a promising avenue for PD treatment.",Food & function,2024,Shu-Ping Tsao; Tu-Hsueh Yeh; Ya-Tin Lin; Chun-Hsu Pan; Yuan-Kun Lee; Chieh-Hsi Wu; Hui-Yu Huang
39273435,Psychobiotic Properties of <i>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</i> in Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Neurodegenerative disorders are the main cause of cognitive and physical disabilities, affect millions of people worldwide, and their incidence is on the rise. Emerging evidence pinpoints a disturbance of the communication of the gut-brain axis, and in particular to gut microbial dysbiosis, as one of the contributors to the pathogenesis of these diseases. In fact, dysbiosis has been associated with neuro-inflammatory processes, hyperactivation of the neuronal immune system, impaired cognitive functions, aging, depression, sleeping disorders, and anxiety. With the rapid advance in metagenomics, metabolomics, and big data analysis, together with a multidisciplinary approach, a new horizon has just emerged in the fields of translational neurodegenerative disease. In fact, recent studies focusing on taxonomic profiling and leaky gut in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders are not only shedding light on an overlooked field but are also creating opportunities for biomarker discovery and development of new therapeutic and adjuvant strategies to treat these disorders. <i>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</i> (LBP) strains are emerging as promising psychobiotics for the treatment of these diseases. In fact, LBP strains are able to promote eubiosis, increase the enrichment of bacteria producing beneficial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids, boost the production of neurotransmitters, and support the homeostasis of the gut-brain axis. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the role of the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders with a particular focus on the benefits of LBP strains in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, autism, anxiety, and depression.",International journal of molecular sciences,2024,Mariagiovanna Di Chiano; Fabio Sallustio; Daniela Fiocco; Maria Teresa Rocchetti; Giuseppe Spano; Paola Pontrelli; Antonio Moschetta; Loreto Gesualdo; Raffaella Maria Gadaleta; Anna Gallone

Dysregulation of the gut microbiota has been implicated in the pathogenesis of this disease, sparking growing interest in the quest for non-invasive biomarkers derived from the gut for early PD diagnosis. Herein, an artificial intelligence-guided gut-microenvironment-triggered imaging sensor (Eu-MOF@Au-Aptmer) to achieve non-invasive, accurate screening for various stages of PD is presented. The sensor works by analyzing Î±-Syn in the gut using deep learning algorithms. By monitoring changes in Î±-Syn, the sensor can predict the onset of PD with high accuracy. This work has the potential to revolutionize the diagnosis and treatment of PD by allowing for early intervention and personalized treatment plans. Moreover, it exemplifies the promising prospects of integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced sensors in the monitoring and prediction of a broad spectrum of diseases and health conditions.","Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",2024,Yiwei Li; Hong-Xia Ren; Chong-Yung Chi; Yang-Bao Miao
39331469,Orally Administered Ginkgolide C Alleviates MPTP-Induced Neurodegeneration by Suppressing Neuroinflammation and Oxidative Stress through Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis in Mice.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, the etiology of which remains unclear. Studies have shown that neuroinflammation and oxidative stress (OS) play an important role in neuronal damage in patients with PD. Disturbances in the gut microbiota influence neuroinflammation and OS through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Ginkgolide C (GC), a traditional Chinese medicine extracted from the leaves of <i>Ginkgo biloba</i>, has been reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory effects and the ability to modulate intestinal microbial composition. However, the potential of GC to positively impact PD by modulating the gut microbiota remains unexplored. This study aimed to explore the effects of GC on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD in mice and elucidate its underlying mechanisms. Our findings elucidated that GC treatment significantly ameliorates behavioral deficits as well as pathological damage via restoring gut microbial homeostasis to downgrade OS and neuroinflammation in MPTP-induced PD mice. Mechanistically, GC treatment exerts antioxidant effects via activating the AKT/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway in MPP<sup>+</sup>-exposed SN4741 neuronal cells and significantly downregulates the expression of inflammatory mediators via regulating NF-ÎºB and MAPK signaling in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV2 microglial cells. Overall, our study demonstrates that GC administration alleviates MPTP-induced neurodegeneration via rebuilding gut microbial homeostasis to inhibit OS and neuroinflammation in mice, indicating that GC might serve as a promising candidate medicine for PD.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2024,Xiyu Gao; Shoupeng Fu; Jingru Wen; Aohan Yan; Shuo Yang; Yiming Zhang; Dianfeng Liu; Dewei He
39344226,Research Progress on the Relationship between Parkinson's Disease and REM Sleep Behavior Disorder.,"An individual's quality of life is greatly affected by Parkinson's disease (PD), a prevalent neurological degenerative condition. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a prominent non-motor symptom commonly associated with PD. Previous studies have shown a close relationship between PD and RBD. In addition to being a prodromal symptom of PD, RBD has a major negative impact on the prognosis of PD patients. This intrinsic connection indicates that there is a bidirectional relationship between PD and RBD. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the pathological mechanism related to PD and RBD, including the Î±-synuclein pathological deposition, abnormal iron metabolism, neuroinflammation, glymphatic system dysfunction and dysbiosis of the gut microbiota. Increasing evidence has shown that RBD patients have the same pathogenic mechanisms that underlie PD, but relatively little research has been done on how RBD contributes to PD progression. Therefore, a more thorough investigation is warranted to characterise how RBD affects the course of PD, in order to prepare for future therapeutic trials.",Journal of integrative neuroscience,2024,Yu Zhou; Xiaoli Liu; Bin Xu

38267447,Unravelling the mechanisms of underweight in Parkinson's disease by investigating into the role of gut microbiome.,"Approximately half of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) suffer from unintentional weight loss and are underweight, complicating the clinical course of PD patients. Gut microbiota alteration has been proven to be associated with PD, and recent studies have shown that gut microbiota could lead to muscle wasting, implying a possible role of gut microbiota in underweight PD. In this study, we aimed to (1) investigate the mechanism underlying underweight in PD patients with respect to gut microbiota and (2) estimate the extent to which gut microbiota may mediate PD-related underweight through mediation analysis. The data were adapted from Hill-Burns et al., in which 330 participants (199 PD, 131 controls) were enrolled in the study. Fecal samples were collected from participants for microbiome analysis. 16S rRNA gene sequence data were processed using DADA2. Mediation analysis was performed to quantify the effect of intestinal microbial alteration on the causal effect of PD on underweight and to identify the key bacteria that significantly mediated PD-related underweight. The results showed that the PD group had significantly more underweight patients (body mass index (BMI)â<â18.5) after controlling for age and sex. Ten genera and four species were significantly different in relative abundance between the underweight and non-underweight individuals in the PD group. Mediation analysis showed that 42.29% and 37.91% of the effect of PD on underweight was mediated through intestinal microbial alterations at the genus and species levels, respectively. Five genera (Agathobacter, Eisenbergiella, Fusicatenibacter, Roseburia, Ruminococcaceae_UCG_013) showed significant mediation effects. In conclusion, we found that up to 42.29% of underweight PD cases are mediated by gut microbiota, with increased pro-inflammatory bacteria and decreased SCFA-producing bacteria, which indicates that the pro-inflammatory state, disturbance of metabolism, and interference of appetite regulation may be involved in the mechanism of underweight PD.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2024,Ling-Chieh Shih; Ru-Jen Lin; Yan-Lin Chen; Shih-Chen Fu
38891863,From Gut to Brain: Uncovering Potential Serum Biomarkers Connecting Inflammatory Bowel Diseases to Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are characterized by chronic gastrointestinal inflammation due to abnormal immune responses to gut microflora. The gut-brain axis is disrupted in IBDs, leading to neurobiological imbalances and affective symptoms. Systemic inflammation in IBDs affects the brain's inflammatory response system, hormonal axis, and blood-brain barrier integrity, influencing the gut microbiota. This review aims to explore the association between dysregulations in the gut-brain axis, serum biomarkers, and the development of cognitive disorders. Studies suggest a potential association between IBDs and the development of neurodegeneration. The mechanisms include systemic inflammation, nutritional deficiency, GBA dysfunction, and the effect of genetics and comorbidities. The objective is to identify potential correlations and propose future research directions to understand the impact of altered microbiomes and intestinal barrier functions on neurodegeneration. Serum levels of vitamins, inflammatory and neuronal damage biomarkers, and neuronal growth factors have been investigated for their potential to predict the development of neurodegenerative diseases, but current results are inconclusive and require more studies.",International journal of molecular sciences,2024,Oliviu-Florentiu Sarb; Adriana-Daniela Sarb; Maria Iacobescu; Irina-Maria Vlad; Mircea-Vasile Milaciu; Lorena Ciurmarnean; Vitalie Vacaras; Alina-Ioana Tantau
38741945,Utility of zebrafish-based models in understanding molecular mechanisms of neurotoxicity mediated by the gut-brain axis.,"The gut microbes perform several beneficial functions which impact the periphery and central nervous systems of the host. Gut microbiota dysbiosis is acknowledged as a major contributor to the development of several neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders including bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and autism spectrum disorder. Thus, elucidation of how the gut microbiota-brain axis plays a role in health and disease conditions is a potential novel approach to prevent and treat brain disorders. The zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) is an invaluable vertebrate model that possesses conserved brain and intestinal features with those of humans, thus making zebrafish a valued model to investigate the interplay between the gut microbiota and host health. This chapter describes current findings on the utility of zebrafish in understanding molecular mechanisms of neurotoxicity mediated via the gut microbiota-brain axis.

39002442,Pharmacological mechanisms of puerarin in the treatment of Parkinson's disease: An overview.,"Puerarin, a monomer of traditional Chinese medicine, is a key component of Pueraria radix. Both clinical and experimental researches demonstrated that puerarin has therapeutic effects on Parkinson's disease (PD). Puerarin's pharmacological mechanisms include: 1) Anti-apoptosis. Puerarin inhibits cell apoptosis through the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathways. Puerarin also exerts a hormone-like effect against cell apoptosis; 2) Anti-oxidative stress injury. Puerarin inhibits the Nrf2 nuclear exclusion through the GSK-3Î²/Fyn pathway to promote the Nrf2 accumulation in the nucleus, and then promotes the antioxidant synthesis through the Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway to protect against oxidative stress; 3) Neuroprotective effects by intervening in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP). Puerarin significantly enhances the activity of chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), which downregulates the expression of Î±-synuclein, reduces its accumulation, and thus improves the function of damaged neurons. Additionally, puerarin increases proteasome activity and decreases ubiquitin-binding proteins, thereby preventing toxic accumulation of intracellular proteins; 4) Alleviating inflammatory response. Puerarin inhibits the conversion of microglia to the M1 phenotype while inducing the transition of microglia to the M2 phenotype. Furthermore, puerarin promotes the secretion of anti-inflammatory factor and inhibits the expression of pro-inflammatory factors; 5) Increasing the levels of dopamine and its metabolites. Puerarin could increase the levels of dopamine, homovanillic acid (HVA) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) in the striatum; 6) Promoting neurotrophic factor expression and neuronal repair. Puerarin increases the expression of glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF), thereby exerting a neuroprotective effect. Moreover, the regulation of the gut microbiota by puerarin may be a potential mechanism for the treatment of PD. The current review discusses the molecular mechanisms of puerarin, which may provide insight into the active components of traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of PD.",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2024,Nianping Zhang; Peng Guo; Yan Zhao; Xiao Qiu; Shuai Shao; Zhenzhong Liu; Zong Gao

Of these, 61% of participants had Parkinson's disease and their mean age was 72Â years. Microbiome and predicted metagenome data were generated by 16S rRNA gene sequencing of fecal samples. Ambient long-term OP exposures were assessed using pesticide application records combined with residential addresses in a geographic information system. We examined gut microbiome differences due to OP exposures, specifically differences in microbial diversity based on the Shannon index and Bray-Curtis dissimilarities, and differential taxa abundance and predicted Metacyc pathway expression relying on regression models and adjusting for potential confounders.OP exposure was not associated with alpha or beta diversity of the gut microbiome. However, the predicted metagenome was sparser and less evenly expressed among those highly exposed to OP (pâ=â0.04). Additionally, we found that the abundance of two bacterial families, 22 genera, and the predicted expression of 34 Metacyc pathways were associated with long-term OP exposure. These pathways included perturbed processes related to cellular respiration, increased biosynthesis and degradation of compounds related to bacterial wall structure, increased biosynthesis of RNA/DNA precursors, and decreased synthesis of Vitamin B1 and B6.In support of previous animal studies and in-vitro findings, our results suggest that ambient chronic OP pesticide exposure alters gut microbiome composition and its predicted metabolism in humans.",Environmental health : a global access science source,2024,Keren Zhang; Kimberly Paul; Jonathan P Jacobs; Myles G Cockburn; Jeff M Bronstein; Irish Del Rosario; Beate Ritz
37855342,The Role of the Vagus Nerve in the Microbiome and Digestive System in Relation to Epilepsy.,"The Enteric Nervous System (ENS) is described as a division of the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS), located within the gut wall and it is formed by two main plexuses: the myenteric plexus (Auerbach's) and the submucosal plexus (Meissner's). The contribution of the ENS to the pathophysiology of various neurological diseases such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease has been described in the literature, while some other studies have found a connection between epilepsy and the gastrointestinal tract. The above could be explained by cholinergic neurons and neurotransmission systems in the myenteric and submucosal plexuses, regulating the vagal excitability effect. It is also understandable, as the discharges arising in the amygdala are transmitted to the intestine through projections the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, giving rise to efferent fibers that stimulate the gastrointestinal tract and consequently the symptoms at this level. Therefore, this review's main objective is to argue in favor of the existing relationship of the ENS with the Central Nervous System (CNS) as a facilitator of epileptogenic or ictogenic mechanisms. The gut microbiota also participates in this interaction; however, it depends on many individual factors of each human being. The link between the ENS and the CNS is a poorly studied epileptogenic site with a big impact on one of the most prevalent neurological conditions such as epilepsy.",Current medicinal chemistry,2024,Carmen Rubio; Ernesto Ochoa; Fernando Gatica; Alonso Portilla; David VÃ¡zquez; MoisÃ©s Rubio-Osornio

The existence of gut microbiota dysbiosis has been associated with systemic inflammatory processes present in neurodegenerative disease, creating the opportunity for new treatment strategies. This involves modifying the strains that constitute the gut microbiota to enhance synaptic function through the gut-brain axis. Recent studies have evaluated the beneficial effects of the use of <i>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</i> on motor and cognitive symptomatology, alone or in combination. This systematic review includes 20 research articles (<i>n</i> = 3 in human and <i>n</i> = 17 in animal models). The main result of this research was that the use of <i>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</i> alone or in combination produced improvements in symptomatology related to neurodegenerative disease. However, one of the studies included reported negative effects after the administration of <i>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</i>. This systematic review provides current and relevant information about the use of this probiotic in pathologies that present neurodegenerative processes such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Multiple Sclerosis.",International journal of molecular sciences,2024,Ana Isabel BeltrÃ¡n-Velasco; Manuel Reiriz; Sara Uceda; VÃ­ctor Echeverry-Alzate
39060267,Multiomics of parkinsonism cynomolgus monkeys highlights significance of metabolites in interaction between host and microbiota.,"The gut microbiota has been demonstrated to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, conflicting findings regarding specific microbial species have been reported, possibly due to confounding factors within human populations. Herein, our current study investigated the interaction between the gut microbiota and host in a non-human primate (NHP) PD model induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) using a multi-omic approach and a self-controlled design. Our transcriptomic sequencing of peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) identified key genes involved in pro-inflammatory cytokine dysregulation, mitochondrial function regulation, neuroprotection activation, and neurogenesis associated with PD, such as IL1B, ATP1A3, and SLC5A3. The metabolomic profiles in serum and feces consistently exhibited significant alterations, particularly those closely associated with inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunctions and neurodegeneration in PD, such as TUDCA, ethylmalonic acid, and L-homophenylalanine. Furthermore, fecal metagenome analysis revealed gut dysbiosis associated with PD, characterized by a significant decrease in alpha diversity and altered commensals, particularly species such as Streptococcus, Butyrivibrio, and Clostridium. Additionally, significant correlations were observed between PD-associated microbes and metabolites, such as sphingomyelin and phospholipids. Importantly, PDPC significantly reduced in both PD monkey feces and serum, exhibiting strong correlation with PD-associated genes and microbes, such as SLC5A3 and Butyrivibrio species. Moreover, such multi-omic differential biomarkers were linked to the clinical rating scales of PD monkeys. Our findings provided novel insights into understanding the potential role of key metabolites in the host-microbiota interaction involved in PD pathogenesis.",NPJ biofilms and microbiomes,2024,Jiang-Mei Gao; Shou-Yue Xia; Geoff Hide; Bi-Hai Li; Yi-Yan Liu; Zhi-Yuan Wei; Xiao-Ji Zhuang; Qing Yan; Yun Wang; Wei Yang; Jian-Huan Chen; Jun-Hua Rao
39064687,"Postbiotics as Molecules Targeting Cellular Events of Aging Brain-The Role in Pathogenesis, Prophylaxis and Treatment of Neurodegenerative Diseases.","Aging is the most prominent risk factor for neurodegeneration occurrence. The most common neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's (PD) diseases, are characterized by the incidence of proteinopathy, abnormal activation of glial cells, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, impaired autophagy and cellular senescence excessive for the patient's age. Moreover, mitochondrial disfunction, epigenetic alterations and neurogenesis inhibition, together with increased blood-brain barrier permeability and gut dysbiosis, have been linked to ND pathogenesis. Since NDs still lack curative treatment, recent research has sought therapeutic options in restoring gut microbiota and supplementing probiotic bacteria-derived metabolites with beneficial action to the host-so called postbiotics. The current review focuses on literature explaining cellular mechanisms involved in ND pathogenesis and research addressing the impact that postbiotics as a whole mixture and particular metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), lactate, polyamines, polyphenols, tryptophan metabolites, exopolysaccharides and bacterial extracellular vesicles, have on the ageing-associated processes underlying ND occurrence. The review also discusses the issue of implementing postbiotics into ND prophylaxis and therapy, depicting them as compounds addressing senescence-triggered dysfunctions that are worth translating from bench to pharmaceutical market in response to ""silver consumers"" demands.",Nutrients,2024,Pola GÅowacka; Katarzyna Oszajca; Agnieszka Pudlarz; Janusz Szemraj; Monika Witusik-Perkowska
39145619,Oral aged garlic (<i>Allium sativum</i>) alleviates ulcerative colitis in mice by improving gut homeostasis.,"Aged garlic, obtained by heating raw garlic (<i>Allium sativum</i>) under high temperature and controlled humidity for a period, possesses a wide range of bioactivities, but its role in ulcerative colitis and its mechanism are not fully elucidated. We investigated the bioactive constituents in aged garlic (AG) and explored the effect of oral AG delivery on DSS-induced murine colitis. The results revealed that the aging process up-regulated anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial compounds such as dihydrocaffeic acid, 5-acetylsalicylic acid, verticine, <i>S</i>-allyl-L-cysteine and D-fucose. Oral AG obviously alleviated colitis, reducing colon damage and enhancing anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Streptococcus equinus</i> dramatically were enriched in the colon of mice with colitis that were strongly associated with Parkinson's disease, bacterial invasion of epithelial cells, aerobactin biosynthesis, and heme biosynthesis, but a distinct AG-mediated alteration in the colon due to increasing abundance of <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i>, <i>Lactobacillus</i> sp. <i>L-YJ</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium breve</i>, <i>Blautia wexlerae</i>, <i>Desulfomicrobium</i> sp. <i>P100A</i>, and <i>Lentilactobacillus hilgardii</i> was observed. Next, we demonstrated that colonic microbiome reconstruction by oral AG significantly increased the production of short-chain fatty acids such as acetic acid, propionic acid, isobutyric acid, and isovaleric acid. This study provides the first data indicating that oral AG ameliorates colonic inflammation in a gut microbiota-dependent manner. Our findings provide novel insights into the AG-mediated remission of colitis and AG as a functional food for modulating the gut microbiota to prevent and treat colitis.",Food & function,2024,Deping Han; Xuke Guan; Fengxia Zhu; Qing Yang; Dingding Su
38500273,"Gastrointestinal Issues in Depression, Anxiety, and Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Systematic Review on Pathways and Clinical Targets Implications.","Multiple illnesses commonly involve both the Central Nervous System (CNS) and the Gastrointestinal Tract (GI) simultaneously. Consistent evidence suggests that neurological disorders impair GI tract function and worsen the symptomatology and pathophysiology of digestive disorders. On the other hand, it has been proposed that early functional changes in the GI tract contribute to the genesis of several CNS illnesses. Additionally, the role played by the gut in these diseases can be seen as a paradigm for how the gut and the brain interact.We mentioned significant GI symptoms and discussed how the GI tract affects central nervous system illnesses, including depression, anxiety, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease in this study. We also explored potential pathophysiological underpinnings and novel targets for the creation of future therapies targeted at gut-brain connections.In this situation, modulating the gut microbiota through the administration of fecal microbiota transplants or probiotics may represent a new therapeutic option for this population, not only to treat GI problems but also behavioral problems, given the role that dysbiosis and leaky gut play in many neurological disorders.Accurate diagnosis and treatment of co-existing illnesses also require coordination between psychiatrists, neurologists, gastroenterologists, and other specialties, as well as a thorough history and thorough physical examination.",CNS & neurological disorders drug targets,2024,Ian Richard Lucena Andriolo; Bruna Longo; Dayse Machado de Melo; MÃ¡rcia Maria de Souza; Rui Daniel Prediger; Luisa Mota da Silva

39309265,Effect of <i>BF</i>839â+âearthworm protein supplement on motor and some non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease: a randomized clinical trial.,"Some studies have found that probiotics have the potential to treat PD, and earthworm protein is a traditional Chinese medicine used for the treatment of PD. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of <i>Bacteroides fragilis</i> 839 (<i>BF</i>839)â+âearthworm protein supplement as an adjunctive therapy for PD and to observe changes in the gut microbiota.Forty-six patients with PD were recruited for a 12-week 1:1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate changes in motor and some non-motor symptom scores and detect metagenomic changes in the gut microbiota.From baseline to 12âweeks, compared with placebo, the trial group showed significant reductions in the United Parkinson's Disease Rate Scale (UPDRS) total score (-7.74âÂ±â5.92 vs. -1.83âÂ±â4.14, <i>p</i>â<â0.001), UPDRS part I (-0.72âÂ±â0.81 vs. -0.20âÂ±â0.72, <i>p</i>â=â0.026), UPDRS part II (-2.50âÂ±â2.24 vs. -0.22âÂ±â1.98, <i>p</i>â=â0.001), UPDRS part III (-3.43âÂ±â3.42 vs. -1.33âÂ±â2.65, <i>p</i>â=â0.024), and UPDRS part IV (-1.13âÂ±â1.19 vs. -0.15âÂ±â0.57, <i>p</i>â=â0.001). Significant reductions in the Hamilton Depression Scale-24 score (-3.91âÂ±â3.99 vs. +1.15âÂ±â3.42, <i>p</i>â<â0.001), Self-Rating Anxiety Scale scores (-7.04âÂ±â5.71 vs. -1.23âÂ±â2.34, <i>p</i>â<â0.001), and Constipation scoring system scores (-8.59âÂ±â4.75 vs. 0.27âÂ±â1.24, <i>p</i>â<â0.001), were also noted.

38366179,Commensal protist Tritrichomonas musculus exhibits a dynamic life cycle that induces extensive remodeling of the gut microbiota.,"Commensal protists and gut bacterial communities exhibit complex relationships, mediated at least in part through host immunity. To improve our understanding of this tripartite interplay, we investigated community and functional dynamics between the murine protist Tritrichomonas musculus and intestinal bacteria in healthy and B-cell-deficient mice. We identified dramatic, protist-driven remodeling of resident microbiome growth and activities, in parallel with Tritrichomonas musculus functional changes, which were accelerated in the absence of B cells. Metatranscriptomic data revealed nutrient-based competition between bacteria and the protist. Single-cell transcriptomics identified distinct Tritrichomonas musculus life stages, providing new evidence for trichomonad sexual replication and the formation of pseudocysts. Unique cell states were validated in situ through microscopy and flow cytometry.

However, knowledge of the gut microbiota on the genome level is still limited. Here we performed deep metagenomic sequencing and binning to build metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from 136 human fecal microbiomes (68 PD samples and 68 control samples). We constructed 952 non-redundant high-quality MAGs and compared them between PD and control groups. Among these MAGs, there were 22 different genomes of Collinsella and Prevotella, indicating high variability of those genera in the human gut environment. Microdiversity analysis indicated that Ruminococcus bromii was statistically significantly (pâ<â0.002) more diverse on the strain level in the control samples compared to the PD samples. In addition, by clustering all genes and performing presence-absence analysis between groups, we identified several control-specific (pâ<â0.05) related genes, such as speF and Fe-S oxidoreductase. We also report detailed annotation of MAGs, including Clusters of Orthologous Genes (COG), Cas operon type, antiviral gene, prophage, and secondary metabolites biosynthetic gene clusters, which can be useful for providing a reference for future studies.",Scientific reports,2024,Ilhan Cem Duru; Alexandre Lecomte; TÃ¢nia Keiko Shishido; Pia Laine; Joni Suppula; Lars Paulin; Filip Scheperjans; Pedro A B Pereira; Petri Auvinen

39406307,Lactiplantibacillus plantarum SG5 inhibits neuroinflammation in MPTP-induced PD mice through GLP-1/PGC-1Î± pathway.,"Mounting evidence suggests that alterations in gut microbial composition play an active role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Probiotics are believed to modulate gut microbiota, potentially influencing PD development through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. However, the potential beneficial effects of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum SG5 (formerly known as Lactobacillus plantarum, abbreviated as L. plantarum) on PD and its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we employed immunofluorescence, Western blotting, ELISA, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to investigate the neuroprotective effects of L. plantarum SG5 against neuroinflammation in an MPTP-induced PD model and to explore the underlying mechanisms. Our results demonstrated that L. plantarum SG5 ameliorated MPTP-induced motor deficits, dopaminergic neuron loss, and elevated Î±-synuclein protein levels. Furthermore, SG5 inhibited MPTP-triggered overactivation of microglia and astrocytes in the substantia nigra (SN), attenuated disruption of both blood-brain and intestinal barriers, and suppressed the release of inflammatory factors in the colon and SN. Notably, SG5 modulated the composition and structure of the gut microbiota in mice. The MPTP-induced decrease in colonic GLP-1 secretion was reversed by SG5 treatment, accompanied by increased expression of GLP-1R and PGC-1Î± in the SN. Importantly, the GLP-1R antagonist Exendin 9-39 and PGC-1Î± inhibitor SR18292 attenuated the protective effects of SG5 in PD mice. In conclusion, we demonstrate a neuroprotective role of L. plantarum SG5 in the MPTP-induced PD mouse model, which likely involves modulation of the gut microbiota and, significantly, the GLP-1/PGC-1Î± signaling pathway.",Experimental neurology,2024,Yueyan Qi; Yuxuan Dong; Jinhu Chen; Siyou Xie; Xin Ma; Xueping Yu; Yang Yu; Yanqin Wang

Our previous research revealed a decreased abundance of <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> (Akk) in PD mice; however, whether Akk is beneficial to PD is unknown. To answer this question, the mice received MPTP intraperitoneally to construct a subacute model of PD and were then supplemented with Akk orally for 21 consecutive days. Motor function, dopaminergic neurons, neuroinflammation, and neurogenesis were examined. In addition, intestinal inflammation, and serum and fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) analyses, were assessed. We found that Akk treatment effectively inhibited the reduction of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and partially improved the motor function in PD mice. Additionally, Akk markedly alleviated neuroinflammation in the striatum and hippocampus and promoted hippocampal neurogenesis. It also decreased the level of colon inflammation. Furthermore, these aforementioned changes are mainly accompanied by alterations in serum and fecal isovaleric acid levels, and lower intestinal permeability. Our research strongly suggests that Akk is a potential neuroprotective agent for PD therapy.",Brain sciences,2024,Chen-Meng Qiao; Wen-Yan Huang; Yu Zhou; Wei Quan; Gu-Yu Niu; Ting Li; Mei-Xuan Zhang; Jian Wu; Li-Ping Zhao; Wei-Jiang Zhao; Chun Cui; Yan-Qin Shen
39367119,Synbiotic supplementation may globally improve non-motor symptoms in patients with stable Parkinson's disease: results from an open label single-arm study.,"Gut microbiota changes and brain-gut-axis (BGA) dysregulation are common in people with Parkinson's Disease (PD). Probiotics and prebiotics are emerging as a potential therapeutic approach for PD patients. The aim of this paper was to assess the neurological and gastroenterological effects in PD patients with constipation after the administration of a synbiotic product, with a focus on behavioral and cognitive symptoms. We enrolled patients with stable PD who met diagnostic criteria for functional constipation and/or irritable bowel syndrome with constipation according to Rome IV Criteria. Patients received a synbiotic treatment (Enterolactis Duo, containing the probiotic strain Lacticaseibacillus paracasei DG and the prebiotic fiber inulin) for 12Â weeks. A neurological and a gastroenterological evaluation were collected before and after the treatment. In addition, 16S rRNA gene profiling and short chain fatty acid quantification were performed to characterize the microbial ecosystem of fecal samples collected before (nâ=â22) and after (nâ=â9) the synbiotic administration. 30 patients were consecutively enrolled.

38796044,Rosmarinic acid mitigates intestinal inflammation and oxidative stress in bullfrogs (Lithobates catesbeiana) fed high soybean meal diets.,"High proportions of soybean meal in aquafeed have been confirmed to induce various intestinal pathologies. This study aims to investigate the regulatory effects of rosmarinic acid (RA), an antioxidant with anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, when added to high soybean meal feeds in different doses, (0, 0.5, 1, and 4Â g/kg). During the 56-day feeding trial, results indicated that, compared to the control group without RA (0Â g/kg), the 1Â g/kg and 4Â g/kg RA groups increased bullfrog survival rates and total weight gain while reducing feed coefficient. Additionally, these doses markedly suppressed the expression of key intestinal inflammatory markers (tlr5, myd88, tnfÎ±, il1Î², cxcl8, cxcl12) and the activity and content of intestinal antioxidants (CAT, MDA, GSH, GPX). Concurrently, RA significantly downregulated the transcription levels of antioxidant-related genes (cat, gpx5, cyba, cybb, mgst, gclc, gsta, gstp), suggesting RA's potential to alleviate intestinal inflammation and oxidative stress induced by high soybean meal and to help downregulate and restore normal expression of antioxidant enzyme genes. However, the 0.5Â g/kg RA group did not show a significant improvement in survival rates; instead, it upregulated the transcription of some antioxidant genes (cat, gpx5, cyba, cybb), revealing the complexity and dose-dependency of RA's antioxidant action. Furthermore, RA supplementation significantly reshaped the intestinal microbial community structure and relative abundance in bullfrogs, particularly affecting the genera Hafnia, Phascolarctobacterium, and Lactococcus. Notably, high doses of RA (1Â g/kg, 4Â g/kg) were able to downregulate pathways associated with the enrichment of gut microbiota in diseases such as Parkinson's, Staphylococcus aureus infection, and Systemic lupus erythematosus, suggesting its potential in anti-inflammatory action and health maintenance to prevent potential diseases.",Fish & shellfish immunology,2024,Bo Zhu; Shude Xu; Junzhi Zhang; Shuhui Xiang; Yi Hu

MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) was injected intraperitoneally into male C57BL/6 mice to establish a PD model, and WEG was given via oral gavage. The results indicated that WEG could protect the damaged neuronal cells of the mice brain, inhibit the aggregation of Î±-synuclein (Î±-Syn) in the brain, and increase the positive expression rate of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). WEG significantly improved intestinal damage and regulated intestinal disorders (P<0.05). WEG intervention increased the levels of beneficial bacteria, such as Lactobacillus, and normalized the abundance and diversity of colonies in the intestine of mice. Our results suggested that WEG protected neurons in the brain of PD mice via inhibiting the aggregation of Î±-Syn in the brain and increasing the positive expression level of TH in the brain. WEG regulated the gut microbiota of mice, improved the behavioral disorders of PD mice, and offered some therapeutic effects on PD mice.",PloS one,2024,Ning Xu; Shuyang Xing; Jie Li; Bo Pang; Meichen Liu; Meiling Fan; Yu Zhao
38997651,Identification of volatile metabolites produced from levodopa metabolism by different bacteria strains of the gut microbiome.,"Interspecies pathways in the gut microbiome have been shown to metabolize levodopa, the primary treatment for Parkinson's disease, and reduce its bioavailability. While the enzymatic reactions have been identified, the ability to establish the resulting macromolecules as biomarkers of microbial metabolism remains technically challenging. In this study, we leveraged an untargeted mass spectrometry-based approach to investigate volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced during levodopa metabolism by Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium sporogenes, and Eggerthella lenta. We cultured these organisms with and without their respective bioactive metabolites and detected levodopa-induced shifts in VOC profiles. We then utilized bioinformatics to identify significant differences in 2,6-dimethylpyrazine, 4,6-dimethylpyrimidine, and 4,5-dimethylpyrimidine associated with its biotransformation. Supplementing cultures with inhibitors of levodopa-metabolizing enzymes revealed specific modulation of levodopa-associated diazines, verifying their relationship to its metabolism. Furthermore, functional group analysis depicts strain-specific VOC profiles that reflect interspecies differences in metabolic activity that can be leveraged to assess microbiome functionality in individual patients. Collectively, this work identifies previously uncharacterized metabolites of microbe-mediated levodopa metabolism to determine potential indicators of this activity and further elucidate the metabolic capabilities of different gut bacteria.",BMC microbiology,2024,Taylor Pennington; Jarrett Eshima; Barbara S Smith
39310761,Identification of proteotoxic and proteoprotective bacteria that non-specifically affect proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases.,"There are no cures for neurodegenerative protein conformational diseases (PCDs), such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD). Emerging evidence suggests the gut microbiota plays a role in their pathogenesis, though the influences of specific bacteria on disease-associated proteins remain elusive. Here, we reveal the effects of 229 human bacterial isolates on the aggregation and toxicity of AÎ²<sub>1-42</sub>, Î±-synuclein, and polyglutamine tracts in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> expressing these culprit proteins. Our findings demonstrate that bacterial effects on host protein aggregation are consistent across different culprit proteins, suggesting that microbes affect protein stability by modulating host proteostasis rather than selectively targeting disease-associated proteins. Furthermore, we found that feeding <i>C.Â elegans</i> proteoprotective <i>Prevotella corporis</i> activates the heat shock response, revealing an unexpected discovery of a microbial influence on host proteostasis. Insight into how individual bacteria affect PCD proteins could open new strategies for prevention and treatment by altering the abundance of microbes.",iScience,2024,Alyssa C Walker; Rohan Bhargava; Michael J Bucher; Yoan M Argote; Amanda S Brust; Daniel M CzyÅ¼
