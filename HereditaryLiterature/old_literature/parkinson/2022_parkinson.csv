36672595,Toxin-like Peptides from the Bacterial Cultures Derived from Gut Microbiome Infected by SARS-CoV-2-New Data for a Possible Role in the Long COVID Pattern.,"It has been 3 years since the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, however it is as yet little known how to care for the acute COVID-19 and long COVID patients. COVID-19 clinical manifestations are of both pulmonary and extra-pulmonary types. Extra-pulmonary ones include extreme tiredness (fatigue), shortness of breath, muscle aches, hyposmia, dysgeusia, and other neurological manifestations. In other autoimmune diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD) or Alzheimer's Disease (AD), it is well known that role of acetylcholine is crucial in olfactory dysfunction. We have already observed the presence of toxin-like peptides in plasma, urine, and faecal samples from COVID-19 patients, which are very similar to molecules known to alter acetylcholine signaling. After observing the production of these peptides in bacterial cultures, we have performed additional proteomics analyses to better understand their behavior and reported the extended data from our latest in vitro experiment. It seems that the gut microbiome continues to produce toxin-like peptides also after the decrease of RNA SARS-CoV-2 viral load at molecular tests. These toxicological interactions between the gut/human microbiome bacteria and the virus suggest a new scenario in the study of the clinical symptoms in long COVID and also in acute COVID-19 patients. It is discussed that in the bacteriophage similar behavior, the presence of toxins produced by bacteria continuously after viral aggression can be blocked using an appropriate combination of certain drugs.",Biomedicines,2022,Carlo Brogna; Simone Cristoni; Barbara Brogna; Domenico Rocco Bisaccia; Giuliano Marino; Valentina Viduto; Luigi Montano; Marina Piscopo
36590421,The gut microbiome in human health and disease-Where are we and where are we going? A bibliometric analysis.,"There are trillions of microbiota in our intestinal tract, and they play a significant role in health and disease <i>via</i> interacting with the host in metabolic, immune, neural, and endocrine pathways. Over the past decades, numerous studies have been published in the field of gut microbiome and disease. Although there are narrative reviews of gut microbiome and certain diseases, the whole field is lack of systematic and quantitative analysis. Therefore, we outline research status of the gut microbiome and disease, and present insights into developments and characteristics of this field to provide a holistic grasp and future research directions.An advanced search was carried out in the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC), basing on the term ""gut microbiome"" and its synonyms. The current status and developing trends of this scientific domain were evaluated by bibliometric methodology. CiteSpace was used to perform collaboration network analysis, co-citation analysis and citation burst detection.A total of 29,870 articles and 13,311 reviews were retrieved from the database, which involve 42,900 keywords, 176 countries/regions, 19,065 institutions, 147,225 authors and 4,251 journals. The gut microbiome and disease research is active and has received increasing attention. Co-cited reference analysis revealed the landmark articles in the field. The United States had the largest number of publications and close cooperation with other countries. The current research mainly focuses on gastrointestinal diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), while extra-intestinal diseases are also rising, such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease. Omics technologies, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and metabolites linked to mechanism would be more concerned in the future.The gut microbiome and disease has been a booming field of research, and the trend is expected to continue. Overall, this research field shows a multitude of challenges and great opportunities.",Frontiers in microbiology,2022,Zhiqiang Huang; Kun Liu; Wenwen Ma; Dezhi Li; Tianlu Mo; Qing Liu
36564391,Inflammatory microbes and genes as potential biomarkers of Parkinson's disease.,"As the second-largest neurodegenerative disease in the world, Parkinson's disease (PD) has brought a severe economic and medical burden to our society. Growing evidence in recent years suggests that the gut microbiome may influence PD, but the exact pathogenesis of PD remains unclear. In addition, the current diagnosis of PD could be inaccurate and expensive. In this study, the largest meta-analysis currently of the gut microbiome in PD was analyzed, including 2269 samples by 16S rRNA gene and 236 samples by shotgun metagenomics, aiming to reveal the connection between PD and gut microbiome and establish a model to predict PD. The results showed that the relative abundances of potential pro-inflammatory bacteria, genes and pathways were significantly increased in PD, while potential anti-inflammatory bacteria, genes and pathways were significantly decreased. These changes may lead to a decrease in potential anti-inflammatory substances (short-chain fatty acids) and an increase in potential pro-inflammatory substances (lipopolysaccharides, hydrogen sulfide and glutamate). Notably, the results of 16S rRNA gene and shotgun metagenomic analysis have consistently identified five decreased genera (Roseburia, Faecalibacterium, Blautia, Lachnospira, and Prevotella) and five increased genera (Streptococcus, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Akkermansia, and Desulfovibrio) in PD. Furthermore, random forest models performed well for PD prediction based on 11 genera (accuracy > 80%) or 6 genes (accuracy > 90%) related to inflammation. Finally, a possible mechanism was presented to explain the pathogenesis of inflammation leading to PD. Our results provided further insights into the prediction and treatment of PD based on inflammation.",NPJ biofilms and microbiomes,2022,Shiqing Nie; Jichen Wang; Ye Deng; Zheng Ye; Yuan Ge
36532064,Hypothesis of a potential BrainBiota and its relation to CNS autoimmune inflammation.,"Infectious agents have been long considered to play a role in the pathogenesis of neurological diseases as part of the interaction between genetic susceptibility and the environment. The role of bacteria in CNS autoimmunity has also been highlighted by changes in the diversity of gut microbiota in patients with neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer disease and multiple sclerosis, emphasizing the role of the gut-brain axis. We discuss the hypothesis of a brain microbiota, the BrainBiota: bacteria living in symbiosis with brain cells. Existence of various bacteria in the human brain is suggested by morphological evidence, presence of bacterial proteins, metabolites, transcripts and mucosal-associated invariant T cells. Based on our data, we discuss the hypothesis that these bacteria are an integral part of brain development and immune tolerance as well as directly linked to the gut microbiome. We further suggest that changes of the BrainBiota during brain diseases may be the consequence or cause of the chronic inflammation similarly to the gut microbiota.",Frontiers in immunology,2022,Maria L Elkjaer; Lukas Simon; Tobias Frisch; Lisa-Marie Bente; Tim Kacprowski; Mads Thomassen; Richard Reynolds; Jan Baumbach; Richard Röttger; Zsolt Illes
36516898,Effects of molecular hydrogen intervention on the gut microbiome in methamphetamine abusers with mental disorder.,"Methamphetamine (METH) is a potent and highly addictive psychostimulant and one of the most widely used illicit drugs, the abuse of which has become a severe public health problem worldwide. A growing amount of evidence has indicated potential connections between gut microbiota and mental disorders induced by METH and associations with neural and metabolic pathways. The present study aimed to explore the relationship between fecal microbial alterations and neuropsychiatric diseases in METH addictions. Thus, mental disorders and gut microbial alterations were analyzed by self-rating depression (SDS) and anxiety (SAS) scales and 16 S rRNA gene sequencing, respectively. Our results showed that increased SDS and SAS indices and decreased alpha diversity indicated more serious mental disorders and lower bacterial diversity in METH users than in the age-matched healthy control group. The gut microbial composition in female METH users was also significantly altered, with reductions in hydrogen-producing bacteria, including Bacteroides and Roseburia. Molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) is spontaneously produced by intestinal bacteria in the process of anaerobic metabolism, which is the main pathway for H<sub>2</sub> production in vivo. Numerous studies have shown that hydrogen intervention can significantly improve neuropsychiatric diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Our results showed that hydrogen intervention, including drinking and inhaling, significantly alleviated mental disorders induced by METH abuse, and the inhalation of hydrogen also altered gut microbiota profiles in the METH abusers. These results suggest that hydrogen intervention has potential therapeutic applicability in the treatment of mental disorders in METH abusers.",Brain research bulletin,2023,Yong Wang; Mengmeng Wang; Bing Xie; Di Wen; Wenbo Li; Meiqi Zhou; Xintao Wang; Yun Lu; Bin Cong; Zhiyu Ni; Chunling Ma
36466165,Mapping trends and hotspot regarding gastrointestinal microbiome and neuroscience: A bibliometric analysis of global research (2002-2022).,"Scholars have long understood that gastrointestinal microorganisms are intimately related to human disorders. The literature on research involving the gut microbiome and neuroscience is emerging. This study exposed the connections between gut microbiota and neuroscience methodically and intuitively using bibliometrics and visualization. This study's objectives were to summarize the knowledge structure and identify emerging trends and potential hotspots in this field.On October 18, 2022, a literature search was conducted utilizing the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database for studies on gut microbiota and neuroscience studies from 2002 to 2022 (August 20, 2022). VOSviewer and CiteSpace V software was used to conduct the bibliometrics and visualization analysis.From 2002 to 2022 (August 20, 2022), 2,275 publications in the WoSCC database satisfied the criteria. The annual volume of publications has rapidly emerged in recent years (2016-2022). The most productive nation (<i>n</i> = 732, 32.18%) and the hub of inter-country cooperation (links: 38) were the United States. University College Cork had the most research papers published in this area, followed by McMaster University and Harvard Medical School. Cryan JF, Dinan TG, and Clarke G were key researchers with considerable academic influence. The journals with the most publications are ""Neurogastroenterology and Motility"" and ""Brain Behavior and Immunity."" The most cited article and co-cited reference was Cryan JF's 2012 article on the impact of gut microbiota on the brain and behavior. The current research hotspot includes gastrointestinal microbiome, inflammation, gut-brain axis, Parkinson's disease (PD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The research focus would be on the ""gastrointestinal microbiome, inflammation: a link between obesity, insulin resistance, and cognition"" and ""the role of two important theories of the gut-brain axis and microbial-gut-brain axis in diseases."" Burst detection analysis showed that schizophrenia, pathology, and psychiatric disorder may continue to be the research frontiers.Research on ""gastrointestinal microbiome, inflammation: a link between obesity, insulin resistance, and cognition"" and ""the role of two important theories of the gut-brain axis and microbial-gut-brain axis in diseases"" will continue to be the hotspot.

36442206,Parkinson's Disease and the Gut Microbiome in Rural California.,"Increasing evidence connects the gut microbiome to Parkinson's disease (PD) etiology, but little is known about microbial contributions to PD progression and its clinical features.We aim to explore the association between the gut microbiome with PD, and the microbial association with PD-specific clinical features.In a community-based case-control study of 96 PD patients and 74 controls, microbiome data were obtained from 16S rRNA gene sequencing of fecal samples, and analyzed for microbial diversity, taxa abundance, and predicted functional pathways that differed in PD patients and controls, and their association with PD-specific features (disease duration, motor subtypes, L-DOPA daily dose, and motor function).PD patients' gut microbiome showed lower species diversity (p = 0.04) and were compositionally different (p = 0.002) compared to controls but had a higher abundance of three phyla (Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobiota, Actinobacteria) and five genera (Akkermansia, Enterococcus, Hungatella, and two Ruminococcaceae) controlling for sex, race, age, and sequencing platform. Also, 35 Metacyc pathways were predicted to be differentially expressed in PD patients including biosynthesis, compound degradation/utilization/assimilation, generation of metabolites and energy, and glycan pathways. Additionally, the postural instability gait dysfunction subtype was associated with three phyla and the NAD biosynthesis pathway. PD duration was associated with the Synergistota phylum, six genera, and the aromatic compound degradation pathways. Two genera were associated with motor function.PD patients differed from controls in gut microbiome composition and its predicted metagenome. Clinical features were also associated with bacterial taxa and altered metabolic pathways of interest for PD progression.",Journal of Parkinson's disease,2022,Keren Zhang; Kimberly C Paul; Jonathan P Jacobs; Hsiang-Chin Lori Chou; Aline Duarte Folle; Irish Del Rosario; Yu Yu; Jeff M Bronstein; Adrienne M Keener; Beate Ritz
36430144,What Are the Key Gut Microbiota Involved in Neurological Diseases? A Systematic Review.,"There is a growing body of evidence highlighting there are significant changes in the gut microbiota composition and relative abundance in various neurological disorders. We performed a systematic review of the different microbiota altered in a wide range of neurological disorders (Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and stroke). Fifty-two studies were included representing 5496 patients. At the genus level, the most frequently involved microbiota are Akkermansia, Faecalibacterium, and Prevotella. The overlap between the pathologies was strongest for MS and PD, sharing eight genera (Akkermansia, Butyricicoccus, Bifidobacterium, Coprococcus, Dorea, Faecalibacterium, Parabacteroides, and Prevotella) and PD and stroke, sharing six genera (Enterococcus, Faecalibacterium, Lactobacillus, Parabacteroides, Prevotella, and Roseburia). The identification signatures overlapping for AD, PD, and MS raise the question of whether these reflect a common etiology or rather common consequence of these diseases. The interpretation is hampered by the low number and low power for AD, ALS, and stroke with ample opportunity for false positive and false negative findings.",International journal of molecular sciences,2022,Bruno Bonnechère; Najaf Amin; Cornelia van Duijn
36411639,Deciphering the gut microbiome in neurodegenerative diseases and metagenomic approaches for characterization of gut microbes.,"The central nervous system has essential role in the regulation of the physiological condition of the human body. Gut microbes cause several types of gastrointestinal diseases like ulcer stomach and intestine and irritable bowel syndrome. Microbes present in the human gut can affect brain function by the release of neuroactive metabolites such as neurotransmitters, hormones, and other compounds. Gut microbial-derived metabolites also have an important role in neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, etc. Vital communication between the gut microbes and the central nervous system is known as the microbiota-gut-brain axis. It provides a communication pathway between the gut and brain which is made up of the vagus nerve, immune system components, and neuroendocrine. Disturbance in gut microbiota composition can alter the central nervous system and enteric nervous system functions. Metagenomics has been employed for the identification, and characterization of gut microbes and microbial-derived metabolites. This review is focused on the gut microbes-brain relationship and the role of gut microbes in neurodegenerative diseases. This study is also focused on major metagenomic approaches and their role in gut microbes characterization.",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2022,Nidhi Singh; Veer Singh; Sachchida Nand Rai; Vishal Mishra; Emanuel Vamanu; Mohan P Singh
36406749,A review of the preclinical and clinical studies on the role of the gut microbiome in aging and neurodegenerative diseases and its modulation.,"As the world population ages, the burden of age-related health problems grows, creating a greater demand for new novel interventions for healthy aging. Advancing aging is related to a loss of beneficial mutualistic microbes in the gut microbiota caused by extrinsic and intrinsic factors such as diet, sedentary lifestyle, sleep deprivation, circadian rhythms, and oxidative stress, which emerge as essential elements in controlling and prolonging life expectancy of healthy aging. This condition is known as gut dysbiosis, and it affects normal brain function via the brain-gut microbiota (BGM) axis, which is a bidirectional link between the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and the central nervous system (CNS) that leads to the emergence of brain disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Here, we reviewed the role of the gut microbiome in aging and neurodegenerative diseases, as well as provided a comprehensive review of recent findings from preclinical and clinical studies to present an up-to-date overview of recent advances in developing strategies to modulate the intestinal microbiome by probiotic administration, dietary intervention, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and physical activity to address the aging process and prevent neurodegenerative diseases. The findings of this review will provide researchers in the fields of aging and the gut microbiome design innovative studies that leverage results from preclinical and clinical studies to better understand the nuances of aging, gut microbiome, and neurodegenerative diseases.",Frontiers in cellular neuroscience,2022,Haslin Madihah Hashim; Suzana Makpol
36400238,Bile acids and neurological disease.,"This review will focus on how bile acids are being used in clinical trials to treat neurological diseases due to their central involvement with the gut-liver-brain axis and their physiological and pathophysiological roles in both normal brain function and multiple neurological diseases. The synthesis of primary and secondary bile acids species and how the regulation of the bile acid pool may differ between the gut and brain is discussed. The expression of several bile acid receptors in brain and their currently known functions along with the tools available to manipulate them pharmacologically are examined, together with discussion of the interaction of bile acids with the gut microbiome and their lesser-known effects upon brain glucose and lipid metabolism. How dysregulation of the gut microbiome, aging and sex differences may lead to disruption of bile acid signalling and possible causal roles in a number of neurological disorders are also considered. Finally, we discuss how pharmacological treatments targeting bile acid receptors are currently being tested in an array of clinical trials for several different neurodegenerative diseases.",Pharmacology & therapeutics,2022,Michael J Hurley; Rachel Bates; Jane Macnaughtan; Anthony H V Schapira
36389228,The interplay between the gut-brain axis and the microbiome: A perspective on psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.,"What is the effect of our gut microbial flora on brain? Does the gut microbiome have any role in the causation of psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases? Does the effect of gut microbiota traverse the gut-brain axis? Questions like these have captured the interest and imagination of the scientific community for quite some time now. Research in the quest for answers to these questions, to unravel the potential role of the microbiota inhabiting the gut in controlling brain functions, has progressed manifold over the last two decades. Although the possibility of microbiome as a key susceptibility factor for neurological disorders viz. Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and autism spectrum disorder has bolstered by an increase in the clinical and preclinical evidence, the field is still in its infancy. Given the fact that the diversity of the gut microbiota is affected by various factors including the diet and exercise, the interpretation of such data becomes all the more difficult. Also, such studies have been mostly conducted on animal models, so there is a need for randomized controlled trials in human subjects, corroborated by longitudinal studies, to establish if modulating the gut microbiota can unravel novel therapeutic interventions. Exploring the genomic, metagenomic and metabolomic data from clinical subjects with psychiatric and neurological diseases can prove to be a helpful guide in individual treatment selection.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2022,Yasir Bashir; Asad U Khan
36376318,Metagenomics of Parkinson's disease implicates the gut microbiome in multiple disease mechanisms.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) may start in the gut and spread to the brain. To investigate the role of gut microbiome, we conducted a large-scale study, at high taxonomic resolution, using uniform standardized methods from start to end. We enrolled 490 PD and 234 control individuals, conducted deep shotgun sequencing of fecal DNA, followed by metagenome-wide association studies requiring significance by two methods (ANCOM-BC and MaAsLin2) to declare disease association, network analysis to identify polymicrobial clusters, and functional profiling. Here we show that over 30% of species, genes and pathways tested have altered abundances in PD, depicting a widespread dysbiosis. PD-associated species form polymicrobial clusters that grow or shrink together, and some compete. PD microbiome is disease permissive, evidenced by overabundance of pathogens and immunogenic components, dysregulated neuroactive signaling, preponderance of molecules that induce alpha-synuclein pathology, and over-production of toxicants; with the reduction in anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective factors limiting the capacity to recover. We validate, in human PD, findings that were observed in experimental models; reconcile and resolve human PD microbiome literature; and provide a broad foundation with a wealth of concrete testable hypotheses to discern the role of the gut microbiome in PD.",Nature communications,2022,Zachary D Wallen; Ayse Demirkan; Guy Twa; Gwendolyn Cohen; Marissa N Dean; David G Standaert; Timothy R Sampson; Haydeh Payami
36353491,Gut microbiome and human health: Exploring how the probiotic genus <i>Lactobacillus</i> modulate immune responses.,"The highest density of microbes resides in human gastrointestinal tract, known as ""Gut microbiome"". Of note, the members of the genus <i>Lactobacillus</i> that belong to phyla Firmicutes are the most important probiotic bacteria of the gut microbiome. These gut-residing <i>Lactobacillus</i> species not only communicate with each other but also with the gut epithelial lining to balance the gut barrier integrity, mucosal barrier defence and ameliorate the host immune responses. The human body suffers from several inflammatory diseases affecting the gut, lungs, heart, bone or neural tissues. Mounting evidence supports the significant role of <i>Lactobacillus</i> spp. and their components (such as metabolites, peptidoglycans, and/or surface proteins) in modulatingimmune responses, primarily through exchange of immunological signals between gastrointestinal tract and distant organs. This bidirectional crosstalk which is mediated by <i>Lactobacillus</i> spp. promotes anti-inflammatory response, thereby supporting the improvement of symptoms pertaining to asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), neuroinflammatory diseases (such as multiple sclerosis, alzheimer's disease, parkinson's disease), cardiovascular diseases, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and chronic infections in patients. The metabolic disorders, obesity and diabetes are characterized by a low-grade inflammation. Genus <i>Lactobacillus</i> alleviates metabolic disorders by regulating the oxidative stress response and inflammatory pathways. Osteoporosis is also associated with bone inflammation and resorption. The <i>Lactobacillus</i> spp. and their metabolites act as powerful immune cell controllers and exhibit a regulatory role in bone resorption and formation, supporting bone health. Thus, this review demonstrated the mechanisms and summarized the evidence of the benefit of <i>Lactobacillus</i> spp. in alleviating inflammatory diseases pertaining to different organs from animal and clinical trials. The present narrative review explores in detail the complex interactions between the gut-dwelling <i>Lactobacillus</i> spp. and the immune components in distant organs to promote host's health.",Frontiers in pharmacology,2022,Sonakshi Rastogi; Aditi Singh
36346385,A prebiotic diet modulates microglial states and motor deficits in α-synuclein overexpressing mice.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a movement disorder characterized by neuroinflammation, α-synuclein pathology, and neurodegeneration. Most cases of PD are non-hereditary, suggesting a strong role for environmental factors, and it has been speculated that disease may originate in peripheral tissues such as the gastrointestinal (GI) tract before affecting the brain. The gut microbiome is altered in PD and may impact motor and GI symptoms as indicated by animal studies, although mechanisms of gut-brain interactions remain incompletely defined. Intestinal bacteria ferment dietary fibers into short-chain fatty acids, with fecal levels of these molecules differing between PD and healthy controls and in mouse models. Among other effects, dietary microbial metabolites can modulate activation of microglia, brain-resident immune cells implicated in PD. We therefore investigated whether a fiber-rich diet influences microglial function in α-synuclein overexpressing (ASO) mice, a preclinical model with PD-like symptoms and pathology. Feeding a prebiotic high-fiber diet attenuates motor deficits and reduces α-synuclein aggregation in the substantia nigra of mice. Concomitantly, the gut microbiome of ASO mice adopts a profile correlated with health upon prebiotic treatment, which also reduces microglial activation. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of microglia from the substantia nigra and striatum uncovers increased pro-inflammatory signaling and reduced homeostatic responses in ASO mice compared to wild-type counterparts on standard diets. However, prebiotic feeding reverses pathogenic microglial states in ASO mice and promotes expansion of protective disease-associated macrophage (DAM) subsets of microglia. Notably, depletion of microglia using a CSF1R inhibitor eliminates the beneficial effects of prebiotics by restoring motor deficits to ASO mice despite feeding a prebiotic diet. These studies uncover a novel microglia-dependent interaction between diet and motor symptoms in mice, findings that may have implications for neuroinflammation and PD.",eLife,2022,Reem Abdel-Haq; Johannes C M Schlachetzki; Joseph C Boktor; Thaisa M Cantu-Jungles; Taren Thron; Mengying Zhang; John W Bostick; Tahmineh Khazaei; Sujatha Chilakala; Livia H Morais; Greg Humphrey; Ali Keshavarzian; Jonathan E Katz; Matthew Thomson; Rob Knight; Viviana Gradinaru; Bruce R Hamaker; Christopher K Glass; Sarkis K Mazmanian
36334762,Are neuromodulation interventions associated with changes in the gut microbiota? A systematic review.,"The microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) refers to the bidirectional communication between the brain and the gut microbiota and recent studies have linked the MGBA to health and disease. Research has so far investigated this axis mainly from microbiota to brain but less is known about the other direction. One approach to examine the MGBA from brain to microbiota is through understanding if and how neuromodulation might impact microbiota. Neuromodulation encompasses a wide range of stimulation techniques and is used to treat neurological, psychiatric and metabolic disorders, like Parkinson's Disease, depression and obesity. Here, we performed a systematic review to investigate whether neuromodulation is associated with subsequent changes in the gut microbiota. Searches in PsycINFO and MEDLINE were performed up to March 2022. Included studies needed to be clinical or preclinical studies comparing the effects of deep brain stimulation, electroconvulsive therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation or vagal nerve stimulation on the gut microbiota before and after treatment or between active and control groups. Seven studies were identified. Neuromodulation was associated with changes in relative bacterial abundances, but not with (changes in) α-diversity or β-diversity. Summarizing, currently reported findings suggest that neuromodulation interventions are associated with moderate changes in the gut microbiome. However, findings remain inconclusive due to the limited number and varying quality of included studies, as well as the large heterogeneity between studies. More research is required to more conclusively establish whether, and if so, via which mechanism(s) of action neuromodulation interventions might influence the gut microbiota.",Neuropharmacology,2023,Vera Korenblik; Marlies E Brouwer; Aniko Korosi; Damiaan Denys; Claudi L H Bockting; Stanley Brul; Anja Lok
36332796,Gut microbiome and Parkinson's disease: Perspective on pathogenesis and treatment.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a disease of ⍺-synuclein aggregation-mediated dopaminergic neuronal loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta, which leads to motor and non-motor symptoms. Through the last two decades of research, there has been growing consensus that inflammation-mediated oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cytokine-induced toxicity are mainly involved in neuronal damage and loss associated with PD. However, it remains unclear how these mechanisms relate to sporadic PD, a more common form of PD. Both enteric and central nervous systems have been implicated in the pathogenesis of sporadic PD, thus highlighting the crosstalk between the gut and brain.of Review: In this review, we summarize how alterations in the gut microbiome can affect PD pathogenesis. We highlight various mechanisms increasing/decreasing the risk of PD development. Based on the previous supporting evidence, we suggest how early interventions could protect against PD development and how controlling specific factors, including our diet, could modify our perspective on disease mechanisms and therapeutics. We explain the strong relationship between the gut microbiota and the brain in PD subjects, by delineating the multiple mechanisms involved inneuroinflammation and oxidative stress. We conclude that the neurodetrimental effects of western diet (WD) and the neuroprotective effects of Mediterranean diets should be further exploredin humans through clinical trials. Key Scientific Concepts of Review: Alterations in the gut microbiome and associated metabolites may contribute to pathogenesis in PD. In some studies, probiotics have been shown to exert anti-oxidative effects in PD via improved mitochondrial dynamics and homeostasis, thus reducing PD-related consequences. However, there is a significant unmet need for randomized clinical trials to investigate the effectiveness of microbial products, probiotic-based supplementation, and dietary intervention in reversing gut microbial dysbiosis in PD.",Journal of advanced research,2023,Safa Salim; Fatima Ahmad; Ayesha Banu; Farhan Mohammad
36284437,Gut bacterial profiles in Parkinson's disease: A systematic review.,"Recent advances have highlighted the relationships between gut dysbiosis and Parkinson's disease (PD). Microbiota transplantation from PD patients to mice can induce increased alpha-synuclein-mediated motor deficits. Human studies have identified differences in the gut microbiota of PD patients compared to healthy controls. We undertook a systematic review to evaluate the available evidence for the involvement of gut bacteria in the etiology of PD.The PubMed databank, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure databank, and Wanfang Data were searched from inception until June 2021 to identify human case-control studies that investigated relationships between PD and microbiota quantified from feces. We evaluated the resulting studies focusing on bacterial taxa that were different between PD patients and healthy controls.Twenty-six studies were found in which 53 microbial families and 98 genera exhibited differences between patients with PD and healthy controls. The genera identified by more than two studies as increased in PD were Bifidobacterium, Alistipes, Christensenella, Enterococcus, Oscillospira, Bilophila, Desulfovibrio, Escherichia/Shigella, and Akkermansia, while Prevotella, Blautia, Faecalibacterium, Fusicatenibacter, and Haemophilus had three or more reports of being lower in PD patients. More than one report demonstrated that Bacteroides, Odoribacter, Parabacteroides, Butyricicoccus, Butyrivibrio, Clostridium, Coprococcus, Lachnospira, Lactobacillus, Megasphaera, Phascolarctobacterium, Roseburia, Ruminococcus, Streptococcus, and Klebsiella were altered in both directions.Our review shows that the involvement of the gut microbiome in the etiology of PD may involve alterations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producing bacteria and an increase in putative gut pathobionts. SCFAs-producing bacteria may vary above or below an ""optimal range,"" causing imbalances. Considering that Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Akkermansia are beneficial for human health, increased Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus in the PD gut microbiome may be associated with PD medications, especially COMT inhibitors, while a high level of Akkermansia may be associated with aging.",CNS neuroscience & therapeutics,2023,Zhe Li; Hongfeng Liang; Yingyu Hu; Lin Lu; Chunye Zheng; Yuzhen Fan; Bin Wu; Tao Zou; Xiaodong Luo; Xinchun Zhang; Yan Zeng; Ziyan Liu; Zhicheng Zhou; Zhenyu Yue; Yi Ren; Zhuo Li; Qiaozhen Su; Pingyi Xu
36278360,Exploring the Connection Between the Gut Microbiome and Parkinson's Disease Symptom Progression and Pathology: Implications for Supplementary Treatment Options.,"The contribution of the microbiota to induce gastrointestinal inflammation is hypothesized to be a key component of alpha-synuclein (aSyn) aggregation within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract in the pathological progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). The function of the GI tract is governed by a system of neurons that form part of the enteric nervous system (ENS). The ENS hosts  100-500 million nerve cells within two thin layers lining the GI tract. The gut-brain axis (GBA) is the major communication pathway between the ENS and the central nervous system. It has become increasingly clear that the microbiota in the gut are key regulators of GBA function and help to maintain homeostasis in the immune and endocrine systems. The GBA may act as a possible etiological launching pad for the pathogenesis of age-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as PD, because of an imbalance in the gut microbiota. PD is a multi-faceted illness with multiple biological, immunological, and environmental factors contributing to its pathological progression. Interestingly, individuals with PD have an altered gut microbiota compared to healthy individuals. However, there is a lack of literature describing the relationship between microbiota composition in the gut and symptom progression in PD patients. This review article examines how the pathology and symptomology of PD may originate from dysregulated signaling in the ENS. We then discuss by targeting the imbalance within the gut microbiota such as prebiotics and probiotics, some of the prodromal symptoms might be alleviated, possibly curtailing the pathological spread of aSyn and ensuing debilitating motor symptoms.",Journal of Parkinson's disease,2022,Dennis G Chan; Katelyn Ventura; Ally Villeneuve; Paul Du Bois; Matthew R Holahan

The beneficial effects of DR are being increasingly acknowledged in aging and in a series of age-related neurodegenerative disorders, for example, Parkinson's disease (PD). To date, the pathogenesis of PD remains elusive and there is no cure for it in spite of intensive research over decades. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the efficacy of DR on PD, focusing on the underlying mechanisms involving general metabolism, neuroendocrinolgy, neuroinflammation, gut microbiome, and so on.

36216843,Fecal microbiome alterations in treatment-naive de novo Parkinson's disease.,"Gut microbiota alterations in Parkinson's disease (PD) have been found in several studies and are suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis of PD. However, previous results could not be adequately adjusted for a potential confounding effect of PD medication and disease duration, as almost all PD participants were already using dopaminergic medication and were included several years after diagnosis. Here, the gut microbiome composition of treatment-naive de novo PD subjects was assessed compared to healthy controls (HC) in two large independent case-control cohorts (n = 136 and 56 PD, n = 85 and 87 HC), using 16S-sequencing of fecal samples. Relevant variables such as technical batches, diet and constipation were assessed for their potential effects. Overall gut microbiome composition differed between PD and HC in both cohorts, suggesting gut microbiome alterations are already present in de novo PD subjects at the time of diagnosis, without the possible confounding effect of dopaminergic medication. Although no differentially abundant taxon could be replicated in both cohorts, multiple short chain fatty acids (SCFA) producing taxa were decreased in PD in both cohorts. In particular, several taxa belonging to the family Lachnospiraceae were decreased in abundance. Fewer taxonomic differences were found compared to previous studies, indicating smaller effect sizes in de novo PD.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2022,Jeffrey M Boertien; Kirsi Murtomäki; Pedro A B Pereira; Sygrid van der Zee; Tuomas H Mertsalmi; Reeta Levo; Tanja Nojonen; Elina Mäkinen; Elina Jaakkola; Pia Laine; Lars Paulin; Eero Pekkonen; Valtteri Kaasinen; Petri Auvinen; Filip Scheperjans; Teus van Laar; 
36072564,Age-dependent effects of gut microbiota metabolites on brain resident macrophages.,"In recent years, development of age-related diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, as well as other brain disorders, including anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia have been shown to be associated with changes in the gut microbiome. Several factors can induce an alteration in the bacterial composition of the host's gastrointestinal tract. Besides dietary changes and frequent use of antibiotics, the microbiome is also profoundly affected by aging. Levels of microbiota-derived metabolites are elevated in older individuals with age-associated diseases and cognitive defects compared to younger, healthy age groups. The identified metabolites with higher concentration in aged hosts, which include choline and trimethylamine, are known risk factors for age-related diseases. While the underlying mechanisms and pathways remain elusive for the most part, it has been shown, that these metabolites are able to trigger the innate immunity in the central nervous system by influencing development and activation status of brain-resident macrophages. The macrophages residing in the brain comprise parenchymal microglia and non-parenchymal macrophages located in the perivascular spaces, meninges, and the choroid plexus. In this review, we highlight the impact of age on the composition of the microbiome and microbiota-derived metabolites and their influence on age-associated diseases caused by dysfunctional brain-resident macrophages.",Frontiers in cellular neuroscience,2022,Dilara Hasavci; Thomas Blank
36009361,Pain and Opioid-Induced Gut Microbial Dysbiosis.,"Opioid-induced dysbiosis (OID) is a specific condition describing the consequences of opioid use on the bacterial composition of the gut. Opioids have been shown to affect the epithelial barrier in the gut and modulate inflammatory pathways, possibly mediating opioid tolerance or opioid-induced hyperalgesia; in combination, these allow the invasion and proliferation of non-native bacterial colonies. There is also evidence that the gut-brain axis is linked to the emotional and cognitive aspects of the brain with intestinal function, which can be a factor that affects mental health. For example, <i>Mycobacterium</i>, <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Clostridium difficile</i> are linked to Irritable Bowel Disease; <i>Lactobacillaceae</i> and <i>Enterococcacae</i> have associations with Parkinson's disease, and <i>Alistipes</i> has increased prevalence in depression. However, changes to the gut microbiome can be therapeutically influenced with treatments such as faecal microbiota transplantation, targeted antibiotic therapy and probiotics. There is also evidence of emerging therapies to combat OID. This review has collated evidence that shows that there are correlations between OID and depression, Parkinson's Disease, infection, and more. Specifically, in pain management, targeting OID deserves specific investigations.",Biomedicines,2022,Karen R Thomas; Jacob Watt; Chuen Mong J Wu; Adejoke Akinrinoye; Sairah Amjad; Lucy Colvin; Rachel Cowe; Sylvia H Duncan; Wendy R Russell; Patrice Forget
35994167,Parkinson's Disease: A Multisystem Disorder.,"The way sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD) is perceived has undergone drastic changes in recent decades. For a long time, PD was considered a brain disease characterized by motor disturbances; however, the identification of several risk factors and the hypothesis that PD has a gastrointestinal onset have shed additional light. Today, after recognition of prodromal non-motor symptoms and the pathological processes driving their evolution, there is a greater understanding of the involvement of other organ systems. For this reason, PD is increasingly seen as a multiorgan and multisystemic pathology that arises from the interaction of susceptible genetic factors with a challenging environment during aging-related decline.",Neuroscience bulletin,2023,Helena Nunes Costa; Ana Raquel Esteves; Nuno Empadinhas; Sandra Morais Cardoso
35965349,Systematic profiling of the chicken gut microbiome reveals dietary supplementation with antibiotics alters expression of multiple microbial pathways with minimal impact on community structure.,"The emergence of antimicrobial resistance is a major threat to global health and has placed pressure on the livestock industry to eliminate the use of antibiotic growth promotants (AGPs) as feed additives. To mitigate their removal, efficacious alternatives are required. AGPs are thought to operate through modulating the gut microbiome to limit opportunities for colonization by pathogens, increase nutrient utilization, and reduce inflammation. However, little is known concerning the underlying mechanisms. Previous studies investigating the effects of AGPs on the poultry gut microbiome have largely focused on 16S rDNA surveys based on a single gastrointestinal (GI) site, diet, and/or timepoint, resulting in an inconsistent view of their impact on community composition.In this study, we perform a systematic investigation of both the composition and function of the chicken gut microbiome, in response to AGPs. Birds were raised under two different diets and AGP treatments, and 16S rDNA surveys applied to six GI sites sampled at three key timepoints of the poultry life cycle. Functional investigations were performed through metatranscriptomics analyses and metabolomics.Our study reveals a more nuanced view of the impact of AGPs, dependent on age of bird, diet, and intestinal site sampled. Although AGPs have a limited impact on taxonomic abundances, they do appear to redefine influential taxa that may promote the exclusion of other taxa. Microbiome expression profiles further reveal a complex landscape in both the expression and taxonomic representation of multiple pathways including cell wall biogenesis, antimicrobial resistance, and several involved in energy, amino acid, and nucleotide metabolism. Many AGP-induced changes in metabolic enzyme expression likely serve to redirect metabolic flux with the potential to regulate bacterial growth or produce metabolites that impact the host.As alternative feed additives are developed to mimic the action of AGPs, our study highlights the need to ensure such alternatives result in functional changes that are consistent with site-, age-, and diet-associated taxa. The genes and pathways identified in this study are therefore expected to drive future studies, applying tools such as community-based metabolic modeling, focusing on the mechanistic impact of different dietary regimes on the microbiome. Consequently, the data generated in this study will be crucial for the development of next-generation feed additives targeting gut health and poultry production.

35914559,Oral ingestion of the environmental toxicant trichloroethylene in rats induces alterations in the gut microbiome: Relevance to idiopathic Parkinson's disease.,"Microbial alterations within the gut microbiome appear to be a common feature of individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD), providing further evidence for the role of the gut-brain axis in PD development. As a major site of contact with the environment, questions have emerged surrounding the cause and effect of alterations to the gut microbiome by environmental contaminants associated with PD risk, such as pesticides, metals, and organic solvents. Recent data from our lab shows that ingestion of the industrial byproduct and environmental pollutant trichloroethylene (TCE) induces key Parkinsonian pathology within aged rats, including the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, α-synuclein accumulation, neuroinflammation, and endolysosomal deficits. As TCE is the most common organic contaminant within drinking water, we postulated that ingestion of TCE associated with PD-related neurodegeneration may alter the gut microbiome to a similar extent as observed in persons with PD. To assess this, we collected fecal samples from adult rats treated with 200 mg/kg TCE over 6 weeks via oral gavage - the dose that produced nigrostriatal neurodegeneration - and analyzed the gut microbiome via whole genome shotgun sequencing. Our results showed changes in gut microorganisms reflective of the microbial signatures observed in individuals with idiopathic PD, such as decreased abundance of short-chain fatty acid producing Blautia and elevated lactic-acid producing Bifidobacteria, as well as genera who contain species previously reported as opportunistic pathogens such as Clostridium. From these experimental data, we postulate that TCE exposure within contaminated drinking water could induce alterations of the gut microbiome that contributes to chronic disease risk, including idiopathic PD.",Toxicology and applied pharmacology,2022,Neda M Ilieva; Zachary D Wallen; Briana R De Miranda
35855338,Effects of Ketogenic Diet on Neuroinflammation in Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"The ketogenic diet (KD) is a low-carbohydrate, high-fat and adequate-protein diet. As a diet mimicking fasting, it triggers the production of ketone bodies (KBs) and brings the body into a state of ketosis. Recent and accumulating studies on humans and animal models have shown that KD is beneficial to neurodegenerative diseases through modulating central and peripheral metabolism, mitochondrial function, inflammation, oxidative stress, autophagy, and the gut microbiome. Complicated interplay of metabolism, gut microbiome, and other mechanisms can regulate neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases by activating multiple molecular and cellular pathways. In this review, we detail the physiological basis of the KD, its functions in regulating neuroinflammation, and its protective role in normal brain aging and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington's disease (HD). We aimed to elucidate the underlying neuroinflammatory mechanisms of KD therapies in neurodegenerative diseases and provide novel insights into their application for neurodegenerative disease prevention and treatment.",Aging and disease,2022,Ziying Jiang; Xi Yin; Miao Wang; Tong Chen; Yuanyuan Wang; Zhongbao Gao; Zhenfu Wang
35798742,Oral and gut dysbiosis leads to functional alterations in Parkinson's disease.,"Although several studies have identified a distinct gut microbial composition in Parkinson's disease (PD), few studies have investigated the oral microbiome or functional alteration of the microbiome in PD. We aimed to investigate the connection between the oral and gut microbiome and the functional changes in the PD-specific gut microbiome using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. The taxonomic composition of the oral and gut microbiome was significantly different between PD patients and healthy controls (P = 0.003 and 0.001, respectively). Oral Lactobacillus was more abundant in PD patients and was associated with opportunistic pathogens in the gut (FDR-adjusted P < 0.038). Functional analysis revealed that microbial gene markers for glutamate and arginine biosynthesis were downregulated, while antimicrobial resistance gene markers were upregulated in PD patients than healthy controls (all P < 0.001). We identified a connection between the oral and gut microbiota in PD, which might lead to functional alteration of the microbiome in PD.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2022,Sungyang Jo; Woorim Kang; Yun Su Hwang; Seung Hyun Lee; Kye Won Park; Mi Sun Kim; Hyunna Lee; Hyung Jeong Yoon; Yoo Kyoung Park; Mauricio Chalita; Je Hee Lee; Hojun Sung; Jae-Yun Lee; Jin-Woo Bae; Sun Ju Chung
35786740,Gut instincts in neuroimmunity from the eighteenth to twenty-first centuries.,"In the past two decades, work on the microbiota-gut-brain axis has led to a renewed appreciation for the interconnectedness between body systems in both clinical and scientific circles. In the USA alone, millions of adults are burdened with non-communicable chronic diseases whose putative etiologies were previously thought to be restricted to either the gut or brain, such as inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, and autism spectrum disorder. However, the recent explosion of research into the impacts of the gut microbiome on diverse aspects of human health has revealed the potentially critical importance of reciprocal interactions between the gut microbiota, the immune system, and the brain in diverse diseases and disorders. In this review, we revisit the history of gut-brain interactions in science and medicine, which dates back to at least the eighteenth century, and outline how concepts in this field have shifted and evolved across eras. Next, we highlight the modern resurgence of gut-brain axis research, focusing on neuro-immune-microbiota interactions and recent progress towards a mechanistic understanding of the diverse impacts of the microbiome on human health. Finally, we offer a forward-looking perspective on the future of microbiota-gut-brain research, which may eventually reveal new paths towards the treatment of diverse diseases influenced by the complex connections between the microbiota and the brain.",Seminars in immunopathology,2022,Mytien Nguyen; Noah W Palm
35743072,PARK7/DJ-1 as a Therapeutic Target in Gut-Brain Axis Diseases.,"It is increasingly known that Parkinson's (PD) and Alzheimer's (AD) diseases occur more frequently in patients with inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases including inflammatory bowel (IBD) or celiac disease, indicating a pathological link between them. Although epidemiological observations suggest the existence of the gut-brain axis (GBA) involving systemic inflammatory and neural pathways, little is known about the exact molecular mechanisms. Parkinson's disease 7 (PARK7/DJ-1) is a multifunctional protein whose protective role has been widely demonstrated in neurodegenerative diseases, including PD, AD, or ischemic stroke. Recent studies also revealed the importance of PARK7/DJ-1 in the maintenance of the gut microbiome and also in the regulation of intestinal inflammation. All these findings suggest that PARK7/DJ-1 may be a link and also a potential therapeutic target in gut and brain diseases. In this review, therefore, we discuss our current knowledge about PARK7/DJ-1 in the context of GBA diseases.",International journal of molecular sciences,2022,Domonkos Pap; Apor Veres-Székely; Beáta Szebeni; Ádám Vannay
35723531,Bacterial Butyrate in Parkinson's Disease Is Linked to Epigenetic Changes and Depressive Symptoms.,"The gut microbiome and its metabolites can impact brain health and are altered in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. It has been recently demonstrated that PD patients have reduced fecal levels of the potent epigenetic modulator butyrate and its bacterial producers.Here, we investigate whether the changes in the gut microbiome and associated metabolites are related to PD symptoms and epigenetic markers in leucocytes and neurons.Stool, whole blood samples, and clinical data were collected from 55 PD patients and 55 controls. We performed DNA methylation analysis on whole blood samples and analyzed the results in relation to fecal short-chain fatty acid concentrations and microbiota composition. In another cohort, prefrontal cortex neurons were isolated from control and PD brains. We identified genome-wide DNA methylation by targeted bisulfite sequencing.We show that lower fecal butyrate and reduced counts of genera Roseburia, Romboutsia, and Prevotella are related to depressive symptoms in PD patients. Genes containing butyrate-associated methylation sites include PD risk genes and significantly overlap with sites epigenetically altered in PD blood leucocytes, predominantly neutrophils, and in brain neurons, relative to controls. Moreover, butyrate-associated methylated-DNA regions in PD overlap with those altered in gastrointestinal (GI), autoimmune, and psychiatric diseases.Decreased levels of bacterially produced butyrate are related to epigenetic changes in leucocytes and neurons from PD patients and to the severity of their depressive symptoms. PD shares common butyrate-dependent epigenetic changes with certain GI and psychiatric disorders, which could be relevant for their epidemiological relation. © 2022 The Authors.

35722294,"Integrated Microbiome and Host Transcriptome Profiles Link Parkinson's Disease to <i>Blautia</i> Genus: Evidence From Feces, Blood, and Brain.","A link between the gut microbiome and Parkinson's disease (PD) has been intensively studied, and more than 100 differential genera were identified across the studies. However, the predominant genera contributing to PD remain poorly understood. Inspired by recent advances showing microbiota distribution in the blood and brain, we, here, comprehensively investigated currently available fecal microbiome data (1,914 samples) to identify significantly altered genera, which were further validated by comparison to the results from microbiome analysis of blood (85 samples) and brain (268 samples). Our data showed that the composition of fecal microbiota was different from that of blood and brain. We found that <i>Blautia</i> was the unique genus consistently depleted across feces, blood, and brain samples of PD patients (<i>P</i> < 0.05), despite using rigorous criteria to remove contaminants. Moreover, enrichment analyses revealed that host genes correlated with <i>Blautia</i> genus abundance were mainly involved in mitochondrial function and energy metabolism, and mapped to neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) and metabolic diseases. A random forest classifier constructed with fecal microbiota data demonstrated that <i>Blautia</i> genus was an important feature contributing to discriminating PD patients from controls [receiver operating characteristic (ROC)-area under curve (AUC) = 0.704, precision-recall curve (PRC)-AUC = 0.787]. Through the integration of microbiome and transcriptome, our study depicted microbial profiles in the feces, blood, and brain of PD patients, and identified <i>Blautia</i> genus as a potential genus linked to PD. Further studies are greatly encouraged to determine the role of <i>Blautia</i> genus in the pathogenesis of PD.",Frontiers in microbiology,2022,Xingzhi Guo; Peng Tang; Chen Hou; Li Chong; Xin Zhang; Peng Liu; Li Chen; Yue Liu; Lina Zhang; Rui Li
35708472,Neuroinflammation: A Distal Consequence of Periodontitis.,"Periodontitis, a chronic, inflammatory disease, induces systemic inflammation and contributes to the development of neurodegenerative diseases. The precise etiology of the most common neurodegenerative disorders, such as sporadic Alzheimer's, Parkinson's diseases and multiple sclerosis (AD, PD, and MS, respectively), remains to be revealed. Chronic neuroinflammation is a well-recognized component of these disorders, and evidence suggests that systemic inflammation is a possible stimulus for neuroinflammation development. Systemic inflammation can lead to deleterious consequences on the brain if the inflammation is sufficiently severe or if the brain shows vulnerabilities due to genetic predisposition, aging, or neurodegenerative diseases. It has been proposed that periodontal disease can initiate or contribute to the AD pathogenesis through multiple pathways, including key periodontal pathogens. Dysbiotic oral bacteria can release bacterial products into the bloodstream and eventually cross the brain-blood barrier; these bacteria can also cause alterations to gut microbiota that enhance inflammation and potentially affect brain function via the gut-brain axis. The trigeminal nerve has been suggested as another route for connecting oral bacterial products to the brain. PD and MS are often preceded by gastrointestinal symptoms or aberrant gut microbiome composition, and alterations in the enteric nervous system accompany the disease. Clinical evidence has suggested that patients with periodontitis are at a higher risk of developing PD and MS. This nexus among the brain, periodontal disease, and systemic inflammation heralds new ways in which microglial cells, the main innate immune cells, and astrocytes, the crucial regulators of innate and adaptive immune responses in the brain, contribute to brain pathology. Currently, the lack of understanding of the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration is hindering treatment development. However, we may prevent this pathogenesis by tackling one of its possible contributors (periodontitis) for systemic inflammation through simple preventive oral hygiene measures.",Journal of dental research,2022,X Li; M Kiprowska; T Kansara; P Kansara; P Li
35674870,Neurodegeneration and Neuroinflammation in Parkinson's Disease: a Self-Sustained Loop.,"Neuroinflammation plays a significant role in Parkinson's disease (PD) etiology along with mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired proteostasis. In this context, mechanisms related to immune response can act as modifiers at different steps of the neurodegenerative process and justify the growing interest in anti-inflammatory agents as potential disease-modifying treatments in PD. The discovery of inherited gene mutations in PD has allowed researchers to develop cellular and animal models to study the mechanisms of the underlying biology, but the original cause of neuroinflammation in PD is still debated to date.Cell autonomous alterations in neuronal cells, including mitochondrial damage and protein aggregation, could play a role, but recent findings also highlighted the importance of intercellular communication at both local and systemic level. This has given rise to debate about the role of non-neuronal cells in PD and reignited intense research into the gut-brain axis and other non-neuronal interactions in the development of the disease. Whatever the original trigger of neuroinflammation in PD, what appears quite clear is that the aberrant activation of glial cells and other components of the immune system creates a vicious circle in which neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation nourish each other. In this review, we will provide an up-to-date summary of the main cellular alterations underlying neuroinflammation in PD, including those induced by environmental factors (e.g. the gut microbiome) and those related to the genetic background of affected patients. Starting from the lesson provided by familial forms of PD, we will discuss pathophysiological mechanisms linked to inflammation that could also play a role in idiopathic forms. Finally, we will comment on the potential clinical translatability of immunobiomarkers identified in PD patient cohorts and provide an update on current therapeutic strategies aimed at overcoming or preventing inflammation in PD.",Current neurology and neuroscience reports,2022,G Arena; K Sharma; G Agyeah; R Krüger; A Grünewald; J C Fitzgerald
35656540,The Gut Microbiome in Parkinson's Disease: A Longitudinal Study of the Impacts on Disease Progression and the Use of Device-Assisted Therapies.,"Altered gut microbiome (GM) composition has been established in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, few studies have longitudinally investigated the GM in PD, or the impact of device-assisted therapies.To investigate the temporal stability of GM profiles from PD patients on standard therapies and those initiating device-assisted therapies (DAT) and define multivariate models of disease and progression.We evaluated validated clinical questionnaires and stool samples from 74 PD patients and 74 household controls (HCs) at 0, 6, and 12 months. Faster or slower disease progression was defined from levodopa equivalence dose and motor severity measures. 19 PD patients initiating Deep Brain Stimulation or Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel were separately evaluated at 0, 6, and 12 months post-therapy initiation.Persistent underrepresentation of short-chain fatty-acid-producing bacteria, <i>Butyricicoccus, Fusicatenibacter, Lachnospiraceae ND3007 group</i>, and <i>Erysipelotrichaceae UCG-003</i>, were apparent in PD patients relative to controls. A sustained effect of DAT initiation on GM associations with PD was not observed. PD progression analysis indicated that the genus <i>Barnesiella</i> was underrepresented in faster progressing PD patients at <i>t</i> = 0 and <i>t</i> = 12 months. Two-stage predictive modeling, integrating microbiota abundances and nutritional profiles, improved predictive capacity (change in Area Under the Curve from 0.58 to 0.64) when assessed at Amplicon Sequence Variant taxonomic resolution.We present longitudinal GM studies in PD patients, showing persistently altered GM profiles suggestive of a reduced butyrogenic production potential. DATs exerted variable GM influences across the short and longer-term. We found that specific GM profiles combined with dietary factors improved prediction of disease progression in PD patients.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2022,Michal Lubomski; Xiangnan Xu; Andrew J Holmes; Samuel Muller; Jean Y H Yang; Ryan L Davis; Carolyn M Sue
35654142,Mechanistic insights into accelerated α-synuclein aggregation mediated by human microbiome-associated functional amyloids.,"The gut microbiome has been shown to have key implications in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). The Escherichia coli functional amyloid CsgA is known to accelerate α-synuclein aggregation in vitro and induce PD symptoms in mice. However, the mechanism governing CsgA-mediated acceleration of α-synuclein aggregation is unclear. Here, we show that CsgA can form stable homodimeric species that correlate with faster α-synuclein amyloid aggregation. Furthermore, we identify and characterize new CsgA homologs encoded by bacteria present in the human microbiome. These CsgA homologs display diverse aggregation kinetics, and they differ in their ability to modulate α-synuclein aggregation. Remarkably, we demonstrate that slowing down CsgA aggregation leads to an increased acceleration of α-synuclein aggregation, suggesting that the intrinsic amyloidogenicity of gut bacterial CsgA homologs affects their ability to accelerate α-synuclein aggregation. Finally, we identify a complex between CsgA and α-synuclein that functions as a platform to accelerate α-synuclein aggregation. Taken together, our work reveals complex interplay between bacterial amyloids and α-synuclein that better informs our understanding of PD causation.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2022,Sujeet S Bhoite; Yilin Han; Brandon T Ruotolo; Matthew R Chapman
35645785,Nutritional Intake and Gut Microbiome Composition Predict Parkinson's Disease.,"Models to predict Parkinson's disease (PD) incorporating alterations of gut microbiome (GM) composition have been reported with varying success.To assess the utility of GM compositional changes combined with macronutrient intake to develop a predictive model of PD.We performed a cross-sectional analysis of the GM and nutritional intake in 103 PD patients and 81 household controls (HCs). GM composition was determined by 16S amplicon sequencing of the V3-V4 region of bacterial ribosomal DNA isolated from stool. To determine multivariate disease-discriminant associations, we developed two models using Random Forest and support-vector machine (SVM) methodologies.Using updated taxonomic reference, we identified significant compositional differences in the GM profiles of PD patients in association with a variety of clinical PD characteristics. Six genera were overrepresented and eight underrepresented in PD patients relative to HCs, with the largest difference being overrepresentation of <i>Lactobacillaceae</i> at family taxonomic level. Correlation analyses highlighted multiple associations between clinical characteristics and select taxa, whilst constipation severity, physical activity and pharmacological therapies associated with changes in beta diversity. The random forest model of PD, incorporating taxonomic data at the genus level and carbohydrate contribution to total energy demonstrated the best predictive capacity [Area under the ROC Curve (AUC) of 0.74].The notable differences in GM diversity and composition when combined with clinical measures and nutritional data enabled the development of a predictive model to identify PD. These findings support the combination of GM and nutritional data as a potentially useful biomarker of PD to improve diagnosis and guide clinical management.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2022,Michal Lubomski; Xiangnan Xu; Andrew J Holmes; Samuel Muller; Jean Y H Yang; Ryan L Davis; Carolyn M Sue
35610236,Probiotics synergized with conventional regimen in managing Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is mainly managed by pharmacological therapy (e.g., Benserazide and dopamine agonists). However, prolonged use of these drugs would gradually diminish their dopaminergic effect. Gut dysbiosis was observed in some patients with PD, suggesting close association between the gut microbiome and PD. Probiotics modulate the host's gut microbiota beneficially. A 3-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted to investigate the beneficial effect of probiotic co-administration in patients with PD. Eighty-two PD patients were recruited and randomly divided into probiotic [n = 48; Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Probio-M8 (Probio-M8), Benserazide, dopamine agonists] and placebo (n = 34; placebo, Benserazide, dopamine agonists) groups. Finally, 45 and 29 patients from Probio-M8 and placebo groups provided complete fecal and serum samples for further omics analysis, respectively. The results showed that Probio-M8 co-administration conferred added benefits by improving sleep quality, alleviating anxiety, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Metagenomic analysis showed that, after the intervention, there were significantly more species-level genome bins (SGBs) of Bifidobacterium animalis, Ruminococcaceae, and Lachnospira, while less Lactobacillus fermentum and Klebsiella oxytoca in Probio-M8 group (P < 0.05). Interestingly, Lactobacillus fermentum correlated positively with the scores of UPDRS-III, HAMA, HAMD-17, and negatively with MMSE. Klebsiella oxytoca correlated negatively with feces hardness. Moreover, co-administering Probio-M8 increased SGBs involved in tryptophan degradation, gamma-aminobutyric acid, short-chain fatty acids, and secondary bile acid biosynthesis, as well as serum acetic acid and dopamine levels (P < 0.05). Taken together, Probio-M8 synergized with the conventional regimen and strengthened the clinical efficacy in managing PD, accompanied by modifications of the host's gut microbiome, gut microbial metabolic potential, and serum metabolites.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2022,Hairong Sun; Feiyan Zhao; Yuanyuan Liu; Teng Ma; Hao Jin; Keyu Quan; Bing Leng; Junwu Zhao; Xiaoling Yuan; Zhenguang Li; Fang Li; Lai-Yu Kwok; Shukun Zhang; Zhihong Sun; Jinbiao Zhang; Heping Zhang

35572407,Interplay of gut microbiota and oxidative stress: Perspective on neurodegeneration and neuroprotection.,"Recent research on the implications of gut microbiota on brain functions has helped to gather important information on the relationship between them. Pathogenesis of neurological disorders is found to be associated with dysregulation of gut-brain axis. Some gut bacteria metabolites are found to be directly associated with the increase in reactive oxygen species levels, one of the most important risk factors of neurodegeneration. Besides their morbid association, gut bacteria metabolites are also found to play a significant role in reducing the onset of these life-threatening brain disorders.Studies done in the recent past raises two most important link between gut microbiota and the brain: ""gut microbiota-oxidative stress-neurodegeneration"" and gut microbiota-antioxidant-neuroprotection. This review aims to gives a deep insight to our readers, of the collective studies done, focusing on the gut microbiota mediated oxidative stress involved in neurodegeneration along with a focus on those studies showing the involvement of gut microbiota and their metabolites in neuroprotection.This review is focused on three main key concepts. Firstly, the mounting evidences from clinical and preclinical arenas shows the influence of gut microbiota mediated oxidative stress resulting in dysfunctional neurological processes. Therefore, we describe the potential role of gut microbiota influencing the vulnerability of brain to oxidative stress, and a budding causative in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Secondly, contributing roles of gut microbiota has been observed in attenuating oxidative stress and inflammation via its own metabolites or by producing secondary metabolites and, also modulation in gut microbiota population with antioxidative and anti-inflammatory probiotics have shown promising neuro resilience. Thirdly, high throughput <i>in silico</i> tools and databases also gives a correlation of gut microbiome, their metabolites and brain health, thus providing fascinating perspective and promising new avenues for therapeutic options.",Journal of advanced research,2022,Shruti Shandilya; Sandeep Kumar; Niraj Kumar Jha; Kavindra Kumar Kesari; Janne Ruokolainen
35571084,Using <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> to Model Therapeutic Interventions of Neurodegenerative Diseases Targeting Microbe-Host Interactions.,"Emerging evidence from both clinical studies and animal models indicates the importance of the interaction between the gut microbiome and the brain in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). Although how microbes modulate neurodegeneration is still mostly unclear, recent studies have started to probe into the mechanisms for the communication between microbes and hosts in NDs. In this review, we highlight the advantages of using <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> (C. elegans) to disentangle the microbe-host interaction that regulates neurodegeneration. We summarize the microbial pro- and anti-neurodegenerative factors identified using the <i>C. elegans</i> ND models and the effects of many are confirmed in mouse models. Specifically, we focused on the role of bacterial amyloid proteins, such as curli, in promoting proteotoxicity and neurodegeneration by cross-seeding the aggregation of endogenous ND-related proteins, such as α-synuclein. Targeting bacterial amyloid production may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy for treating NDs, and several compounds, such as epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), were shown to suppress neurodegeneration at least partly by inhibiting curli production. Because bacterial amyloid fibrils contribute to biofilm formation, inhibition of amyloid production often leads to the disruption of biofilms. Interestingly, from a list of 59 compounds that showed neuroprotective effects in <i>C. elegans</i> and mouse ND models, we found that about half of them are known to inhibit bacterial growth or biofilm formation, suggesting a strong correlation between the neuroprotective and antibiofilm activities. Whether these potential therapeutics indeed protect neurons from proteotoxicity by inhibiting the cross-seeding between bacterial and human amyloid proteins awaits further investigations. Finally, we propose to screen the long list of antibiofilm agents, both FDA-approved drugs and novel compounds, for their neuroprotective effects and develop new pharmaceuticals that target the gut microbiome for the treatment of NDs. To this end, the <i>C. elegans</i> ND models can serve as a platform for fast, high-throughput, and low-cost drug screens that target the microbe-host interaction in NDs.",Frontiers in pharmacology,2022,Chenyin Wang; Chaogu Zheng
35565918,The Therapeutic Role of Ketogenic Diet in Neurological Disorders.,"The ketogenic diet (KD) is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate and adequate-protein diet that has gained popularity in recent years in the context of neurological diseases (NDs). The complexity of the pathogenesis of these diseases means that effective forms of treatment are still lacking. Conventional therapy is often associated with increasing tolerance and/or drug resistance. Consequently, more effective therapeutic strategies are being sought to increase the effectiveness of available forms of therapy and improve the quality of life of patients. For the moment, it seems that KD can provide therapeutic benefits in patients with neurological problems by effectively controlling the balance between pro- and antioxidant processes and pro-excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, and modulating inflammation or changing the composition of the gut microbiome. In this review we evaluated the potential therapeutic efficacy of KD in epilepsy, depression, migraine, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. In our opinion, KD should be considered as an adjuvant therapeutic option for some neurological diseases.",Nutrients,2022,Diana Pietrzak; Kamila Kasperek; Paweł Rękawek; Iwona Piątkowska-Chmiel
35513230,Evidence for immune system alterations in peripheral biological fluids in Parkinson's disease.,"Immune-related alterations in Parkinson's disease (PD) can be monitored by assessing peripheral biological fluids that show that specific inflammatory pathways contribute to a chronic pro-inflammatory status. This pro-inflammatory activity is hypothesized to be already present in the prodromal stages of PD. These pathways maintain and reinforce chronic neurodegeneration by stimulating cell activation and proliferation what triggers the pro-inflammatory status as well. The gut microbiome possibly contributes to inflammatory pathways and shows specific differences in fecal samples from PD compared to healthy controls. In PD, Bacteroides abundance correlates with inflammatory markers in blood and motor impairment. Increased pro-inflammatory and decreased anti-inflammatory bacterial colonization can lead to changes in the metabolic pathways of amino acids, inducing increased membrane permeability, described as a leaky gut, enabling advanced contact between immune cells and gut microbiome and potentially a spreading of neuroinflammation through the body via the blood. Increased cytokine blood levels in PD are correlated with disease severity, motor symptoms, and clinical phenotypes. α-synuclein is a central player in PD-associated inflammation, inducing specific T-cell activity and triggering microglial activation in the central nervous system (CNS). Misfolded α-synuclein propagation possibly results in the spreading of aggregated α-synuclein from neuron to neuron leading to a sustained neuroinflammation. This is supported by age-dependent defects of protein uptake in microglia and monocytes, so-called ""inflammaging"", including α-synuclein oligomers, as the key pathological protein in PD. Genetic risk markers and inherited forms of PD are also associated with inflammation, which is highly relevant for potential therapeutical targets. The documented associations of inflammatory markers and clinical phenotypes indicate a pro-inflammatory concept of specific PD pathophysiology here. An in-depth understanding of inflammatory mechanisms in PD from bottom (gut) to top (CNS) and vice versa is needed to design novel immunomodulatory approaches to delay or even stop PD. Future studies focusing on structured protocols in large patient cohorts with appropriate control groups and comparative analysis among studies will aid the discovery of novel candidate biomarkers.",Neurobiology of disease,2022,Michael Bartl; Mary Xylaki; Mathias Bähr; Sandrina Weber; Claudia Trenkwalder; Brit Mollenhauer
35477134,Effects of therapeutic levels of dietary antibiotics on the cecal microbiome composition of broiler chickens.,"Dietary antibiotics, including antibiotic growth promoters (AGPs), have been commonly used to improve health and growth of poultry. The present study investigated the effects of therapeutic doses of dietary antibiotics, including bacitracin methylene disalicylate (BMD), penicillin G potassium (PP) and an ionophore (salinomycin, SA), on the cecal microbiome of chickens. BMD and SA treatments were given as dietary supplements from d 1 to 35 of age. The SAPP (salinomycin+ penicillin G potassium) group was given SA as a dietary supplement from d 1 to 35 of age and PP was added to drinking water from d 19 to 24 of age to simulate common practices for control of necrotic enteritis in broilers. The cecal contents were collected from all treatment groups on d 10, 24, and 35 of age and DNA was extracted for metagenomic analysis of the cecal microbiome. The results revealed that dietary or water supplementation of therapeutic levels of antibiotics and ionophores to chickens significantly altered the cecal microbial homeostasis during different stages of the chicken life. The alpha diversity analysis showed that BMD, SA, and SAPP treatments decreased diversity and evenness of the cecal microbiome of treated chickens on d 10 of age. Species richness was also reduced on d 35 following treatment with BMD. Beta diversity analyses revealed that SAPP and BMD induced significant changes in the relative abundance of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria on d 10, while no significant differences were observed on d 24. On d 35, the non-treated control group had higher relative abundance of unclassified Gram-positive and -negative bacteria compared to SA, SAPP, and BMD treatment groups. Overall, despite their beneficial role in controlling necrotic enteritis outbreaks, the findings of this study highlight the potential negative effects of dietary supplementation of therapeutic levels of antibiotics on the gut microbiome and suggest that adjusting gut bacteria may be required to restore microbial richness and diversity of the gut microbiome following treatment with these antibiotics.",Poultry science,2022,Seyed Hossien Kairmi; Khaled Taha-Abdelaziz; Alexander Yitbarek; Mehdi Sargolzaei; Heidi Spahany; Jake Astill; Bahram Shojadoost; Mohammadali Alizadeh; Raveendra R Kulkarni; John Parkinson; Shayan Sharif
35443740,Role of diet and its effects on the gut microbiome in the pathophysiology of mental disorders.,"There is emerging evidence that diet has a major modulatory influence on brain-gut-microbiome (BGM) interactions with important implications for brain health, and for several brain disorders. The BGM system is made up of neuroendocrine, neural, and immune communication channels which establish a network of bidirectional interactions between the brain, the gut and its microbiome. Diet not only plays a crucial role in shaping the gut microbiome, but it can modulate structure and function of the brain through these communication channels. In this review, we summarize the evidence available from preclinical and clinical studies on the influence of dietary habits and interventions on a selected group of psychiatric and neurologic disorders including depression, cognitive decline, Parkinson's disease, autism spectrum disorder and epilepsy. We will particularly address the role of diet-induced microbiome changes which have been implicated in these effects, and some of which are shared between different brain disorders. While the majority of these findings have been demonstrated in preclinical and in cross-sectional, epidemiological studies, to date there is insufficient evidence from mechanistic human studies to make conclusions about causality between a specific diet and microbially mediated brain function. Many of the dietary benefits on microbiome and brain health have been attributed to anti-inflammatory effects mediated by the microbial metabolites of dietary fiber and polyphenols. The new attention given to dietary factors in brain disorders has the potential to improve treatment outcomes with currently available pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies.",Translational psychiatry,2022,J Horn; D E Mayer; S Chen; E A Mayer
35432226,To the Gut Microbiome and Beyond: The Brain-First or Body-First Hypothesis in Parkinson's Disease.,"There is continued debate regarding Parkinson's disease etiology and whether it originates in the brain or begins in the gut. Recently, evidence has been provided for both, with Parkinson's disease onset presenting as either a ""body-first"" or ""brain-first"" progression. Most research indicates those with Parkinson's disease have an altered gut microbiome compared to controls. However, some studies do not report gut microbiome differences, potentially due to the brain or body-first progression type. Based on the etiology of each proposed progression, individuals with the body-first progression may exhibit altered gut microbiomes, i.e., where short-chain fatty acid producing bacteria are reduced, while the brain-first progression may not. Future microbiome research should consider this hypothesis and investigate whether gut microbiome differences exist between each type of progression. This may further elucidate the impact of the gut microbiome in Parkinson's disease and show how it may not be homogenous across individuals with Parkinson's disease.",Frontiers in microbiology,2022,Nathan D Nuzum; Amy Loughman; Ewa A Szymlek-Gay; Wei-Peng Teo; Ashlee M Hendy; Helen Macpherson
35399136,"Intestinal Dopamine Receptor D2 is Required for Neuroprotection Against 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced Dopaminergic Neurodegeneration.","A wealth of evidence has suggested that gastrointestinal dysfunction is associated with the onset and progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the mechanisms underlying these links remain to be defined. Here, we investigated the impact of deregulation of intestinal dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) signaling in response to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Dopamine/dopamine signaling in the mouse colon decreased with ageing. Selective ablation of Drd2, but not Drd4, in the intestinal epithelium, caused a more severe loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra following MPTP challenge, and this was accompanied by a reduced abundance of succinate-producing Alleoprevotella in the gut microbiota. Administration of succinate markedly attenuated dopaminergic neuronal loss in MPTP-treated mice by elevating the mitochondrial membrane potential. This study suggests that intestinal epithelial DRD2 activity and succinate from the gut microbiome contribute to the maintenance of nigral DA neuron survival. These findings provide a potential strategy targeting neuroinflammation-related neurological disorders such as PD.",Neuroscience bulletin,2022,Hairong Peng; Shui Yu; Yukai Zhang; Yanqing Yin; Jiawei Zhou
35393656,The human microbiome in disease and pathology.,"This narrative review seeks to examine the relationships between bacterial microbiomes and infectious disease. This is achieved by detailing how different human host microbiomes develop and function, from the earliest infant acquisitions of maternal and environmental species through to the full development of microbiomes by adulthood. Communication between bacterial species or communities of species within and outside of the microbiome is a factor in both maintenance of homeostasis and management of threats from the external environment. Dysbiosis of this homeostasis is key to understanding the development of disease states. Several microbiomes and the microbiota within are used as prime examples of how changes in species composition, particularly at the phylum level, leads to such diverse conditions as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), type 2 diabetes, psoriasis, Parkinson's disease, reflux oesophagitis and others. The review examines spatial relationships between microbiomes to understand how dysbiosis in the gut microbiome in particular can influence diseases in distant host sites via routes such as the gut-lung, gut-skin and gut-brain axes. Microbiome interaction with host processes such as adaptive immunity is increasingly identified as critical to developing the capacity of the immune system to react to pathogens. Dysbiosis of essential bacteria involved in modification of host substrates such as bile acid components can result in development of Crohn's disease, small intestine bacterial overgrowth, hepatic cancer and obesity. Interactions between microbiomes in distantly located sites are being increasingly being identified, resulting in a 'whole of body' effect by the combined host microbiome.","APMIS : acta pathologica, microbiologica, et immunologica Scandinavica",2022,Jim Manos
35327401,<i>Drosophila</i> Model for Studying Gut Microbiota in Behaviors and Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Mounting evidence indicates that the gut microbiota is linked to several physiological processes and disease development in mammals; however, the underlying mechanisms remained unexplored mostly due to the complexity of the mammalian gut microbiome. The fruit fly, <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, is a valuable animal model for studying host-gut microbiota interactions in translational aspects. The availability of powerful genetic tools and resources in <i>Drosophila</i> allowed the scientists to unravel the mechanisms by which the gut microbes affect fitness, health, and behavior of their hosts. <i>Drosophila</i> models have been extensively used not only to study animal behaviors (i.e., courtship, aggression, sleep, and learning & memory), but also some human related neurodegenerative diseases (i.e., Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease) in the past.

35326429,Hydrogen Sulfide Produced by Gut Bacteria May Induce Parkinson's Disease.,"Several bacterial species can generate hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S). Study evidence favors the view that the microbiome of the colon harbors increased amounts of H<sub>2</sub>S producing bacteria in Parkinson's disease. Additionally, H<sub>2</sub>S can easily penetrate cell membranes and enter the cell interior. In the cells, excessive amounts of H<sub>2</sub>S can potentially release cytochrome c protein from the mitochondria, increase the iron content of the cytosolic iron pool, and increase the amount of reactive oxygen species. These events can lead to the formation of alpha-synuclein oligomers and fibrils in cells containing the alpha-synuclein protein. In addition, bacterially produced H<sub>2</sub>S can interfere with the body urate metabolism and affect the blood erythrocytes and lymphocytes. Gut bacteria responsible for increased H<sub>2</sub>S production, especially the mucus-associated species of the bacterial genera belonging to the Desulfovibrionaceae and Enterobacteriaceae families, are likely play a role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Special attention should be devoted to changes not only in the colonic but also in the duodenal microbiome composition with regard to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Influenza infections may increase the risk of Parkinson's disease by causing the overgrowth of H<sub>2</sub>S-producing bacteria both in the colon and duodenum.",Cells,2022,Kari Erik Murros
35317228,Analysis methods for the gut microbiome in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.,"For a long time, the central nervous system was believed to be the only regulator of cognitive functions. However, accumulating evidence suggests that the composition of the microbiome is strongly associated with brain functions and diseases. Indeed, the gut microbiome is involved in neuropsychiatric diseases (e.g., depression, autism spectrum disorder, and anxiety) and neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease). In this review, we provide an overview of the link between the gut microbiome and neuropsychiatric or neurodegenerative disorders. We also introduce analytical methods used to assess the connection between the gut microbiome and the brain. The limitations of the methods used at present are also discussed. The accurate translation of the microbiome information to brain disorder could promote better understanding of neuronal diseases and aid in finding alternative and novel therapies.",Computational and structural biotechnology journal,2022,Jae Gwang Song; Myeong-Sang Yu; Bomi Lee; Jingyu Lee; Su-Hee Hwang; Dokyun Na; Hyung Wook Kim
35307514,Gut dysbiosis and age-related neurological diseases in females.,"Historically, females have been underrepresented in biological research. With increased interest in the gut microbiome and the gut-brain axis, it is important for researchers to pursue studies that consider sex as a biological variable. The composition of the gut microbiome is influenced by environmental factors, disease, diet, and varies with age and by sex. Detrimental changes in the gut microbiome, referred to as dysbiosis, is believed to influence the development and progression of age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and stroke. Many are investigating the changes in microbial populations in order or to better understand the role of the gut immunity and the microbiome in neurodegenerative diseases, many of which the exact etiology remains elusive, and no cures exist.  Others are working to find diagnostic markers for earlier detection, or to therapeutically modulate microbial populations using probiotics. However, while all these diseases present in reproductively senescent females, most studies only use male animals for their experimental design. Reproductively senescent females have been shown to have differences in disease progression, inflammatory responses, and microbiota composition, therefore, for research to be translational to affected populations it is necessary for appropriate models to be used. This review discusses factors that influence the gut microbiome and the gut brain axis in females, and highlights studies that have investigated the role of dysbiosis in age-related neurodegenerative disorders that have included females in their study design.",Neurobiology of disease,2022,Janelle M Korf; Bhanu P Ganesh; Louise D McCullough
35281490,Mechanistic Insights Into Gut Microbiome Dysbiosis-Mediated Neuroimmune Dysregulation and Protein Misfolding and Clearance in the Pathogenesis of Chronic Neurodegenerative Disorders.,"The human gut microbiota is a complex, dynamic, and highly diverse community of microorganisms. Beginning as early as <i>in utero</i> fetal development and continuing through birth to late-stage adulthood, the crosstalk between the gut microbiome and brain is essential for modulating various metabolic, neurodevelopmental, and immune-related pathways. Conversely, microbial dysbiosis - defined as alterations in richness and relative abundances - of the gut is implicated in the pathogenesis of several chronic neurological and neurodegenerative disorders. Evidence from large-population cohort studies suggests that individuals with neurodegenerative conditions have an altered gut microbial composition as well as microbial and serum metabolomic profiles distinct from those in the healthy population. Dysbiosis is also linked to psychiatric and gastrointestinal complications - comorbidities often associated with the prodromal phase of Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Studies have identified potential mediators that link gut dysbiosis and neurological disorders. Recent findings have also elucidated the potential mechanisms of disease pathology in the enteric nervous system prior to the onset of neurodegeneration. This review highlights the functional pathways and mechanisms, particularly gut microbe-induced chronic inflammation, protein misfolding, propagation of disease-specific pathology, defective protein clearance, and autoimmune dysregulation, linking gut microbial dysbiosis and neurodegeneration. In addition, we also discuss how pathogenic transformation of microbial composition leads to increased endotoxin production and fewer beneficial metabolites, both of which could trigger immune cell activation and enteric neuronal dysfunction. These can further disrupt intestinal barrier permeability, aggravate the systemic pro-inflammatory state, impair blood-brain barrier permeability and recruit immune mediators leading to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Continued biomedical advances in understanding the microbiota-gut-brain axis will extend the frontier of neurodegenerative disorders and enable the utilization of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to mitigate the pathological burden of these diseases.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2022,Piyush Padhi; Carter Worth; Gary Zenitsky; Huajun Jin; Kumar Sambamurti; Vellareddy Anantharam; Arthi Kanthasamy; Anumantha G Kanthasamy
35207632,Gastrointestinal Dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease: Current and Potential Therapeutics.,"Abnormalities in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of Parkinson's disease (PD) sufferers were first reported over 200 years ago; however, the extent and role of GI dysfunction in PD disease progression is still unknown. GI dysfunctions, including dysphagia, gastroparesis, and constipation, are amongst the most prevalent non-motor symptoms in PD. These symptoms not only impact patient quality of life, but also complicate disease management. Conventional treatment pathways for GI dysfunctions (i.e., constipation), such as increasing fibre and fluid intake, and the use of over-the-counter laxatives, are generally ineffective in PD patients, and approved compounds such as guanylate cyclase C agonists and selective 5-hyroxytryptamine 4 receptor agonists have demonstrated limited efficacy. Thus, identification of potential targets for novel therapies to alleviate PD-induced GI dysfunctions are essential to improve clinical outcomes and quality of life in people with PD. Unlike the central nervous system (CNS), where PD pathology and the mechanisms involved in CNS damage are relatively well characterised, the effect of PD at the cellular and tissue level in the enteric nervous system (ENS) remains unclear, making it difficult to alleviate or reverse GI symptoms. However, the resurgence of interest in understanding how the GI tract is involved in various disease states, such as PD, has resulted in the identification of novel therapeutic avenues. This review focuses on common PD-related GI symptoms, and summarizes the current treatments available and their limitations. We propose that by targeting the intestinal barrier, ENS, and/or the gut microbiome, may prove successful in alleviating PD-related GI symptoms, and discuss emerging therapies and potential drugs that could be repurposed to target these areas.",Journal of personalized medicine,2022,Myat Noe Han; David I Finkelstein; Rachel M McQuade; Shanti Diwakarla
35203906,Parkinson's Disease in Light of the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"In this review we attempt to collate the existing scientific evidence regarding the possible role of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD), as well as to investigate the impact of PD/parkinsonism on the clinical course of the viral infection itself. Since etiology of PD is not completely understood, various studies suggest different potential links between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and PD. Suggested connections include, among others, similar prodromal symptoms, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system involvement, or gut microbiome dysbiosis participation. Despite the initial assumptions that, as a mainly elderly population suffering from rigidity of respiratory muscles, impairment of cough reflex, and dyspnea, PD patients would be more susceptible to viral infection, and would experience a more aggressive course of COVID-19, the published scientific reports contain mutually exclusive data that require further investigation and meta-analysis.",Brain sciences,2022,Anna Drelich-Zbroja; Mateusz Cheda; Maryla Kuczyńska; Izabela Dąbrowska; Ewa Kopyto; Izabela Halczuk
35189807,Rifaximin modulates TRH and TRH-like peptide expression throughout the brain and peripheral tissues of male rats.,"The TRH/TRH-R1 receptor signaling pathway within the neurons of the dorsal vagal complex is an important mediator of the brain-gut axis. Mental health and protection from a variety of neuropathologies, such as autism, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, major depression, migraine and epilepsy are influenced by the gut microbiome and is mediated by the vagus nerve. The antibiotic rifaximin (RF) does not cross the gut-blood barrier. It changes the composition of the gut microbiome resulting in therapeutic benefits for traveler's diarrhea, hepatic encephalopathy, and prostatitis. TRH and TRH-like peptides, with the structure pGlu-X-Pro-NH<sub>2</sub>, where ""X"" can be any amino acid residue, have reproduction-enhancing, caloric-restriction-like, anti-aging, pancreatic-β cell-, cardiovascular-, and neuroprotective effects. TRH and TRH-like peptides occur not only throughout the CNS but also in peripheral tissues. To elucidate the involvement of TRH-like peptides in brain-gut-reproductive system interactions 16 male Sprague-Dawley rats, 203 ± 6 g, were divided into 4 groups (n = 4/group): the control (CON) group remained on ad libitum Purina rodent chow and water for 10 days until decapitation, acute (AC) group receiving 150 mg RF/kg powdered rodent chow for 24 h providing 150 mg RF/kg body weight for 200 g rats, chronic (CHR) animals receiving RF for 10 days; withdrawal (WD) rats receiving RF for 8 days and then normal chow for 2 days.Significant changes in the levels of TRH and TRH-like peptides occurred throughout the brain and peripheral tissues in response to RF. The number of significant changes in TRH and TRH-like peptide levels in brain resulting from RF treatment, in descending order were: medulla (16), piriform cortex (8), nucleus accumbens (7), frontal cortex (5), striatum (3), amygdala (3), entorhinal cortex (3), anterior (2), and posterior cingulate (2), hippocampus (1), hypothalamus (0) and cerebellum (0). The corresponding ranking for peripheral tissues were: prostate (6), adrenals (4), pancreas (3), liver (2), testis (1), heart (0).The sensitivity of TRH and TRH-like peptide expression to RF treatment, particularly in the medulla oblongata and prostate, is consistent with the participation of these peptides in the therapeutic effects of RF.",BMC neuroscience,2022,Albert Eugene Pekary; Albert Sattin
35163103,Gut-Brain Axis as a Pathological and Therapeutic Target for Neurodegenerative Disorders.,"Human lifestyle and dietary behaviors contribute to disease onset and progression. Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), considered multifactorial disorders, have been associated with changes in the gut microbiome. NDDs display pathologies that alter brain functions with a tendency to worsen over time. NDDs are a worldwide health problem; in the US alone, 12 million Americans will suffer from NDDs by 2030. While etiology may vary, the gut microbiome serves as a key element underlying NDD development and prognosis. In particular, an inflammation-associated microbiome plagues NDDs. Conversely, sequestration of this inflammatory microbiome by a correction in the dysbiotic state of the gut may render therapeutic effects on NDDs. To this end, treatment with short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria, the main metabolites responsible for maintaining gut homeostasis, ameliorates the inflammatory microbiome. This intimate pathological link between the gut and NDDs suggests that the gut-brain axis (GBA) acts as an underexplored area for developing therapies for NDDs. Traditionally, the classification of NDDs depends on their clinical presentation, mostly manifesting as extrapyramidal and pyramidal movement disorders, with neuropathological evaluation at autopsy as the gold standard for diagnosis. In this review, we highlight the evolving notion that GBA stands as an equally sensitive pathological marker of NDDs, particularly in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and chronic stroke. Additionally, GBA represents a potent therapeutic target for treating NDDs.",International journal of molecular sciences,2022,Alma Rosa Lezama Toledo; Germán Rivera Monroy; Felipe Esparza Salazar; Jea-Young Lee; Shalini Jain; Hariom Yadav; Cesario Venturina Borlongan
35145822,Constipation and Cigarette Smoking Are Independent Influences for Parkinson's Disease.,"Background Tobacco smokers have reduced Parkinson's disease (PD) risk. Some patients with PD experience constipation long before they develop mobility problems, and constipation is a frequent complaint of people who try to stop smoking. Recently, the gut microbiome has been implicated in PD. Methods In the present study, we analyzed the relationship between smoking and constipation in subjects with PD and controls. We wished to determine whether the effects of smoking and constipation were independent or whether they might be interrelated. To evaluate the relationship, we used a cohort of subjects from the UK Biobank (UKB). Results In 501,174 subjects, the decreased risk of Parkinson's disease with increased smoking was significant (p < 0.001, two-tailed Fisher's exact test). The increased risk of constipation in subjects with PD was significant (p = 0.001, two-tailed Fisher's exact test). Logistic regression was performed; sex, age, constipation, and smoking were the independent variables, and PD present or absent was the dependent variable. The PD odds ratio (OR) for males was 1.790 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.629-1.966) times that for females, indicating that PD is more common in men. The risk of PD increased by 1.140 (95% CI: 1.131-1.149) with every year of age. Constipation increased the risk of PD by 4.043 (95% CI: 1.901-8.599). Smoking diminished PD risk by 0.772 (95% CI: 0.690-0.863). Drinking coffee was associated with a reduced risk of PD (OR: 0.815 (95% CI: 0.730-0.909). Drinking tea reduced PD risk by 0.979 (95% CI: 0.962-0.997) for each cup per day. The effects of sex, age, constipation, smoking, drinking coffee, and drinking tea were independent and significant. Conclusion Our analysis suggests that the favorable effect of smoking on PD is independent of the detrimental effect of constipation. Smoking reduces PD risk because it not only stimulates the bowel to empty and prevents constipation but also alters the gut microbiome. Another factor, perhaps the tobacco component diterpenoids, may be responsible for the PD risk-reducing effect.",Cureus,2022,Steven Lehrer; Peter H Rheinstein
35111696,Gut Microbiota: A Key Regulator in the Effects of Environmental Hazards on Modulates Insulin Resistance.,"Insulin resistance is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), type II diabetes (T2D), and Parkinson's disease (PD). Emerging evidence indicates that these disorders are typically characterized by alterations in the gut microbiota composition, diversity, and their metabolites. Currently, it is understood that environmental hazards including ionizing radiation, toxic heavy metals, pesticides, particle matter, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are capable of interacting with gut microbiota and have a non-beneficial health effect. Based on the current study, we propose the hypothesis of ""gut microenvironment baseline drift"". According to this ""baseline drift"" theory, gut microbiota is a temporarily combined cluster of species sharing the same environmental stresses for a short period, which would change quickly under the influence of different environmental factors. This indicates that the microbial species in the gut do not have a long-term relationship; any split, division, or recombination may occur in different environments. Nonetheless, the ""baseline drift"" theory considers the critical role of the response of the whole gut microbiome. Undoubtedly, this hypothesis implies that the gut microbiota response is not merely a ""cross junction"" switch; in contrast, the human health or disease is a result of a rich palette of gut-microbiota-driven multiple-pathway responses. In summary, environmental factors, including hazardous and normal factors, are critical to the biological impact of the gut microbiota responses and the dual effect of the gut microbiota on the regulation of biological functions. Novel appreciation of the role of gut microbiota and environmental hazards in the insulin resistance would shed new light on insulin resistance and also promote the development of new research direction and new overcoming strategies for patients.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2021,Ruixue Huang
35083314,The small bowel microbiome changes significantly with age and aspects of the ageing process.,"Gut microbiome changes have been associated with human ageing and implicated in age-related diseases including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. However, studies to date have used stool samples, which do not represent the entire gut. Although more challenging to access, the small intestine plays critical roles in host metabolism and immune function. In this paper (Leite <i>et al.</i> (2021), Cell Reports, doi: 10.1016/j.celrep.2021.109765), we demonstrate significant differences in the small intestinal microbiome in older subjects, using duodenal aspirates from 251 subjects aged 18-80 years. Differences included significantly decreased microbial diversity in older subjects, driven by increased relative abundance of phylum Proteobacteria, particularly family Enterobacteriaceae and coliform genera <i>Escherichia</i> and <i>Klebsiella.</i> Moreover, while this decreased diversity was associated with the 'ageing process' (comprising chronologic age, number of medications, and number of concomitant diseases), changes in certain taxa were found to be associated with number of medications alone (<i>Klebsiella</i>), number of diseases alone (<i>Clostridium, Bilophila</i>), or chronologic age alone (<i>Escherichia</i>, <i>Lactobacillus, Enterococcus</i>). Lastly, many taxa associated with increasing chronologic age were anaerobes. These changes may contribute to changes in human health that occur during the ageing process.","Microbial cell (Graz, Austria)",2022,Gabriela Leite; Mark Pimentel; Gillian M Barlow; Ruchi Mathur
35069178,The Gut-Brain Axis and Its Relation to Parkinson's Disease: A Review.,"Parkinson's disease is a chronic neurodegenerative disease characterized by the accumulation of misfolded alpha-synuclein protein (Lewy bodies) in dopaminergic neurons of the <i>substantia nigra</i> and other related circuitry, which contribute to the development of both motor (bradykinesia, tremors, stiffness, abnormal gait) and non-motor symptoms (gastrointestinal issues, urinogenital complications, olfaction dysfunction, cognitive impairment). Despite tremendous progress in the field, the exact pathways and mechanisms responsible for the initiation and progression of this disease remain unclear. However, recent research suggests a potential relationship between the commensal gut bacteria and the brain capable of influencing neurodevelopment, brain function and health. This bidirectional communication is often referred to as the microbiome-gut-brain axis. Accumulating evidence suggests that the onset of non-motor symptoms, such as gastrointestinal manifestations, often precede the onset of motor symptoms and disease diagnosis, lending support to the potential role that the microbiome-gut-brain axis might play in the underlying pathological mechanisms of Parkinson's disease. This review will provide an overview of and critically discuss the current knowledge of the relationship between the gut microbiota and Parkinson's disease. We will discuss the role of α-synuclein in non-motor disease pathology, proposed pathways constituting the connection between the gut microbiome and the brain, existing evidence related to pre- and probiotic interventions. Finally, we will highlight the potential opportunity for the development of novel preventative measures and therapeutic options that could target the microbiome-gut-brain axis in the context of Parkinson's disease.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2021,Emily M Klann; Upuli Dissanayake; Anjela Gurrala; Matthew Farrer; Aparna Wagle Shukla; Adolfo Ramirez-Zamora; Volker Mai; Vinata Vedam-Mai
35057561,Are We What We Eat? Impact of Diet on the Gut-Brain Axis in Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease is characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms, such as defects in the gut function, which may occur before the motor symptoms. To date, there are therapies that can improve these symptoms, but there is no cure to avoid the development or exacerbation of this disorder. Dysbiosis of gut microbiota could have a crucial role in the gut-brain axis, which is a bidirectional communication between the central nervous system and the enteric nervous system. Diet can affect the microbiota composition, impacting gut-brain axis functionality. Gut microbiome restoration through probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics or other dietary means could have the potential to slow PD progression. In this review, we will discuss the influence of diet on the bidirectional communication between gut and brain, thus supporting the hypothesis that this disorder could begin in the gut. We also focus on how food-based therapies might then have an influence on PD and could ameliorate non-motor as well as motor symptoms.",Nutrients,2022,Margherita Alfonsetti; Vanessa Castelli; Michele d'Angelo
35055364,Microbiome Changes in Humans with Parkinson's Disease after Photobiomodulation Therapy: A Retrospective Study.,"There is a paucity of information on the effect of photobiomodulation therapy on gut microbiome composition. Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder with few management options, although the gut microbiome has been suggested as a potential avenue of treatment. We retrospectively analysed the microbiome from human stool samples from a previously published study, which had demonstrated the efficacy of photobiomodulation to treat Parkinson's patients' symptoms. Specifically, we have observed changes in the microbiome of Parkinson's patients after a 12-week treatment regimen with photobiomodulation to the abdomen, neck, head and nose. Noted were positive changes in the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (F:B) ratio, which is often interpreted as a proxy for gut health.",Journal of personalized medicine,2022,Brian Bicknell; Ann Liebert; Craig S McLachlan; Hosen Kiat
35032636,Impact of intestinal disorders on central and peripheral nervous system diseases.,"Brain injuries and neurological diseases have a significant impact on the gut microbiome and the gut barrier. Reciprocally, gut disorders, such as Inflammatory Bowel Syndromes (IBS), can affect the development and pathology of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases, although this aspect is less well studied and is the focus of this review. Inflammatory Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a chronic and debilitating functional gastrointestinal disorder afflicting an estimated 9-23% of the world's population. A hallmark of this disease is leaky gut, a pathology in which the integrity of the gut blood barrier is compromised, causing gut contents such as immune cells and microbiota to enter the bloodstream leading to low-grade systemic inflammation. The increased levels of inflammation associated cytokines in circulation has the potential to affect all organs, including the brain. Although the brain is protected by the blood brain barrier, inflammation associated cytokines can damage the junctions in this barrier and allow brain infiltration of peripheral immune cells. Central inflammation in the brain is associated with various neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and neuropsychiatric disorders, namely, depression, and anxiety. Neurodegenerative diseases are of particular concern due to the anticipated rise in the population of the elderly and consequently, the prevalence of these diseases. Additionally, depression and anxiety are the most common mental illnesses affecting roughly 18% of the American population. In this review, we will explore the mechanisms by which IBS can influence the risk and severity of neurological disease.",Neurobiology of disease,2022,Yumna El-Hakim; Shameena Bake; Kathiresh Kumar Mani; Farida Sohrabji
34985325,A Comprehensive Review on the Role of the Gut Microbiome in Human Neurological Disorders.,"The human body is full of an extensive number of commensal microbes, consisting of bacteria, viruses, and fungi, collectively termed the human microbiome. The initial acquisition of microbiota occurs from both the external and maternal environments, and the vast majority of them colonize the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). These microbial communities play a central role in the maturation and development of the immune system, the central nervous system, and the GIT system and are also responsible for essential metabolic pathways. Various factors, including host genetic predisposition, environmental factors, lifestyle, diet, antibiotic or nonantibiotic drug use, etc., affect the composition of the gut microbiota. Recent publications have highlighted that an imbalance in the gut microflora, known as dysbiosis, is associated with the onset and progression of neurological disorders. Moreover, characterization of the microbiome-host cross talk pathways provides insight into novel therapeutic strategies. Novel preclinical and clinical research on interventions related to the gut microbiome for treating neurological conditions, including autism spectrum disorders, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and stroke, hold significant promise. This review aims to present a comprehensive overview of the potential involvement of the human gut microbiome in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders, with a particular emphasis on the potential of microbe-based therapies and/or diagnostic microbial biomarkers. This review also discusses the potential health benefits of the administration of probiotics, prebiotics, postbiotics, and synbiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation in neurological disorders.",Clinical microbiology reviews,2022,Shokufeh Ghasemian Sorboni; Hanieh Shakeri Moghaddam; Reza Jafarzadeh-Esfehani; Saman Soleimanpour
34980288,Performance of distinct microbial based solutions in a Campylobacter infection challenge model in poultry.,"Antibiotic growth promoters (AGPs) are commonly used within poultry production to improve feed conversion, bird growth, and reduce morbidity and mortality from clinical and subclinical diseases. Due to the association between AGP usage and rising antimicrobial resistance, the industry has explored new strategies including the use of probiotics and other microbial-based interventions to promote the development of a healthy microbiome in birds and mitigate against infections associated with food safety and food security. While previous studies have largely focused on the ability of probiotics to protect against Clostridium perfringens and Salmonella enterica, much less is known concerning their impact on Campylobacter jejuni, a near commensal of the chicken gut microbiome that nevertheless is a major cause of food poisoning in humans.Here we compare the efficacy of four microbial interventions (two single strain probiotics, the bacterium-Pediococcus acidilactici, and the yeast-Saccharomyces cerevisiae boulardii; and two complex, competitive exclusion, consortia-Aviguard and CEL) to bacitracin, a commonly used AGP, to modulate chicken gut microbiota and subsequently impact C. jejuni infection in poultry. Cecal samples were harvested at 30- and 39-days post hatch to assess Campylobacter burden and examine their impact on the gut microbiota. While the different treatments did not significantly decrease C. jejuni burden relative to the untreated controls, both complex consortia resulted in significant decreases relative to treatment with bacitracin. Analysis of 16S rDNA profiles revealed a distinct microbial signature associated with each microbial intervention. For example, treatment with Aviguard and CEL increased the relative abundance of Bacteroidaceae and Rikenellaceae respectively. Furthermore, Aviguard promoted a less complex microbial community compared to other treatments.Depending upon the individual needs of the producer, our results illustrate the potential of each microbial interventions to serve flock-specific requirements.",Animal microbiome,2022,Maxine Ty; Khaled Taha-Abdelaziz; Vanessa Demey; Mathieu Castex; Shayan Sharif; John Parkinson
34965376,Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease May Result from Reactivation of Embryologic Pathways Silenced at Birth.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), Lewy Body Dementia (LBD), and Parkinson's disease (PD) form a continuum that may explain multiple aspects of age-related neurodegeneration. Inflammaging, the long-term result of the chronic physiological stimulation of the innate immune system, is integral to this process. The gut microbiome plays an important role in inflammaging, as it can release inflammatory products and communicate with other organs and systems. Although AD and PD are molecularly and clinically distinct disorders, their causes appear to underlie LBD. All three conditions lie on a continuum related to AD, PD, or LBD in vulnerable persons. Inflammation in AD is linked to cytokines and growth factors. Moreover, cytokines and neurotrophins profoundly affect PD and LBD. Growth factors, neurotrophins and cytokines are also involved in embryo neural development. Cytokines influence gene expression, metabolism, cell stress, and apoptosis in the preimplantation embryo. The responsible genes are silenced around birth. But if activated by inflammaging and viruses in the brain decades later, they could destroy the same neural structures they created in utero. For this reason, the pathology and progression of AD, LBD, and PD would be unique. Embryonic reactivation could explain two well documented features of AD. 1) NSAIDs reduce AD risk but fail as a treatment. 2) NSAIDs reduce AD risk because they suppress inflammaging. But they are not a treatment because they cannot silence the embryonic genes that have become active and damage the brain.",Discovery medicine,2021,Steven Lehrer; Peter H Rheinstein

There is differential increase in evidences focusing on the bidirectional communication between the gut microbiome and the brain. It supports existence of far-reaching model of ""gut-brain axis."" This axis is attaining more adherence to fields investigating biological and physiological footing of psychiatric, neuro-developmental, age-related, and neurodegenerative disorders. Many factors can change microbiota composition in early life as well as with the increasing age. Stress can affect the microbiota-gut-brain axis at every stages of life. Recent advances have involved the gut microbiota in many conditions including severe mental illness, autism, anxiety, obesity, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease.

34888340,Neuroprotection by the Ketogenic Diet: Evidence and Controversies.,"The ketogenic diet (KD) is a high-fat low-carbohydrate diet that has been used for decades as a non-pharmacologic approach to treat metabolic disorders and refractory pediatric epilepsy. In recent years, enthusiasm for the KD has increased in the scientific community due to evidence that the diet reduces pathology and improves various outcome measures in animal models of neurodegenerative disorders, including multiple sclerosis, stroke, glaucoma, spinal cord injury, retinal degenerations, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Clinical trials also suggest that the KD improved quality of life in patients with multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, the major ketone bodies BHB and ACA have potential neuroprotective properties and are now known to have direct effects on specific inflammatory proteins, transcription factors, reactive oxygen species, mitochondria, epigenetic modifications and the composition of the gut microbiome. Neuroprotective benefits of the KD are likely due to a combination of these cellular processes and other potential mechanisms that are yet to be confirmed experimentally. This review provides a comprehensive summary of current evidence for the effectiveness of the KD in humans and preclinical models of various neurological disorders, describes molecular mechanisms that may contribute to its beneficial effects, and highlights key controversies and current gaps in knowledge.",Frontiers in nutrition,2021,Sarah M Gough; Alicia Casella; Kristen Jasmin Ortega; Abigail S Hackam
34884399,Differences in the Composition of Gut Microbiota between Patients with Parkinson's Disease and Healthy Controls: A Cohort Study.,"Gut microbiome and colonic inflammation can be associated with the predisposition and progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). The presented study aimed to compare gastrointestinal microbiota composition between patients diagnosed with PD and treated only with Levodopa to healthy controls. In this prospective study, patients were recruited in 1 academic hospital from July 2019 to July 2020. The detailed demographic data and medical history were collected using a set of questionnaires. Fecal samples were obtained from all participants. Next-Generation Sequencing was used to assess the microbiota composition. The endpoint was the difference in composition of the gut microbiota. In this study, we enrolled 27 hospitalized PD patients with well-controlled symptoms. The control group included 44 healthy subjects matched for age. Among PD patients, our results presented a higher abundance of <i>Bacteroides</i> phylum, class <i>Corynebacteria</i> among phylum <i>Actinobacteria</i>, class <i>Deltaproteobacteria</i> among phylum <i>Proteobacteria</i>, and genera such as <i>Butyricimonas, Robinsoniella</i>, and <i>Flavonifractor</i>. The species <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i>, <i>Eubacterium biforme</i>, and <i>Parabacteroides merdae</i> were identified as more common in the gut microbiota of PD patients. In conclusion, the patients diagnosed with PD have significantly different gut microbiota profiles in comparison with healthy controls.",Journal of clinical medicine,2021,Barbara Zapała; Tomasz Stefura; Magdalena Wójcik-Pędziwiatr; Radosław Kabut; Marta Bałajewicz-Nowak; Tomasz Milewicz; Alicja Dudek; Anastazja Stój; Monika Rudzińska-Bar

Malfunction of the gut microbiome can induce inflammatory processes, oxidative stress, and cytokine storm. Dysfunction of the gut microbiome can be caused by short-term (virus infection and other infectious diseases) or long-term (environment, nutrition, and stress) factors. Here, we reviewed the inflammation and oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases and coronavirus infection (COVID-19). Here, we reviewed the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) involved in the processes of formation of oxidative stress and inflammation in viral and neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, the coronavirus uses ACE2 receptors of the RAAS to penetrate human cells. The coronavirus infection can be the trigger for neurodegenerative diseases by dysfunction of the RAAS.

34853754,Role of Gastrointestinal Dysbiosis and Fecal Transplantation in Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases with a high rate of morbidity. It is associated with dopaminergic neuron loss and is fairly common in the elderly population. Recently, there has been a growing interest in the role of the gut microbiome in the pathogenesis of PD and thus studies addressing the methods to modulate the microbiota are becoming increasingly popular. Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) is one of these methods and is effective in certain intestinal and extraintestinal conditions. This review aims to talk about gastrointestinal dysbiosis and how the reconstruction of this microbiome via FMT could potentially be used as a treatment modality in the future. We went through various studies and collected data relevant to our topic from the previous five years. The studies selected include reviews, observational studies, animal studies, case reports, and some grey literature. We concluded that although it has great potential as a therapeutic modality in the future, it is limited by several factors such as variability among the results of most clinical studies and the lack of large sample sizes. Therefore, there is a need for high-quality clinical trials with larger sample sizes to gather enough clinical evidence so that FMT can qualify as a widely recommended therapeutic measure.",Cureus,2021,Rahul Jena; Ruchi Jain; Suchitra Muralidharan; Vijaya Lakshmi Yanamala; Zainab Zubair; Ketan Kantamaneni; Krishi Jalla; Mahvish Renzu; Michael Alfonso
34841505,Assessment of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in Alzheimer's disease.,"There is great interest in crosstalk between the gastrointestinal and immune systems. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is a bowel disorder prevalent among patients with Parkinson's disease; SIBO treatment has been shown to modulate neurological inflammation, motor and cognitive outcomes there. However, to date, no link between Alzheimer's dementia and SIBO has been established. This pilot study sought to estimate the prevalence of SIBO in Alzheimer's dementia in the outpatient setting in Singapore General Hospital. It entailed performing a hydrogen breath test and objectively scoring gastrointestinal symptoms and their severity in 48 patients, comparing symptom scores and mean breath test values in those with mild to moderate Alzheimer's against age- and sex-matched controls that did not fulfill DSM-V criteria for probable Alzheimer's. Here, the prevalence of positive breath tests and symptoms of SIBO were no greater among Alzheimer's patients than in controls. This suggests that the gut microbiome changes and increased bowel inflammation seen in previous studies on Alzheimer's patients are likely effected through pathways other than SIBO, and are likely more complex than a mere increase in small bowel bacterial volume. Rather, future research could be directed along the lines of qualitative changes in small bowel microbiota, or pathologies in other parts of the gastrointestinal tract such as the colon or stomach, aspects which are not adequately captured by the hydrogen breath test.

34836918,Footprints of a microbial toxin from the gut microbiome to mesencephalic mitochondria.,"Idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterised by alpha-synuclein (aSyn) aggregation and death of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain. Recent evidence posits that PD may initiate in the gut by microbes or their toxins that promote chronic gut inflammation that will ultimately impact the brain. In this work, we sought to demonstrate that the effects of the microbial toxin β-<i>N</i>-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) in the gut may trigger some PD cases, which is especially worrying as this toxin is present in certain foods but not routinely monitored by public health authorities.To test the hypothesis, we treated wild-type mice, primary neuronal cultures, cell lines and isolated mitochondria with BMAA, and analysed its impact on gut microbiota composition, barrier permeability, inflammation and aSyn aggregation as well as in brain inflammation, dopaminergic neuronal loss and motor behaviour. To further examine the key role of mitochondria, we also determined the specific effects of BMAA on mitochondrial function and on inflammasome activation.BMAA induced extensive depletion of segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) that regulate gut immunity, thus triggering gut dysbiosis, immune cell migration, increased intestinal inflammation, loss of barrier integrity and caudo-rostral progression of aSyn. Additionally, BMAA induced <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> mitochondrial dysfunction with cardiolipin exposure and consequent activation of neuronal innate immunity. These events primed neuroinflammation, dopaminergic neuronal loss and motor deficits.Taken together, our results demonstrate that chronic exposure to dietary BMAA can trigger a chain of events that recapitulate the evolution of the PD pathology from the gut to the brain, which is consistent with 'gut-first' PD.",Gut,2023,A Raquel Esteves; Mário F Munoz-Pinto; Daniela Nunes-Costa; Emanuel Candeias; Diana F Silva; João D Magalhães; A Raquel Pereira-Santos; I Luisa Ferreira; Susana Alarico; Igor Tiago; Nuno Empadinhas; Sandra Morais Cardoso
34829694,Probiotic Enhancement of Antioxidant Capacity and Alterations of Gut Microbiota Composition in 6-Hydroxydopamin-Induced Parkinson's Disease Rats.,"Oxidative stress plays a key role in the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD), which may be aggravated by concomitant PD-associated gut dysbiosis. Probiotics and prebiotics are therapeutically relevant to these conditions due to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and gut microbiome modulation properties. However, the mechanisms by which probiotic/prebiotic supplementation affects antioxidant capacity and the gut microbiome in PD remains poorly characterized. In this study, we assessed the effects of a <i>Lactobacillus salivarius</i> AP-32 probiotic, a prebiotic (dried AP-32 culture medium supernatant), and a probiotic/prebiotic cocktail in rats with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced PD. The neuroprotective effects and levels of oxidative stress were evaluated after eight weeks of daily supplementation. Fecal microbiota composition was analyzed by fecal 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The supplements were associated with direct increases in host antioxidant enzyme activities and short-chain fatty acid production, protected dopaminergic neurons, and improved motor functions. The supplements also altered the fecal microbiota composition, and some specifically enriched commensal taxa correlated positively with superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase activity, indicating supplementation also promotes antioxidant activity via an indirect pathway. Therefore, <i>L. salivarius</i> AP-32 supplementation enhanced the activity of host antioxidant enzymes via direct and indirect modes of action in rats with 6-OHDA-induced PD.","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2021,Shu-Ping Tsao; Bira Arumndari Nurrahma; Ravi Kumar; Chieh-Hsi Wu; Tu-Hsueh Yeh; Ching-Chi Chiu; Yen-Peng Lee; Yi-Chi Liao; Cheng-Hsieh Huang; Yao-Tsung Yeh; Hui-Yu Huang
34789332,New perspectives on cytoskeletal dysregulation and mitochondrial mislocalization in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by selective, early degeneration of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. Motor neurons have long axonal projections, which rely on the integrity of neuronal cytoskeleton and mitochondria to regulate energy requirements for maintaining axonal stability, anterograde and retrograde transport, and signaling between neurons. The formation of protein aggregates which contain cytoskeletal proteins, and mitochondrial dysfunction both have devastating effects on the function of neurons and are shared pathological features across several neurodegenerative conditions, including ALS, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly clear that cytoskeletal integrity and mitochondrial function are intricately linked. Therefore, dysregulations of the cytoskeletal network and mitochondrial homeostasis and localization, may be common pathways in the initial steps of neurodegeneration. Here we review and discuss known contributors, including variants in genetic loci and aberrant protein activities, which modify cytoskeletal integrity, axonal transport and mitochondrial localization in ALS and have overlapping features with other neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, we explore some emerging pathways that may contribute to this disruption in ALS.",Translational neurodegeneration,2021,Frances Theunissen; Phillip K West; Samuel Brennan; Bojan Petrović; Kosar Hooshmand; P Anthony Akkari; Matt Keon; Boris Guennewig
34776854,Changes in the Gut Microbiome and Predicted Functional Metabolic Effects in an Australian Parkinson's Disease Cohort.,"<b>Background:</b> There has been increasing recognition of the importance of the gut microbiome in Parkinson's disease (PD), but the influence of geographic location has received little attention. The present study characterized the gut microbiota and associated changes in host metabolic pathways in an Australian cohort of people with PD (PwP). <b>Methods:</b> The study involved recruitment and assessment of 87 PwP from multiple Movement Disorders Clinics in Australia and 47 healthy controls. Illumina sequencing of the V3 and V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene was used to distinguish inter-cohort differences in gut microbiota; KEGG analysis was subsequently performed to predict functional changes in host metabolic pathways. <b>Results:</b> The current findings identified significant differences in relative abundance and diversity of microbial operational taxonomic units (OTUs), and specific bacterial taxa between PwP and control groups. Alpha diversity was significantly reduced in PwP when compared to controls. Differences were found in two phyla (Synergistetes and Proteobacteria; both increased in PwP), and five genera (C<i>olidextribacter, Intestinibacter, Kineothrix, Agathobaculum</i>, and <i>Roseburia</i>; all decreased in PwP). Within the PD cohort, there was no association identified between microbial composition and gender, constipation or use of gastrointestinal medication. Furthermore, KEGG analysis identified 15 upregulated and 11 downregulated metabolic pathways which were predicted to be significantly altered in PwP. <b>Conclusion:</b> This study provides the first comprehensive characterization of the gut microbiome and predicted functional metabolic effects in a southern hemisphere PD population, further exploring the possible mechanisms whereby the gut microbiota may exert their influence on this disease, and providing evidence for the incorporation of such data in future individualized therapeutic strategies.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2021,Jade E Kenna; Eng Guan Chua; Megan Bakeberg; Alfred Tay; Sarah McGregor; Anastazja Gorecki; Malcolm Horne; Barry Marshall; Frank L Mastaglia; Ryan S Anderton
34704023,Gut microbiome alpha-diversity is not a marker of Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis.,"The gut-brain axis may play a central role in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders. Dozens of case-control studies have been carried out to identify bacterial markers by the use of targeted metagenomics. Alterations of several taxonomic profiles have been confirmed across several populations, however, no consensus has been made regarding alpha-diversity. A recent publication has described and validated a novel method based on richness and evenness measures of the gut microbiome in order to reduce the complexity and multiplicity of alpha-diversity indices. We used these recently described richness and evenness composite measures to investigate the potential link between gut microbiome alpha-diversity and neurological disorders and to determine to what extent it could be used as a marker to diagnose neurological disorders from stool samples. We performed an exhaustive review of the literature to identify original published clinical studies including 16S rRNA gene sequencing on Parkinson's disease, multiple Sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. Richness and evenness factors loadings were quantified from sequencing files in addition with the Shannon diversity index. For each disease, we performed a meta-analysis comparing the indices between patients and healthy controls. Seven studies were meta-analysed for Parkinson's disease, corresponding to 1067 subjects (631 Parkinson's Disease/436 healthy controls). Five studies were meta-analysed for multiple sclerosis, corresponding to 303 subjects (164 Multiple Sclerosis/139 healthy controls). For Alzheimer's disease, the meta-analysis was not done as only two studies matched our criteria. Neither richness nor evenness was significantly altered in Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis patients in comparison to healthy controls (<i>P</i>-value > 0.05). Shannon index was neither associated with neurological disorders (<i>P</i>-value > 0.05). After adjusting for age and sex, none of the alpha-diversity measures were associated with Parkinson's Disease. This is the first report investigating systematically alpha-diversity and its potential link to neurological disorders. Our study has demonstrated that unlike in other gastro-intestinal, immune and metabolic disorders, loss of bacterial diversity is not associated with Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis.",Brain communications,2021,Jonathan Plassais; Guillaume Gbikpi-Benissan; Marine Figarol; Filip Scheperjans; Guy Gorochov; Pascal Derkinderen; Alessandra C L Cervino
34650532,Cross-Sectional Study on the Gut Microbiome of Parkinson's Disease Patients in Central China.,"Gastrointestinal dysfunction plays an important role in the occurrence and development of Parkinson's disease (PD). This study investigates the composition of the gut microbiome using shotgun metagenomic sequencing in PD patients in central China. Fecal samples from 39 PD patients (PD group) and the corresponding 39 healthy spouses of the patients (SP) were collected for shotgun metagenomics sequencing. Results showed a significantly altered microbial composition in the PD patients. <i>Bilophila wadsworthia</i> enrichment was found in the gut microbiome of PD patients, which has not been reported in previous studies. The random forest (RF) model, which identifies differences in microbiomes, reliably discriminated patients with PD from controls; the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.803. Further analysis of the microbiome and clinical symptoms showed that <i>Klebsiella</i> and <i>Parasutterella</i> were positively correlated with the duration and severity of PD, whereas hydrogen-generating <i>Prevotella</i> was negatively correlated with disease severity. The Cluster of Orthologous Groups of protein database, the KEGG Orthology database, and the carbohydrate-active enzymes of gene-category analysis showed that branched-chain amino acid-related proteins were significantly increased, and GH43 was significantly reduced in the PD group.

34576191,The Role of Gut Microbiota and Gut-Brain Interplay in Selected Diseases of the Central Nervous System.,"The gut microbiome has attracted increasing attention from researchers in recent years. The microbiota can have a specific and complex cross-talk with the host, particularly with the central nervous system (CNS), creating the so-called ""gut-brain axis"". Communication between the gut, intestinal microbiota, and the brain involves the secretion of various metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), structural components of bacteria, and signaling molecules. Moreover, an imbalance in the gut microbiota composition modulates the immune system and function of tissue barriers such as the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Therefore, the aim of this literature review is to describe how the gut-brain interplay may contribute to the development of various neurological disorders, combining the fields of gastroenterology and neuroscience. We present recent findings concerning the effect of the altered microbiota on neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, as well as multiple sclerosis. Moreover, the impact of the pathological shift in the microbiome on selected neuropsychological disorders, i.e., major depressive disorders (MDD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), is also discussed. Future research on the effect of balanced gut microbiota composition on the gut-brain axis would help to identify new potential opportunities for therapeutic interventions in the presented diseases.",International journal of molecular sciences,2021,Julia Doroszkiewicz; Magdalena Groblewska; Barbara Mroczko
34576000,"Nuclear and Mitochondrial Genome, Epigenome and Gut Microbiome: Emerging Molecular Biomarkers for Parkinson's Disease.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is currently the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, burdening about 10 million elderly individuals worldwide. The multifactorial nature of PD poses a difficult obstacle for understanding the mechanisms involved in its onset and progression. Currently, diagnosis depends on the appearance of clinical signs, some of which are shared among various neurologic disorders, hindering early diagnosis. There are no effective tools to prevent PD onset, detect the disease in early stages or accurately report the risk of disease progression. Hence, there is an increasing demand for biomarkers that may identify disease onset and progression, as treatment-based medicine may not be the best approach for PD. Over the last few decades, the search for molecular markers to predict susceptibility, aid in accurate diagnosis and evaluate the progress of PD have intensified, but strategies aimed to improve individualized patient care have not yet been established.Genomic variation, regulation by epigenomic mechanisms, as well as the influence of the host gut microbiome seem to have a crucial role in the onset and progress of PD, thus are considered potential biomarkers.

34422879,Memorable Food: Fighting Age-Related Neurodegeneration by Precision Nutrition.,"Healthcare systems worldwide are seriously challenged by a rising prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), which mostly, but not exclusively, affect the ever-growing population of the elderly. The most known neurodegenerative diseases are Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, but some viral infections of the brain and traumatic brain injury may also cause NDD. Typical for NDD are the malfunctioning of neurons and their irreversible loss, which often progress irreversibly to dementia and ultimately to death. Numerous factors are involved in the pathogenesis of NDD: genetic variability, epigenetic changes, extent of oxidative/nitrosative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and DNA damage. The complex interplay of all the above-mentioned factors may be a fingerprint of neurodegeneration, with different diseases being affected to different extents by particular factors. There is a voluminous body of evidence showing the benefits of regular exercise to brain health and cognitive functions. Moreover, the importance of a healthy diet, balanced in macro- and micro-nutrients, in preventing neurodegeneration and slowing down a progression to full-blown disease is evident. Individuals affected by NDD almost inevitably have low-grade inflammation and anomalies in lipid metabolism. Metabolic and lipid profiles in NDD can be improved by the Mediterranean diet. Many studies have associated the Mediterranean diet with a decreased risk of dementia and AD, but a cause-and-effect relationship has not been deduced. Studies with caloric restriction showed neuroprotective effects in animal models, but the results in humans are inconsistent. The pathologies of NDD are complex and there is a great inter-individual (epi)genetic variance within any population. Furthermore, the gut microbiome, being deeply involved in nutrient uptake and lipid metabolism, also represents a pillar of the gut microbiome-brain axis and is linked with the pathogenesis of NDD. Numerous studies on the role of different micronutrients (omega-3 fatty acids, bioactive polyphenols from fruit and medicinal plants) in the prevention, prediction, and treatment of NDD have been conducted, but we are still far away from a personalized diet plan for individual NDD patients. For this to be realized, large-scale cohorts that would include the precise monitoring of food intake, mapping of genetic variants, epigenetic data, microbiome studies, and metabolome, lipidome, and transcriptome data are needed.",Frontiers in nutrition,2021,Maja Milošević; Aleksandra Arsić; Zorica Cvetković; Vesna Vučić
34422393,"A discussion of the gut microbiome's development, determinants, and dysbiosis in cancers of the esophagus and stomach.","The microbiome refers to a population of microbes that colonize the skin, nasopharynx, oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, and urogenital tract. The human microbiome consists of bacteria, archaea, fungi, viruses, and phages. Recent advances in genomic sequencing have catalyzed a deeper understanding of complex microbe-microbe and host-microbe interactions. Dysregulation of these interactions, or dysbiosis of the gastrointestinal tract, has been implicated in a growing list of pathologies including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, depression, Parkinson's disease, autism, and various gastrointestinal cancers. Gastric and esophageal cancer, for example, continue to remain as two of the most common causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, therefore there is an increased emphasis on investigating the role of dysbiosis on these cancers. In this review, we discuss the development and structure of the gut microbiome, its homeostatic and dysbiotic mechanisms, and the key microbes in esophageal and gastric carcinogenesis with a focus on bacterial biology. Further clarification of these pathways and discovery of diagnostic or therapeutic targets could have broad impacts on global subpopulations.

34408160,Exploring human-genome gut-microbiome interaction in Parkinson's disease.,"The causes of complex diseases remain an enigma despite decades of epidemiologic research on environmental risks and genome-wide studies that have uncovered tens or hundreds of susceptibility loci for each disease. We hypothesize that the microbiome is the missing link. Genetic studies have shown that overexpression of alpha-synuclein, a key pathological protein in Parkinson's disease (PD), can cause familial PD and variants at alpha-synuclein locus confer risk of idiopathic PD. Recently, dysbiosis of gut microbiome in PD was identified: altered abundances of three microbial clusters were found, one of which was composed of opportunistic pathogens. Using two large datasets, we found evidence that the overabundance of opportunistic pathogens in PD gut is influenced by the host genotype at the alpha-synuclein locus, and that the variants responsible modulate alpha-synuclein expression. Results put forth testable hypotheses on the role of gut microbiome in the pathogenesis of PD, the incomplete penetrance of PD susceptibility genes, and potential triggers of pathology in the gut.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2021,Zachary D Wallen; William J Stone; Stewart A Factor; Eric Molho; Cyrus P Zabetian; David G Standaert; Haydeh Payami
34357070,Association of Gut Microbiome Dysbiosis with Neurodegeneration: Can Gut Microbe-Modifying Diet Prevent or Alleviate the Symptoms of Neurodegenerative Diseases?,"The central nervous system was classically perceived as anatomically and functionally independent from the other visceral organs. But in recent decades, compelling evidence has led the scientific community to place a greater emphasis on the role of gut microbes on the brain. Pathological observations and early gastrointestinal symptoms highlighted that gut dysbiosis likely precedes the onset of cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. The delicate balance in the number and functions of pathogenic microbes and alternative probiotic populations is critical in the modulation of systemic inflammation and neuronal health. However, there is limited success in restoring healthy microbial biodiversity in AD and PD patients with general probiotics interventions and fecal microbial therapies. Fortunately, the gut microflora is susceptible to long-term extrinsic influences such as lifestyle and dietary choices, providing opportunities for treatment through comparatively individual-specific control of human behavior. In this review, we examine the impact of restrictive diets on the gut microbiome populations associated with AD and PD. The overall evidence presented supports that gut dysbiosis is a plausible prelude to disease onset, and early dietary interventions are likely beneficial for the prevention and treatment of progressive neurodegenerative diseases.","Life (Basel, Switzerland)",2021,Li Yang Tan; Xin Yi Yeo; Han-Gyu Bae; Delia Pei Shan Lee; Roger C Ho; Jung Eun Kim; Dong-Gyu Jo; Sangyong Jung
34346706,Gut Microbiome and Serum Metabolome Alterations Associated with Isolated Dystonia.,"Dystonia is a complex neurological movement disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions. Increasing studies implicate the microbiome as a possible key susceptibility factor for neurological disorders, but the relationship between the gut microbiota and dystonia remains poorly explored. Here, the gut microbiota of 57 patients with isolated dystonia and 27 age- and environment-matched healthy controls was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Further, integrative analysis of the gut microbiome and serum metabolome measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was performed. No difference in α-diversity was found, while β-diversity was significantly different, with a more heterogeneous community structure among dystonia patients than among controls. The most significant changes in dystonia highlighted an increase in <i>Clostridiales</i>, including Blautia obeum, Dorea longicatena, and Eubacterium hallii, and a reduction in Bacteroides vulgatus and Bacteroides plebeius. The functional analysis revealed that genes related to tryptophan and purine biosynthesis were more abundant in gut microbiota from patients with dystonia, while genes linked to citrate cycle, vitamin B<sub>6</sub>, and glycan metabolism were less abundant. The evaluation of serum metabolites revealed altered levels of l-glutamic acid, taurine, and d-tyrosine, suggesting changes in neurotransmitter metabolism. The most modified metabolites strongly inversely correlated with the abundance of members belonging to the <i>Clostridiales</i>, revealing the effect of the gut microbiota on neurometabolic activity. This study is the first to reveal gut microbial dysbiosis in patients with isolated dystonia and identified potential links between gut microbiota and serum neurotransmitters, providing new insight into the pathogenesis of isolated dystonia. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Dystonia is the third most common movement disorder after essential tremor and Parkinson's disease. However, the cause for the majority of cases is not known. This is the first study so far that reveals significant alterations of gut microbiome and correlates the alteration of serum metabolites with gut dysbiosis in patients with isolated dystonia. We demonstrated a general overrepresentation of <i>Clostridiales</i> and underrepresentation of <i>Bacteroidetes</i> in patients with dystonia in comparison with healthy controls. The functional analysis found that genes related to the biosynthesis of tryptophan, which is the precursor of the neurotransmitter serotonin, were more active in isolated dystonia patients. Altered levels of several serum metabolites were found to be associated with microbial changes, such as d-tyrosine, taurine, and glutamate, indicating differences in neurotransmitter metabolism in isolated dystonia. Integrative analysis suggests that neurotransmitter system dysfunction may be a possible pathway by which the gut microbiome participates in the development of dystonia. The gut microbiome changes provide new insight into the pathogenesis of dystonia, suggesting new potential therapeutic directions.",mSphere,2021,Lingyan Ma; Jing Keng; Min Cheng; Hua Pan; Bo Feng; Yongfeng Hu; Tao Feng; Fan Yang

Recently, there has been a growing focus on the relationship between the gut and the development of PD. Emerging to the forefront, an interesting concept has developed suggesting that the initial pathophysiological changes occur in the gastrointestinal tract before changes are seen within the brain. This review is aimed at highlighting the relationship between PD and the gastrointestinal tract, along with the supporting evidence for this. Firstly, we will focus on the gastrointestinal conditions and symptoms which commonly affects patients, including both upper and lower gastrointestinal issues. Secondly, the impact of nutrition and diet on neurological health and PD physiology, with particular emphasis on commonly consumed items including macronutrients and micronutrients. Finally, variability of the gut microbiome will also be discussed and its link with both the symptoms and signs of PD. The evidence presented in this review highly suggests that the initial pathogenesis in the gut may proceed the development of prodromal PD subtypes, and therefore building on this further could be imperative and lead to earlier diagnosis with new and improved therapeutics.",Journal of Parkinson's disease,2021,Nehal Yemula; Celina Dietrich; Vaclav Dostal; Michael Hornberger
34216356,The Relationship Between the Gut Microbiome and Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Many recent studies have shown that the gut microbiome plays important roles in human physiology and pathology. Also, microbiome-based therapies have been used to improve health status and treat diseases. In addition, aging and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, have become topics of intense interest in biomedical research. Several researchers have explored the links between these topics to study the potential pathogenic or therapeutic effects of intestinal microbiota in disease. But the exact relationship between neurodegenerative diseases and gut microbiota remains unclear. As technology advances, new techniques for studying the microbiome will be developed and refined, and the relationship between diseases and gut microbiota will be revealed. This article summarizes the known interactions between the gut microbiome and neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting assay techniques for the gut microbiome, and we also discuss the potential therapeutic role of microbiome-based therapies in diseases.",Neuroscience bulletin,2021,Xueling Zhu; Bo Li; Pengcheng Lou; Tingting Dai; Yang Chen; Aoxiang Zhuge; Yin Yuan; Lanjuan Li

Microbes mediate communication among the metabolic, peripheral immune, and central nervous systems via the microbiota-gut-brain axis. However, it is not well understood how the gut microbiome and neurons in the brain mutually interact or how these interactions affect normal brain functioning and cognition. We summarize the mechanisms whereby the gut microbiota regulate the production, transportation, and functioning of neurotransmitters.

34171417,The neuromicrobiology of Parkinson's disease: A unifying theory.,"Recent evidence confirms that PD is indeed a multifactorial disease with different aetiologies and prodromal symptomatology that likely depend on the initial trigger. New players with important roles as triggers, facilitators and aggravators of the PD neurodegenerative process have re-emerged in the last few years, the microbes. Having evolved in association with humans for ages, microbes and their products are now seen as fundamental regulators of human physiology with disturbances in their balance being increasingly accepted to have a relevant impact on the progression of disease in general and on PD in particular. In this review, we comprehensively address early studies that have directly or indirectly linked bacteria or other infectious agents to the onset and progression of PD, from the earliest suspects to the most recent culprits, the gut microbiota. The quest for effective treatments to arrest PD progression must inevitably address the different interactions between microbiota and human cells, and naturally consider the gut-brain axis. The comprehensive characterization of such mechanisms will help design innovative bacteriotherapeutic approaches to selectively shape the gut microbiota profile ultimately to halt PD progression. The present review describes our current understanding of the role of microorganisms and their endosymbiotic relatives, the mitochondria, in inducing, facilitating, or aggravating PD pathogenesis.",Ageing research reviews,2021,Mario F Munoz-Pinto; Nuno Empadinhas; Sandra M Cardoso
34079079,Compositional and genetic alterations in Graves' disease gut microbiome reveal specific diagnostic biomarkers.,"Graves' Disease is the most common organ-specific autoimmune disease and has been linked in small pilot studies to taxonomic markers within the gut microbiome. Important limitations of this work include small sample sizes and low-resolution taxonomic markers. Accordingly, we studied 162 gut microbiomes of mild and severe Graves' disease (GD) patients and healthy controls. Taxonomic and functional analyses based on metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) and MAG-annotated genes, together with predicted metabolic functions and metabolite profiles, revealed a well-defined network of MAGs, genes and clinical indexes separating healthy from GD subjects. A supervised classification model identified a combination of biomarkers including microbial species, MAGs, genes and SNPs, with predictive power superior to models from any single biomarker type (AUC = 0.98). Global, cross-disease multi-cohort analysis of gut microbiomes revealed high specificity of these GD biomarkers, notably discriminating against Parkinson's Disease, and suggesting that non-invasive stool-based diagnostics will be useful for these diseases.",The ISME journal,2021,Qiyun Zhu; Qiangchuan Hou; Shi Huang; Qianying Ou; Dongxue Huo; Yoshiki Vázquez-Baeza; Chaoping Cen; Victor Cantu; Mehrbod Estaki; Haibo Chang; Pedro Belda-Ferre; Ho-Cheol Kim; Kaining Chen; Rob Knight; Jiachao Zhang
34053243,Gut Microbiota and Parkinson's Disease: Implications for Faecal Microbiota Transplantation Therapy.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) ranks the second place among neurodegenerative diseases in terms of its morbidity, which affects 1-2% people aged over 65 years. In addition to genetics, some environmental factors may exert vital parts in PD occurrence as well. At present, more and more studies are conducted to elucidate the association between gut microbial dysbiosis and the incidence of PD. Gut microbial dysbiosis has a certain effect on both the central nervous system (CNS) and the enteric nervous system (ENS), which indicates that there is a gut-microbiota-brain axis that induces CNS disorders. Some gut microbial strains are suggested to suppress or weaken the neuroinflammation- and gut-inflammation-immune responses, which suggests the protective and pathogenic effects of certain gut microbial species on PD progression. Therefore, gut microbiome may contain plenty of targets for preventing and managing PD. Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) may serve as a direct and useful treatment for PD in the future. Nonetheless, there is little available scientific research in this field. The present work reviewed the latest research to examine the association of gut microbiota with PD, and the future prospects of FMT treatment.",ASN neuro,2021,Yongbo Kang; Xing Kang; Hongfang Zhang; Qingqing Liu; Hao Yang; Weiping Fan
34034646,Comparison study of differential abundance testing methods using two large Parkinson disease gut microbiome datasets derived from 16S amplicon sequencing.,"Testing for differential abundance of microbes in disease is a common practice in microbiome studies. Numerous differential abundance (DA) testing methods exist and range from traditional statistical tests to methods designed for microbiome data. Comparison studies of DA testing methods have been performed, but none performed on microbiome datasets collected for the study of real, complex disease. Due to this, DA testing was performed here using various DA methods in two large, uniformly collected gut microbiome datasets on Parkinson disease (PD), and their results compared.Overall, 78-92% of taxa tested were detected as differentially abundant by at least one method, while 5-22% were called differentially abundant by the majority of methods (depending on dataset and filtering of taxonomic data prior to testing). Concordances between method results ranged from 1 to 100%. Average concordance for datasets 1 and 2 were 24% and 28% respectively, and 27% for replicated DA signatures. Concordances increased when removing rarer taxa before testing, increasing average concordances by 2-32%. Certain methods consistently resulted in higher concordances (e.g. ANCOM-BC, LEfSe), while others consistently resulted in lower (e.g. edgeR, fitZIG). Hierarchical clustering revealed three groups of DA signatures that were (1) replicated by the majority of methods on average and included taxa previously associated with PD, (2) replicated by a subset of methods and included taxa largely enriched in PD, and (3) replicated by few to one method(s).Differential abundance tests yielded varied concordances, and amounts of detected DA signatures. Some methods were more concordant than others on both filtered and unfiltered data, therefore, if consistency with other study methodology is a key goal, one might choose among these methods. Even still, using one method on one dataset may find true associations, but may also detect false positives. To help lower false positives, one might analyze data with two or more DA methods to gauge concordance, and use a built-in replication dataset. This study will hopefully serve to complement previously reported DA method comparison studies by implementing and coalescing a large number of both previously and yet to be compared methods on two real gut microbiome datasets.",BMC bioinformatics,2021,Zachary D Wallen

Although SARS-CoV-2 infections are not more prevalent in Parkinson's disease patients, a higher mortality rate has been reported not only associated with older age and longer disease duration, but also through several mechanisms, such as interactions with the brain dopaminergic system and through systemic inflammatory responses. Indeed, a number of the neurological symptoms seen in COVID-19 patients, as well as the alterations in the gut microbiome, are also prevalent in patients with Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, biochemical pathways such as oxidative stress, inflammation, and protein aggregation have shared commonalities between Parkinson's disease and COVID-19 disease progression.

33968794,Review: The Role of Intestinal Dysbiosis in Parkinson's Disease.,"Several studies have highlighted the roles played by the gut microbiome in central nervous system diseases. Clinical symptoms and neuropathology have suggested that Parkinson's disease may originate in the gut, which is home to approximately 100 trillion microbes. Alterations in the gastrointestinal microbiota populations may promote the development and progression of Parkinson's disease. Here, we reviewed existing studies that have explored the role of intestinal dysbiosis in Parkinson's disease, focusing on the roles of microbiota, their metabolites, and components in inflammation, barrier failure, microglial activation, and α-synuclein pathology. We conclude that there are intestinal dysbiosis in Parkinson's disease. Intestinal dysbiosis is likely involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease through mechanisms that include barrier destruction, inflammation and oxidative stress, decreased dopamine production, and molecular mimicry. Additional studies remain necessary to explore and verify the mechanisms through which dysbiosis may cause or promote Parkinson's disease. Preclinical studies have shown that gastrointestinal microbial therapy may represent an effective and novel treatment for Parkinson's disease; however, more studies, especially clinical studies, are necessary to explore the curative effects of microbial therapy in Parkinson's disease.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2021,Yiying Huang; Jinchi Liao; Xu Liu; Yunxiao Zhong; Xiaodong Cai; Ling Long

A healthy diet plays an integral role in maintaining the gut microbiota equilibrium, thus promoting digestive health. The structure and function of gut microbiota are affected by genetics and environmental factors, such as altered dietary habits, gastroenteritis, stress, increased use of alcohol and drugs, and medication use. Whereas there are various management approaches cited in the literature to manage symptoms of IBS, the purpose of this article is to focus on dietary options that will restore the gut microbiome and help in managing IBS symptoms. Some of the diets that are discussed in this article include a low-FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols) diet, gluten-free/wheat-free diet, high-fiber diet, dietary and herbal supplements (psyllium, peppermint oil), and probiotics/prebiotics/synbiotics. The clinical practice guidelines recommended by the American College of Gastroenterology outlines evidence-based dietary recommendations for patients with IBS to manage symptoms.

33899052,Gut Microbiome Changes with Osteopathic Treatment of Constipation in Parkinson's Disease: A Pilot Study.,"The gut microbiome appears to be predictive of Parkinson's disease (PD) with constipation. Chronic constipation frequently manifests prior to motor symptoms and impairs quality of life. An osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM) sequence used physical exam assessment and manual treatment of neuromusculoskeletal dysfunctions pertinent to constipation in PD for this prospective ABA-design study, IRB-NYITBHS1065. The effects of 4 weekly treatments on the gut microbiome among men and women over 40 years old with chronic constipation and PD were investigated. Severity of PD was rated with the Movement Disorders Society-Unified PD rating scale (UPDRS) in six subjects with constipation. Also, the Bristol stool scale and questionnaires validated for constipation were administered for diagnosis, symptom severity, and quality of life during a 4-week control-period (A), 4-weekly OMM-treatments (B), and 2-weeks no-intervention (A). Biweekly stool samples were assessed for normalized microbiota abundance.The mean Bristol rating improved from type 2 (± 1) Pre-OMM to 3 (± 1; p = .167; d = 0.677) Post-OMM. Mean constipation severity significantly decreased (p = .010; d = 1.508) Post-OMM. Mean quality of life significantly improved (p = .041; d = 1.072) Post-OMM. The Pre-OMM mean number of families within the phylum Firmicutes decreased by 3 (p = .043; d = 1.177) Post-OMM. There were significant changes in the normalized abundance of phyla Actinobacteria (p = .040; d = 0.845) and Verrucomicrobia (p = .024; d = 0.675) as well as in genus Roseburia (p = .033; d = 1.109), Intestinimonas (p = .035; d = 0.627) and Anaerotruncus (p = .004) Post-OMM.The gut microbiome shifted among individuals with constipation and PD after four weekly treatments with the OMM-sequence. Changes in the gut microbiome Post-OMM were associated with UPDRS results and constipation measures.

33860090,Probiotics for Parkinson's disease: Current evidence and future directions.,"The gut-brain axis is a hot topic in Parkinson's disease (PD). It has been postulated that gut pathogens and dysbiosis can contribute to peripheral inflammatory states or trigger downstream metabolic effects that exacerbate the neurodegenerative process in PD. Several preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated disrupted intestinal permeability, intestinal inflammation, altered gut microbiome, and reduced fecal short-chain fatty acids in PD. In this regard, microbial-directed therapies such as probiotics are emerging as potential therapeutic options. Probiotic supplementation is postulated to confer a variety of health benefits due to the diverse functions of these live microorganisms, including inhibition of pathogen colonization, modulation/""normalization"" of the microbiome and/or its function, immunomodulatory effects (e.g. reducing inflammation), and improved host epithelial barrier function. Interestingly, several PD animal model studies have demonstrated the potential neuroprotective effects of probiotics in reducing dopaminergic neuronal degeneration. Notably, two randomized placebo-controlled trials have provided class I evidence for probiotics as a treatment for constipation in PD. However, the effects of probiotics on other PD aspects, such as motor disability and cognitive function, and its long-term efficacy (including effects on PD drug absorption in the gut) have not been investigated adequately. Further targeted animal and human studies are also warranted to understand the mechanisms of actions of probiotics in PD and to tailor probiotic therapy based on individual host profiles to improve patient outcomes in this disabling disorder.",JGH open : an open access journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,2021,Ai Huey Tan; Jia Wei Hor; Chun Wie Chong; Shen-Yang Lim
33825149,Gut Microbial Metabolites in Parkinson's Disease: Implications of Mitochondrial Dysfunction in the Pathogenesis and Treatment.,"The search for therapeutic targets for Parkinson's disease (PD) is hindered by the incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease. Mitochondrial dysfunction is an area with high potential. The neurobiological signaling connections between the gut microbiome and the central nervous system are incompletely understood. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the gut microbiota participates in the pathogenesis of PD. Gut microbial dysbiosis may contribute to the loss of dopaminergic neurons through mitochondrial dysfunction. The intervention of gut microbial metabolites via the microbiota-gut-brain axis may serve as a promising therapeutic strategy for PD. In this narrative review, we summarize the potential roles of gut microbial dysbiosis in PD, with emphasis on microbial metabolites and mitochondrial function. We then review the possible ways in which microbial metabolites affect the central nervous system, as well as the impact of microbial metabolites on mitochondrial dysfunction. We finally discuss the possibility of gut microbiota as a therapeutic target for PD.",Molecular neurobiology,2021,Yixuan Liang; Li Cui; Jiguo Gao; Mingqin Zhu; Ying Zhang; Hong-Liang Zhang
33819374,"Trimethylamine modulates dauer formation, neurodegeneration, and lifespan through tyra-3/daf-11 signaling in Caenorhabditis elegans.","In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, signals derived from bacteria in the diet, the animal's major nutrient source, can modulate both behavior and healthspan. Here we describe a dual role for trimethylamine (TMA), a human gut flora metabolite, which acts as a nutrient signal and a neurotoxin. TMA and its associated metabolites are produced by the human gut microbiome and have been suggested to serve as risk biomarkers for diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. We demonstrate that the tyramine receptor TYRA-3, a conserved G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), is required to sense TMA and mediate its responses. TMA activates guanylyl cyclase DAF-11 signaling through TYRA-3 in amphid neurons (ASK) and ciliated neurons (BAG) to mediate food-sensing behavior. Bacterial mutants deficient in TMA production enhance dauer formation, extend lifespan, and are less preferred as a food source. Increased levels of TMA lead to neural damage in models of Parkinson's disease and shorten lifespan. Our results reveal conserved signaling pathways modulated by TMA in C. elegans that are likely to be relevant for its effects in mammalian systems.",Aging cell,2021,Amit Khanna; Durai Sellegounder; Jitendra Kumar; Manish Chamoli; Miguel Vargas; Shankar J Chinta; Anand Rane; Christopher Nelson; T Harshani Peiris; Rachel Brem; Julie Andersen; Gordon Lithgow; Pankaj Kapahi
33782648,Preventing and Treating Neurological Disorders with the Flavonol Fisetin.,"Neurological disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases, have a significant negative impact on both patients and society at large. Since the prevalence of most of these disorders increases with age, the consequences for our aging population are only going to grow. It is now acknowledged that neurological disorders are multi-factorial involving disruptions in multiple cellular systems. While each disorder has specific initiating mechanisms and pathologies, certain common pathways appear to be involved in most, if not all, neurological disorders. Thus, it is becoming increasingly important to identify compounds that can modulate the multiple pathways that contribute to disease development or progression. One of these compounds is the flavonol fisetin. Fisetin has now been shown in preclinical models to be effective at preventing the development and/or progression of multiple neurological disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, stroke (both ischemic and hemorrhagic) and traumatic brain injury as well as to reduce age-associated changes in the brain. These beneficial effects stem from its actions on multiple pathways associated with the different neurological disorders. These actions include its well characterized anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects as well as more recently described effects on the regulated cell death oxytosis/ferroptosis pathway, the gut microbiome and its senolytic activity. Therefore, the growing body of pre-clinical data, along with fisetin's ability to modulate a large number of pathways associated with brain dysfunction, strongly suggest that it would be worthwhile to pursue its therapeutic effects in humans.","Brain plasticity (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2021,Pamela Maher
33717189,Microbiome or Infections: Amyloid-Containing Biofilms as a Trigger for Complex Human Diseases.,"The human microbiota is the community of microorganisms that live upon or within their human host. The microbiota consists of various microorganisms including bacteria, fungi, viruses, and archaea; the gut microbiota is comprised mostly of bacteria. Many bacterial species within the gut microbiome grow as biofilms, which are multicellular communities embedded in an extracellular matrix. Studies have shown that the relative abundances of bacterial species, and therefore biofilms and bacterial byproducts, change during progression of a variety of human diseases including gastrointestinal, autoimmune, neurodegenerative, and cancer. Studies have shown the location and proximity of the biofilms within the gastrointestinal tract might impact disease outcome. Gram-negative enteric bacteria secrete the amyloid curli, which makes up as much as 85% of the extracellular matrix of enteric biofilms. Curli mediates cell-cell attachment and attachment to various surfaces including extracellular matrix components such as fibronectin and laminin. Structurally, curli is strikingly similar to pathological and immunomodulatory human amyloids such as amyloid-β, which has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease, α-synuclein, which is involved in Parkinson's disease, and serum amyloid A, which is secreted during the acute phase of inflammation. The immune system recognizes both bacterial amyloid curli and human amyloids utilizing the same receptors, so curli also induces inflammation. Moreover, recent work indicates that curli can participate in the self-assembly process of pathological human amyloids. Curli is found within biofilms of commensal enteric bacteria as well as invasive pathogens; therefore, evidence suggests that curli contributes to complex human diseases. In this review, we summarize the recent findings on how bacterial biofilms containing curli participate in the pathological and immunological processes in gastrointestinal diseases, systemic autoimmune diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases.",Frontiers in immunology,2021,Amanda L Miller; Shingo Bessho; Kaitlyn Grando; Çagla Tükel
33692356,Meta-analysis of the Parkinson's disease gut microbiome suggests alterations linked to intestinal inflammation.,"The gut microbiota is emerging as an important modulator of neurodegenerative diseases, and accumulating evidence has linked gut microbes to Parkinson's disease (PD) symptomatology and pathophysiology. PD is often preceded by gastrointestinal symptoms and alterations of the enteric nervous system accompany the disease. Several studies have analyzed the gut microbiome in PD, but a consensus on the features of the PD-specific microbiota is missing. Here, we conduct a meta-analysis re-analyzing the ten currently available 16S microbiome datasets to investigate whether common alterations in the gut microbiota of PD patients exist across cohorts. We found significant alterations in the PD-associated microbiome, which are robust to study-specific technical heterogeneities, although differences in microbiome structure between PD and controls are small. Enrichment of the genera Lactobacillus, Akkermansia, and Bifidobacterium and depletion of bacteria belonging to the Lachnospiraceae family and the Faecalibacterium genus, both important short-chain fatty acids producers, emerged as the most consistent PD gut microbiome alterations.

33669008,"The Role of Gut Bacterial Metabolites in Brain Development, Aging and Disease.","In the last decade, emerging evidence has reported correlations between the gut microbiome and human health and disease, including those affecting the brain. We performed a systematic assessment of the available literature focusing on gut bacterial metabolites and their associations with diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). The bacterial metabolites short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) as well as non-SCFAs like amino acid metabolites (AAMs) and bacterial amyloids are described in particular. We found significantly altered SCFA levels in patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), affective disorders, multiple sclerosis (MS) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Non-SCFAs yielded less significantly distinct changes in faecal levels of patients and healthy controls, with the majority of findings were derived from urinary and blood samples. Preclinical studies have implicated different bacterial metabolites with potentially beneficial as well as detrimental mechanisms in brain diseases. Examples include immunomodulation and changes in catecholamine production by histone deacetylase inhibition, anti-inflammatory effects through activity on the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and involvement in protein misfolding. Overall, our findings highlight the existence of altered bacterial metabolites in patients across various brain diseases, as well as potential neuroactive effects by which gut-derived SCFAs, p-cresol, indole derivatives and bacterial amyloids could impact disease development and progression. The findings summarized in this review could lead to further insights into the gut-brain-axis and thus into potential diagnostic, therapeutic or preventive strategies in brain diseases.",Nutrients,2021,Shirley Mei-Sin Tran; M Hasan Mohajeri

However, nonmotor symptoms, such as gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction, precede those affecting movement. Evidence of an early involvement of the GI tract and enteric nervous system highlights the need for better understanding of the role of gut microbiota in GI complications in PD. Here, we investigate the gut microbiome of patients with PD using metagenomics and serum metabolomics. We integrate these data using metabolic modeling and construct an integrative correlation network giving insight into key microbial species linked with disease severity, GI dysfunction, and age of patients with PD. Functional analysis reveals an increased microbial capability to degrade mucin and host glycans in PD.

33517890,Gut microbiota-derived propionate mediates the neuroprotective effect of osteocalcin in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with no absolute cure. The evidence of the involvement of gut microbiota in PD pathogenesis suggests the need to identify certain molecule(s) derived from the gut microbiota, which has the potential to manage PD. Osteocalcin (OCN), an osteoblast-secreted protein, has been shown to modulate brain function. Thus, it is of interest to investigate whether OCN could exert protective effect on PD and, if yes, whether the underlying mechanism lies in the subsequent changes in gut microbiota.The intraperitoneal injection of OCN can effectively ameliorate the motor deficits and dopaminergic neuronal loss in a 6-hydroxydopamine-induced PD mouse model. The further antibiotics treatment and fecal microbiota transplantation experiments confirmed that the gut microbiota was required for OCN-induced protection in PD mice. OCN elevated Bacteroidetes and depleted Firmicutes phyla in the gut microbiota of PD mice with elevated potential of microbial propionate production and was confirmed by fecal propionate levels. Two months of orally administered propionate successfully rescued motor deficits and dopaminergic neuronal loss in PD mice. Furthermore, AR420626, the agonist of FFAR3, which is the receptor of propionate, mimicked the neuroprotective effects of propionate and the ablation of enteric neurons blocked the prevention of dopaminergic neuronal loss by propionate in PD mice.Together, our results demonstrate that OCN ameliorates motor deficits and dopaminergic neuronal loss in PD mice, modulating gut microbiome and increasing propionate level might be an underlying mechanism responsible for the neuroprotective effects of OCN on PD, and the FFAR3, expressed in enteric nervous system, might be the main action site of propionate.

33514545,"Human physiomimetic model integrating microphysiological systems of the gut, liver, and brain for studies of neurodegenerative diseases.","Slow progress in the fight against neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) motivates an urgent need for highly controlled in vitro systems to investigate organ-organ- and organ-immune-specific interactions relevant for disease pathophysiology. Of particular interest is the gut/microbiome-liver-brain axis for parsing out how genetic and environmental factors contribute to NDs. We have developed a mesofluidic platform technology to study gut-liver-cerebral interactions in the context of Parkinson's disease (PD). It connects microphysiological systems (MPSs) of the primary human gut and liver with a human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cerebral MPS in a systemically circulated common culture medium containing CD4<sup>+</sup> regulatory T and T helper 17 cells. We demonstrate this approach using a patient-derived cerebral MPS carrying the PD-causing A53T mutation, gaining two important findings: (i) that systemic interaction enhances features of in vivo-like behavior of cerebral MPSs, and (ii) that microbiome-associated short-chain fatty acids increase expression of pathology-associated pathways in PD.",Science advances,2021,Martin Trapecar; Emile Wogram; Devon Svoboda; Catherine Communal; Attya Omer; Tenzin Lungjangwa; Pierre Sphabmixay; Jason Velazquez; Kirsten Schneider; Charles W Wright; Samuel Mildrum; Austin Hendricks; Stuart Levine; Julien Muffat; Meelim Jasmine Lee; Douglas A Lauffenburger; David Trumper; Rudolf Jaenisch; Linda G Griffith
33505487,Acupoint Massage Therapy Alters the Composition of Gut Microbiome in Functional Constipation Patients.,"Results showed the overall structure of gut microbiome has no significant difference between experimental and control groups. In the genus level, the abundance of <i>Pseudobutyrivibrio</i> and <i>Ruminiclostridium</i> is higher in the experiment group than in the control, whereas that of <i>Fusicatenibacter</i> is less. The 16S KEGG function prediction suggested that Parkinson disease, retinol metabolism, and arachidonic acid metabolism could explain the biological function of different gut microbiome. Furthermore, cytokines in the serum showed a correlation with the abundance of <i>Pseudobutyrivibrio</i> in CFC.AMT could change the composition of gut microbiome which is associated with cytokines in CFC patients.",Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,2021,Hui Chen; Pei-Shan Tan; Chun-Ping Li; Bi-Zhen Chen; Yu-Qin Xu; Yan-Qin He; Xiao Ke
33488420,Bibliometric and Visual Analysis of Research on the Links Between the Gut Microbiota and Depression From 1999 to 2019.,"<b>Background:</b> There is a crucial link between the gut microbiota and the host central nervous system, and the communication between them occurs <i>via</i> a bidirectional pathway termed the ""microbiota-gut-brain axis."" The gut microbiome in the modern environment has markedly changed in response to environmental factors. These changes may affect a broad range of host psychiatric disorders, such as depression, by interacting with the host through metabolic, immune, neural, and endocrine pathways. Nevertheless, the general aspects of the links between the gut microbiota and depression have not been systematically investigated through bibliometric analysis. <b>Aim:</b> This study aimed to analyze the current status and developing trends in gut microbiota research in the depression field through bibliometric and visual analysis. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 1,962 publications published between 1999 and 2019 were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection. CiteSpace (5.6 R5) was used to perform collaboration network analysis, co-citation analysis, co-occurrence analysis, and citation burst detection. <b>Results:</b> The number of publications has been rapidly growing since 2010. The collaboration network analysis revealed that the USA, University College Cork, and John F. Cryan were the most influential country, institute, and scholar, respectively. The most productive and co-cited journals were <i>Brain Behavior and Immunity</i> and <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</i>, respectively. The co-citation analysis of references revealed that the most recent research focus was in the largest theme cluster, ""cytokines,"" thus reflecting the important research foundation in this field. The co-occurrence analysis of keywords revealed that ""fecal microbiota"" and ""microbiome"" have become the top two research hotspots since 2013. The citation burst detection for keywords identified several keywords, including ""Parkinson's disease,"" ""microbiota-gut-brain axis,"" ""microbiome,"" ""dysbiosis,"" ""bipolar disorder,"" ""impact,"" ""C reactive protein,"" and ""immune system,"" as new research frontiers, which have currently ongoing bursts. <b>Conclusions:</b> These results provide an instructive perspective on the current research and future directions in the study of the links between the gut microbiota and depression, which may help researchers choose suitable cooperators or journals, and promote their research illustrating the underlying molecular mechanisms of depression, including its etiology, prevention, and treatment.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2020,Xiuqing Zhu; Jinqing Hu; Shuhua Deng; Yaqian Tan; Chang Qiu; Ming Zhang; Xiaojia Ni; Haoyang Lu; Zhanzhang Wang; Lu Li; Hongzhen Chen; Shanqing Huang; Tao Xiao; Dewei Shang; Yuguan Wen
33422110,The impact of dextran sodium sulphate and probiotic pre-treatment in a murine model of Parkinson's disease.,"Recent work has established that Parkinson's disease (PD) patients have an altered gut microbiome, along with signs of intestinal inflammation. This could help explain the high degree of gastric disturbances in PD patients, as well as potentially be linked to the migration of peripheral inflammatory factors into the brain. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine microbiome alteration prior to the induction of a PD murine model.We presently assessed whether pre-treatment with the probiotic, VSL #3, or the inflammatory inducer, dextran sodium sulphate (DSS), would influence the PD-like pathology provoked by a dual hit toxin model using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and paraquat exposure.While VSL #3 has been reported to have anti-inflammatory effects, DSS is often used as a model of colitis because of the gut inflammation and the breach of the intestinal barrier that it induces. We found that VSL#3 did not have any significant effects (beyond a blunting of LPS paraquat-induced weight loss). However, the DSS treatment caused marked changes in the gut microbiome and was also associated with augmented behavioral and inflammatory outcomes. In fact, DSS markedly increased taxa belonging to the Bacteroidaceae and Porphyromonadaceae families but reduced those from Rikencellaceae and S24-7, as well as provoking colonic pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, consistent with an inflamed gut. The DSS also increased the impact of LPS plus paraquat upon microglial morphology, along with circulating lipocalin-2 (neutrophil marker) and IL-6. Yet, neither DSS nor VSL#3 influenced the loss of substantia nigra dopamine neurons or the astrocytic and cytoskeleton remodeling protein changes that were provoked by the LPS followed by paraquat treatment.These data suggest that disruption of the intestinal integrity and the associated microbiome can interact with systemic inflammatory events to promote widespread brain-gut changes that could be relevant for PD and at the very least, suggestive of novel neuro-immune communication.",Journal of neuroinflammation,2021,Zach Dwyer; Melany Chaiquin; Jeffrey Landrigan; Kiara Ayoub; Pragya Shail; Julianna Rocha; Christie L Childers; Kenneth B Storey; Dana J Philpott; Hongyu Sun; Shawn Hayley
33416892,Effects of dietary restriction on neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases.,"Recent and accumulating work in experimental animal models and humans shows that diet has a much more pervasive and prominent role than previously thought in modulating neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative mechanisms leading to some of the most common chronic central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Chronic or intermittent food restriction has profound effects in shaping brain and peripheral metabolism, immunity, and gut microbiome biology. Interactions among calorie intake, meal frequency, diet quality, and the gut microbiome modulate specific metabolic and molecular pathways that regulate cellular, tissue, and organ homeostasis as well as inflammation during normal brain aging and CNS neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis, among others. This review discusses these findings and their potential application to the prevention and treatment of CNS neuroinflammatory diseases and the promotion of healthy brain aging.",The Journal of experimental medicine,2021,Luigi Fontana; Laura Ghezzi; Anne H Cross; Laura Piccio
33406628,Gut Microbiota Dysbiosis Is Associated with Elevated Bile Acids in Parkinson's Disease.,"The gut microbiome can impact brain health and is altered in Parkinson's disease (PD). The vermiform appendix is a lymphoid tissue in the cecum implicated in the storage and regulation of the gut microbiota. We sought to determine whether the appendix microbiome is altered in PD and to analyze the biological consequences of the microbial alterations. We investigated the changes in the functional microbiota in the appendix of PD patients relative to controls (<i>n</i> = 12 PD, 16 C) by metatranscriptomic analysis. We found microbial dysbiosis affecting lipid metabolism, including an upregulation of bacteria responsible for secondary bile acid synthesis. We then quantitatively measure changes in bile acid abundance in PD relative to the controls in the appendix (<i>n</i> = 15 PD, 12 C) and ileum (<i>n</i> = 20 PD, 20 C). Bile acid analysis in the PD appendix reveals an increase in hydrophobic and secondary bile acids, deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA). Further proteomic and transcriptomic analysis in the appendix and ileum corroborated these findings, highlighting changes in the PD gut that are consistent with a disruption in bile acid control, including alterations in mediators of cholesterol homeostasis and lipid metabolism. Microbially derived toxic bile acids are heightened in PD, which suggests biliary abnormalities may play a role in PD pathogenesis.",Metabolites,2021,Peipei Li; Bryan A Killinger; Elizabeth Ensink; Ian Beddows; Ali Yilmaz; Noah Lubben; Jared Lamp; Meghan Schilthuis; Irving E Vega; Randy Woltjer; J Andrew Pospisilik; Patrik Brundin; Lena Brundin; Stewart F Graham; Viviane Labrie
33063712,The emerging role of probiotics in neurodegenerative diseases: new hope for Parkinson's disease?,"Neurodegenerative disease etiology is still unclear, but different contributing factors, such as lifestyle and genetic factors are involved. Altered components of the gut could play a key role in the gut-brain axis, which is a bidirectional system between the central nervous system and the enteric nervous system. Variations in the composition of the gut microbiota and its function between healthy people and patients have been reported for a variety of human disorders comprising metabolic, autoimmune, cancer, and, notably, neurodegenerative disorders. Diet can alter the microbiota composition, affecting the gut-brain axis function. Different nutraceutical interventions have been devoted to normalizing gut microbiome dysbiosis and to improving biological outcomes in neurological conditions, including the use of probiotics. Preclinical and clinical investigations discussed in this review strengthen the correlation between intestinal microbiota and brain and the concept that modifying the microbiome composition may improve brain neurochemistry, modulating different pathways. This review will discuss the potential use of probiotics for Parkinson's disease prevention or treatment or as adjuvant therapy, confirming that gut microbiota modulation influences different pro-survival pathways. Future investigations in Parkinson's disease should consider the role of the gut-brain axis and additional comprehension of the underlying mechanisms is extremely necessary.",Neural regeneration research,2021,Vanessa Castelli; Michele d'Angelo; Massimiliano Quintiliani; Elisabetta Benedetti; Maria Grazia Cifone; Annamaria Cimini
32504503,"Dysregulation of the Gut-Brain Axis, Dysbiosis and Influence of Numerous Factors on Gut Microbiota Associated Parkinson's Disease.","Parkinson's disease (PD) has been one of the substantial social, medical concerns and, burdens of the present time. PD is a gradually devastating neurodegenerative disorder of the neurological function marked with α-synucleinopathy affecting numerous regions of the brain-gut axis, as well as the central, enteric, and autonomic nervous system. Its etiology is a widely disputed topic.This review emphasizes to find out the correlation among the microbial composition and the observable disturbances in the metabolites of the microbial species and its impact on the immune response, which may have a concrete implication on the occurrence, persistence and, pathophysiology of PD via the gut-brain axis.An in-depth research and the database was developed from the available peer-reviewed articles to date (March 2020) utilizing numerous search engines like PubMed, MEDLINE and, other internet sources.Progressively increasing shreds of evidence have proved the fact that dysbiosis in the gut microbiome plays a central role in many neurological disorders, such as PD. Indeed, a disordered microbiome-gut-brain axis in PD could be focused on gastrointestinal afflictions that manifest primarily several years prior to the diagnosis, authenticating a concept wherein the pathological pathway progresses from the intestine reaching the brain.The microbiota greatly affects the bidirectional interaction between the brain and the gut via synchronized neurological, immunological, and neuroendocrine mechanisms. It can be concluded that a multitude of factors discussed in this review steadily induce the onset of dysbacteriosis that may exacerbate the etiologic mechanism of Parkinson's disease.",Current neuropharmacology,2021,Gagandeep Kaur; Tapan Behl; Simona Bungau; Arun Kumar; Md Sahab Uddin; Vineet Mehta; Gokhan Zengin; Bijo Mathew; Muhammad Ajmal Shah; Sandeep Arora
