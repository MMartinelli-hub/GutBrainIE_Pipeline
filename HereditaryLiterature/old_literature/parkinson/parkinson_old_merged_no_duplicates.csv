33860090,Probiotics for Parkinson's disease: Current evidence and future directions.,"The gut-brain axis is a hot topic in Parkinson's disease (PD). It has been postulated that gut pathogens and dysbiosis can contribute to peripheral inflammatory states or trigger downstream metabolic effects that exacerbate the neurodegenerative process in PD. Several preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated disrupted intestinal permeability, intestinal inflammation, altered gut microbiome, and reduced fecal short-chain fatty acids in PD. In this regard, microbial-directed therapies such as probiotics are emerging as potential therapeutic options. Probiotic supplementation is postulated to confer a variety of health benefits due to the diverse functions of these live microorganisms, including inhibition of pathogen colonization, modulation/""normalization"" of the microbiome and/or its function, immunomodulatory effects (e.g. reducing inflammation), and improved host epithelial barrier function. Interestingly, several PD animal model studies have demonstrated the potential neuroprotective effects of probiotics in reducing dopaminergic neuronal degeneration. Notably, two randomized placebo-controlled trials have provided class I evidence for probiotics as a treatment for constipation in PD. However, the effects of probiotics on other PD aspects, such as motor disability and cognitive function, and its long-term efficacy (including effects on PD drug absorption in the gut) have not been investigated adequately. Further targeted animal and human studies are also warranted to understand the mechanisms of actions of probiotics in PD and to tailor probiotic therapy based on individual host profiles to improve patient outcomes in this disabling disorder.",JGH open : an open access journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,2021,Ai Huey Tan; Jia Wei Hor; Chun Wie Chong; Shen-Yang Lim
33488420,Bibliometric and Visual Analysis of Research on the Links Between the Gut Microbiota and Depression From 1999 to 2019.,"<b>Background:</b> There is a crucial link between the gut microbiota and the host central nervous system, and the communication between them occurs <i>via</i> a bidirectional pathway termed the ""microbiota-gut-brain axis."" The gut microbiome in the modern environment has markedly changed in response to environmental factors. These changes may affect a broad range of host psychiatric disorders, such as depression, by interacting with the host through metabolic, immune, neural, and endocrine pathways. Nevertheless, the general aspects of the links between the gut microbiota and depression have not been systematically investigated through bibliometric analysis. <b>Aim:</b> This study aimed to analyze the current status and developing trends in gut microbiota research in the depression field through bibliometric and visual analysis. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 1,962 publications published between 1999 and 2019 were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection. CiteSpace (5.6 R5) was used to perform collaboration network analysis, co-citation analysis, co-occurrence analysis, and citation burst detection. <b>Results:</b> The number of publications has been rapidly growing since 2010. The collaboration network analysis revealed that the USA, University College Cork, and John F. Cryan were the most influential country, institute, and scholar, respectively. The most productive and co-cited journals were <i>Brain Behavior and Immunity</i> and <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</i>, respectively. The co-citation analysis of references revealed that the most recent research focus was in the largest theme cluster, ""cytokines,"" thus reflecting the important research foundation in this field. The co-occurrence analysis of keywords revealed that ""fecal microbiota"" and ""microbiome"" have become the top two research hotspots since 2013. The citation burst detection for keywords identified several keywords, including ""Parkinson's disease,"" ""microbiota-gut-brain axis,"" ""microbiome,"" ""dysbiosis,"" ""bipolar disorder,"" ""impact,"" ""C reactive protein,"" and ""immune system,"" as new research frontiers, which have currently ongoing bursts. <b>Conclusions:</b> These results provide an instructive perspective on the current research and future directions in the study of the links between the gut microbiota and depression, which may help researchers choose suitable cooperators or journals, and promote their research illustrating the underlying molecular mechanisms of depression, including its etiology, prevention, and treatment.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2020,Xiuqing Zhu; Jinqing Hu; Shuhua Deng; Yaqian Tan; Chang Qiu; Ming Zhang; Xiaojia Ni; Haoyang Lu; Zhanzhang Wang; Lu Li; Hongzhen Chen; Shanqing Huang; Tao Xiao; Dewei Shang; Yuguan Wen
33240722,Gut-Brain Axis and its Neuro-Psychiatric Effects: A Narrative Review.,"The gut microbiota regulates the function and health of the human gut. Preliminary evidence suggests its impact on multiple human systems including the nervous and immune systems. A major area of research has been the directional relationship between intestinal microbiota and the central nervous system (CNS), called the microbiota-gut-brain axis. It is hypothesized that the intestinal microbiota affects brain activity and behavior via endocrine, neural, and immune pathways. An alteration in the composition of the gut microbiome has been linked to a variety of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. The connection between gut microbiome and several CNS disorders indicates that the focus of research in the future should be on the bacterial and biochemical targets. Through this review, we outline the established knowledge regarding the gut microbiome and gut-brain axis. In addition to gut microbiome in neurological and psychiatry diseases, we have briefly discussed microbial metabolites affecting the blood-brain barrier (BBB), immune dysregulation, modification of autonomic sensorimotor connections, and hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis.",Cureus,2020,Likhita Shaik; Rahul Kashyap; Sahith Reddy Thotamgari; Romil Singh; Sahil Khanna
33092203,Clustering on Human Microbiome Sequencing Data: A Distance-Based Unsupervised Learning Model.,"Modeling and analyzing human microbiome allows the assessment of the microbial community and its impacts on human health. Microbiome composition can be quantified using 16S rRNA technology into sequencing data, which are usually skewed and heavy-tailed with excess zeros. Clustering methods are useful in personalized medicine by identifying subgroups for patients stratification. However, there is currently a lack of standardized clustering method for the complex microbiome sequencing data. We propose a clustering algorithm with a specific beta diversity measure that can address the presence-absence bias encountered for sparse count data and effectively measure the sample distances for sample stratification. Our distance measure used for clustering is derived from a parametric based mixture model producing sample-specific distributions conditional on the observed operational taxonomic unit (OTU) counts and estimated mixture weights. The method can provide accurate estimates of the true zero proportions and thus construct a precise beta diversity measure. Extensive simulation studies have been conducted and suggest that the proposed method achieves substantial clustering improvement compared with some widely used distance measures when a large proportion of zeros is presented. The proposed algorithm was implemented to a human gut microbiome study on Parkinson's diseases to identify distinct microbiome states with biological interpretations.",Microorganisms,2020,Dongyang Yang; Wei Xu
33076930,Gut bacterial deamination of residual levodopa medication for Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by both motor and non-motor symptoms. Gastrointestinal tract dysfunction is one of the non-motor features, where constipation is reported as the most common gastrointestinal symptom. Aromatic bacterial metabolites are attracting considerable attention due to their impact on gut homeostasis and host's physiology. In particular, Clostridium sporogenes is a key contributor to the production of these bioactive metabolites in the human gut.Here, we show that C. sporogenes deaminates levodopa, the main treatment in Parkinson's disease, and identify the aromatic aminotransferase responsible for the initiation of the deamination pathway. The deaminated metabolite from levodopa, 3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)propionic acid, elicits an inhibitory effect on ileal motility in an ex vivo model. We detected 3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)propionic acid in fecal samples of Parkinson's disease patients on levodopa medication and found that this metabolite is actively produced by the gut microbiota in those stool samples.Levodopa is deaminated by the gut bacterium C. sporogenes producing a metabolite that inhibits ileal motility ex vivo. Overall, this study underpins the importance of the metabolic pathways of the gut microbiome involved in drug metabolism not only to preserve drug effectiveness, but also to avoid potential side effects of bacterial breakdown products of the unabsorbed residue of medication.",BMC biology,2020,Sebastiaan P van Kessel; Hiltje R de Jong; Simon L Winkel; Sander S van Leeuwen; Sieger A Nelemans; Hjalmar Permentier; Ali Keshavarzian; Sahar El Aidy
33046051,Using data science for medical decision making case: role of gut microbiome in multiple sclerosis.,"A decade ago, the advancements in the microbiome data sequencing techniques initiated the development of research of the microbiome and its relationship with the host organism. The development of sophisticated bioinformatics and data science tools for the analysis of large amounts of data followed. Since then, the analyzed gut microbiome data, where microbiome is defined as a network of microorganisms inhabiting the human intestinal system, has been associated with several conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome - IBS, colorectal cancer, diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome, and lately in the study of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases as well. This paper aims to provide an understanding of differences between microbial data of individuals who have been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and those who were not by exploiting data science techniques on publicly available data.This study examines the relationship between multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune central nervous system disease, and gut microbial community composition, using the samples acquired by 16s rRNA sequencing technique. We have used three different sets of MS samples sequenced during three independent studies (Jangi et al, Nat Commun 7:1-11, 2016), (Miyake et al, PLoS ONE 10:0137429, 2015), (McDonald et al, Msystems 3:00031-18, 2018) and this approach strengthens our results. Analyzed sequences were from healthy control and MS groups of sequences. The extracted set of statistically significant bacteria from the (Jangi et al, Nat Commun 7:1-11, 2016) dataset samples and their statistically significant predictive functions were used to develop a Random Forest classifier. In total, 8 models based on two criteria: bacteria abundance (at six taxonomic levels) and predictive functions (at two levels), were constructed and evaluated. These include using taxa abundances at different taxonomy levels as well as predictive function analysis at different hierarchical levels of KEGG pathways.The highest accuracy of the classification model was obtained at the genus level of taxonomy (76.82%) and the third hierarchical level of KEGG pathways (70.95%). The second dataset's 18 MS samples (Miyake et al, PLoS ONE 10:0137429, 2015) and 18 self-reported healthy samples from the (McDonald et al, Msystems 3:00031-18, 2018) dataset were used to validate the developed classification model. The significance of this step is to show that the model is not overtrained for a specific dataset but can also be used on other independent datasets. Again, the highest classification model accuracy for both validating datasets combined was obtained at the genus level of taxonomy (70.98%) and third hierarchical level of KEGG pathways (67.24%). The accuracy of the independent set remained very relevant.Our results demonstrate that the developed classification model provides a good tool that can be used to suggest the presence or absence of MS condition by collecting and analyzing gut microbiome samples. The accuracy of the model can be further increased by using sequencing methods that allow higher taxa resolution (i.e. shotgun metagenomic sequencing).",BMC medical informatics and decision making,2020,Jasminka Hasic Telalovic; Azra Music
32999308,"DJ-1 (Park7) affects the gut microbiome, metabolites and the development of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs).","The proper communication between gut and brain is pivotal for the maintenance of health and, dysregulation of the gut-brain axis can lead to several clinical disorders. In Parkinson's disease (PD) 85% of all patients experienced constipation many years before showing any signs of motor phenotypes. For differential diagnosis and preventive treatment, there is an urgent need for the identification of biomarkers indicating early disease stages long before the disease phenotype manifests. DJ-1 is a chaperone protein involved in the protection against PD and genetic mutations in this protein have been shown to cause familial PD. However, how the deficiency of DJ-1 influences the risk of PD remains incompletely understood. In the present study, we provide evidence that DJ-1 is implicated in shaping the gut microbiome including; their metabolite production, inflammation and innate immune cells (ILCs) development. We revealed that deficiency of DJ-1 leads to a significant increase in two specific genera/species, namely Alistipes and Rikenella. In DJ-1 knock-out (DJ-1<sup>-/-</sup>) mice the production of fecal calprotectin and MCP-1 inflammatory proteins were elevated. Fecal and serum metabolic profile showed that malonate which influences the immune system was significantly more abundant in DJ-1<sup>-/-</sup> mice. DJ-1 appeared also to be involved in ILCs development. Further, inflammatory genes related to PD were augmented in the midbrain of DJ-1<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Our data suggest that metabolites and inflammation produced in the gut could be used as biomarkers for PD detection. Perhaps, these metabolites and inflammatory mediators could be involved in triggering inflammation resulting in PD pathology.",Scientific reports,2020,Yogesh Singh; Christoph Trautwein; Achal Dhariwal; Madhuri S Salker; Md Alauddin; Laimdota Zizmare; Lisann Pelzl; Martina Feger; Jakob Admard; Nicolas Casadei; Michael Föller; Vivek Pachauri; David S Park; Tak W Mak; Julia-Stefanie Frick; Diethelm Wallwiener; Sara Y Brucker; Florian Lang; Olaf Riess
32987656,The Pathology of Parkinson's Disease and Potential Benefit of Dietary Polyphenols.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by a loss of dopaminergic neurons, leading to bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor at rest, and postural instability, as well as non-motor symptoms such as olfactory impairment, pain, autonomic dysfunction, impaired sleep, fatigue, and behavioral changes. The pathogenesis of PD is believed to involve oxidative stress, disruption to mitochondria, alterations to the protein α-synuclein, and neuroinflammatory processes. There is currently no cure for the disease. Polyphenols are secondary metabolites of plants, which have shown benefit in several experimental models of PD. Intake of polyphenols through diet is also associated with lower PD risk in humans. In this review, we provide an overview of the pathology of PD and the data supporting the potential neuroprotective capacity of increased polyphenols in the diet. Evidence suggests that the intake of dietary polyphenols may inhibit neurodegeneration and the progression of PD. Polyphenols appear to have a positive effect on the gut microbiome, which may decrease inflammation that contributes to the disease. Therefore, a diet rich in polyphenols may decrease the symptoms and increase quality of life in PD patients.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2020,Sunisha Aryal; Taylor Skinner; Bronwyn Bridges; John T Weber
32982910,Gut-Brain Axis: Potential Factors Involved in the Pathogenesis of Parkinson's Disease.,"Increasing evidence suggests an association between gastrointestinal (GI) disorders and susceptibility and progress of Parkinson's disease (PD). Gut-brain axis has been proposed to play important roles in the pathogenesis of PD, though the exact pathophysiologic mechanism has yet to be elucidated. Here, we discuss the common factors involved in both PD and GI disorders, including genes, altered gut microbiota, diet, environmental toxins, and altered mucosal immunity. Large-scale prospective clinical studies are needed to define the exact relationship between dietary factors, microbiome, and genetic factors in PD. Identification of early diagnostic markers and demonstration of the efficacy of diet modulation and regulation of gut microbiome through specific therapeutics can potentially change the treatment paradigm for PD.",Frontiers in neurology,2020,Yin-Xia Chao; Muhammad Yaaseen Gulam; Nicholas Shyh Jenn Chia; Lei Feng; Olaf Rotzschke; Eng-King Tan
32834004,Predictive analysis methods for human microbiome data with application to Parkinson's disease.,"Microbiome data consists of operational taxonomic unit (OTU) counts characterized by zero-inflation, over-dispersion, and grouping structure among samples. Currently, statistical testing methods are commonly performed to identify OTUs that are associated with a phenotype. The limitations of statistical testing methods include that the validity of p-values/q-values depend sensitively on the correctness of models and that the statistical significance does not necessarily imply predictivity. Predictive analysis using methods such as LASSO is an alternative approach for identifying associated OTUs and for measuring the predictability of the phenotype variable with OTUs and other covariate variables. We investigate three strategies of performing predictive analysis: (1) LASSO: fitting a LASSO multinomial logistic regression model to all OTU counts with specific transformation; (2) screening+GLM: screening OTUs with q-values returned by fitting a GLMM to each OTU, then fitting a GLM model using a subset of selected OTUs; (3) screening+LASSO: fitting a LASSO to a subset of OTUs selected with GLMM. We have conducted empirical studies using three simulation datasets generated using Dirichlet-multinomial models and a real gut microbiome data related to Parkinson's disease to investigate the performance of the three strategies for predictive analysis. Our simulation studies show that the predictive performance of LASSO with appropriate variable transformation works remarkably well on zero-inflated data. Our results of real data analysis show that Parkinson's disease can be predicted based on selected OTUs after the binary transformation, age, and sex with high accuracy (Error Rate = 0.199, AUC = 0.872, AUPRC = 0.912). These results provide strong evidences of the relationship between Parkinson's disease and the gut microbiome.",PloS one,2020,Mei Dong; Longhai Li; Man Chen; Anthony Kusalik; Wei Xu
32791113,The Microbiome as a Modifier of Neurodegenerative Disease Risk.,"The gut microbiome is increasingly implicated in modifying susceptibility to and progression of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). In this review, we discuss roles for the microbiome in aging and in NDs. In particular, we summarize findings from human studies on microbiome alterations in Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington's disease. We assess animal studies of genetic and environmental models for NDs that investigate how manipulations of the microbiome causally impact the development of behavioral and neuropathological endophenotypes of disease. We additionally evaluate the likely immunological, neuronal, and metabolic mechanisms for how the gut microbiota may modulate risk for NDs. Finally, we speculate on cross-cutting features for microbial influences across multiple NDs and consider the potential for microbiome-targeted interventions for NDs.",Cell host & microbe,2020,P Fang; S A Kazmi; K G Jameson; E Y Hsiao
32600151,Rapid improvement in Alzheimer's disease symptoms following fecal microbiota transplantation: a case report.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is a leading cause of death and a major cause of morbidity in older people. The disease is characterized by progressive memory loss, cognitive impairment, and the cerebral accumulation of amyloid-β peptide. Given the health and economic impacts of AD, treatments that target the underlying etiology of AD or modify the course of the disease are of significant interest. The gut microbiome has been increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, emerging evidence has demonstrated that there are alterations in gut microbiome composition in patients with AD, suggesting involvement of the microbiome-gut-brain axis. We present symptom improvement in a patient with AD following fecal microbiota transplantation for a <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> infection.",The Journal of international medical research,2020,Sabine Hazan
32572814,Butyrate Protects Against Salsolinol-Induced Toxicity in SH-SY5Y Cells: Implication for Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is associated with the destruction of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and the formation of Lewy bodies in basal ganglia. Risk factors for PD include aging, as well as environmental and genetic factors. Recent converging reports suggest a role for the gut microbiome and epigenetic factors in the onset and/or progression of PD. Of particular relevance and potential therapeutic targets in this regard are histone deacetylases (HDACs), enzymes that are involved in chromatin remodeling. Butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid (FA) produced in the gut and presumably acting via several G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) including FA3 receptors (FA3Rs), is a well-known HDAC inhibitor that plays an important role in maintaining homeostasis of the gut-brain axis. Recently, its significance in regulation of some critical brain functions and usefulness in neurodegenerative diseases such as PD has been suggested. In this study we sought to determine whether butyrate may have protective effects against salsolionl (SALS)-induced toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. SALS, an endogenous product of aldehyde and dopamine condensation, may be selectively toxic to dopaminergic neurons. SH-SY5Y cells, derived from human neuroblastoma cells, are used as a model of these neurons. Exposure of SH-SY5Y cells for 24 h to 400 μM SALS resulted in approximately 60% cell death, which was concentration-dependently prevented by butyrate. The effects of butyrate in turn were significantly attenuated by beta-hydroxy butyrate (BHB), a selective FA3R antagonist. Moreover, a selective FA3R agonist (AR 420626) also provided protective effects against SALS, which was totally blocked by BHB. These findings provide further support that butyrate or an agonist of FA3R may be of therapeutic potential in PD.",Neurotoxicity research,2020,Bruk Getachew; Antonei B Csoka; Amna Bhatti; Robert L Copeland; Yousef Tizabi
32566740,Characterizing dysbiosis of gut microbiome in PD: evidence for overabundance of opportunistic pathogens.,"In Parkinson's disease (PD), gastrointestinal features are common and often precede the motor signs. Braak and colleagues proposed that PD may start in the gut, triggered by a pathogen, and spread to the brain. Numerous studies have examined the gut microbiome in PD; all found it to be altered, but found inconsistent results on associated microorganisms. Studies to date have been small (<i>N</i> = 20 to 306) and are difficult to compare or combine due to varied methodology. We conducted a microbiome-wide association study (MWAS) with two large datasets for internal replication (<i>N</i> = 333 and 507). We used uniform methodology when possible, interrogated confounders, and applied two statistical tests for concordance, followed by correlation network analysis to infer interactions. Fifteen genera were associated with PD at a microbiome-wide significance level, in both datasets, with both methods, with or without covariate adjustment. The associations were not independent, rather they represented three clusters of co-occurring microorganisms. Cluster 1 was composed of opportunistic pathogens and all were elevated in PD. Cluster 2 was short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria and all were reduced in PD. Cluster 3 was carbohydrate-metabolizing probiotics and were elevated in PD. Depletion of anti-inflammatory SCFA-producing bacteria and elevated levels of probiotics are confirmatory. Overabundance of opportunistic pathogens is an original finding and their identity provides a lead to experimentally test their role in PD.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2020,Zachary D Wallen; Mary Appah; Marissa N Dean; Cheryl L Sesler; Stewart A Factor; Eric Molho; Cyrus P Zabetian; David G Standaert; Haydeh Payami
32545788,Focus on the Role of NLRP3 Inflammasome in Diseases.,"Inflammation is a protective reaction activated in response to detrimental stimuli, such as dead cells, irritants or pathogens, by the evolutionarily conserved immune system and is regulated by the host. The inflammasomes are recognized as innate immune system sensors and receptors that manage the activation of caspase-1 and stimulate inflammation response. They have been associated with several inflammatory disorders. The NLRP3 inflammasome is the most well characterized. It is so called because NLRP3 belongs to the family of nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain-like receptors (NLRs). Recent evidence has greatly improved our understanding of the mechanisms by which the NLRP3 inflammasome is activated. Additionally, increasing data in animal models, supported by human studies, strongly implicate the involvement of the inflammasome in the initiation or progression of disorders with a high impact on public health, such as metabolic pathologies (obesity, type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis), cardiovascular diseases (ischemic and non-ischemic heart disease), inflammatory issues (liver diseases, inflammatory bowel diseases, gut microbiome, rheumatoid arthritis) and neurologic disorders (Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other neurological disorders), compared to other molecular platforms. This review will provide a focus on the available knowledge about the NLRP3 inflammasome role in these pathologies and describe the balance between the activation of the harmful and beneficial inflammasome so that new therapies can be created for patients with these diseases.",International journal of molecular sciences,2020,Roberta Fusco; Rosalba Siracusa; Tiziana Genovese; Salvatore Cuzzocrea; Rosanna Di Paola
32538869,Crosstalk Between Alpha-Synuclein and Other Human and Non-Human Amyloidogenic Proteins: Consequences for Amyloid Formation in Parkinson's Disease.,"It was recently shown (Sampson et al., Elife9, 2020) that an amyloidogenic protein, CsgA, present in E. coli biofilms in the gut can trigger Parkinson's disease in mice. This study emphasizes the possible role of the gut microbiome in modulation (and even initiation) of human neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease. As the CsgA protein was found to accelerate alpha-synuclein (the key amyloidogenic protein in Parkinson's disease) amyloid formation in vitro, this result suggests that also other amyloidogenic proteins from gut bacteria, and even from the diet (such as stable allergenic proteins), may be able to affect human protein conformations and thereby modulate amyloid-related diseases. In this review, we summarize what has been reported in terms of in vitro cross-reactivity studies between alpha-synuclein and other amyloidogenic human and non-human proteins. It becomes clear from the limited data that exist that there is a fine line between acceleration and inhibition, but that cross-reactivity is widespread, and it is more common for other proteins (among the studied cases) to accelerate alpha-synuclein amyloid formation than to block it. It is of high importance to expand investigations of cross-reactivity between amyloidogenic proteins to both reveal underlying mechanisms and links between human diseases, as well as to develop new treatments that may be based on an altered gut microbiome.",Journal of Parkinson's disease,2020,Tony Werner; Istvan Horvath; Pernilla Wittung-Stafshede

To date, no disease modifying treatment for PD exists. Here, the study protocol of the Dutch Parkinson Cohort (DUPARC) is described. DUPARC is a longitudinal cohort study aimed at deeply phenotyping de novo PD patients who are treatment-naïve at baseline, to discover and validate biomarkers for PD progression, subtypes and pathophysiology.DUPARC is a prospective cohort study in which 150 de novo PD subjects will be recruited through a collaborative network of PD treating neurologists in the northern part of the Netherlands (Parkinson Platform Northern Netherlands, PPNN). Participants will receive follow-up assessments after 1 year and 3 years, with the intention of an extended follow-up with 3 year intervals. Subjects are extensively characterized to primarily assess objectives within three major domains of PD: cognition, gastrointestinal function and vision. This includes brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); brain cholinergic PET-imaging with fluoroethoxybenzovesamicol (FEOBV-PET); brain dopaminergic PET-imaging with fluorodopa (FDOPA-PET); detailed neuropsychological assessments, covering all cognitive domains; gut microbiome composition; intestinal wall permeability; optical coherence tomography (OCT); genotyping; motor and non-motor symptoms; overall clinical status and lifestyle factors, including a dietary assessment; storage of blood and feces for additional analyses of inflammation and metabolic parameters. Since the start of the inclusion, at the end of 2017, over 100 PD subjects with a confirmed dopaminergic deficit on FDOPA-PET have been included.DUPARC is the first study to combine data within, but not limited to, the non-motor domains of cognition, gastrointestinal function and vision in PD subjects over time.

32517799,Parkinson's disease-associated alterations of the gut microbiome predict disease-relevant changes in metabolic functions.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a systemic disease clinically defined by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the brain. While alterations in the gut microbiome composition have been reported in PD, their functional consequences remain unclear. Herein, we addressed this question by an analysis of stool samples from the Luxembourg Parkinson's Study (n = 147 typical PD cases, n = 162 controls).All individuals underwent detailed clinical assessment, including neurological examinations and neuropsychological tests followed by self-reporting questionnaires. Stool samples from these individuals were first analysed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Second, we predicted the potential secretion for 129 microbial metabolites through personalised metabolic modelling using the microbiome data and genome-scale metabolic reconstructions of human gut microbes. Our key results include the following. Eight genera and seven species changed significantly in their relative abundances between PD patients and healthy controls. PD-associated microbial patterns statistically depended on sex, age, BMI, and constipation. Particularly, the relative abundances of Bilophila and Paraprevotella were significantly associated with the Hoehn and Yahr staging after controlling for the disease duration. Furthermore, personalised metabolic modelling of the gut microbiomes revealed PD-associated metabolic patterns in the predicted secretion potential of nine microbial metabolites in PD, including increased methionine and cysteinylglycine. The predicted microbial pantothenic acid production potential was linked to the presence of specific non-motor symptoms.Our results suggest that PD-associated alterations of the gut microbiome can translate into substantial functional differences affecting host metabolism and disease phenotype.",BMC biology,2020,Federico Baldini; Johannes Hertel; Estelle Sandt; Cyrille C Thinnes; Lorieza Neuberger-Castillo; Lukas Pavelka; Fay Betsou; Rejko Krüger; Ines Thiele; 
32459513,The dichotomous role of the gut microbiome in exacerbating and ameliorating neurodegenerative disorders.,"Age related neurodegenerative disorders affect millions of people around the world. The role of the gut microbiome (GM) in neurodegenerative disorders has been elucidated over the past few years. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiome ultimately results in neurodegeneration. However, the gut microbiome can be modulated to promote neuro-resilience.This review is focused on demonstrating the role of the gut microbiome in host physiology in Parkinson's disease (PD) and other neurodegenerative disorders. We will discuss how the microbiome will impact neurodegeneration in PD, Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Multiple sclerosis (MS), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), and finally discuss how the gut microbiome can be influenced through diet and lifestyle.Currently, much of the focus has been to study the mechanisms by which the microbiome induces neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in PD, AD, MS, ALS. In particular, the role of certain dietary flavonoids in regulation of gut microbiome to promote neuro-resilience.

32456274,Anti-aggregation Effects of Phenolic Compounds on α-synuclein.,"The aggregation and deposition of α-synuclein (αS) are major pathologic features of Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and other α-synucleinopathies. The propagation of αS pathology in the brain plays a key role in the onset and progression of clinical phenotypes. Thus, there is increasing interest in developing strategies that attenuate αS aggregation and propagation. Based on cumulative evidence that αS oligomers are neurotoxic and critical species in the pathogenesis of α-synucleinopathies, we and other groups reported that phenolic compounds inhibit αS aggregation including oligomerization, thereby ameliorating αS oligomer-induced cellular and synaptic toxicities. Heterogeneity in gut microbiota may influence the efficacy of dietary polyphenol metabolism. Our recent studies on the brain-penetrating polyphenolic acids 3-hydroxybenzoic acid (3-HBA), 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (3,4-diHBA), and 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (3-HPPA), which are derived from gut microbiota-based metabolism of dietary polyphenols, demonstrated an in vitro ability to inhibit αS oligomerization and mediate aggregated αS-induced neurotoxicity. Additionally, 3-HPPA, 3,4-diHBA, 3-HBA, and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid significantly attenuated intracellular αS seeding aggregation in a cell-based system.

The spread of α-syn pathology across brain regions is thought to play a key role in the onset and progression of clinical phenotypes. Thus, there is increasing interest in developing strategies that target and attenuate α-syn aggregation and spread. Recent studies of brain-penetrating polyphenolic acids, namely, 3-hydroxybenzoic acid (3-HBA), 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (3,4-diHBA), and 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid (3-HPPA) that are derived from gut microbiota metabolism of dietary polyphenols, show <i>in vitro</i> ability to effectively modulate α-syn misfolding, oligomerization, and mediate aggregated α-syn neurotoxicity. Here we investigate whether 3-HBA, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4-HBA), 3,4-diHBA, or 3-HPPA interfere with α-syn spreading in a cell-based system. Using HEK293 cells overexpressing α-syn-A53T-CFP/YFP, we assessed α-syn seeding activity using Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) to detect and quantify α-syn aggregation. We demonstrated that 3-HPPA, 3,4-diHBA, 3-HBA, and 4-HBA significantly attenuated intracellular α-syn seeding aggregation. To determine whether our compounds could inhibit brain-derived seeding activity, we utilized insoluble α-syn extracted from post-mortem MSA or PD brain specimens. We found that 3-HPPA effectively attenuated MSA-induced aggregation of monomer into high molecular weight aggregates capable of inducing intracellular aggregation. Outcomes from our studies suggest interactions between gut microbiome and certain dietary factors may form the basis for effective therapies that modulate pathologic α-syn propagation. Collectively, our findings provide the basis for future developments of probiotic, prebiotic, or synbiotic approaches for modulating the onset and/or progression of α-synucleinopathies.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2020,Tritia R Yamasaki; Kenjiro Ono; Lap Ho; Giulio M Pasinetti
32399169,Long-Term Use of Antibiotics and Risk of Parkinson's Disease in the Nurses' Health Study.,"Antibiotic use is one of the strongest environmental predictors of an altered and less diverse gut microbiome, which has been linked to Parkinson's disease. To our knowledge, no prior study has examined the association between long-term antibiotic use and Parkinson's disease.We conducted a prospective study of 59,637 women in the Nurses' Health Study who reported total duration of antibiotic use at ages 20-39, 40-59, 60 +, or during the past 4 years. We used Cox Proportional Hazard regression to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the association between categories of antibiotic use and risk of PD.One hundred and eighty cases of PD were confirmed during the follow-up. Self-reported antibiotic use at ages 20-39, 40-59, and 60 +, as assessed in 2004, was not significantly associated with PD risk in our cohort. The hazard ratio comparing participants who used antibiotics for 2 or more months vs. 1-14 days at age 20-39 was 0.98 (95% CI: 0.54, 1.78), at age 40-59 was 1.44 (95% CI: 0.88, 2.33), and at age 60 +was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.53, 1.47). Antibiotic use during the past four years, as assessed in 2008, was also not associated with future risk of PD (HR: 1.14, 95% CI: 0.62, 2.10).In this cohort study, we did not observe a significant association between antibiotic use and incidence PD. A major limitation of our study is assessment of exposure, which required many participants to recall their antibiotic use decades in the past. Thus, although the results of this study do not support an effect of antibiotic use on PD risk, larger investigations relying on records of antibiotic prescriptions would provide more definitive evidence.",Parkinson's disease,2020,Natalia Palacios; Éilis J O'Reilly; Michael A Schwarzschild; Alberto Ascherio
32155131,Effects of the probiotic formulation SLAB51 in <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> Parkinson's disease models.,"Parkinson is a common neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms, including abnormalities in the gut function, which may appear before the motor sign. To date, there are treatments that can help relieve Parkinson' disease (PD)-associated symptoms, but there is no cure to control the onset and progression of this disorder. Altered components of the gut could represent a key role in gut-brain axis, which is a bidirectional system between the central nervous system and the enteric nervous system. Diet can alter the microbiota composition, affecting gut-brain axis function. Gut microbiome restoration through selected probiotics' administration has been reported. In this study, we investigated the effects of the novel formulation SLAB51 in PD. Our findings indicate that this probiotic formulation can counteract the detrimental effect of 6-OHDA <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> models of PD. The results suggest that SLAB51 can be a promising candidate for the prevention or as coadjuvant treatment of PD.",Aging,2020,Vanessa Castelli; Michele d'Angelo; Francesca Lombardi; Margherita Alfonsetti; Andrea Antonosante; Mariano Catanesi; Elisabetta Benedetti; Paola Palumbo; Maria Grazia Cifone; Antonio Giordano; Giovambattista Desideri; Annamaria Cimini

Although whole metagenome sequencing promises enough raw data to study those changes, existing tools are limited in their ability to directly compare microbial metabolic function across samples and studies. We introduce Carnelian, an end-to-end pipeline for metabolic functional profiling uniquely suited to finding functional trends across diverse datasets. Carnelian is able to find shared metabolic pathways, concordant functional dysbioses, and distinguish Enzyme Commission (EC) terms missed by existing methodologies.

32041265,Interventional Influence of the Intestinal Microbiome Through Dietary Intervention and Bowel Cleansing Might Improve Motor Symptoms in Parkinson's Disease.,"The impact of the gut microbiome is being increasingly appreciated in health and in various chronic diseases, among them neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). In the pathogenesis of PD, the role of the gut has been previously established. In conjunction with a better understanding of the intestinal microbiome, a link to the misfolding and spread of alpha-synuclein via inflammatory processes within the gut is discussed. In a case-control study, we assessed the gut microbiome of 54 PD patients and 32 healthy controls (HC). Additionally, we tested in this proof-of-concept study whether dietary intervention alone or additional physical colon cleaning may lead to changes of the gut microbiome in PD. 16 PD patients underwent a well-controlled balanced, ovo-lacto vegetarian diet intervention including short fatty acids for 14 days. 10 of those patients received additional treatment with daily fecal enema over 8 days. Stool samples were collected before and after 14 days of intervention. In comparison to HC, we could confirm previously reported PD associated microbiome changes. The UDPRS III significantly improved and the levodopa-equivalent daily dose decreased after vegetarian diet and fecal enema in a one-year follow-up. Additionally, we observed a significant association between the gut microbiome diversity and the UPDRS III and the abundance of <i>Ruminococcaceae</i>. Additionally, the abundance of <i>Clostridiaceae</i> was significantly reduced after enema. Dietary intervention and bowel cleansing may provide an additional non-pharmacologic therapeutic option for PD patients.",Cells,2020,Tobias Hegelmaier; Marco Lebbing; Alexander Duscha; Laura Tomaske; Lars Tönges; Jacob Bak Holm; Henrik Bjørn Nielsen; Sören G Gatermann; Horst Przuntek; Aiden Haghikia
31998605,The gut microbiome: an orchestrator of xenobiotic metabolism.,"Microbes inhabiting the intestinal tract of humans represent a site for xenobiotic metabolism. The gut microbiome, the collection of microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract, can alter the metabolic outcome of pharmaceuticals, environmental toxicants, and heavy metals, thereby changing their pharmacokinetics. Direct chemical modification of xenobiotics by the gut microbiome, either through the intestinal tract or re-entering the gut <i>via</i> enterohepatic circulation, can lead to increased metabolism or bioactivation, depending on the enzymatic activity within the microbial niche. Unique enzymes encoded within the microbiome include those that reverse the modifications imparted by host detoxification pathways. Additionally, the microbiome can limit xenobiotic absorption in the small intestine by increasing the expression of cell-cell adhesion proteins, supporting the protective mucosal layer, and/or directly sequestering chemicals. Lastly, host gene expression is regulated by the microbiome, including CYP450s, multi-drug resistance proteins, and the transcription factors that regulate them. While the microbiome affects the host and pharmacokinetics of the xenobiotic, xenobiotics can also influence the viability and metabolism of the microbiome. Our understanding of the complex interconnectedness between host, microbiome, and metabolism will advance with new modeling systems, technology development and refinement, and mechanistic studies focused on the contribution of human and microbial metabolism.",Acta pharmaceutica Sinica.

31954994,Dysbiosis in Parkinson's disease might be triggered by certain antibiotics.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative amyloid disorder with debilitating motor symptoms due to the loss of dopamine-synthesizing, basal ganglia-projecting neurons in the substantia nigra. An interesting feature of the disease is that most of PD patients have gastrointestinal problems and bacterial dysbiosis, years before the full expression of motor symptoms. We hypothesized that antibiotic consumption might be a contributing factor of gut microbiome dysbiosis in PD, favoring curli-producing Enterobacteria. Curli is a bacterial α-synuclein (αSyn) which is deposited first in the enteric nervous system and amyloid deposits are propagated in a prion like manner to the central nervous system. In addition, antibiotics result in a low-grade systemic inflammation, which also contributes to damage of neurons in enteric- and central nervous system. To support our hypothesis, by comparing PD prevalence change with antibiotic consumption data in EU countries, we found significant positive correlation between use narrow spectrum penicillin + penicillinase resistant penicillin and increased prevalence of the disease.",Medical hypotheses,2020,Gábor Ternák; Dániel Kuti; Krisztina J Kovács
31952509,The progress of gut microbiome research related to brain disorders.,"There is increasing evidence showing that the dynamic changes in the gut microbiota can alter brain physiology and behavior. Cognition was originally thought to be regulated only by the central nervous system. However, it is now becoming clear that many non-nervous system factors, including the gut-resident bacteria of the gastrointestinal tract, regulate and influence cognitive dysfunction as well as the process of neurodegeneration and cerebrovascular diseases. Extrinsic and intrinsic factors including dietary habits can regulate the composition of the microbiota. Microbes release metabolites and microbiota-derived molecules to further trigger host-derived cytokines and inflammation in the central nervous system, which contribute greatly to the pathogenesis of host brain disorders such as pain, depression, anxiety, autism, Alzheimer's diseases, Parkinson's disease, and stroke. Change of blood-brain barrier permeability, brain vascular physiology, and brain structure are among the most critical causes of the development of downstream neurological dysfunction. In this review, we will discuss the following parts: Overview of technical approaches used in gut microbiome studiesMicrobiota and immunityGut microbiota and metabolitesMicrobiota-induced blood-brain barrier dysfunctionNeuropsychiatric diseases ■ Stress and depression■ Pain and migraine■ Autism spectrum disordersNeurodegenerative diseases ■ Parkinson's disease■ Alzheimer's disease■ Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis■ Multiple sclerosisCerebrovascular disease ■ Atherosclerosis■ Stroke■ Arteriovenous malformationConclusions and perspectives.",Journal of neuroinflammation,2020,Sibo Zhu; Yanfeng Jiang; Kelin Xu; Mei Cui; Weimin Ye; Genming Zhao; Li Jin; Xingdong Chen
31940482,Probiotic Bacillus subtilis Protects against α-Synuclein Aggregation in C. elegans.,"Recent discoveries have implicated the gut microbiome in the progression and severity of Parkinson's disease; however, how gut bacteria affect such neurodegenerative disorders remains unclear. Here, we report that the Bacillus subtilis probiotic strain PXN21 inhibits α-synuclein aggregation and clears preformed aggregates in an established Caenorhabditis elegans model of synucleinopathy. This protection is seen in young and aging animals and is partly mediated by DAF-16. Multiple B. subtilis strains trigger the protective effect via both spores and vegetative cells, partly due to a biofilm formation in the gut of the worms and the release of bacterial metabolites. We identify several host metabolic pathways differentially regulated in response to probiotic exposure, including sphingolipid metabolism. We further demonstrate functional roles of the sphingolipid metabolism genes lagr-1, asm-3, and sptl-3 in the anti-aggregation effect. Our findings provide a basis for exploring the disease-modifying potential of B. subtilis as a dietary supplement.",Cell reports,2020,María Eugenia Goya; Feng Xue; Cristina Sampedro-Torres-Quevedo; Sofia Arnaouteli; Lourdes Riquelme-Dominguez; Andrés Romanowski; Jack Brydon; Kathryn L Ball; Nicola R Stanley-Wall; Maria Doitsidou
31890161,Microbiome changes: an indicator of Parkinson's disease?,"Parkinson's disease is characterized by dopaminergic neuron loss and intracellular inclusions composed mainly of alpha synuclein (α-syn), but the mechanism of pathogenesis is still obscure. In recent years, more attention has been given to the gut as a key player in the initiation and progression of PD pathology. Several studies characterizing changes in the microbiome, particularly the gut microbiome, have been conducted. Although many studies found a decrease in the bacterial family Prevotellaceae and in butyrate-producing bacterial genera such as Roseburia and Faecalibacteria, and an increase in the genera Akkermansia many of the studies reported contradictory findings.

31749671,Enriched Environmental Conditions Modify the Gut Microbiome Composition and Fecal Markers of Inflammation in Parkinson's Disease.,"Recent findings suggest an implication of the gut microbiome in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. PD onset and progression has also been linked with various environmental factors such as physical activity, exposure to pesticides, head injury, nicotine, and dietary factors. In this study, we used a mouse model, overexpressing the complete human SNCA gene (SNCA-TG mice) modeling familial and sporadic forms of PD to study whether environmental conditions such as standard <i>vs.</i> enriched environment changes the gut microbiome and influences disease progression. We performed 16S rRNA DNA sequencing on fecal samples for microbiome analysis and studied fecal inflammatory calprotectin from the colon of control and SNCA-TG mice kept under standard environment (SE) and enriched environment (EE) conditions. The overall composition of the gut microbiota was not changed in SNCA-TG mice compared with WT in EE with respect to SE. However, individual gut bacteria at genus level such as <i>Lactobacillus</i> sp. was a significant changed in the SNCA-TG mice. EE significantly reduced colon fecal inflammatory calprotectin protein in WT and SNCA-TG EE compared to SE. Moreover, EE reduces the pro-inflammatory cytokines in the feces and inflammation inducing genes in the colon. Our data suggest that an enriched social environment has a positive effect on the induction of SNCA mediated inflammation in the intestine and by modulating anti-inflammatory gut bacteria.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2019,Yogesh Singh; Mohamed El-Hadidi; Jakob Admard; Zinah Wassouf; Julia M Schulze-Hentrich; Ursula Kohlhofer; Leticia Quintanilla-Martinez; Daniel Huson; Olaf Riess; Nicolas Casadei
31745471,Gut Vibes in Parkinson's Disease: The Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis.,"The complexity of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD) is attributable to multifactorial changes occurring at a molecular level, influenced by genetics and environmental interactions. However, what causes the main hallmarks of PD is not well understood. Recent data increasingly suggest that imbalances in the gut microbiome composition might trigger and/or exacerbate the progression of PD.The present review aims to (1) report emerging literature showing changes in microbiota composition of PD patients compared to healthy individuals and (2) discuss how these changes may initiate and/or perpetuate PD pathology.We analyzed 13 studies published from 2015 and included in this review. Altered microbial taxa were compiled in a detailed table summarizing bacterial changes in fecal/mucosal samples. The methodology was systematically reviewed across the articles and was also included in a table to facilitate comparisons between studies.Multiple studies found a reduction in short-chain fatty-acid-producing bacteria that can rescue neuronal damage through epigenetic mechanisms. Overall, the studies showed that changes in the gut microbiota composition might influence colonic inflammation, gut permeability, and α-synuclein aggregation, contributing to the neurogenerative process.Further studies with larger cohorts and high-resolution sequencing methods are required to better define gut microbiota changes in PD. Furthermore, additional longitudinal studies are required to determine the causal link between these changes and PD pathogenesis as well as to study the potential of the intestinal microbiota as a biomarker.",Movement disorders clinical practice,2019,Clara Bullich; Ali Keshavarzian; Johan Garssen; Aletta Kraneveld; Paula Perez-Pardo

31609697,The Appendix in Parkinson's Disease: From Vestigial Remnant to Vital Organ?,"Parkinson's disease (PD) has long been considered a brain disease, but studies now point to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract as a potential starting point for PD. In particular, the human vermiform appendix has been implicated in PD. The appendix is a tissue rich in immune cells, serving as part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue and as a storehouse for the gut microbiome. The functions of the appendix converge with recent evidence demonstrating that gut inflammation and shifts in the microbiome are linked to PD. Some epidemiological studies have linked removal of the appendix to lowered PD risk, though there is controversy among these associations. What is apparent is that there is an abundance of aggregated forms of α-synuclein in the appendix relevant to PD pathology. α-Synuclein pathology is thought to propagate from gut to brain via the vagus nerve, which innervates GI tract locations, including the appendix. Remarkably, α-synuclein aggregates in the appendix occur not only in PD patients, but are also present in healthy individuals. This has led to the proposal that in the appendix α-synuclein aggregates are not unique to PD. Moreover, the molecular events leading to PD and the mechanisms by which α-synuclein aggregates transfers from gut to brain may be identifiable in the human appendix. The influence of the appendix on GI inflammation, autoimmunity, microbiome storage, and the lymphatic system may be yet unexplored mechanisms by which the appendix contributes to PD. Overall, the appendix represents a promising tissue site to advance our understanding of PD pathobiology.",Journal of Parkinson's disease,2019,Bryan Killinger; Viviane Labrie
31596658,"""Photobiomics"": Can Light, Including Photobiomodulation, Alter the Microbiome?","<b><i>Objective</i>:</b> The objective of this review is to consider the dual effects of microbiome and photobiomodulation (PBM) on human health and to suggest a relationship between these two as a novel mechanism. <b><i>Background</i>:</b> PBM describes the use of low levels of visible or near-infrared (NIR) light to heal and stimulate tissue, and to relieve pain and inflammation. In recent years, PBM has been applied to the head as an investigative approach to treat diverse brain diseases such as stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI), Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and psychiatric disorders. Also, in recent years, increasing attention has been paid to the total microbial population that colonizes the human body, chiefly in the gut and the mouth, called the microbiome. It is known that the composition and health of the gut microbiome affects many diseases related to metabolism, obesity, cardiovascular disorders, autoimmunity, and even brain disorders. <b><i>Materials and methods</i>:</b> A literature search was conducted for published reports on the effect of light on the microbiome. <b><i>Results</i>:</b> Recent work by our research group has demonstrated that PBM (red and NIR light) delivered to the abdomen in mice, can alter the gut microbiome in a potentially beneficial way. This has also now been demonstrated in human subjects. <b><i>Conclusions</i>:</b> In consideration of the known effects of PBM on metabolomics, and the now demonstrated effects of PBM on the microbiome, as well as other effects of light on the microbiome, including modulating circadian rhythms, the present perspective introduces a new term ""photobiomics"" and looks forward to the application of PBM to influence the microbiome in humans.

31519175,The endotoxin hypothesis of neurodegeneration.,"The endotoxin hypothesis of neurodegeneration is the hypothesis that endotoxin causes or contributes to neurodegeneration. Endotoxin is a lipopolysaccharide (LPS), constituting much of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, present at high concentrations in gut, gums and skin and in other tissue during bacterial infection. Blood plasma levels of endotoxin are normally low, but are elevated during infections, gut inflammation, gum disease and neurodegenerative disease. Adding endotoxin at such levels to blood of healthy humans induces systemic inflammation and brain microglial activation. Adding high levels of endotoxin to the blood or body of rodents induces microglial activation, priming and/or tolerance, memory deficits and loss of brain synapses and neurons. Endotoxin promotes amyloid β and tau aggregation and neuropathology, suggesting the possibility that endotoxin synergises with different aggregable proteins to give different neurodegenerative diseases. Blood and brain endotoxin levels are elevated in Alzheimer's disease, which is accelerated by systemic infections, including gum disease. Endotoxin binds directly to APOE, and the APOE4 variant both sensitises to endotoxin and predisposes to Alzheimer's disease. Intestinal permeability increases early in Parkinson's disease, and injection of endotoxin into mice induces α-synuclein production and aggregation, as well as loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. The gut microbiome changes in Parkinson's disease, and changing the endotoxin-producing bacterial species can affect the disease in patients and mouse models. Blood endotoxin is elevated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and endotoxin promotes TDP-43 aggregation and neuropathology. Peripheral diseases that elevate blood endotoxin, such as sepsis, AIDS and liver failure, also result in neurodegeneration. Endotoxin directly and indirectly activates microglia that damage neurons via nitric oxide, oxidants and cytokines, and by phagocytosis of synapses and neurons. The endotoxin hypothesis is unproven, but if correct, then neurodegeneration may be reduced by decreasing endotoxin levels or endotoxin-induced neuroinflammation.",Journal of neuroinflammation,2019,Guy C Brown
31505196,MitoPark transgenic mouse model recapitulates the gastrointestinal dysfunction and gut-microbiome changes of Parkinson's disease.,"Gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances are one of the earliest symptoms affecting most patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). In many cases, these symptoms are observed years before motor impairments become apparent. Hence, the molecular and cellular underpinnings that contribute to this early GI dysfunction in PD have actively been explored using a relevant animal model. The MitoPark model is a chronic, progressive mouse model recapitulating several key pathophysiological aspects of PD. However, GI dysfunction and gut microbiome changes have not been categorized in this model. Herein, we show that decreased GI motility was one of the first non-motor symptoms to develop, evident as early as 8 weeks with significantly different transit times from 12 weeks onwards. These symptoms were observed well before motor symptoms developed, thereby paralleling PD progression in humans. At age 24 weeks, we observed increased colon transit time and reduced fecal water content, indicative of constipation. Intestinal inflammation was evidenced with increased expression of iNOS and TNFα in the small and large intestine. Specifically, iNOS was observed mainly in the enteric plexi, indicating enteric glial cell activation. A pronounced loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons occurred at 24 weeks both in the mid-brain region as well as the gut, leading to a corresponding decrease in dopamine (DA) production. We also observed decreased DARPP-32 expression in the colon, validating the loss of DAergic neurons in the gut. However, the total number of enteric neurons did not significantly differ between the two groups. Metabolomic gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of fecal samples showed increased sterol, glycerol, and tocopherol production in MitoPark mice compared to age-matched littermate controls at 20 weeks of age while 16 s microbiome sequencing showed a transient temporal increase in the genus Prevotella. Altogether, the data shed more light on the role of the gut dopaminergic system in maintaining intestinal health. Importantly, this model recapitulates the chronology and development of GI dysfunction along with other non-motor symptoms and can become an attractive translational animal model for pre-clinical assessment of the efficacy of new anti-Parkinsonian drugs that can alleviate GI dysfunction in PD.",Neurotoxicology,2019,Shivani Ghaisas; Monica R Langley; Bharathi N Palanisamy; Somak Dutta; Kirthi Narayanaswamy; Paul J Plummer; Souvarish Sarkar; Muhammet Ay; Huajun Jin; Vellareddy Anantharam; Arthi Kanthasamy; Anumantha G Kanthasamy
31498131,Increasing Comparability and Utility of Gut Microbiome Studies in Parkinson's Disease: A Systematic Review.,"Gut microbiota have been studied in relation to the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) due to the early gastrointestinal symptomatology and presence of alpha-synuclein pathology in the enteric nervous system, hypothesized to ascend via the vagal nerve to the central nervous system. Accordingly, sixteen human case-control studies have published gut microbiome composition changes in PD and reported over 100 differentially abundant taxa covering all taxonomic levels from phylum to genus or species, depending on methodology. While certain findings were replicated across several studies, various contradictory findings were reported. Here, differences in methodologies and the presence of possible confounders in the study populations are assessed for their potential to confound the results of gut microbiome studies in PD. Gut microbiome studies in PD exhibited considerable variability with respect to the study population, sample transport conditions, laboratory protocols and sequencing, bioinformatics pipelines, and biostatistical methods. To move from the current heterogeneous dataset towards clinically relevant biomarkers and the identification of putative therapeutic targets, recommendations are derived from the limitations of the available studies to increase the future comparability of microbiome studies in PD. In addition, integration of currently available data on the gut microbiome in PD is proposed to identify robust gut microbiome profiles in PD. Furthermore, expansion of the current dataset with atypical parkinsonism cohorts, prodromal and treatment-naïve de novo PD subjects, measurements of fecal microbial concentrations and multi-omics assessments are required to provide clinically relevant biomarkers and reveal therapeutic targets within the gut microbiome of PD.",Journal of Parkinson's disease,2019,Jeffrey M Boertien; Pedro A B Pereira; Velma T E Aho; Filip Scheperjans
31440136,Altered Gut Microbiome in Parkinson's Disease and the Influence of Lipopolysaccharide in a Human α-Synuclein Over-Expressing Mouse Model.,"The interaction between the gut microbiota and alpha-synuclein (αSyn) aggregation in Parkinson's disease (PD) is receiving increasing attention. The objective of this study was to investigate gut microbiota, and effects of an inflammatory lipopolysaccharide (LPS) trigger in a human αSyn over-expressing mouse model of PD (Thy1-αSyn). Stool samples from patients with confirmed PD and Thy1-αSyn mice were analyzed using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. Compared to healthy controls, the relative abundance of mucin-degrading Verrucomicrobiae and LPS-producing Gammaproteobacteria were greater in PD patients. In mice, the abundance of Gammaproteobacteria was negligible in both Thy1-αSyn and wild-type (WT) animals, while Verrucomicrobiae were reduced in Thy1-αSyn mice. The effect of LPS on intestinal barrier function was investigated <i>in vitro</i> using intestinal epithelial (IEC-6) cells, and <i>in vivo</i> via administration of LPS in drinking water to Thy1-αSyn mice. Acute exposure to LPS <i>in vitro</i> resulted in a reduction and altered distribution of the tight junction markers ZO-1 and e-Cadherin around the cell membrane in IEC-6 cells, as shown by immunohistochemistry. LPS administration in Thy1-αSyn mice resulted in the emergence of early motor manifestations at 10 weeks, compared to untreated mice who were still asymptomatic at this age.

Over the last 2 decades evidence has emerged to suggest that inflammation-derived oxidative damage and cytokine induced toxicity may play a significant role in the neuronal damage associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). Presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines and T cell infiltration has been observed in the brain parenchyma of patients with PD. Furthermore, evidence for inflammatory changes has been reported in the enteric nervous system, the vagus nerve branches and glial cells. The presence of α-synuclein deposits in the post-mortem brain biopsy in patients with PD has further substantiated the role of inflammation in PD. It has been suggested that the α-synuclein misfolding might begin in the gut and spread ""prion like"" via the vagus nerve into lower brainstem and ultimately to the midbrain; this is known as the Braak hypothesis. It is noteworthy that the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms (constipation, dysphagia, and hypersalivation), altered gut microbiota and leaky gut have been observed in PD patients several years prior to the clinical onset of the disease. These clinical observations have been supported by in vitro studies in mice as well, demonstrating the role of genetic (α-synuclein overexpression) and environmental (gut dysbiosis) factors in the pathogenesis of PD.

Cell therapy has emerged as an experimental treatment, but current cell sources such as human umbilical cord blood (hUCB) stem cells display only partial recapitulation of mature dopaminergic neuron phenotype and function. Nonetheless, stem cell grafts ameliorate PD-associated histological and behavioral deficits likely through stem cell graft-secreted therapeutic substances. We recently demonstrated the potential of hUCB-derived plasma in enhancing motor capabilities and gastrointestinal function, as well as preventing dopaminergic neuronal cell loss, in an 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-pyridine (MPTP) rodent model of PD. Recognizing the translational need to test in another PD model, we now examined here the effects of an intravenously transplanted combination of hUCB and plasma into the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesioned adult rats. Animals received three separate doses of 4 × 10<sup>6</sup> hUCB cells with plasma beginning at 7 days after stereotaxic 6-OHDA lesion, then behaviorally and immunohistochemically evaluated over 56 days post-lesion. Whereas vehicle-treated lesioned animals exhibited the typical 6-OHDA neurobehavioral symptoms, hUCB and plasma-treated lesioned animals showed significant attenuation of motor function, gut motility, and nigral dopaminergic neuronal survival, combined with diminished pro-inflammatory microbiomes not only in the nigra, but also in the gut. Altogether these data support a regenerative medicine approach for PD by sequestering inflammation and neurotoxicity through correction of gut dysbiosis.",Stem cell reviews and reports,2019,Jea-Young Lee; Julian P Tuazon; Sydney Corey; Brooke Bonsack; Sandra Acosta; Jared Ehrhart; Paul R Sanberg; Cesario V Borlongan
31275138,The Gut-Brain Axis in Neurodegenerative Diseases and Relevance of the Canine Model: A Review.,"Identifying appropriate animal models is critical in developing translatable <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> systems for therapeutic drug development and investigating disease pathophysiology. These animal models should have direct biological and translational relevance to the underlying disease they are supposed to mimic. Aging dogs not only naturally develop a cognitive decline in many aspects including learning and memory deficits, but they also exhibit human-like individual variability in the aging process. Neurodegenerative processes that can be observed in both human and canine brains include the progressive accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) found as diffuse plaques in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), including the <i>gyrus proreus (i.e., medial orbital PFC)</i>, as well as the hippocampus and the cerebral vasculature. Tau pathology, a marker of neurodegeneration and dementia progression, was also found in canine hippocampal synapses. Various epidemiological data show that human patients with neurodegenerative diseases have concurrent intestinal lesions, and histopathological changes in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract occurs decades before neurodegenerative changes. Gut microbiome alterations have also been reported in many neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's diseases, as well as inflammatory central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Interestingly, the dog gut microbiome more closely resembles human gut microbiome in composition and functional overlap compared to rodent models. This article reviews the physiology of the gut-brain axis (GBA) and its involvement with neurodegenerative diseases in humans. Additionally, we outline the advantages and weaknesses of current <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> models and discuss future research directions investigating major human neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and Parkinson's diseases using dogs.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2019,Yoko M Ambrosini; Dana Borcherding; Anumantha Kanthasamy; Hyun Jung Kim; Auriel A Willette; Albert Jergens; Karin Allenspach; Jonathan P Mochel
31248424,Altered gut microbiota and inflammatory cytokine responses in patients with Parkinson's disease.,"Emerging evidence suggests that gut microbiome composition alterations affect neurodegeneration through neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we evaluate gut microbiota alterations and host cytokine responses in a population of Taiwanese patients with PD.Fecal microbiota communities from 80 patients with PD and 77 age and gender-matched controls were assessed by sequencing the V3-V4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Diet and comorbidities were controlled in the analyses. Plasma concentrations of IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-13, IL-18, GM-CSF, IFNγ, and TNFα were measured by a multiplex immunoassay and relationships between microbiota, clinical characteristics, and cytokine levels were analyzed in the PD group. We further examined the cytokine changes associated with the altered gut microbiota seen in patients with PD in another independent cohort of 120 PD patients and 120 controls.Microbiota from patients with PD was altered relative to controls and dominated by Verrucomicrobia, Mucispirillum, Porphyromonas, Lactobacillus, and Parabacteroides. In contrast, Prevotella was more abundant in controls. The abundances of Bacteroides were more increased in patients with non-tremor PD subtype than patients with tremor subtype. Bacteroides abundance was correlated with motor symptom severity defined by UPDRS part III motor scores (rho = 0.637 [95% confidence interval 0.474 to 0.758], P < 0.01). Altered microbiota was correlated with plasma concentrations of IFNγ and TNFα. There was a correlation between Bacteroides and plasma level of TNFα (rho = 0.638 [95% CI: 0.102-0.887], P = 0.02); and a correlation between Verrucomicrobia abundance and plasma concentrations of IFNγ (rho = 0.545 [95% CI - 0.043-0.852], P = 0.05). The elevated plasma cytokine responses were confirmed in an additional independent 120 patients with PD and 120 controls (TNFα: PD vs. control 8.51 ± 4.63 pg/ml vs. 4.82 ± 2.23 pg/ml, P < 0.01; and IFNγ: PD vs. control: 38.45 ± 7.12 pg/ml vs. 32.79 ± 8.03 pg/ml, P = 0.03).This study reveals altered gut microbiota in PD and its correlation with clinical phenotypes and severity in our population. The altered plasma cytokine profiles associated with gut microbiome composition alterations suggest aberrant immune responses may contribute to inflammatory processes in PD.",Journal of neuroinflammation,2019,Chin-Hsien Lin; Chieh-Chang Chen; Han-Lin Chiang; Jyh-Ming Liou; Chih-Min Chang; Tzu-Pin Lu; Eric Y Chuang; Yi-Cheng Tai; Chieh Cheng; Han-Yi Lin; Ming-Shiang Wu
31214110,The Gut and Parkinson's Disease-A Bidirectional Pathway.,"Humans evolved a symbiotic relationship with their gut microbiome, a complex microbial community composed of bacteria, archaea, protists, and viruses, including bacteriophages. The enteric nervous system (ENS) is a gateway for the bidirectional communication between the brain and the gut, mostly through the vagus nerve (VN). Environmental exposure plays a pivotal role in both the composition and functionality of the gut microbiome and may contribute to susceptibility to neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD). The neuropathological hallmark of PD is the widespread appearance of alpha-synuclein aggregates in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, including the ENS. Many studies suggest that gut toxins can induce the formation of α-syn aggregates in the ENS, which may then be transmitted in a prion-like manner to the CNS through the VN. PD is strongly associated with aging and its negative effects on homeostatic mechanisms protecting from inflammation, oxidative stress, and protein malfunction. In this mini-review, we revisit some landmark discoveries in the field of Parkinson's research and focus on the gut-brain axis. In the process, we highlight evidence showing gut-associated dysbiosis and related microbial-derived components as important players and risk factors for PD. Therefore, the gut microbiome emerges as a potential target for protective measures aiming to prevent PD onset.",Frontiers in neurology,2019,Susanne Fonseca Santos; Hadassa Loth de Oliveira; Elizabeth Sumi Yamada; Bianca Cruz Neves; Antonio Pereira
31158941,Altered Gut Microbiome and Intestinal Pathology in Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder arising from an interplay between genetic and environmental risk factors. Studies have suggested that the pathological hallmarks of intraneuronal α-synuclein aggregations may start from the olfactory bulb and the enteric nervous system of the gut and later propagate to the brain via the olfactory tract and the vagus nerve. This hypothesis correlates well with clinical symptoms, such as constipation, that may develop up to 20 years before the onset of PD motor symptoms. Recent interest in the gut-brain axis has led to vigorous research into the gastrointestinal pathology and gut microbiota changes in patients with PD. In this review, we provide current clinical and pathological evidence of gut involvement in PD by summarizing the changes in gut microbiota composition and gut inflammation associated with its pathogenesis.",Journal of movement disorders,2019,Han-Lin Chiang; Chin-Hsien Lin
31148353,Gutting the brain of inflammation: A key role of gut microbiome in human umbilical cord blood plasma therapy in Parkinson's disease model.,"Current therapies for Parkinson's disease (PD), including L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), and clinical trials investigating dopaminergic cell transplants, have generated mixed results with the eventual induction of dyskinetic side effects. Although human umbilical cord blood (hUCB) stem/progenitor cells present with no or minimal capacity of differentiation into mature dopaminergic neurons, their transplantation significantly attenuates parkinsonian symptoms likely via bystander effects, specifically stem cell graft-mediated secretion of growth factors, anti-inflammatory cytokines, or synaptic function altogether promoting brain repair. Recognizing this non-cell replacement mechanism, we examined here the effects of intravenously transplanted combination of hUCB-derived plasma into the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced rat model of PD. Animals received repeated dosing of either hUCB-derived plasma or vehicle at 3, 5 and 10 days after induction into MPTP lesion, then behaviourally and immunohistochemically evaluated over 56 days post-lesion. Compared to vehicle treatment, transplantation with hUCB-derived plasma significantly improved motor function, gut motility and dopaminergic neuronal survival in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), which coincided with reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines in both the SNpc and the intestinal mucosa and dampened inflammation-associated gut microbiota. These novel data directly implicate a key pathological crosstalk between gut and brain ushering a new avenue of therapeutically targeting the gut microbiome with hUCB-derived stem cells and plasma for PD.",Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,2019,Jea-Young Lee; Julian P Tuazon; Jared Ehrhart; Paul R Sanberg; Cesario V Borlongan
30890906,Common miRNA Patterns of Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease and Their Putative Impact on Commensal Gut Microbiota.,"With the rise of Next-Generation-Sequencing (NGS) methods, Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) have achieved an important position in the research landscape and have been found to present valuable diagnostic tools in various diseases such as multiple sclerosis or lung cancer. There is also emerging evidence that miRNAs play an important role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) or Parkinson's disease (PD). Apparently, these diseases come along with changes in miRNA expression patterns which led to attempts from researchers to use these small RNA species from several body fluids for a better diagnosis and in order to observe disease progression. Additionally, it became evident that microbial commensals might play an important role for pathology development and were shown to have a significantly different composition in patients suffering from neurodegeneration compared with healthy controls. As it could recently be shown that secreted miRNAs are able to enter microbial organisms, it is conceivable that the host's miRNA might affect the gut microbial ecosystem. As such, miRNAs may inherit a central role in shaping the ""diseased microbiome"" and thereby mutually act on the characteristics of these neurodegenerative diseases. We have therefore (1) compiled a list of miRNAs known to be associated with AD and/or PD, (2) performed an <i>in silico</i> target screen for binding sites of these miRNA on human gut metagenome sequences and (3) evaluated the hit list for interesting matches potentially relevant to the etiology of AD and or PD. The examination of protein identifiers connected to bacterial secretion system, lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and biofilm formation revealed an overlap of 37 bacterial proteins that were targeted by human miRNAs. The identified links of miRNAs to the biological processes of bacteria connected to AD and PD have yet to be validated via <i>in vivo</i> experiments. However, our results show a promising new approach for understanding aspects of these neurodegenerative diseases in light of the regulation of the microbiome.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2019,Charlotte Hewel; Julia Kaiser; Anna Wierczeiko; Jan Linke; Christoph Reinhardt; Kristina Endres; Susanne Gerber

30258234,Microglia in neurodegeneration.,"The neuroimmune system is involved in development, normal functioning, aging, and injury of the central nervous system. Microglia, first described a century ago, are the main neuroimmune cells and have three essential functions: a sentinel function involved in constant sensing of changes in their environment, a housekeeping function that promotes neuronal well-being and normal operation, and a defense function necessary for responding to such changes and providing neuroprotection. Microglia use a defined armamentarium of genes to perform these tasks. In response to specific stimuli, or with neuroinflammation, microglia also have the capacity to damage and kill neurons. Injury to neurons in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, and prion diseases, as well as in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, results from disruption of the sentinel or housekeeping functions and dysregulation of the defense function and neuroinflammation. Pathways associated with such injury include several sensing and housekeeping pathways, such as the Trem2, Cx3cr1 and progranulin pathways, which act as immune checkpoints to keep the microglial inflammatory response under control, and the scavenger receptor pathways, which promote clearance of injurious stimuli. Peripheral interference from systemic inflammation or the gut microbiome can also alter progression of such injury. Initiation or exacerbation of neurodegeneration results from an imbalance between these microglial functions; correcting such imbalance may be a potential mode for therapy.",Nature neuroscience,2018,Suzanne Hickman; Saef Izzy; Pritha Sen; Liza Morsett; Joseph El Khoury
30099552,Making Sense of … the Microbiome in Psychiatry.,"Microorganisms can be found almost anywhere, including in and on the human body. The collection of microorganisms associated with a certain location is called a microbiota, with its collective genetic material referred to as the microbiome. The largest population of microorganisms on the human body resides in the gastrointestinal tract; thus, it is not surprising that the most investigated human microbiome is the human gut microbiome. On average, the gut hosts microbes from more than 60 genera and contains more cells than the human body. The human gut microbiome has been shown to influence many aspects of host health, including more recently the brain.Several modes of interaction between the gut and the brain have been discovered, including via the synthesis of metabolites and neurotransmitters, activation of the vagus nerve, and activation of the immune system. A growing body of work is implicating the microbiome in a variety of psychological processes and neuropsychiatric disorders. These include mood and anxiety disorders, neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia, and even neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Moreover, it is probable that most psychotropic medications have an impact on the microbiome.Here, an overview will be provided for the bidirectional role of the microbiome in brain health, age-associated cognitive decline, and neurological and psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, a primer on the common microbiological and bioinformatics techniques used to interrogate the microbiome will be provided. This review is meant to equip the reader with a primer to this exciting research area that is permeating all areas of biological psychiatry research.",The international journal of neuropsychopharmacology,2019,Thomaz F S Bastiaanssen; Caitlin S M Cowan; Marcus J Claesson; Timothy G Dinan; John F Cryan
30072879,Effects of Sub-Chronic MPTP Exposure on Behavioral and Cognitive Performance and the Microbiome of Wild-Type and mGlu8 Knockout Female and Male Mice.,"Motor dysfunction is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD); however, non-motor symptoms such as gastrointestinal dysfunction often arise prior to motor symptoms. Alterations in the gut microbiome have been proposed as the earliest event in PD pathogenesis. PD symptoms often demonstrate sex differences. Glutamatergic neurotransmission has long been linked to PD pathology. Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGlu), a family of G protein-coupled receptors, are divided into three groups, with group III mGlu receptors mainly localized presynaptically where they can inhibit glutamate release in the CNS as well as in the gut. Additionally, the gut microbiome can communicate with the CNS via the gut-brain axis. Here, we assessed whether deficiency of metabotropic glutamate receptor 8 (mGlu8), group III mGlu, modulates the effects of the neurotoxin, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), on behavioral and cognitive performance in female and male mice. We studied whether these effects are associated with changes in striatal tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) levels and the gut microbiome. Two-week sub-chronic MPTP increased activity of female and male wild-type (WT) and mGlu8 knockout (KO) mice in the open field. MPTP also showed genotype- and sex-dependent effects. MPTP increased the time WT, but not KO, females and males spent exploring objects. In WT mice, MPTP improved sensorimotor function in males but impaired it in females. Further, MPTP impaired cued fear memory in WT, but not KO, male mice. MPTP reduced striatal TH levels in WT and KO mice but these effects were only pronounced in males. MPTP treatment and genotype affected the diversity of the gut microbiome. In addition, there were significant associations between microbiome α-diversity and sensorimotor performance, as well as microbiome composition and fear learning. These results indicate that specific taxa may directly affect motor and fear learning or that the same physiological effects that enhance both forms of learning also alter diversity of the gut microbiome. MPTP's effect on motor and cognitive performance may then be, at least in part, be mediated by the gut microbiome. These data also support mGlu8 as a novel therapeutic target for PD and highlight the importance of including both sexes in preclinical studies.",Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience,2018,Eileen Ruth S Torres; Tunde Akinyeke; Keaton Stagaman; Robert M Duvoisin; Charles K Meshul; Thomas J Sharpton; Jacob Raber
29867531,The Microbiome-Mitochondria Dance in Prodromal Parkinson's Disease.,"The brain is an immunologically active organ where neurons and glia cells orchestrate complex innate immune responses against infections and injuries. Neuronal responses involve Toll-like or Nod-like receptors and the secretion of antimicrobial peptides and cytokines. The endosymbiotic theory for the evolutionary origin of mitochondria from primitive bacteria, suggests that they may have also retained the capacity to activate neuronal innate immunity. In fact, it was shown that mitochondrial damage-associated molecular patterns could signal and activate innate immunity and inflammation. Moreover, the mitochondrial cascade hypothesis for sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD) argues that altered mitochondrial metabolism and function can drive neurodegeneration. Additionally, a neuroinflammatory signature with increased levels of pro-inflammatory mediators in PD affected brain areas was recently detected. Herein, we propose that a cascade of events initiating in a dysbiotic gut microbiome drive the production of toxins or antibiotics that target and damage mitochondria. This in turn activates neuronal innate immunity and triggers sterile inflammation phenomena that culminate in the neurodegenerative processes observed in the enteric and in the central nervous systems and that ultimately lead to Parkinson's disease.",Frontiers in physiology,2018,Sandra M Cardoso; Nuno Empadinhas
29857583,Changes of Colonic Bacterial Composition in Parkinson's Disease and Other Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"In recent years evidence has emerged that neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are strongly associated with the microbiome composition in the gut. Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most intensively studied neurodegenerative disease in this context. In this review, we performed a systematic evaluation of the published literature comparing changes in colonic microbiome in PD to the ones observed in other NDs including Alzheimer's disease (AD), multiple system atrophy (MSA), multiple sclerosis (MS), neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). To enhance the comparability of different studies, only human case-control studies were included. Several studies showed an increase of <i>Lactobacillus</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, Verrucomicrobiaceae and <i>Akkermansia</i> in PD. A decrease of <i>Faecalibacterium</i> spp., <i>Coprococcus</i> spp., <i>Blautia</i> spp., <i>Prevotella</i> spp. and Prevotellaceae was observed in PD. On a low taxonomic resolution, like the phylum level, the changes are not disease-specific and are inconsistent. However, on a higher taxonomic resolution like genus or species level, a minor overlap was observed between PD and MSA, both alpha synucleinopathies. We show that standardization of sample collection and analysis is necessary for ensuring the reproducibility and comparability of data. We also provide evidence that assessing the microbiota composition at high taxonomic resolution reveals changes in relative abundance that may be specific to or characteristic of one disease or disease group, and might evolve discriminative power. The interactions between bacterial species and strains and the co-abundances must be investigated before assumptions about the effects of specific bacteria on the host can be made with certainty.",Nutrients,2018,Sara Gerhardt; M Hasan Mohajeri
29802603,"Gut, Microbiome, and Brain Regulatory Axis: Relevance to Neurodegenerative and Psychiatric Disorders.","It has become apparent that the molecular and biochemical integrity of interactive families, genera, and species of human gut microflora is critically linked to maintaining complex metabolic and behavioral processes mediated by peripheral organ systems and central nervous system neuronal groupings. Relatively recent studies have established intrinsic ratios of enterotypes contained within the human microbiome across demographic subpopulations and have empirically linked significant alterations in the expression of bacterial enterotypes with the initiation and persistence of several major metabolic and psychiatric disorders. Accordingly, the goal of our review is to highlight potential thematic/functional linkages of pathophysiological alterations in gut microbiota and bidirectional gut-brain signaling pathways with special emphasis on the potential roles of gut dysbiosis on the pathophysiology of psychiatric illnesses. We provide critical discussion of putative thematic linkages of Parkinson's disease (PD) data sets to similar pathophysiological events as potential causative factors in the development and persistence of diverse psychiatric illnesses. Finally, we include a concise review of preclinical paradigms that involve immunologically-induced GI deficits and dysbiosis of maternal microflora that are functionally linked to impaired neurodevelopmental processes leading to affective behavioral syndromes in the offspring.",Cellular and molecular neurobiology,2018,G B Stefano; N Pilonis; R Ptacek; J Raboch; M Vnukova; R M Kream
29358918,Longitudinal Analysis of Fecal Microbiome and Pathologic Processes in a Rotenone Induced Mice Model of Parkinson's Disease.,"Recent studies reported an association between gut microbiota composition and Parkinson's disease (PD). However, we know little about the relationship between microbiome dysbiosis and the pathogenesis of PD. The objective of this study was to describe the evolution of fecal microbiota using an oral rotenone model of PD from a longitudinal study over a period of 4 weeks. Gastrointestinal function was assessed by measuring fecal pellet output, motor functions was assessed by open-field and pole tests every week. α-synuclein pathology, inflammation and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) neuron loss from the middle brain were also analyzed. Fecal samples were collected every week followed by 16S rRNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. We reported that chronically oral administered rotenone caused gastrointestinal dysfunction and microbiome dysbiosis prior to motor dysfunction and central nervous system (CNS) pathology. 16S rRNA sequencing of fecal microbiome showed rotenone-treated mice exhibited fecal microbiota dysbiosis characterized by an overall decrease in bacterial diversity and a significant change of microbiota composition, notably members of the phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, with an increase in Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio after 3 weeks of rotenone treatment. Moreover, rotenone-induced gastrointestinal and motor dysfunctions were observed to be robustly correlated with changes in the composition of fecal microbiota. Our results demonstrated that gut microbiome perturbation might contribute to rotenone toxicity in the initiation of PD and brought a new insight in the pathogenesis of PD. Novel therapeutic options aimed at modifying the gut microbiota composition might postpone the onset and following cascade of neurodegeneration.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2017,Xiaodong Yang; Yiwei Qian; Shaoqing Xu; Yanyan Song; Qin Xiao
29315562,HFE Genotype Restricts the Response to Paraquat in a Mouse Model of Neurotoxicity.,"Parkinson's disease is marked clinically by motor dysfunction and pathologically by dopaminergic cell loss in the substantia nigra and iron accumulation in the substantia nigra. The driver underlying iron accumulation remains unknown and could be genetic or environmental. The HFE protein is critical for the regulation of cellular iron uptake. Mutations within this protein are associated with increased iron accumulation including in the brain. We have focused on the commonly occurring H63D variant of the HFE gene as a disease modifier in a number of neurodegenerative diseases. To investigate the role of H63D HFE genotype, we generated a mouse model in which the wild-type (WT) HFE gene is replaced by the H67D gene variant (mouse homolog of the human H63D gene variant). Using paraquat toxicity as the model for Parkinson's disease, we found that WT mice responded as expected with significantly greater motor function, loss of tyrosine hydroxylase staining and increase microglial staining in the substantia nigra, and an increase in R<sub>2</sub> relaxation rate within the substantia nigra of the paraquat-treated mice compared to their saline-treated counterparts. In contrast, the H67D mice showed a remarkable resistance to paraquat treatment; specifically differing from the WT mice with no changes in motor function or changes in R<sub>2</sub> relaxation rates following paraquat exposure. At baseline, there were differences between the H67D HFE mice and WT mice in gut microbiome profile and increased L-ferritin staining in the substantia nigra that could account for the resistance to paraquat. Of particular note, the H67D HFE mice regardless of whether or not they were treated with paraquat had significantly less tyrosine hydroxylase immunostaining than WT. Our results clearly demonstrate that the HFE genotype impacts the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase in the substantia nigra, the gut microbiome and the response to paraquat providing additional support that the HFE genotype is a disease modifier for Parkinson's disease. Moreover, the finding that the HFE mutant mice are resistant to paraquat may provide a model in which to study resistant mechanisms to neurotoxicants.",Journal of neurochemistry,2018,Anne M Nixon; Mark D Meadowcroft; Elizabeth B Neely; Amanda M Snyder; Carson J Purnell; Justin Wright; Regina Lamendella; Wint Nandar; Xuemei Huang; James R Connor

28843021,The nasal and gut microbiome in Parkinson's disease and idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder.,"Increasing evidence connects the gut microbiota and the onset and/or phenotype of Parkinson's disease (PD). Differences in the abundances of specific bacterial taxa have been reported in PD patients. It is, however, unknown whether these differences can be observed in individuals at high risk, for example, with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, a prodromal condition of α-synuclein aggregation disorders including PD.To compare microbiota in carefully preserved nasal wash and stool samples of subjects with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, manifest PD, and healthy individuals.Microbiota of flash-frozen stool and nasal wash samples from 76 PD patients, 21 idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder patients, and 78 healthy controls were assessed by 16S and 18S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing. Seventy variables, related to demographics, clinical parameters including nonmotor symptoms, and sample processing, were analyzed in relation to microbiome variability and controlled differential analyses were performed.Differentially abundant gut microbes, such as Akkermansia, were observed in PD, but no strong differences in nasal microbiota. Eighty percent of the differential gut microbes in PD versus healthy controls showed similar trends in idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, for example, Anaerotruncus and several Bacteroides spp., and correlated with nonmotor symptoms. Metagenomic sequencing of select samples enabled the reconstruction of genomes of so far uncharacterized differentially abundant organisms.Our study reveals differential abundances of gut microbial taxa in PD and its prodrome idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder in comparison to the healthy controls, and highlights the potential of metagenomics to identify and characterize microbial taxa, which are enriched or depleted in PD and/or idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder. © 2017 The Authors.

28783713,"Aging and sarcopenia associate with specific interactions between gut microbes, serum biomarkers and host physiology in rats.","The microbiome has been demonstrated to play an integral role in the maintenance of many aspects of health that are also associated with aging. In order to identify areas of potential exploration and intervention, we simultaneously characterized age-related alterations in gut microbiome, muscle physiology and serum proteomic and lipidomic profiles in aged rats to define an integrated signature of the aging phenotype. We demonstrate that aging skews the composition of the gut microbiome, in particular by altering the Sutterella to Barneseilla ratio, and alters the metabolic potential of intestinal bacteria. Age-related changes of the gut microbiome were associated with the physiological decline of musculoskeletal function, and with molecular markers of nutrient processing/availability, and inflammatory/immune status in aged versus adult rats. Altogether, our study highlights that aging leads to a complex interplay between the microbiome and host physiology, and provides candidate microbial species to target physical and metabolic decline during aging by modulating gut microbial ecology.",Aging,2017,Jay Siddharth; Anirikh Chakrabarti; Alice Pannérec; Sonia Karaz; Delphine Morin-Rivron; Mojgan Masoodi; Jerome N Feige; Scott James Parkinson
28610994,Manganese-induced sex-specific gut microbiome perturbations in C57BL/6 mice.,"Overexposure to manganese (Mn) leads to toxic effects, such as promoting the development of Parkinson's-like neurological disorders. The gut microbiome is deeply involved in immune development, host metabolism, and xenobiotics biotransformation, and significantly influences central nervous system (CNS) via the gut-brain axis, i.e. the biochemical signaling between the gastrointestinal tract and the CNS. However, it remains unclear whether Mn can affect the gut microbiome and its metabolic functions, particularly those linked to neurotoxicity. In addition, sex-specific effects of Mn have been reported, with no mechanism being identified yet. Recently, we have shown that the gut microbiome is largely different between males and females, raising the possibility that differential gut microbiome responses may contribute to sex-selective toxicity of Mn. Here, we applied high-throughput sequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) metabolomics to explore how Mn<sup>2+</sup> exposure affects the gut microbiome and its metabolism in C57BL/6 mice. Mn<sup>2+</sup> exposure perturbed the gut bacterial compositions, functional genes and fecal metabolomes in a highly sex-specific manner. In particular, bacterial genes and/or key metabolites of neurotransmitter synthesis and pro-inflammatory mediators are significantly altered by Mn<sup>2+</sup> exposure, which can potentially affect chemical signaling of gut-brain interactions. Likewise, functional genes involved in iron homeostasis, flagellar motility, quorum sensing, and Mn transportation/oxidation are also widely changed by Mn<sup>2+</sup> exposure. Taken together, this study has demonstrated that Mn<sup>2+</sup> exposure perturbs the gut microbiome and its metabolic functions, which highlights the potential role of the gut microbiome in Mn<sup>2+</sup> toxicity, particularly its sex-specific toxic effects.",Toxicology and applied pharmacology,2017,Liang Chi; Bei Gao; Xiaoming Bian; Pengcheng Tu; Hongyu Ru; Kun Lu
28195358,Parkinson's disease and Parkinson's disease medications have distinct signatures of the gut microbiome.,"There is mounting evidence for a connection between the gut and Parkinson's disease (PD). Dysbiosis of gut microbiota could explain several features of PD.The objective of this study was to determine if PD involves dysbiosis of gut microbiome, disentangle effects of confounders, and identify candidate taxa and functional pathways to guide research.A total of 197 PD cases and 130 controls were studied. Microbial composition was determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing of DNA extracted from stool. Metadata were collected on 39 potential confounders including medications, diet, gastrointestinal symptoms, and demographics. Statistical analyses were conducted while controlling for potential confounders and correcting for multiple testing. We tested differences in the overall microbial composition, taxa abundance, and functional pathways.Independent microbial signatures were detected for PD (P = 4E-5), participants' region of residence within the United States (P = 3E-3), age (P = 0.03), sex (P = 1E-3), and dietary fruits/vegetables (P = 0.01). Among patients, independent signals were detected for catechol-O-methyltransferase-inhibitors (P = 4E-4), anticholinergics (P = 5E-3), and possibly carbidopa/levodopa (P = 0.05). We found significantly altered abundances of the Bifidobacteriaceae, Christensenellaceae, [Tissierellaceae], Lachnospiraceae, Lactobacillaceae, Pasteurellaceae, and Verrucomicrobiaceae families. Functional predictions revealed changes in numerous pathways, including the metabolism of plant-derived compounds and xenobiotics degradation.PD is accompanied by dysbiosis of gut microbiome. Results coalesce divergent findings of prior studies, reveal altered abundance of several taxa, nominate functional pathways, and demonstrate independent effects of PD medications on the microbiome. The findings provide new leads and testable hypotheses on the pathophysiology and treatment of PD. © 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society,2017,Erin M Hill-Burns; Justine W Debelius; James T Morton; William T Wissemann; Matthew R Lewis; Zachary D Wallen; Shyamal D Peddada; Stewart A Factor; Eric Molho; Cyrus P Zabetian; Rob Knight; Haydeh Payami
26627987,Gut microbiome in health and disease: Linking the microbiome-gut-brain axis and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of systemic and neurodegenerative diseases.,"The gut microbiome comprises the collective genome of the trillions of microorganisms residing in our gastrointestinal ecosystem. The interaction between the host and its gut microbiome is a complex relationship whose manipulation could prove critical to preventing or treating not only various gut disorders, like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and ulcerative colitis (UC), but also central nervous system (CNS) disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The purpose of this review is to summarize what is known about the gut microbiome, how it is connected to the development of disease and to identify the bacterial and biochemical targets that should be the focus of future research. Understanding the mechanisms behind the activity and proliferation of the gut microbiome will provide us new insights that may pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies.",Pharmacology & therapeutics,2016,Shivani Ghaisas; Joshua Maher; Anumantha Kanthasamy
26092111,Peripheral aetiopathogenic drivers and mediators of Parkinson's disease and co-morbidities: role of gastrointestinal microbiota.,"We seek an aetiopathogenic model for the spectrum of Parkinson's disease (PD), functional bowel disease, depression and cognitive impairment. The adopted concept is that systemic immuno-inflammatory processes mediate neuro-inflammation. The model would be based on phenotype, exposome (including gastrointestinal microbiome), milieu (immuno-inflammatory and metabolome), human genetics and their interactions. It would enable a patient's position, to be understood in terms of drivers, perpetuators and mediators, and a future position, with and without intervention, predicted. Even the cardinal facets of PD may have different drivers: halting one may allow escape down subordinate pathways. Peptic ulceration is prodromal to PD. In our randomised placebo-controlled trial, hypokinesia improved over the year following biopsy-proven Helicobacter pylori eradication and rigidity worsened. This was independent of any (stable, long t½) antiparkinsonian medication. There are pointers to an autoimmune process: for example, surveillance-confirmed hypokinesia effect was indication specific. During surveillance, successive antimicrobial courses, other than for Helicobacter, were associated with cumulative increase in rigidity. Exhibiting laxatives appeared to stem the overall temporal increase, despite antiparkinsonian medication, in rigidity. Thus, intestinal dysbiosis may be a major source of bystander neuronal damage. There are biological gradients of objective measures of PD facets on circulating inflammatory markers and leucocyte subset counts. Moreover, lactulose hydrogen breath test positivity for small-intestinal bacterial overgrowth (present in two thirds of PD patients) is associated with the same subsets: higher natural killer and total CD4+ counts and lower neutrophils. With greater aetiopathogenic understanding, relatively low cost and on-the-shelf medication could have a major impact. A new generation of animal models, based on the gut microbiome, is envisaged.",Journal of neurovirology,2016,Sylvia M Dobbs; R John Dobbs; Clive Weller; André Charlett; Aisha Augustin; David Taylor; Mohammad A A Ibrahim; Ingvar Bjarnason
25940667,"The dormant blood microbiome in chronic, inflammatory diseases.","Blood in healthy organisms is seen as a 'sterile' environment: it lacks proliferating microbes. Dormant or not-immediately-culturable forms are not absent, however, as intracellular dormancy is well established. We highlight here that a great many pathogens can survive in blood and inside erythrocytes. 'Non-culturability', reflected by discrepancies between plate counts and total counts, is commonplace in environmental microbiology. It is overcome by improved culturing methods, and we asked how common this would be in blood. A number of recent, sequence-based and ultramicroscopic studies have uncovered an authentic blood microbiome in a number of non-communicable diseases. The chief origin of these microbes is the gut microbiome (especially when it shifts composition to a pathogenic state, known as 'dysbiosis'). Another source is microbes translocated from the oral cavity. 'Dysbiosis' is also used to describe translocation of cells into blood or other tissues. To avoid ambiguity, we here use the term 'atopobiosis' for microbes that appear in places other than their normal location. Atopobiosis may contribute to the dynamics of a variety of inflammatory diseases. Overall, it seems that many more chronic, non-communicable, inflammatory diseases may have a microbial component than are presently considered, and may be treatable using bactericidal antibiotics or vaccines.",FEMS microbiology reviews,2015,Marnie Potgieter; Janette Bester; Douglas B Kell; Etheresia Pretorius
25847918,Leaky intestine and impaired microbiome in an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mouse model.,"Emerging evidence has demonstrated that intestinal homeostasis and the microbiome play essential roles in neurological diseases, such as Parkinson's disease. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by a progressive loss of motor neurons and muscle atrophy. Currently, there is no effective treatment. Most patients die within 3-5 years due to respiratory paralysis. Although the death of motor neurons is a hallmark of ALS, other organs may also contribute to the disease progression. We examined the gut of an ALS mouse model, G93A, which expresses mutant superoxide dismutase (SOD1(G93A)), and discovered a damaged tight junction structure and increased permeability with a significant reduction in the expression levels of tight junction protein ZO-1 and the adherens junction protein E-cadherin. Furthermore, our data demonstrated increased numbers of abnormal Paneth cells in the intestine of G93A mice. Paneth cells are specialized intestinal epithelial cells that can sense microbes and secrete antimicrobial peptides, thus playing key roles in host innate immune responses and shaping the gut microbiome. A decreased level of the antimicrobial peptides defensin 5 alpha was indeed found in the ALS intestine. These changes were associated with a shifted profile of the intestinal microbiome, including reduced levels of Butyrivibrio Fibrisolvens, Escherichia coli, and Fermicus, in G93A mice. The relative abundance of bacteria was shifted in G93A mice compared to wild-type mice. Principal coordinate analysis indicated a difference in fecal microbial communities between ALS and wild-type mice. Taken together, our study suggests a potential novel role of the intestinal epithelium and microbiome in the progression of ALS.",Physiological reports,2015,Shaoping Wu; Jianxun Yi; Yong-Guo Zhang; Jingsong Zhou; Jun Sun
23981537,Metabolic features of the cell danger response.,"The cell danger response (CDR) is the evolutionarily conserved metabolic response that protects cells and hosts from harm. It is triggered by encounters with chemical, physical, or biological threats that exceed the cellular capacity for homeostasis. The resulting metabolic mismatch between available resources and functional capacity produces a cascade of changes in cellular electron flow, oxygen consumption, redox, membrane fluidity, lipid dynamics, bioenergetics, carbon and sulfur resource allocation, protein folding and aggregation, vitamin availability, metal homeostasis, indole, pterin, 1-carbon and polyamine metabolism, and polymer formation. The first wave of danger signals consists of the release of metabolic intermediates like ATP and ADP, Krebs cycle intermediates, oxygen, and reactive oxygen species (ROS), and is sustained by purinergic signaling. After the danger has been eliminated or neutralized, a choreographed sequence of anti-inflammatory and regenerative pathways is activated to reverse the CDR and to heal. When the CDR persists abnormally, whole body metabolism and the gut microbiome are disturbed, the collective performance of multiple organ systems is impaired, behavior is changed, and chronic disease results. Metabolic memory of past stress encounters is stored in the form of altered mitochondrial and cellular macromolecule content, resulting in an increase in functional reserve capacity through a process known as mitocellular hormesis. The systemic form of the CDR, and its magnified form, the purinergic life-threat response (PLTR), are under direct control by ancient pathways in the brain that are ultimately coordinated by centers in the brainstem. Chemosensory integration of whole body metabolism occurs in the brainstem and is a prerequisite for normal brain, motor, vestibular, sensory, social, and speech development. An understanding of the CDR permits us to reframe old concepts of pathogenesis for a broad array of chronic, developmental, autoimmune, and degenerative disorders. These disorders include autism spectrum disorders (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), asthma, atopy, gluten and many other food and chemical sensitivity syndromes, emphysema, Tourette's syndrome, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), traumatic brain injury (TBI), epilepsy, suicidal ideation, organ transplant biology, diabetes, kidney, liver, and heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer and Parkinson disease, and autoimmune disorders like lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis.",Mitochondrion,2014,Robert K Naviaux
35572407,Interplay of gut microbiota and oxidative stress: Perspective on neurodegeneration and neuroprotection.,"Recent research on the implications of gut microbiota on brain functions has helped to gather important information on the relationship between them. Pathogenesis of neurological disorders is found to be associated with dysregulation of gut-brain axis. Some gut bacteria metabolites are found to be directly associated with the increase in reactive oxygen species levels, one of the most important risk factors of neurodegeneration. Besides their morbid association, gut bacteria metabolites are also found to play a significant role in reducing the onset of these life-threatening brain disorders.Studies done in the recent past raises two most important link between gut microbiota and the brain: ""gut microbiota-oxidative stress-neurodegeneration"" and gut microbiota-antioxidant-neuroprotection. This review aims to gives a deep insight to our readers, of the collective studies done, focusing on the gut microbiota mediated oxidative stress involved in neurodegeneration along with a focus on those studies showing the involvement of gut microbiota and their metabolites in neuroprotection.This review is focused on three main key concepts. Firstly, the mounting evidences from clinical and preclinical arenas shows the influence of gut microbiota mediated oxidative stress resulting in dysfunctional neurological processes. Therefore, we describe the potential role of gut microbiota influencing the vulnerability of brain to oxidative stress, and a budding causative in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Secondly, contributing roles of gut microbiota has been observed in attenuating oxidative stress and inflammation via its own metabolites or by producing secondary metabolites and, also modulation in gut microbiota population with antioxidative and anti-inflammatory probiotics have shown promising neuro resilience. Thirdly, high throughput <i>in silico</i> tools and databases also gives a correlation of gut microbiome, their metabolites and brain health, thus providing fascinating perspective and promising new avenues for therapeutic options.",Journal of advanced research,2022,Shruti Shandilya; Sandeep Kumar; Niraj Kumar Jha; Kavindra Kumar Kesari; Janne Ruokolainen
35111696,Gut Microbiota: A Key Regulator in the Effects of Environmental Hazards on Modulates Insulin Resistance.,"Insulin resistance is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), type II diabetes (T2D), and Parkinson's disease (PD). Emerging evidence indicates that these disorders are typically characterized by alterations in the gut microbiota composition, diversity, and their metabolites. Currently, it is understood that environmental hazards including ionizing radiation, toxic heavy metals, pesticides, particle matter, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are capable of interacting with gut microbiota and have a non-beneficial health effect. Based on the current study, we propose the hypothesis of ""gut microenvironment baseline drift"". According to this ""baseline drift"" theory, gut microbiota is a temporarily combined cluster of species sharing the same environmental stresses for a short period, which would change quickly under the influence of different environmental factors. This indicates that the microbial species in the gut do not have a long-term relationship; any split, division, or recombination may occur in different environments. Nonetheless, the ""baseline drift"" theory considers the critical role of the response of the whole gut microbiome. Undoubtedly, this hypothesis implies that the gut microbiota response is not merely a ""cross junction"" switch; in contrast, the human health or disease is a result of a rich palette of gut-microbiota-driven multiple-pathway responses. In summary, environmental factors, including hazardous and normal factors, are critical to the biological impact of the gut microbiota responses and the dual effect of the gut microbiota on the regulation of biological functions. Novel appreciation of the role of gut microbiota and environmental hazards in the insulin resistance would shed new light on insulin resistance and also promote the development of new research direction and new overcoming strategies for patients.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2021,Ruixue Huang
35083314,The small bowel microbiome changes significantly with age and aspects of the ageing process.,"Gut microbiome changes have been associated with human ageing and implicated in age-related diseases including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. However, studies to date have used stool samples, which do not represent the entire gut. Although more challenging to access, the small intestine plays critical roles in host metabolism and immune function. In this paper (Leite <i>et al.</i> (2021), Cell Reports, doi: 10.1016/j.celrep.2021.109765), we demonstrate significant differences in the small intestinal microbiome in older subjects, using duodenal aspirates from 251 subjects aged 18-80 years. Differences included significantly decreased microbial diversity in older subjects, driven by increased relative abundance of phylum Proteobacteria, particularly family Enterobacteriaceae and coliform genera <i>Escherichia</i> and <i>Klebsiella.</i> Moreover, while this decreased diversity was associated with the 'ageing process' (comprising chronologic age, number of medications, and number of concomitant diseases), changes in certain taxa were found to be associated with number of medications alone (<i>Klebsiella</i>), number of diseases alone (<i>Clostridium, Bilophila</i>), or chronologic age alone (<i>Escherichia</i>, <i>Lactobacillus, Enterococcus</i>). Lastly, many taxa associated with increasing chronologic age were anaerobes. These changes may contribute to changes in human health that occur during the ageing process.","Microbial cell (Graz, Austria)",2022,Gabriela Leite; Mark Pimentel; Gillian M Barlow; Ruchi Mathur
35069178,The Gut-Brain Axis and Its Relation to Parkinson's Disease: A Review.,"Parkinson's disease is a chronic neurodegenerative disease characterized by the accumulation of misfolded alpha-synuclein protein (Lewy bodies) in dopaminergic neurons of the <i>substantia nigra</i> and other related circuitry, which contribute to the development of both motor (bradykinesia, tremors, stiffness, abnormal gait) and non-motor symptoms (gastrointestinal issues, urinogenital complications, olfaction dysfunction, cognitive impairment). Despite tremendous progress in the field, the exact pathways and mechanisms responsible for the initiation and progression of this disease remain unclear. However, recent research suggests a potential relationship between the commensal gut bacteria and the brain capable of influencing neurodevelopment, brain function and health. This bidirectional communication is often referred to as the microbiome-gut-brain axis. Accumulating evidence suggests that the onset of non-motor symptoms, such as gastrointestinal manifestations, often precede the onset of motor symptoms and disease diagnosis, lending support to the potential role that the microbiome-gut-brain axis might play in the underlying pathological mechanisms of Parkinson's disease. This review will provide an overview of and critically discuss the current knowledge of the relationship between the gut microbiota and Parkinson's disease. We will discuss the role of α-synuclein in non-motor disease pathology, proposed pathways constituting the connection between the gut microbiome and the brain, existing evidence related to pre- and probiotic interventions. Finally, we will highlight the potential opportunity for the development of novel preventative measures and therapeutic options that could target the microbiome-gut-brain axis in the context of Parkinson's disease.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2021,Emily M Klann; Upuli Dissanayake; Anjela Gurrala; Matthew Farrer; Aparna Wagle Shukla; Adolfo Ramirez-Zamora; Volker Mai; Vinata Vedam-Mai
34965376,Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease May Result from Reactivation of Embryologic Pathways Silenced at Birth.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), Lewy Body Dementia (LBD), and Parkinson's disease (PD) form a continuum that may explain multiple aspects of age-related neurodegeneration. Inflammaging, the long-term result of the chronic physiological stimulation of the innate immune system, is integral to this process. The gut microbiome plays an important role in inflammaging, as it can release inflammatory products and communicate with other organs and systems. Although AD and PD are molecularly and clinically distinct disorders, their causes appear to underlie LBD. All three conditions lie on a continuum related to AD, PD, or LBD in vulnerable persons. Inflammation in AD is linked to cytokines and growth factors. Moreover, cytokines and neurotrophins profoundly affect PD and LBD. Growth factors, neurotrophins and cytokines are also involved in embryo neural development. Cytokines influence gene expression, metabolism, cell stress, and apoptosis in the preimplantation embryo. The responsible genes are silenced around birth. But if activated by inflammaging and viruses in the brain decades later, they could destroy the same neural structures they created in utero. For this reason, the pathology and progression of AD, LBD, and PD would be unique. Embryonic reactivation could explain two well documented features of AD. 1) NSAIDs reduce AD risk but fail as a treatment. 2) NSAIDs reduce AD risk because they suppress inflammaging. But they are not a treatment because they cannot silence the embryonic genes that have become active and damage the brain.",Discovery medicine,2021,Steven Lehrer; Peter H Rheinstein

34888340,Neuroprotection by the Ketogenic Diet: Evidence and Controversies.,"The ketogenic diet (KD) is a high-fat low-carbohydrate diet that has been used for decades as a non-pharmacologic approach to treat metabolic disorders and refractory pediatric epilepsy. In recent years, enthusiasm for the KD has increased in the scientific community due to evidence that the diet reduces pathology and improves various outcome measures in animal models of neurodegenerative disorders, including multiple sclerosis, stroke, glaucoma, spinal cord injury, retinal degenerations, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Clinical trials also suggest that the KD improved quality of life in patients with multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, the major ketone bodies BHB and ACA have potential neuroprotective properties and are now known to have direct effects on specific inflammatory proteins, transcription factors, reactive oxygen species, mitochondria, epigenetic modifications and the composition of the gut microbiome. Neuroprotective benefits of the KD are likely due to a combination of these cellular processes and other potential mechanisms that are yet to be confirmed experimentally. This review provides a comprehensive summary of current evidence for the effectiveness of the KD in humans and preclinical models of various neurological disorders, describes molecular mechanisms that may contribute to its beneficial effects, and highlights key controversies and current gaps in knowledge.",Frontiers in nutrition,2021,Sarah M Gough; Alicia Casella; Kristen Jasmin Ortega; Abigail S Hackam
34884399,Differences in the Composition of Gut Microbiota between Patients with Parkinson's Disease and Healthy Controls: A Cohort Study.,"Gut microbiome and colonic inflammation can be associated with the predisposition and progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). The presented study aimed to compare gastrointestinal microbiota composition between patients diagnosed with PD and treated only with Levodopa to healthy controls. In this prospective study, patients were recruited in 1 academic hospital from July 2019 to July 2020. The detailed demographic data and medical history were collected using a set of questionnaires. Fecal samples were obtained from all participants. Next-Generation Sequencing was used to assess the microbiota composition. The endpoint was the difference in composition of the gut microbiota. In this study, we enrolled 27 hospitalized PD patients with well-controlled symptoms. The control group included 44 healthy subjects matched for age. Among PD patients, our results presented a higher abundance of <i>Bacteroides</i> phylum, class <i>Corynebacteria</i> among phylum <i>Actinobacteria</i>, class <i>Deltaproteobacteria</i> among phylum <i>Proteobacteria</i>, and genera such as <i>Butyricimonas, Robinsoniella</i>, and <i>Flavonifractor</i>. The species <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i>, <i>Eubacterium biforme</i>, and <i>Parabacteroides merdae</i> were identified as more common in the gut microbiota of PD patients.

Here, we reviewed the inflammation and oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases and coronavirus infection (COVID-19). Here, we reviewed the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) involved in the processes of formation of oxidative stress and inflammation in viral and neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, the coronavirus uses ACE2 receptors of the RAAS to penetrate human cells. The coronavirus infection can be the trigger for neurodegenerative diseases by dysfunction of the RAAS.

34853754,Role of Gastrointestinal Dysbiosis and Fecal Transplantation in Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases with a high rate of morbidity. It is associated with dopaminergic neuron loss and is fairly common in the elderly population. Recently, there has been a growing interest in the role of the gut microbiome in the pathogenesis of PD and thus studies addressing the methods to modulate the microbiota are becoming increasingly popular. Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) is one of these methods and is effective in certain intestinal and extraintestinal conditions. This review aims to talk about gastrointestinal dysbiosis and how the reconstruction of this microbiome via FMT could potentially be used as a treatment modality in the future. We went through various studies and collected data relevant to our topic from the previous five years. The studies selected include reviews, observational studies, animal studies, case reports, and some grey literature. We concluded that although it has great potential as a therapeutic modality in the future, it is limited by several factors such as variability among the results of most clinical studies and the lack of large sample sizes. Therefore, there is a need for high-quality clinical trials with larger sample sizes to gather enough clinical evidence so that FMT can qualify as a widely recommended therapeutic measure.",Cureus,2021,Rahul Jena; Ruchi Jain; Suchitra Muralidharan; Vijaya Lakshmi Yanamala; Zainab Zubair; Ketan Kantamaneni; Krishi Jalla; Mahvish Renzu; Michael Alfonso
34841505,Assessment of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in Alzheimer's disease.,"There is great interest in crosstalk between the gastrointestinal and immune systems. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is a bowel disorder prevalent among patients with Parkinson's disease; SIBO treatment has been shown to modulate neurological inflammation, motor and cognitive outcomes there. However, to date, no link between Alzheimer's dementia and SIBO has been established. This pilot study sought to estimate the prevalence of SIBO in Alzheimer's dementia in the outpatient setting in Singapore General Hospital. It entailed performing a hydrogen breath test and objectively scoring gastrointestinal symptoms and their severity in 48 patients, comparing symptom scores and mean breath test values in those with mild to moderate Alzheimer's against age- and sex-matched controls that did not fulfill DSM-V criteria for probable Alzheimer's. Here, the prevalence of positive breath tests and symptoms of SIBO were no greater among Alzheimer's patients than in controls. This suggests that the gut microbiome changes and increased bowel inflammation seen in previous studies on Alzheimer's patients are likely effected through pathways other than SIBO, and are likely more complex than a mere increase in small bowel bacterial volume. Rather, future research could be directed along the lines of qualitative changes in small bowel microbiota, or pathologies in other parts of the gastrointestinal tract such as the colon or stomach, aspects which are not adequately captured by the hydrogen breath test.

34836918,Footprints of a microbial toxin from the gut microbiome to mesencephalic mitochondria.,"Idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterised by alpha-synuclein (aSyn) aggregation and death of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain. Recent evidence posits that PD may initiate in the gut by microbes or their toxins that promote chronic gut inflammation that will ultimately impact the brain. In this work, we sought to demonstrate that the effects of the microbial toxin β-<i>N</i>-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) in the gut may trigger some PD cases, which is especially worrying as this toxin is present in certain foods but not routinely monitored by public health authorities.To test the hypothesis, we treated wild-type mice, primary neuronal cultures, cell lines and isolated mitochondria with BMAA, and analysed its impact on gut microbiota composition, barrier permeability, inflammation and aSyn aggregation as well as in brain inflammation, dopaminergic neuronal loss and motor behaviour. To further examine the key role of mitochondria, we also determined the specific effects of BMAA on mitochondrial function and on inflammasome activation.BMAA induced extensive depletion of segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) that regulate gut immunity, thus triggering gut dysbiosis, immune cell migration, increased intestinal inflammation, loss of barrier integrity and caudo-rostral progression of aSyn. Additionally, BMAA induced <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> mitochondrial dysfunction with cardiolipin exposure and consequent activation of neuronal innate immunity. These events primed neuroinflammation, dopaminergic neuronal loss and motor deficits.Taken together, our results demonstrate that chronic exposure to dietary BMAA can trigger a chain of events that recapitulate the evolution of the PD pathology from the gut to the brain, which is consistent with 'gut-first' PD.",Gut,2023,A Raquel Esteves; Mário F Munoz-Pinto; Daniela Nunes-Costa; Emanuel Candeias; Diana F Silva; João D Magalhães; A Raquel Pereira-Santos; I Luisa Ferreira; Susana Alarico; Igor Tiago; Nuno Empadinhas; Sandra Morais Cardoso
34829694,Probiotic Enhancement of Antioxidant Capacity and Alterations of Gut Microbiota Composition in 6-Hydroxydopamin-Induced Parkinson's Disease Rats.,"Oxidative stress plays a key role in the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD), which may be aggravated by concomitant PD-associated gut dysbiosis. Probiotics and prebiotics are therapeutically relevant to these conditions due to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and gut microbiome modulation properties. However, the mechanisms by which probiotic/prebiotic supplementation affects antioxidant capacity and the gut microbiome in PD remains poorly characterized. In this study, we assessed the effects of a <i>Lactobacillus salivarius</i> AP-32 probiotic, a prebiotic (dried AP-32 culture medium supernatant), and a probiotic/prebiotic cocktail in rats with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced PD. The neuroprotective effects and levels of oxidative stress were evaluated after eight weeks of daily supplementation. Fecal microbiota composition was analyzed by fecal 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The supplements were associated with direct increases in host antioxidant enzyme activities and short-chain fatty acid production, protected dopaminergic neurons, and improved motor functions. The supplements also altered the fecal microbiota composition, and some specifically enriched commensal taxa correlated positively with superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase activity, indicating supplementation also promotes antioxidant activity via an indirect pathway. Therefore, <i>L. salivarius</i> AP-32 supplementation enhanced the activity of host antioxidant enzymes via direct and indirect modes of action in rats with 6-OHDA-induced PD.","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2021,Shu-Ping Tsao; Bira Arumndari Nurrahma; Ravi Kumar; Chieh-Hsi Wu; Tu-Hsueh Yeh; Ching-Chi Chiu; Yen-Peng Lee; Yi-Chi Liao; Cheng-Hsieh Huang; Yao-Tsung Yeh; Hui-Yu Huang
34789332,New perspectives on cytoskeletal dysregulation and mitochondrial mislocalization in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by selective, early degeneration of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. Motor neurons have long axonal projections, which rely on the integrity of neuronal cytoskeleton and mitochondria to regulate energy requirements for maintaining axonal stability, anterograde and retrograde transport, and signaling between neurons. The formation of protein aggregates which contain cytoskeletal proteins, and mitochondrial dysfunction both have devastating effects on the function of neurons and are shared pathological features across several neurodegenerative conditions, including ALS, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly clear that cytoskeletal integrity and mitochondrial function are intricately linked. Therefore, dysregulations of the cytoskeletal network and mitochondrial homeostasis and localization, may be common pathways in the initial steps of neurodegeneration. Here we review and discuss known contributors, including variants in genetic loci and aberrant protein activities, which modify cytoskeletal integrity, axonal transport and mitochondrial localization in ALS and have overlapping features with other neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, we explore some emerging pathways that may contribute to this disruption in ALS.",Translational neurodegeneration,2021,Frances Theunissen; Phillip K West; Samuel Brennan; Bojan Petrović; Kosar Hooshmand; P Anthony Akkari; Matt Keon; Boris Guennewig
34776854,Changes in the Gut Microbiome and Predicted Functional Metabolic Effects in an Australian Parkinson's Disease Cohort.,"<b>Background:</b> There has been increasing recognition of the importance of the gut microbiome in Parkinson's disease (PD), but the influence of geographic location has received little attention. The present study characterized the gut microbiota and associated changes in host metabolic pathways in an Australian cohort of people with PD (PwP). <b>Methods:</b> The study involved recruitment and assessment of 87 PwP from multiple Movement Disorders Clinics in Australia and 47 healthy controls. Illumina sequencing of the V3 and V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene was used to distinguish inter-cohort differences in gut microbiota; KEGG analysis was subsequently performed to predict functional changes in host metabolic pathways. <b>Results:</b> The current findings identified significant differences in relative abundance and diversity of microbial operational taxonomic units (OTUs), and specific bacterial taxa between PwP and control groups. Alpha diversity was significantly reduced in PwP when compared to controls. Differences were found in two phyla (Synergistetes and Proteobacteria; both increased in PwP), and five genera (C<i>olidextribacter, Intestinibacter, Kineothrix, Agathobaculum</i>, and <i>Roseburia</i>; all decreased in PwP). Within the PD cohort, there was no association identified between microbial composition and gender, constipation or use of gastrointestinal medication. Furthermore, KEGG analysis identified 15 upregulated and 11 downregulated metabolic pathways which were predicted to be significantly altered in PwP. <b>Conclusion:</b> This study provides the first comprehensive characterization of the gut microbiome and predicted functional metabolic effects in a southern hemisphere PD population, further exploring the possible mechanisms whereby the gut microbiota may exert their influence on this disease, and providing evidence for the incorporation of such data in future individualized therapeutic strategies.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2021,Jade E Kenna; Eng Guan Chua; Megan Bakeberg; Alfred Tay; Sarah McGregor; Anastazja Gorecki; Malcolm Horne; Barry Marshall; Frank L Mastaglia; Ryan S Anderton
34704023,Gut microbiome alpha-diversity is not a marker of Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis.,"The gut-brain axis may play a central role in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders. Dozens of case-control studies have been carried out to identify bacterial markers by the use of targeted metagenomics. Alterations of several taxonomic profiles have been confirmed across several populations, however, no consensus has been made regarding alpha-diversity. A recent publication has described and validated a novel method based on richness and evenness measures of the gut microbiome in order to reduce the complexity and multiplicity of alpha-diversity indices. We used these recently described richness and evenness composite measures to investigate the potential link between gut microbiome alpha-diversity and neurological disorders and to determine to what extent it could be used as a marker to diagnose neurological disorders from stool samples. We performed an exhaustive review of the literature to identify original published clinical studies including 16S rRNA gene sequencing on Parkinson's disease, multiple Sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. Richness and evenness factors loadings were quantified from sequencing files in addition with the Shannon diversity index. For each disease, we performed a meta-analysis comparing the indices between patients and healthy controls. Seven studies were meta-analysed for Parkinson's disease, corresponding to 1067 subjects (631 Parkinson's Disease/436 healthy controls). Five studies were meta-analysed for multiple sclerosis, corresponding to 303 subjects (164 Multiple Sclerosis/139 healthy controls). For Alzheimer's disease, the meta-analysis was not done as only two studies matched our criteria. Neither richness nor evenness was significantly altered in Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis patients in comparison to healthy controls (<i>P</i>-value > 0.05). Shannon index was neither associated with neurological disorders (<i>P</i>-value > 0.05). After adjusting for age and sex, none of the alpha-diversity measures were associated with Parkinson's Disease. This is the first report investigating systematically alpha-diversity and its potential link to neurological disorders. Our study has demonstrated that unlike in other gastro-intestinal, immune and metabolic disorders, loss of bacterial diversity is not associated with Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis.",Brain communications,2021,Jonathan Plassais; Guillaume Gbikpi-Benissan; Marine Figarol; Filip Scheperjans; Guy Gorochov; Pascal Derkinderen; Alessandra C L Cervino
34650532,Cross-Sectional Study on the Gut Microbiome of Parkinson's Disease Patients in Central China.,"Gastrointestinal dysfunction plays an important role in the occurrence and development of Parkinson's disease (PD). This study investigates the composition of the gut microbiome using shotgun metagenomic sequencing in PD patients in central China. Fecal samples from 39 PD patients (PD group) and the corresponding 39 healthy spouses of the patients (SP) were collected for shotgun metagenomics sequencing. Results showed a significantly altered microbial composition in the PD patients. <i>Bilophila wadsworthia</i> enrichment was found in the gut microbiome of PD patients, which has not been reported in previous studies. The random forest (RF) model, which identifies differences in microbiomes, reliably discriminated patients with PD from controls; the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.803. Further analysis of the microbiome and clinical symptoms showed that <i>Klebsiella</i> and <i>Parasutterella</i> were positively correlated with the duration and severity of PD, whereas hydrogen-generating <i>Prevotella</i> was negatively correlated with disease severity. The Cluster of Orthologous Groups of protein database, the KEGG Orthology database, and the carbohydrate-active enzymes of gene-category analysis showed that branched-chain amino acid-related proteins were significantly increased, and GH43 was significantly reduced in the PD group. Functional analysis of the metagenome confirmed differences in microbiome metabolism in the PD group related to short-chain fatty acid precursor metabolism.",Frontiers in microbiology,2021,Liangwei Mao; Yu Zhang; Jing Tian; Ming Sang; Guimin Zhang; Yuling Zhou; Puqing Wang
34576191,The Role of Gut Microbiota and Gut-Brain Interplay in Selected Diseases of the Central Nervous System.,"The gut microbiome has attracted increasing attention from researchers in recent years. The microbiota can have a specific and complex cross-talk with the host, particularly with the central nervous system (CNS), creating the so-called ""gut-brain axis"". Communication between the gut, intestinal microbiota, and the brain involves the secretion of various metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), structural components of bacteria, and signaling molecules. Moreover, an imbalance in the gut microbiota composition modulates the immune system and function of tissue barriers such as the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Therefore, the aim of this literature review is to describe how the gut-brain interplay may contribute to the development of various neurological disorders, combining the fields of gastroenterology and neuroscience. We present recent findings concerning the effect of the altered microbiota on neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, as well as multiple sclerosis. Moreover, the impact of the pathological shift in the microbiome on selected neuropsychological disorders, i.e., major depressive disorders (MDD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), is also discussed. Future research on the effect of balanced gut microbiota composition on the gut-brain axis would help to identify new potential opportunities for therapeutic interventions in the presented diseases.",International journal of molecular sciences,2021,Julia Doroszkiewicz; Magdalena Groblewska; Barbara Mroczko
34576000,"Nuclear and Mitochondrial Genome, Epigenome and Gut Microbiome: Emerging Molecular Biomarkers for Parkinson's Disease.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is currently the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, burdening about 10 million elderly individuals worldwide. The multifactorial nature of PD poses a difficult obstacle for understanding the mechanisms involved in its onset and progression. Currently, diagnosis depends on the appearance of clinical signs, some of which are shared among various neurologic disorders, hindering early diagnosis. There are no effective tools to prevent PD onset, detect the disease in early stages or accurately report the risk of disease progression. Hence, there is an increasing demand for biomarkers that may identify disease onset and progression, as treatment-based medicine may not be the best approach for PD. Over the last few decades, the search for molecular markers to predict susceptibility, aid in accurate diagnosis and evaluate the progress of PD have intensified, but strategies aimed to improve individualized patient care have not yet been established.Genomic variation, regulation by epigenomic mechanisms, as well as the influence of the host gut microbiome seem to have a crucial role in the onset and progress of PD, thus are considered potential biomarkers. As such, the human nuclear and mitochondrial genome, epigenome, and the host gut microbiome might be the key elements to the rise of personalized medicine for PD patients.",International journal of molecular sciences,2021,Gleyce Fonseca Cabral; Ana Paula Schaan; Giovanna C Cavalcante; Camille Sena-Dos-Santos; Tatiane Piedade de Souza; Natacha M Souza Port's; Jhully Azevedo Dos Santos Pinheiro; Ândrea Ribeiro-Dos-Santos; Amanda F Vidal
34422879,Memorable Food: Fighting Age-Related Neurodegeneration by Precision Nutrition.,"Healthcare systems worldwide are seriously challenged by a rising prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), which mostly, but not exclusively, affect the ever-growing population of the elderly. The most known neurodegenerative diseases are Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, but some viral infections of the brain and traumatic brain injury may also cause NDD. Typical for NDD are the malfunctioning of neurons and their irreversible loss, which often progress irreversibly to dementia and ultimately to death. Numerous factors are involved in the pathogenesis of NDD: genetic variability, epigenetic changes, extent of oxidative/nitrosative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and DNA damage. The complex interplay of all the above-mentioned factors may be a fingerprint of neurodegeneration, with different diseases being affected to different extents by particular factors. There is a voluminous body of evidence showing the benefits of regular exercise to brain health and cognitive functions. Moreover, the importance of a healthy diet, balanced in macro- and micro-nutrients, in preventing neurodegeneration and slowing down a progression to full-blown disease is evident. Individuals affected by NDD almost inevitably have low-grade inflammation and anomalies in lipid metabolism. Metabolic and lipid profiles in NDD can be improved by the Mediterranean diet. Many studies have associated the Mediterranean diet with a decreased risk of dementia and AD, but a cause-and-effect relationship has not been deduced. Studies with caloric restriction showed neuroprotective effects in animal models, but the results in humans are inconsistent. The pathologies of NDD are complex and there is a great inter-individual (epi)genetic variance within any population. Furthermore, the gut microbiome, being deeply involved in nutrient uptake and lipid metabolism, also represents a pillar of the gut microbiome-brain axis and is linked with the pathogenesis of NDD. Numerous studies on the role of different micronutrients (omega-3 fatty acids, bioactive polyphenols from fruit and medicinal plants) in the prevention, prediction, and treatment of NDD have been conducted, but we are still far away from a personalized diet plan for individual NDD patients. For this to be realized, large-scale cohorts that would include the precise monitoring of food intake, mapping of genetic variants, epigenetic data, microbiome studies, and metabolome, lipidome, and transcriptome data are needed.",Frontiers in nutrition,2021,Maja Milošević; Aleksandra Arsić; Zorica Cvetković; Vesna Vučić
34422393,"A discussion of the gut microbiome's development, determinants, and dysbiosis in cancers of the esophagus and stomach.","The microbiome refers to a population of microbes that colonize the skin, nasopharynx, oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, and urogenital tract. The human microbiome consists of bacteria, archaea, fungi, viruses, and phages. Recent advances in genomic sequencing have catalyzed a deeper understanding of complex microbe-microbe and host-microbe interactions. Dysregulation of these interactions, or dysbiosis of the gastrointestinal tract, has been implicated in a growing list of pathologies including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, depression, Parkinson's disease, autism, and various gastrointestinal cancers. Gastric and esophageal cancer, for example, continue to remain as two of the most common causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, therefore there is an increased emphasis on investigating the role of dysbiosis on these cancers. In this review, we discuss the development and structure of the gut microbiome, its homeostatic and dysbiotic mechanisms, and the key microbes in esophageal and gastric carcinogenesis with a focus on bacterial biology. Further clarification of these pathways and discovery of diagnostic or therapeutic targets could have broad impacts on global subpopulations. It is important to understand the nature of the gastrointestinal tract microbiome and its potentional risk factors for dysbiosis in order to tailor its application to the individual patient and create an era of highly personalized, precision medicine.",Journal of gastrointestinal oncology,2021,Karan Grover; Stephanie Gregory; John F Gibbs; Nancy J Emenaker
34408160,Exploring human-genome gut-microbiome interaction in Parkinson's disease.,"The causes of complex diseases remain an enigma despite decades of epidemiologic research on environmental risks and genome-wide studies that have uncovered tens or hundreds of susceptibility loci for each disease. We hypothesize that the microbiome is the missing link. Genetic studies have shown that overexpression of alpha-synuclein, a key pathological protein in Parkinson's disease (PD), can cause familial PD and variants at alpha-synuclein locus confer risk of idiopathic PD. Recently, dysbiosis of gut microbiome in PD was identified: altered abundances of three microbial clusters were found, one of which was composed of opportunistic pathogens. Using two large datasets, we found evidence that the overabundance of opportunistic pathogens in PD gut is influenced by the host genotype at the alpha-synuclein locus, and that the variants responsible modulate alpha-synuclein expression. Results put forth testable hypotheses on the role of gut microbiome in the pathogenesis of PD, the incomplete penetrance of PD susceptibility genes, and potential triggers of pathology in the gut.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2021,Zachary D Wallen; William J Stone; Stewart A Factor; Eric Molho; Cyrus P Zabetian; David G Standaert; Haydeh Payami

But in recent decades, compelling evidence has led the scientific community to place a greater emphasis on the role of gut microbes on the brain. Pathological observations and early gastrointestinal symptoms highlighted that gut dysbiosis likely precedes the onset of cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. The delicate balance in the number and functions of pathogenic microbes and alternative probiotic populations is critical in the modulation of systemic inflammation and neuronal health. However, there is limited success in restoring healthy microbial biodiversity in AD and PD patients with general probiotics interventions and fecal microbial therapies. Fortunately, the gut microflora is susceptible to long-term extrinsic influences such as lifestyle and dietary choices, providing opportunities for treatment through comparatively individual-specific control of human behavior. In this review, we examine the impact of restrictive diets on the gut microbiome populations associated with AD and PD. The overall evidence presented supports that gut dysbiosis is a plausible prelude to disease onset, and early dietary interventions are likely beneficial for the prevention and treatment of progressive neurodegenerative diseases.","Life (Basel, Switzerland)",2021,Li Yang Tan; Xin Yi Yeo; Han-Gyu Bae; Delia Pei Shan Lee; Roger C Ho; Jung Eun Kim; Dong-Gyu Jo; Sangyong Jung
34346706,Gut Microbiome and Serum Metabolome Alterations Associated with Isolated Dystonia.,"Dystonia is a complex neurological movement disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions. Increasing studies implicate the microbiome as a possible key susceptibility factor for neurological disorders, but the relationship between the gut microbiota and dystonia remains poorly explored. Here, the gut microbiota of 57 patients with isolated dystonia and 27 age- and environment-matched healthy controls was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Further, integrative analysis of the gut microbiome and serum metabolome measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was performed. No difference in α-diversity was found, while β-diversity was significantly different, with a more heterogeneous community structure among dystonia patients than among controls. The most significant changes in dystonia highlighted an increase in <i>Clostridiales</i>, including Blautia obeum, Dorea longicatena, and Eubacterium hallii, and a reduction in Bacteroides vulgatus and Bacteroides plebeius. The functional analysis revealed that genes related to tryptophan and purine biosynthesis were more abundant in gut microbiota from patients with dystonia, while genes linked to citrate cycle, vitamin B<sub>6</sub>, and glycan metabolism were less abundant. The evaluation of serum metabolites revealed altered levels of l-glutamic acid, taurine, and d-tyrosine, suggesting changes in neurotransmitter metabolism. The most modified metabolites strongly inversely correlated with the abundance of members belonging to the <i>Clostridiales</i>, revealing the effect of the gut microbiota on neurometabolic activity. This study is the first to reveal gut microbial dysbiosis in patients with isolated dystonia and identified potential links between gut microbiota and serum neurotransmitters, providing new insight into the pathogenesis of isolated dystonia. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Dystonia is the third most common movement disorder after essential tremor and Parkinson's disease. However, the cause for the majority of cases is not known. This is the first study so far that reveals significant alterations of gut microbiome and correlates the alteration of serum metabolites with gut dysbiosis in patients with isolated dystonia. We demonstrated a general overrepresentation of <i>Clostridiales</i> and underrepresentation of <i>Bacteroidetes</i> in patients with dystonia in comparison with healthy controls. The functional analysis found that genes related to the biosynthesis of tryptophan, which is the precursor of the neurotransmitter serotonin, were more active in isolated dystonia patients. Altered levels of several serum metabolites were found to be associated with microbial changes, such as d-tyrosine, taurine, and glutamate, indicating differences in neurotransmitter metabolism in isolated dystonia. Integrative analysis suggests that neurotransmitter system dysfunction may be a possible pathway by which the gut microbiome participates in the development of dystonia. The gut microbiome changes provide new insight into the pathogenesis of dystonia, suggesting new potential therapeutic directions.",mSphere,2021,Lingyan Ma; Jing Keng; Min Cheng; Hua Pan; Bo Feng; Yongfeng Hu; Tao Feng; Fan Yang

Recently, there has been a growing focus on the relationship between the gut and the development of PD. Emerging to the forefront, an interesting concept has developed suggesting that the initial pathophysiological changes occur in the gastrointestinal tract before changes are seen within the brain. This review is aimed at highlighting the relationship between PD and the gastrointestinal tract, along with the supporting evidence for this. Firstly, we will focus on the gastrointestinal conditions and symptoms which commonly affects patients, including both upper and lower gastrointestinal issues. Secondly, the impact of nutrition and diet on neurological health and PD physiology, with particular emphasis on commonly consumed items including macronutrients and micronutrients. Finally, variability of the gut microbiome will also be discussed and its link with both the symptoms and signs of PD.

34171417,The neuromicrobiology of Parkinson's disease: A unifying theory.,"Recent evidence confirms that PD is indeed a multifactorial disease with different aetiologies and prodromal symptomatology that likely depend on the initial trigger. New players with important roles as triggers, facilitators and aggravators of the PD neurodegenerative process have re-emerged in the last few years, the microbes. Having evolved in association with humans for ages, microbes and their products are now seen as fundamental regulators of human physiology with disturbances in their balance being increasingly accepted to have a relevant impact on the progression of disease in general and on PD in particular. In this review, we comprehensively address early studies that have directly or indirectly linked bacteria or other infectious agents to the onset and progression of PD, from the earliest suspects to the most recent culprits, the gut microbiota. The quest for effective treatments to arrest PD progression must inevitably address the different interactions between microbiota and human cells, and naturally consider the gut-brain axis. The comprehensive characterization of such mechanisms will help design innovative bacteriotherapeutic approaches to selectively shape the gut microbiota profile ultimately to halt PD progression. The present review describes our current understanding of the role of microorganisms and their endosymbiotic relatives, the mitochondria, in inducing, facilitating, or aggravating PD pathogenesis.",Ageing research reviews,2021,Mario F Munoz-Pinto; Nuno Empadinhas; Sandra M Cardoso

Important limitations of this work include small sample sizes and low-resolution taxonomic markers. Accordingly, we studied 162 gut microbiomes of mild and severe Graves' disease (GD) patients and healthy controls. Taxonomic and functional analyses based on metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) and MAG-annotated genes, together with predicted metabolic functions and metabolite profiles, revealed a well-defined network of MAGs, genes and clinical indexes separating healthy from GD subjects. A supervised classification model identified a combination of biomarkers including microbial species, MAGs, genes and SNPs, with predictive power superior to models from any single biomarker type (AUC = 0.98). Global, cross-disease multi-cohort analysis of gut microbiomes revealed high specificity of these GD biomarkers, notably discriminating against Parkinson's Disease, and suggesting that non-invasive stool-based diagnostics will be useful for these diseases.",The ISME journal,2021,Qiyun Zhu; Qiangchuan Hou; Shi Huang; Qianying Ou; Dongxue Huo; Yoshiki Vázquez-Baeza; Chaoping Cen; Victor Cantu; Mehrbod Estaki; Haibo Chang; Pedro Belda-Ferre; Ho-Cheol Kim; Kaining Chen; Rob Knight; Jiachao Zhang

In addition to genetics, some environmental factors may exert vital parts in PD occurrence as well. At present, more and more studies are conducted to elucidate the association between gut microbial dysbiosis and the incidence of PD. Gut microbial dysbiosis has a certain effect on both the central nervous system (CNS) and the enteric nervous system (ENS), which indicates that there is a gut-microbiota-brain axis that induces CNS disorders. Some gut microbial strains are suggested to suppress or weaken the neuroinflammation- and gut-inflammation-immune responses, which suggests the protective and pathogenic effects of certain gut microbial species on PD progression. Therefore, gut microbiome may contain plenty of targets for preventing and managing PD. Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) may serve as a direct and useful treatment for PD in the future. Nonetheless, there is little available scientific research in this field. The present work reviewed the latest research to examine the association of gut microbiota with PD, and the future prospects of FMT treatment.",ASN neuro,2021,Yongbo Kang; Xing Kang; Hongfang Zhang; Qingqing Liu; Hao Yang; Weiping Fan
34034646,Comparison study of differential abundance testing methods using two large Parkinson disease gut microbiome datasets derived from 16S amplicon sequencing.,"Testing for differential abundance of microbes in disease is a common practice in microbiome studies. Numerous differential abundance (DA) testing methods exist and range from traditional statistical tests to methods designed for microbiome data. Comparison studies of DA testing methods have been performed, but none performed on microbiome datasets collected for the study of real, complex disease. Due to this, DA testing was performed here using various DA methods in two large, uniformly collected gut microbiome datasets on Parkinson disease (PD), and their results compared.Overall, 78-92% of taxa tested were detected as differentially abundant by at least one method, while 5-22% were called differentially abundant by the majority of methods (depending on dataset and filtering of taxonomic data prior to testing). Concordances between method results ranged from 1 to 100%. Average concordance for datasets 1 and 2 were 24% and 28% respectively, and 27% for replicated DA signatures. Concordances increased when removing rarer taxa before testing, increasing average concordances by 2-32%. Certain methods consistently resulted in higher concordances (e.g. ANCOM-BC, LEfSe), while others consistently resulted in lower (e.g. edgeR, fitZIG). Hierarchical clustering revealed three groups of DA signatures that were (1) replicated by the majority of methods on average and included taxa previously associated with PD, (2) replicated by a subset of methods and included taxa largely enriched in PD, and (3) replicated by few to one method(s).Differential abundance tests yielded varied concordances, and amounts of detected DA signatures. Some methods were more concordant than others on both filtered and unfiltered data, therefore, if consistency with other study methodology is a key goal, one might choose among these methods. Even still, using one method on one dataset may find true associations, but may also detect false positives. To help lower false positives, one might analyze data with two or more DA methods to gauge concordance, and use a built-in replication dataset. This study will hopefully serve to complement previously reported DA method comparison studies by implementing and coalescing a large number of both previously and yet to be compared methods on two real gut microbiome datasets.",BMC bioinformatics,2021,Zachary D Wallen

Although SARS-CoV-2 infections are not more prevalent in Parkinson's disease patients, a higher mortality rate has been reported not only associated with older age and longer disease duration, but also through several mechanisms, such as interactions with the brain dopaminergic system and through systemic inflammatory responses. Indeed, a number of the neurological symptoms seen in COVID-19 patients, as well as the alterations in the gut microbiome, are also prevalent in patients with Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, biochemical pathways such as oxidative stress, inflammation, and protein aggregation have shared commonalities between Parkinson's disease and COVID-19 disease progression.

33968794,Review: The Role of Intestinal Dysbiosis in Parkinson's Disease.,"Several studies have highlighted the roles played by the gut microbiome in central nervous system diseases. Clinical symptoms and neuropathology have suggested that Parkinson's disease may originate in the gut, which is home to approximately 100 trillion microbes. Alterations in the gastrointestinal microbiota populations may promote the development and progression of Parkinson's disease. Here, we reviewed existing studies that have explored the role of intestinal dysbiosis in Parkinson's disease, focusing on the roles of microbiota, their metabolites, and components in inflammation, barrier failure, microglial activation, and α-synuclein pathology. We conclude that there are intestinal dysbiosis in Parkinson's disease. Intestinal dysbiosis is likely involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease through mechanisms that include barrier destruction, inflammation and oxidative stress, decreased dopamine production, and molecular mimicry. Additional studies remain necessary to explore and verify the mechanisms through which dysbiosis may cause or promote Parkinson's disease. Preclinical studies have shown that gastrointestinal microbial therapy may represent an effective and novel treatment for Parkinson's disease; however, more studies, especially clinical studies, are necessary to explore the curative effects of microbial therapy in Parkinson's disease.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2021,Yiying Huang; Jinchi Liao; Xu Liu; Yunxiao Zhong; Xiaodong Cai; Ling Long

33899052,Gut Microbiome Changes with Osteopathic Treatment of Constipation in Parkinson's Disease: A Pilot Study.,"The gut microbiome appears to be predictive of Parkinson's disease (PD) with constipation. Chronic constipation frequently manifests prior to motor symptoms and impairs quality of life. An osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM) sequence used physical exam assessment and manual treatment of neuromusculoskeletal dysfunctions pertinent to constipation in PD for this prospective ABA-design study, IRB-NYITBHS1065. The effects of 4 weekly treatments on the gut microbiome among men and women over 40 years old with chronic constipation and PD were investigated. Severity of PD was rated with the Movement Disorders Society-Unified PD rating scale (UPDRS) in six subjects with constipation. Also, the Bristol stool scale and questionnaires validated for constipation were administered for diagnosis, symptom severity, and quality of life during a 4-week control-period (A), 4-weekly OMM-treatments (B), and 2-weeks no-intervention (A). Biweekly stool samples were assessed for normalized microbiota abundance.The mean Bristol rating improved from type 2 (± 1) Pre-OMM to 3 (± 1; p = .167; d = 0.677) Post-OMM. Mean constipation severity significantly decreased (p = .010; d = 1.508) Post-OMM. Mean quality of life significantly improved (p = .041; d = 1.072) Post-OMM. The Pre-OMM mean number of families within the phylum Firmicutes decreased by 3 (p = .043; d = 1.177) Post-OMM.

33819374,"Trimethylamine modulates dauer formation, neurodegeneration, and lifespan through tyra-3/daf-11 signaling in Caenorhabditis elegans.","In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, signals derived from bacteria in the diet, the animal's major nutrient source, can modulate both behavior and healthspan. Here we describe a dual role for trimethylamine (TMA), a human gut flora metabolite, which acts as a nutrient signal and a neurotoxin. TMA and its associated metabolites are produced by the human gut microbiome and have been suggested to serve as risk biomarkers for diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. We demonstrate that the tyramine receptor TYRA-3, a conserved G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), is required to sense TMA and mediate its responses. TMA activates guanylyl cyclase DAF-11 signaling through TYRA-3 in amphid neurons (ASK) and ciliated neurons (BAG) to mediate food-sensing behavior. Bacterial mutants deficient in TMA production enhance dauer formation, extend lifespan, and are less preferred as a food source. Increased levels of TMA lead to neural damage in models of Parkinson's disease and shorten lifespan. Our results reveal conserved signaling pathways modulated by TMA in C. elegans that are likely to be relevant for its effects in mammalian systems.",Aging cell,2021,Amit Khanna; Durai Sellegounder; Jitendra Kumar; Manish Chamoli; Miguel Vargas; Shankar J Chinta; Anand Rane; Christopher Nelson; T Harshani Peiris; Rachel Brem; Julie Andersen; Gordon Lithgow; Pankaj Kapahi

It is now acknowledged that neurological disorders are multi-factorial involving disruptions in multiple cellular systems. While each disorder has specific initiating mechanisms and pathologies, certain common pathways appear to be involved in most, if not all, neurological disorders. Thus, it is becoming increasingly important to identify compounds that can modulate the multiple pathways that contribute to disease development or progression. One of these compounds is the flavonol fisetin. Fisetin has now been shown in preclinical models to be effective at preventing the development and/or progression of multiple neurological disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, stroke (both ischemic and hemorrhagic) and traumatic brain injury as well as to reduce age-associated changes in the brain. These beneficial effects stem from its actions on multiple pathways associated with the different neurological disorders. These actions include its well characterized anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects as well as more recently described effects on the regulated cell death oxytosis/ferroptosis pathway, the gut microbiome and its senolytic activity. Therefore, the growing body of pre-clinical data, along with fisetin's ability to modulate a large number of pathways associated with brain dysfunction, strongly suggest that it would be worthwhile to pursue its therapeutic effects in humans.","Brain plasticity (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2021,Pamela Maher
33717189,Microbiome or Infections: Amyloid-Containing Biofilms as a Trigger for Complex Human Diseases.,"The human microbiota is the community of microorganisms that live upon or within their human host. The microbiota consists of various microorganisms including bacteria, fungi, viruses, and archaea; the gut microbiota is comprised mostly of bacteria. Many bacterial species within the gut microbiome grow as biofilms, which are multicellular communities embedded in an extracellular matrix. Studies have shown that the relative abundances of bacterial species, and therefore biofilms and bacterial byproducts, change during progression of a variety of human diseases including gastrointestinal, autoimmune, neurodegenerative, and cancer. Studies have shown the location and proximity of the biofilms within the gastrointestinal tract might impact disease outcome. Gram-negative enteric bacteria secrete the amyloid curli, which makes up as much as 85% of the extracellular matrix of enteric biofilms. Curli mediates cell-cell attachment and attachment to various surfaces including extracellular matrix components such as fibronectin and laminin. Structurally, curli is strikingly similar to pathological and immunomodulatory human amyloids such as amyloid-β, which has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease, α-synuclein, which is involved in Parkinson's disease, and serum amyloid A, which is secreted during the acute phase of inflammation. The immune system recognizes both bacterial amyloid curli and human amyloids utilizing the same receptors, so curli also induces inflammation. Moreover, recent work indicates that curli can participate in the self-assembly process of pathological human amyloids. Curli is found within biofilms of commensal enteric bacteria as well as invasive pathogens; therefore, evidence suggests that curli contributes to complex human diseases. In this review, we summarize the recent findings on how bacterial biofilms containing curli participate in the pathological and immunological processes in gastrointestinal diseases, systemic autoimmune diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases.",Frontiers in immunology,2021,Amanda L Miller; Shingo Bessho; Kaitlyn Grando; Çagla Tükel
33692356,Meta-analysis of the Parkinson's disease gut microbiome suggests alterations linked to intestinal inflammation.,"The gut microbiota is emerging as an important modulator of neurodegenerative diseases, and accumulating evidence has linked gut microbes to Parkinson's disease (PD) symptomatology and pathophysiology. PD is often preceded by gastrointestinal symptoms and alterations of the enteric nervous system accompany the disease. Several studies have analyzed the gut microbiome in PD, but a consensus on the features of the PD-specific microbiota is missing. Here, we conduct a meta-analysis re-analyzing the ten currently available 16S microbiome datasets to investigate whether common alterations in the gut microbiota of PD patients exist across cohorts. We found significant alterations in the PD-associated microbiome, which are robust to study-specific technical heterogeneities, although differences in microbiome structure between PD and controls are small. Enrichment of the genera Lactobacillus, Akkermansia, and Bifidobacterium and depletion of bacteria belonging to the Lachnospiraceae family and the Faecalibacterium genus, both important short-chain fatty acids producers, emerged as the most consistent PD gut microbiome alterations. This dysbiosis might result in a pro-inflammatory status which could be linked to the recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms affecting PD patients.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2021,Stefano Romano; George M Savva; Janis R Bedarf; Ian G Charles; Falk Hildebrand; Arjan Narbad
33669008,"The Role of Gut Bacterial Metabolites in Brain Development, Aging and Disease.","In the last decade, emerging evidence has reported correlations between the gut microbiome and human health and disease, including those affecting the brain. We performed a systematic assessment of the available literature focusing on gut bacterial metabolites and their associations with diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). The bacterial metabolites short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) as well as non-SCFAs like amino acid metabolites (AAMs) and bacterial amyloids are described in particular. We found significantly altered SCFA levels in patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), affective disorders, multiple sclerosis (MS) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Non-SCFAs yielded less significantly distinct changes in faecal levels of patients and healthy controls, with the majority of findings were derived from urinary and blood samples. Preclinical studies have implicated different bacterial metabolites with potentially beneficial as well as detrimental mechanisms in brain diseases. Examples include immunomodulation and changes in catecholamine production by histone deacetylase inhibition, anti-inflammatory effects through activity on the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and involvement in protein misfolding. Overall, our findings highlight the existence of altered bacterial metabolites in patients across various brain diseases, as well as potential neuroactive effects by which gut-derived SCFAs, p-cresol, indole derivatives and bacterial amyloids could impact disease development and progression. The findings summarized in this review could lead to further insights into the gut-brain-axis and thus into potential diagnostic, therapeutic or preventive strategies in brain diseases.",Nutrients,2021,Shirley Mei-Sin Tran; M Hasan Mohajeri
33657381,Systematic analysis of gut microbiome reveals the role of bacterial folate and homocysteine metabolism in Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common progressive neurological disorder compromising motor functions. However, nonmotor symptoms, such as gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction, precede those affecting movement. Evidence of an early involvement of the GI tract and enteric nervous system highlights the need for better understanding of the role of gut microbiota in GI complications in PD. Here, we investigate the gut microbiome of patients with PD using metagenomics and serum metabolomics. We integrate these data using metabolic modeling and construct an integrative correlation network giving insight into key microbial species linked with disease severity, GI dysfunction, and age of patients with PD. Functional analysis reveals an increased microbial capability to degrade mucin and host glycans in PD. Personalized community-level metabolic modeling reveals the microbial contribution to folate deficiency and hyperhomocysteinemia observed in patients with PD. The metabolic modeling approach could be applied to uncover gut microbial metabolic contributions to PD pathophysiology.",Cell reports,2021,Dorines Rosario; Gholamreza Bidkhori; Sunjae Lee; Janis Bedarf; Falk Hildebrand; Emmanuelle Le Chatelier; Mathias Uhlen; Stanislav Dusko Ehrlich; Gordon Proctor; Ullrich Wüllner; Adil Mardinoglu; Saeed Shoaie
33517890,Gut microbiota-derived propionate mediates the neuroprotective effect of osteocalcin in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with no absolute cure. The evidence of the involvement of gut microbiota in PD pathogenesis suggests the need to identify certain molecule(s) derived from the gut microbiota, which has the potential to manage PD. Osteocalcin (OCN), an osteoblast-secreted protein, has been shown to modulate brain function. Thus, it is of interest to investigate whether OCN could exert protective effect on PD and, if yes, whether the underlying mechanism lies in the subsequent changes in gut microbiota.The intraperitoneal injection of OCN can effectively ameliorate the motor deficits and dopaminergic neuronal loss in a 6-hydroxydopamine-induced PD mouse model. The further antibiotics treatment and fecal microbiota transplantation experiments confirmed that the gut microbiota was required for OCN-induced protection in PD mice. OCN elevated Bacteroidetes and depleted Firmicutes phyla in the gut microbiota of PD mice with elevated potential of microbial propionate production and was confirmed by fecal propionate levels. Two months of orally administered propionate successfully rescued motor deficits and dopaminergic neuronal loss in PD mice. Furthermore, AR420626, the agonist of FFAR3, which is the receptor of propionate, mimicked the neuroprotective effects of propionate and the ablation of enteric neurons blocked the prevention of dopaminergic neuronal loss by propionate in PD mice.Together, our results demonstrate that OCN ameliorates motor deficits and dopaminergic neuronal loss in PD mice, modulating gut microbiome and increasing propionate level might be an underlying mechanism responsible for the neuroprotective effects of OCN on PD, and the FFAR3, expressed in enteric nervous system, might be the main action site of propionate.

Of particular interest is the gut/microbiome-liver-brain axis for parsing out how genetic and environmental factors contribute to NDs. We have developed a mesofluidic platform technology to study gut-liver-cerebral interactions in the context of Parkinson's disease (PD). It connects microphysiological systems (MPSs) of the primary human gut and liver with a human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cerebral MPS in a systemically circulated common culture medium containing CD4<sup>+</sup> regulatory T and T helper 17 cells. We demonstrate this approach using a patient-derived cerebral MPS carrying the PD-causing A53T mutation, gaining two important findings: (i) that systemic interaction enhances features of in vivo-like behavior of cerebral MPSs, and (ii) that microbiome-associated short-chain fatty acids increase expression of pathology-associated pathways in PD.",Science advances,2021,Martin Trapecar; Emile Wogram; Devon Svoboda; Catherine Communal; Attya Omer; Tenzin Lungjangwa; Pierre Sphabmixay; Jason Velazquez; Kirsten Schneider; Charles W Wright; Samuel Mildrum; Austin Hendricks; Stuart Levine; Julien Muffat; Meelim Jasmine Lee; Douglas A Lauffenburger; David Trumper; Rudolf Jaenisch; Linda G Griffith

33422110,The impact of dextran sodium sulphate and probiotic pre-treatment in a murine model of Parkinson's disease.,"Recent work has established that Parkinson's disease (PD) patients have an altered gut microbiome, along with signs of intestinal inflammation. This could help explain the high degree of gastric disturbances in PD patients, as well as potentially be linked to the migration of peripheral inflammatory factors into the brain. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine microbiome alteration prior to the induction of a PD murine model.We presently assessed whether pre-treatment with the probiotic, VSL #3, or the inflammatory inducer, dextran sodium sulphate (DSS), would influence the PD-like pathology provoked by a dual hit toxin model using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and paraquat exposure.While VSL #3 has been reported to have anti-inflammatory effects, DSS is often used as a model of colitis because of the gut inflammation and the breach of the intestinal barrier that it induces. We found that VSL#3 did not have any significant effects (beyond a blunting of LPS paraquat-induced weight loss). However, the DSS treatment caused marked changes in the gut microbiome and was also associated with augmented behavioral and inflammatory outcomes. In fact, DSS markedly increased taxa belonging to the Bacteroidaceae and Porphyromonadaceae families but reduced those from Rikencellaceae and S24-7, as well as provoking colonic pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, consistent with an inflamed gut. The DSS also increased the impact of LPS plus paraquat upon microglial morphology, along with circulating lipocalin-2 (neutrophil marker) and IL-6. Yet, neither DSS nor VSL#3 influenced the loss of substantia nigra dopamine neurons or the astrocytic and cytoskeleton remodeling protein changes that were provoked by the LPS followed by paraquat treatment.These data suggest that disruption of the intestinal integrity and the associated microbiome can interact with systemic inflammatory events to promote widespread brain-gut changes that could be relevant for PD and at the very least, suggestive of novel neuro-immune communication.",Journal of neuroinflammation,2021,Zach Dwyer; Melany Chaiquin; Jeffrey Landrigan; Kiara Ayoub; Pragya Shail; Julianna Rocha; Christie L Childers; Kenneth B Storey; Dana J Philpott; Hongyu Sun; Shawn Hayley
33416892,Effects of dietary restriction on neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases.,"Recent and accumulating work in experimental animal models and humans shows that diet has a much more pervasive and prominent role than previously thought in modulating neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative mechanisms leading to some of the most common chronic central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Chronic or intermittent food restriction has profound effects in shaping brain and peripheral metabolism, immunity, and gut microbiome biology. Interactions among calorie intake, meal frequency, diet quality, and the gut microbiome modulate specific metabolic and molecular pathways that regulate cellular, tissue, and organ homeostasis as well as inflammation during normal brain aging and CNS neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis, among others.

33406628,Gut Microbiota Dysbiosis Is Associated with Elevated Bile Acids in Parkinson's Disease.,"The gut microbiome can impact brain health and is altered in Parkinson's disease (PD). The vermiform appendix is a lymphoid tissue in the cecum implicated in the storage and regulation of the gut microbiota. We sought to determine whether the appendix microbiome is altered in PD and to analyze the biological consequences of the microbial alterations. We investigated the changes in the functional microbiota in the appendix of PD patients relative to controls (<i>n</i> = 12 PD, 16 C) by metatranscriptomic analysis. We found microbial dysbiosis affecting lipid metabolism, including an upregulation of bacteria responsible for secondary bile acid synthesis. We then quantitatively measure changes in bile acid abundance in PD relative to the controls in the appendix (<i>n</i> = 15 PD, 12 C) and ileum (<i>n</i> = 20 PD, 20 C). Bile acid analysis in the PD appendix reveals an increase in hydrophobic and secondary bile acids, deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA). Further proteomic and transcriptomic analysis in the appendix and ileum corroborated these findings, highlighting changes in the PD gut that are consistent with a disruption in bile acid control, including alterations in mediators of cholesterol homeostasis and lipid metabolism. Microbially derived toxic bile acids are heightened in PD, which suggests biliary abnormalities may play a role in PD pathogenesis.",Metabolites,2021,Peipei Li; Bryan A Killinger; Elizabeth Ensink; Ian Beddows; Ali Yilmaz; Noah Lubben; Jared Lamp; Meghan Schilthuis; Irving E Vega; Randy Woltjer; J Andrew Pospisilik; Patrik Brundin; Lena Brundin; Stewart F Graham; Viviane Labrie
33063712,The emerging role of probiotics in neurodegenerative diseases: new hope for Parkinson's disease?,"Neurodegenerative disease etiology is still unclear, but different contributing factors, such as lifestyle and genetic factors are involved. Altered components of the gut could play a key role in the gut-brain axis, which is a bidirectional system between the central nervous system and the enteric nervous system. Variations in the composition of the gut microbiota and its function between healthy people and patients have been reported for a variety of human disorders comprising metabolic, autoimmune, cancer, and, notably, neurodegenerative disorders. Diet can alter the microbiota composition, affecting the gut-brain axis function. Different nutraceutical interventions have been devoted to normalizing gut microbiome dysbiosis and to improving biological outcomes in neurological conditions, including the use of probiotics. Preclinical and clinical investigations discussed in this review strengthen the correlation between intestinal microbiota and brain and the concept that modifying the microbiome composition may improve brain neurochemistry, modulating different pathways. This review will discuss the potential use of probiotics for Parkinson's disease prevention or treatment or as adjuvant therapy, confirming that gut microbiota modulation influences different pro-survival pathways.

32504503,"Dysregulation of the Gut-Brain Axis, Dysbiosis and Influence of Numerous Factors on Gut Microbiota Associated Parkinson's Disease.","Parkinson's disease (PD) has been one of the substantial social, medical concerns and, burdens of the present time. PD is a gradually devastating neurodegenerative disorder of the neurological function marked with α-synucleinopathy affecting numerous regions of the brain-gut axis, as well as the central, enteric, and autonomic nervous system. Its etiology is a widely disputed topic.This review emphasizes to find out the correlation among the microbial composition and the observable disturbances in the metabolites of the microbial species and its impact on the immune response, which may have a concrete implication on the occurrence, persistence and, pathophysiology of PD via the gut-brain axis.An in-depth research and the database was developed from the available peer-reviewed articles to date (March 2020) utilizing numerous search engines like PubMed, MEDLINE and, other internet sources.Progressively increasing shreds of evidence have proved the fact that dysbiosis in the gut microbiome plays a central role in many neurological disorders, such as PD. Indeed, a disordered microbiome-gut-brain axis in PD could be focused on gastrointestinal afflictions that manifest primarily several years prior to the diagnosis, authenticating a concept wherein the pathological pathway progresses from the intestine reaching the brain.The microbiota greatly affects the bidirectional interaction between the brain and the gut via synchronized neurological, immunological, and neuroendocrine mechanisms. It can be concluded that a multitude of factors discussed in this review steadily induce the onset of dysbacteriosis that may exacerbate the etiologic mechanism of Parkinson's disease.",Current neuropharmacology,2021,Gagandeep Kaur; Tapan Behl; Simona Bungau; Arun Kumar; Md Sahab Uddin; Vineet Mehta; Gokhan Zengin; Bijo Mathew; Muhammad Ajmal Shah; Sandeep Arora
36672595,Toxin-like Peptides from the Bacterial Cultures Derived from Gut Microbiome Infected by SARS-CoV-2-New Data for a Possible Role in the Long COVID Pattern.,"It has been 3 years since the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, however it is as yet little known how to care for the acute COVID-19 and long COVID patients. COVID-19 clinical manifestations are of both pulmonary and extra-pulmonary types. Extra-pulmonary ones include extreme tiredness (fatigue), shortness of breath, muscle aches, hyposmia, dysgeusia, and other neurological manifestations. In other autoimmune diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD) or Alzheimer's Disease (AD), it is well known that role of acetylcholine is crucial in olfactory dysfunction. We have already observed the presence of toxin-like peptides in plasma, urine, and faecal samples from COVID-19 patients, which are very similar to molecules known to alter acetylcholine signaling. After observing the production of these peptides in bacterial cultures, we have performed additional proteomics analyses to better understand their behavior and reported the extended data from our latest in vitro experiment. It seems that the gut microbiome continues to produce toxin-like peptides also after the decrease of RNA SARS-CoV-2 viral load at molecular tests. These toxicological interactions between the gut/human microbiome bacteria and the virus suggest a new scenario in the study of the clinical symptoms in long COVID and also in acute COVID-19 patients. It is discussed that in the bacteriophage similar behavior, the presence of toxins produced by bacteria continuously after viral aggression can be blocked using an appropriate combination of certain drugs.",Biomedicines,2022,Carlo Brogna; Simone Cristoni; Barbara Brogna; Domenico Rocco Bisaccia; Giuliano Marino; Valentina Viduto; Luigi Montano; Marina Piscopo

36564391,Inflammatory microbes and genes as potential biomarkers of Parkinson's disease.,"As the second-largest neurodegenerative disease in the world, Parkinson's disease (PD) has brought a severe economic and medical burden to our society. Growing evidence in recent years suggests that the gut microbiome may influence PD, but the exact pathogenesis of PD remains unclear. In addition, the current diagnosis of PD could be inaccurate and expensive. In this study, the largest meta-analysis currently of the gut microbiome in PD was analyzed, including 2269 samples by 16S rRNA gene and 236 samples by shotgun metagenomics, aiming to reveal the connection between PD and gut microbiome and establish a model to predict PD. The results showed that the relative abundances of potential pro-inflammatory bacteria, genes and pathways were significantly increased in PD, while potential anti-inflammatory bacteria, genes and pathways were significantly decreased. These changes may lead to a decrease in potential anti-inflammatory substances (short-chain fatty acids) and an increase in potential pro-inflammatory substances (lipopolysaccharides, hydrogen sulfide and glutamate). Notably, the results of 16S rRNA gene and shotgun metagenomic analysis have consistently identified five decreased genera (Roseburia, Faecalibacterium, Blautia, Lachnospira, and Prevotella) and five increased genera (Streptococcus, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Akkermansia, and Desulfovibrio) in PD. Furthermore, random forest models performed well for PD prediction based on 11 genera (accuracy > 80%) or 6 genes (accuracy > 90%) related to inflammation. Finally, a possible mechanism was presented to explain the pathogenesis of inflammation leading to PD. Our results provided further insights into the prediction and treatment of PD based on inflammation.",NPJ biofilms and microbiomes,2022,Shiqing Nie; Jichen Wang; Ye Deng; Zheng Ye; Yuan Ge

We discuss the hypothesis of a brain microbiota, the BrainBiota: bacteria living in symbiosis with brain cells. Existence of various bacteria in the human brain is suggested by morphological evidence, presence of bacterial proteins, metabolites, transcripts and mucosal-associated invariant T cells. Based on our data, we discuss the hypothesis that these bacteria are an integral part of brain development and immune tolerance as well as directly linked to the gut microbiome. We further suggest that changes of the BrainBiota during brain diseases may be the consequence or cause of the chronic inflammation similarly to the gut microbiota.",Frontiers in immunology,2022,Maria L Elkjaer; Lukas Simon; Tobias Frisch; Lisa-Marie Bente; Tim Kacprowski; Mads Thomassen; Richard Reynolds; Jan Baumbach; Richard Röttger; Zsolt Illes
36516898,Effects of molecular hydrogen intervention on the gut microbiome in methamphetamine abusers with mental disorder.,"Methamphetamine (METH) is a potent and highly addictive psychostimulant and one of the most widely used illicit drugs, the abuse of which has become a severe public health problem worldwide. A growing amount of evidence has indicated potential connections between gut microbiota and mental disorders induced by METH and associations with neural and metabolic pathways. The present study aimed to explore the relationship between fecal microbial alterations and neuropsychiatric diseases in METH addictions. Thus, mental disorders and gut microbial alterations were analyzed by self-rating depression (SDS) and anxiety (SAS) scales and 16 S rRNA gene sequencing, respectively. Our results showed that increased SDS and SAS indices and decreased alpha diversity indicated more serious mental disorders and lower bacterial diversity in METH users than in the age-matched healthy control group. The gut microbial composition in female METH users was also significantly altered, with reductions in hydrogen-producing bacteria, including Bacteroides and Roseburia. Molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) is spontaneously produced by intestinal bacteria in the process of anaerobic metabolism, which is the main pathway for H<sub>2</sub> production in vivo. Numerous studies have shown that hydrogen intervention can significantly improve neuropsychiatric diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Our results showed that hydrogen intervention, including drinking and inhaling, significantly alleviated mental disorders induced by METH abuse, and the inhalation of hydrogen also altered gut microbiota profiles in the METH abusers. These results suggest that hydrogen intervention has potential therapeutic applicability in the treatment of mental disorders in METH abusers.",Brain research bulletin,2023,Yong Wang; Mengmeng Wang; Bing Xie; Di Wen; Wenbo Li; Meiqi Zhou; Xintao Wang; Yun Lu; Bin Cong; Zhiyu Ni; Chunling Ma

Also, 35 Metacyc pathways were predicted to be differentially expressed in PD patients including biosynthesis, compound degradation/utilization/assimilation, generation of metabolites and energy, and glycan pathways. Additionally, the postural instability gait dysfunction subtype was associated with three phyla and the NAD biosynthesis pathway. PD duration was associated with the Synergistota phylum, six genera, and the aromatic compound degradation pathways. Two genera were associated with motor function.PD patients differed from controls in gut microbiome composition and its predicted metagenome. Clinical features were also associated with bacterial taxa and altered metabolic pathways of interest for PD progression.",Journal of Parkinson's disease,2022,Keren Zhang; Kimberly C Paul; Jonathan P Jacobs; Hsiang-Chin Lori Chou; Aline Duarte Folle; Irish Del Rosario; Yu Yu; Jeff M Bronstein; Adrienne M Keener; Beate Ritz
36430144,What Are the Key Gut Microbiota Involved in Neurological Diseases? A Systematic Review.,"There is a growing body of evidence highlighting there are significant changes in the gut microbiota composition and relative abundance in various neurological disorders. We performed a systematic review of the different microbiota altered in a wide range of neurological disorders (Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and stroke). Fifty-two studies were included representing 5496 patients. At the genus level, the most frequently involved microbiota are Akkermansia, Faecalibacterium, and Prevotella. The overlap between the pathologies was strongest for MS and PD, sharing eight genera (Akkermansia, Butyricicoccus, Bifidobacterium, Coprococcus, Dorea, Faecalibacterium, Parabacteroides, and Prevotella) and PD and stroke, sharing six genera (Enterococcus, Faecalibacterium, Lactobacillus, Parabacteroides, Prevotella, and Roseburia). The identification signatures overlapping for AD, PD, and MS raise the question of whether these reflect a common etiology or rather common consequence of these diseases. The interpretation is hampered by the low number and low power for AD, ALS, and stroke with ample opportunity for false positive and false negative findings.",International journal of molecular sciences,2022,Bruno Bonnechère; Najaf Amin; Cornelia van Duijn
36411639,Deciphering the gut microbiome in neurodegenerative diseases and metagenomic approaches for characterization of gut microbes.,"The central nervous system has essential role in the regulation of the physiological condition of the human body. Gut microbes cause several types of gastrointestinal diseases like ulcer stomach and intestine and irritable bowel syndrome. Microbes present in the human gut can affect brain function by the release of neuroactive metabolites such as neurotransmitters, hormones, and other compounds. Gut microbial-derived metabolites also have an important role in neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, etc. Vital communication between the gut microbes and the central nervous system is known as the microbiota-gut-brain axis. It provides a communication pathway between the gut and brain which is made up of the vagus nerve, immune system components, and neuroendocrine. Disturbance in gut microbiota composition can alter the central nervous system and enteric nervous system functions. Metagenomics has been employed for the identification, and characterization of gut microbes and microbial-derived metabolites. This review is focused on the gut microbes-brain relationship and the role of gut microbes in neurodegenerative diseases. This study is also focused on major metagenomic approaches and their role in gut microbes characterization.",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2022,Nidhi Singh; Veer Singh; Sachchida Nand Rai; Vishal Mishra; Emanuel Vamanu; Mohan P Singh
36406749,A review of the preclinical and clinical studies on the role of the gut microbiome in aging and neurodegenerative diseases and its modulation.,"As the world population ages, the burden of age-related health problems grows, creating a greater demand for new novel interventions for healthy aging. Advancing aging is related to a loss of beneficial mutualistic microbes in the gut microbiota caused by extrinsic and intrinsic factors such as diet, sedentary lifestyle, sleep deprivation, circadian rhythms, and oxidative stress, which emerge as essential elements in controlling and prolonging life expectancy of healthy aging. This condition is known as gut dysbiosis, and it affects normal brain function via the brain-gut microbiota (BGM) axis, which is a bidirectional link between the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and the central nervous system (CNS) that leads to the emergence of brain disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Here, we reviewed the role of the gut microbiome in aging and neurodegenerative diseases, as well as provided a comprehensive review of recent findings from preclinical and clinical studies to present an up-to-date overview of recent advances in developing strategies to modulate the intestinal microbiome by probiotic administration, dietary intervention, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and physical activity to address the aging process and prevent neurodegenerative diseases. The findings of this review will provide researchers in the fields of aging and the gut microbiome design innovative studies that leverage results from preclinical and clinical studies to better understand the nuances of aging, gut microbiome, and neurodegenerative diseases.",Frontiers in cellular neuroscience,2022,Haslin Madihah Hashim; Suzana Makpol
36400238,Bile acids and neurological disease.,"This review will focus on how bile acids are being used in clinical trials to treat neurological diseases due to their central involvement with the gut-liver-brain axis and their physiological and pathophysiological roles in both normal brain function and multiple neurological diseases. The synthesis of primary and secondary bile acids species and how the regulation of the bile acid pool may differ between the gut and brain is discussed. The expression of several bile acid receptors in brain and their currently known functions along with the tools available to manipulate them pharmacologically are examined, together with discussion of the interaction of bile acids with the gut microbiome and their lesser-known effects upon brain glucose and lipid metabolism. How dysregulation of the gut microbiome, aging and sex differences may lead to disruption of bile acid signalling and possible causal roles in a number of neurological disorders are also considered. Finally, we discuss how pharmacological treatments targeting bile acid receptors are currently being tested in an array of clinical trials for several different neurodegenerative diseases.",Pharmacology & therapeutics,2022,Michael J Hurley; Rachel Bates; Jane Macnaughtan; Anthony H V Schapira
36389228,The interplay between the gut-brain axis and the microbiome: A perspective on psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.,"What is the effect of our gut microbial flora on brain? Does the gut microbiome have any role in the causation of psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases? Does the effect of gut microbiota traverse the gut-brain axis? Questions like these have captured the interest and imagination of the scientific community for quite some time now. Research in the quest for answers to these questions, to unravel the potential role of the microbiota inhabiting the gut in controlling brain functions, has progressed manifold over the last two decades. Although the possibility of microbiome as a key susceptibility factor for neurological disorders viz. Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and autism spectrum disorder has bolstered by an increase in the clinical and preclinical evidence, the field is still in its infancy. Given the fact that the diversity of the gut microbiota is affected by various factors including the diet and exercise, the interpretation of such data becomes all the more difficult. Also, such studies have been mostly conducted on animal models, so there is a need for randomized controlled trials in human subjects, corroborated by longitudinal studies, to establish if modulating the gut microbiota can unravel novel therapeutic interventions. Exploring the genomic, metagenomic and metabolomic data from clinical subjects with psychiatric and neurological diseases can prove to be a helpful guide in individual treatment selection.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2022,Yasir Bashir; Asad U Khan
36376318,Metagenomics of Parkinson's disease implicates the gut microbiome in multiple disease mechanisms.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) may start in the gut and spread to the brain. To investigate the role of gut microbiome, we conducted a large-scale study, at high taxonomic resolution, using uniform standardized methods from start to end. We enrolled 490 PD and 234 control individuals, conducted deep shotgun sequencing of fecal DNA, followed by metagenome-wide association studies requiring significance by two methods (ANCOM-BC and MaAsLin2) to declare disease association, network analysis to identify polymicrobial clusters, and functional profiling. Here we show that over 30% of species, genes and pathways tested have altered abundances in PD, depicting a widespread dysbiosis. PD-associated species form polymicrobial clusters that grow or shrink together, and some compete. PD microbiome is disease permissive, evidenced by overabundance of pathogens and immunogenic components, dysregulated neuroactive signaling, preponderance of molecules that induce alpha-synuclein pathology, and over-production of toxicants; with the reduction in anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective factors limiting the capacity to recover. We validate, in human PD, findings that were observed in experimental models; reconcile and resolve human PD microbiome literature; and provide a broad foundation with a wealth of concrete testable hypotheses to discern the role of the gut microbiome in PD.",Nature communications,2022,Zachary D Wallen; Ayse Demirkan; Guy Twa; Gwendolyn Cohen; Marissa N Dean; David G Standaert; Timothy R Sampson; Haydeh Payami
36353491,Gut microbiome and human health: Exploring how the probiotic genus <i>Lactobacillus</i> modulate immune responses.,"The highest density of microbes resides in human gastrointestinal tract, known as ""Gut microbiome"". Of note, the members of the genus <i>Lactobacillus</i> that belong to phyla Firmicutes are the most important probiotic bacteria of the gut microbiome. These gut-residing <i>Lactobacillus</i> species not only communicate with each other but also with the gut epithelial lining to balance the gut barrier integrity, mucosal barrier defence and ameliorate the host immune responses. The human body suffers from several inflammatory diseases affecting the gut, lungs, heart, bone or neural tissues. Mounting evidence supports the significant role of <i>Lactobacillus</i> spp. and their components (such as metabolites, peptidoglycans, and/or surface proteins) in modulatingimmune responses, primarily through exchange of immunological signals between gastrointestinal tract and distant organs. This bidirectional crosstalk which is mediated by <i>Lactobacillus</i> spp. promotes anti-inflammatory response, thereby supporting the improvement of symptoms pertaining to asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), neuroinflammatory diseases (such as multiple sclerosis, alzheimer's disease, parkinson's disease), cardiovascular diseases, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and chronic infections in patients. The metabolic disorders, obesity and diabetes are characterized by a low-grade inflammation. Genus <i>Lactobacillus</i> alleviates metabolic disorders by regulating the oxidative stress response and inflammatory pathways. Osteoporosis is also associated with bone inflammation and resorption. The <i>Lactobacillus</i> spp. and their metabolites act as powerful immune cell controllers and exhibit a regulatory role in bone resorption and formation, supporting bone health. Thus, this review demonstrated the mechanisms and summarized the evidence of the benefit of <i>Lactobacillus</i> spp. in alleviating inflammatory diseases pertaining to different organs from animal and clinical trials. The present narrative review explores in detail the complex interactions between the gut-dwelling <i>Lactobacillus</i> spp. and the immune components in distant organs to promote host's health.",Frontiers in pharmacology,2022,Sonakshi Rastogi; Aditi Singh
36346385,A prebiotic diet modulates microglial states and motor deficits in α-synuclein overexpressing mice.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a movement disorder characterized by neuroinflammation, α-synuclein pathology, and neurodegeneration. Most cases of PD are non-hereditary, suggesting a strong role for environmental factors, and it has been speculated that disease may originate in peripheral tissues such as the gastrointestinal (GI) tract before affecting the brain. The gut microbiome is altered in PD and may impact motor and GI symptoms as indicated by animal studies, although mechanisms of gut-brain interactions remain incompletely defined. Intestinal bacteria ferment dietary fibers into short-chain fatty acids, with fecal levels of these molecules differing between PD and healthy controls and in mouse models. Among other effects, dietary microbial metabolites can modulate activation of microglia, brain-resident immune cells implicated in PD. We therefore investigated whether a fiber-rich diet influences microglial function in α-synuclein overexpressing (ASO) mice, a preclinical model with PD-like symptoms and pathology. Feeding a prebiotic high-fiber diet attenuates motor deficits and reduces α-synuclein aggregation in the substantia nigra of mice. Concomitantly, the gut microbiome of ASO mice adopts a profile correlated with health upon prebiotic treatment, which also reduces microglial activation. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of microglia from the substantia nigra and striatum uncovers increased pro-inflammatory signaling and reduced homeostatic responses in ASO mice compared to wild-type counterparts on standard diets. However, prebiotic feeding reverses pathogenic microglial states in ASO mice and promotes expansion of protective disease-associated macrophage (DAM) subsets of microglia. Notably, depletion of microglia using a CSF1R inhibitor eliminates the beneficial effects of prebiotics by restoring motor deficits to ASO mice despite feeding a prebiotic diet. These studies uncover a novel microglia-dependent interaction between diet and motor symptoms in mice, findings that may have implications for neuroinflammation and PD.",eLife,2022,Reem Abdel-Haq; Johannes C M Schlachetzki; Joseph C Boktor; Thaisa M Cantu-Jungles; Taren Thron; Mengying Zhang; John W Bostick; Tahmineh Khazaei; Sujatha Chilakala; Livia H Morais; Greg Humphrey; Ali Keshavarzian; Jonathan E Katz; Matthew Thomson; Rob Knight; Viviana Gradinaru; Bruce R Hamaker; Christopher K Glass; Sarkis K Mazmanian
36334762,Are neuromodulation interventions associated with changes in the gut microbiota? A systematic review.,"The microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) refers to the bidirectional communication between the brain and the gut microbiota and recent studies have linked the MGBA to health and disease. Research has so far investigated this axis mainly from microbiota to brain but less is known about the other direction. One approach to examine the MGBA from brain to microbiota is through understanding if and how neuromodulation might impact microbiota. Neuromodulation encompasses a wide range of stimulation techniques and is used to treat neurological, psychiatric and metabolic disorders, like Parkinson's Disease, depression and obesity. Here, we performed a systematic review to investigate whether neuromodulation is associated with subsequent changes in the gut microbiota. Searches in PsycINFO and MEDLINE were performed up to March 2022. Included studies needed to be clinical or preclinical studies comparing the effects of deep brain stimulation, electroconvulsive therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation or vagal nerve stimulation on the gut microbiota before and after treatment or between active and control groups. Seven studies were identified. Neuromodulation was associated with changes in relative bacterial abundances, but not with (changes in) α-diversity or β-diversity. Summarizing, currently reported findings suggest that neuromodulation interventions are associated with moderate changes in the gut microbiome. However, findings remain inconclusive due to the limited number and varying quality of included studies, as well as the large heterogeneity between studies. More research is required to more conclusively establish whether, and if so, via which mechanism(s) of action neuromodulation interventions might influence the gut microbiota.",Neuropharmacology,2023,Vera Korenblik; Marlies E Brouwer; Aniko Korosi; Damiaan Denys; Claudi L H Bockting; Stanley Brul; Anja Lok
36332796,Gut microbiome and Parkinson's disease: Perspective on pathogenesis and treatment.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a disease of ⍺-synuclein aggregation-mediated dopaminergic neuronal loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta, which leads to motor and non-motor symptoms. Through the last two decades of research, there has been growing consensus that inflammation-mediated oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cytokine-induced toxicity are mainly involved in neuronal damage and loss associated with PD. However, it remains unclear how these mechanisms relate to sporadic PD, a more common form of PD. Both enteric and central nervous systems have been implicated in the pathogenesis of sporadic PD, thus highlighting the crosstalk between the gut and brain.of Review: In this review, we summarize how alterations in the gut microbiome can affect PD pathogenesis. We highlight various mechanisms increasing/decreasing the risk of PD development. Based on the previous supporting evidence, we suggest how early interventions could protect against PD development and how controlling specific factors, including our diet, could modify our perspective on disease mechanisms and therapeutics. We explain the strong relationship between the gut microbiota and the brain in PD subjects, by delineating the multiple mechanisms involved inneuroinflammation and oxidative stress. We conclude that the neurodetrimental effects of western diet (WD) and the neuroprotective effects of Mediterranean diets should be further exploredin humans through clinical trials. Key Scientific Concepts of Review: Alterations in the gut microbiome and associated metabolites may contribute to pathogenesis in PD. In some studies, probiotics have been shown to exert anti-oxidative effects in PD via improved mitochondrial dynamics and homeostasis, thus reducing PD-related consequences. However, there is a significant unmet need for randomized clinical trials to investigate the effectiveness of microbial products, probiotic-based supplementation, and dietary intervention in reversing gut microbial dysbiosis in PD.",Journal of advanced research,2023,Safa Salim; Fatima Ahmad; Ayesha Banu; Farhan Mohammad
36284437,Gut bacterial profiles in Parkinson's disease: A systematic review.,"Recent advances have highlighted the relationships between gut dysbiosis and Parkinson's disease (PD). Microbiota transplantation from PD patients to mice can induce increased alpha-synuclein-mediated motor deficits. Human studies have identified differences in the gut microbiota of PD patients compared to healthy controls. We undertook a systematic review to evaluate the available evidence for the involvement of gut bacteria in the etiology of PD.The PubMed databank, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure databank, and Wanfang Data were searched from inception until June 2021 to identify human case-control studies that investigated relationships between PD and microbiota quantified from feces. We evaluated the resulting studies focusing on bacterial taxa that were different between PD patients and healthy controls.Twenty-six studies were found in which 53 microbial families and 98 genera exhibited differences between patients with PD and healthy controls. The genera identified by more than two studies as increased in PD were Bifidobacterium, Alistipes, Christensenella, Enterococcus, Oscillospira, Bilophila, Desulfovibrio, Escherichia/Shigella, and Akkermansia, while Prevotella, Blautia, Faecalibacterium, Fusicatenibacter, and Haemophilus had three or more reports of being lower in PD patients. More than one report demonstrated that Bacteroides, Odoribacter, Parabacteroides, Butyricicoccus, Butyrivibrio, Clostridium, Coprococcus, Lachnospira, Lactobacillus, Megasphaera, Phascolarctobacterium, Roseburia, Ruminococcus, Streptococcus, and Klebsiella were altered in both directions.Our review shows that the involvement of the gut microbiome in the etiology of PD may involve alterations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producing bacteria and an increase in putative gut pathobionts. SCFAs-producing bacteria may vary above or below an ""optimal range,"" causing imbalances. Considering that Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Akkermansia are beneficial for human health, increased Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus in the PD gut microbiome may be associated with PD medications, especially COMT inhibitors, while a high level of Akkermansia may be associated with aging.",CNS neuroscience & therapeutics,2023,Zhe Li; Hongfeng Liang; Yingyu Hu; Lin Lu; Chunye Zheng; Yuzhen Fan; Bin Wu; Tao Zou; Xiaodong Luo; Xinchun Zhang; Yan Zeng; Ziyan Liu; Zhicheng Zhou; Zhenyu Yue; Yi Ren; Zhuo Li; Qiaozhen Su; Pingyi Xu
36278360,Exploring the Connection Between the Gut Microbiome and Parkinson's Disease Symptom Progression and Pathology: Implications for Supplementary Treatment Options.,"The contribution of the microbiota to induce gastrointestinal inflammation is hypothesized to be a key component of alpha-synuclein (aSyn) aggregation within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract in the pathological progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). The function of the GI tract is governed by a system of neurons that form part of the enteric nervous system (ENS). The ENS hosts  100-500 million nerve cells within two thin layers lining the GI tract. The gut-brain axis (GBA) is the major communication pathway between the ENS and the central nervous system. It has become increasingly clear that the microbiota in the gut are key regulators of GBA function and help to maintain homeostasis in the immune and endocrine systems. The GBA may act as a possible etiological launching pad for the pathogenesis of age-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as PD, because of an imbalance in the gut microbiota. PD is a multi-faceted illness with multiple biological, immunological, and environmental factors contributing to its pathological progression. Interestingly, individuals with PD have an altered gut microbiota compared to healthy individuals. However, there is a lack of literature describing the relationship between microbiota composition in the gut and symptom progression in PD patients. This review article examines how the pathology and symptomology of PD may originate from dysregulated signaling in the ENS. We then discuss by targeting the imbalance within the gut microbiota such as prebiotics and probiotics, some of the prodromal symptoms might be alleviated, possibly curtailing the pathological spread of aSyn and ensuing debilitating motor symptoms.",Journal of Parkinson's disease,2022,Dennis G Chan; Katelyn Ventura; Ally Villeneuve; Paul Du Bois; Matthew R Holahan

The beneficial effects of DR are being increasingly acknowledged in aging and in a series of age-related neurodegenerative disorders, for example, Parkinson's disease (PD). To date, the pathogenesis of PD remains elusive and there is no cure for it in spite of intensive research over decades. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the efficacy of DR on PD, focusing on the underlying mechanisms involving general metabolism, neuroendocrinolgy, neuroinflammation, gut microbiome, and so on. We anticipate that this review will provide future perspectives for PD prevention and treatment.",Nutrients,2022,Zhonglei Wang; Yueran Cui; Lulu Wen; Haiyang Yu; Juan Feng; Wei Yuan; Xin He
36216843,Fecal microbiome alterations in treatment-naive de novo Parkinson's disease.,"Gut microbiota alterations in Parkinson's disease (PD) have been found in several studies and are suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis of PD. However, previous results could not be adequately adjusted for a potential confounding effect of PD medication and disease duration, as almost all PD participants were already using dopaminergic medication and were included several years after diagnosis. Here, the gut microbiome composition of treatment-naive de novo PD subjects was assessed compared to healthy controls (HC) in two large independent case-control cohorts (n = 136 and 56 PD, n = 85 and 87 HC), using 16S-sequencing of fecal samples. Relevant variables such as technical batches, diet and constipation were assessed for their potential effects. Overall gut microbiome composition differed between PD and HC in both cohorts, suggesting gut microbiome alterations are already present in de novo PD subjects at the time of diagnosis, without the possible confounding effect of dopaminergic medication. Although no differentially abundant taxon could be replicated in both cohorts, multiple short chain fatty acids (SCFA) producing taxa were decreased in PD in both cohorts. In particular, several taxa belonging to the family Lachnospiraceae were decreased in abundance. Fewer taxonomic differences were found compared to previous studies, indicating smaller effect sizes in de novo PD.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2022,Jeffrey M Boertien; Kirsi Murtomäki; Pedro A B Pereira; Sygrid van der Zee; Tuomas H Mertsalmi; Reeta Levo; Tanja Nojonen; Elina Mäkinen; Elina Jaakkola; Pia Laine; Lars Paulin; Eero Pekkonen; Valtteri Kaasinen; Petri Auvinen; Filip Scheperjans; Teus van Laar; 
36072564,Age-dependent effects of gut microbiota metabolites on brain resident macrophages.,"In recent years, development of age-related diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, as well as other brain disorders, including anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia have been shown to be associated with changes in the gut microbiome. Several factors can induce an alteration in the bacterial composition of the host's gastrointestinal tract. Besides dietary changes and frequent use of antibiotics, the microbiome is also profoundly affected by aging. Levels of microbiota-derived metabolites are elevated in older individuals with age-associated diseases and cognitive defects compared to younger, healthy age groups. The identified metabolites with higher concentration in aged hosts, which include choline and trimethylamine, are known risk factors for age-related diseases. While the underlying mechanisms and pathways remain elusive for the most part, it has been shown, that these metabolites are able to trigger the innate immunity in the central nervous system by influencing development and activation status of brain-resident macrophages. The macrophages residing in the brain comprise parenchymal microglia and non-parenchymal macrophages located in the perivascular spaces, meninges, and the choroid plexus. In this review, we highlight the impact of age on the composition of the microbiome and microbiota-derived metabolites and their influence on age-associated diseases caused by dysfunctional brain-resident macrophages.",Frontiers in cellular neuroscience,2022,Dilara Hasavci; Thomas Blank
36009361,Pain and Opioid-Induced Gut Microbial Dysbiosis.,"Opioid-induced dysbiosis (OID) is a specific condition describing the consequences of opioid use on the bacterial composition of the gut. Opioids have been shown to affect the epithelial barrier in the gut and modulate inflammatory pathways, possibly mediating opioid tolerance or opioid-induced hyperalgesia; in combination, these allow the invasion and proliferation of non-native bacterial colonies. There is also evidence that the gut-brain axis is linked to the emotional and cognitive aspects of the brain with intestinal function, which can be a factor that affects mental health. For example, <i>Mycobacterium</i>, <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Clostridium difficile</i> are linked to Irritable Bowel Disease; <i>Lactobacillaceae</i> and <i>Enterococcacae</i> have associations with Parkinson's disease, and <i>Alistipes</i> has increased prevalence in depression. However, changes to the gut microbiome can be therapeutically influenced with treatments such as faecal microbiota transplantation, targeted antibiotic therapy and probiotics. There is also evidence of emerging therapies to combat OID. This review has collated evidence that shows that there are correlations between OID and depression, Parkinson's Disease, infection, and more. Specifically, in pain management, targeting OID deserves specific investigations.",Biomedicines,2022,Karen R Thomas; Jacob Watt; Chuen Mong J Wu; Adejoke Akinrinoye; Sairah Amjad; Lucy Colvin; Rachel Cowe; Sylvia H Duncan; Wendy R Russell; Patrice Forget
35994167,Parkinson's Disease: A Multisystem Disorder.,"The way sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD) is perceived has undergone drastic changes in recent decades. For a long time, PD was considered a brain disease characterized by motor disturbances; however, the identification of several risk factors and the hypothesis that PD has a gastrointestinal onset have shed additional light. Today, after recognition of prodromal non-motor symptoms and the pathological processes driving their evolution, there is a greater understanding of the involvement of other organ systems. For this reason, PD is increasingly seen as a multiorgan and multisystemic pathology that arises from the interaction of susceptible genetic factors with a challenging environment during aging-related decline.",Neuroscience bulletin,2023,Helena Nunes Costa; Ana Raquel Esteves; Nuno Empadinhas; Sandra Morais Cardoso
35965349,Systematic profiling of the chicken gut microbiome reveals dietary supplementation with antibiotics alters expression of multiple microbial pathways with minimal impact on community structure.,"The emergence of antimicrobial resistance is a major threat to global health and has placed pressure on the livestock industry to eliminate the use of antibiotic growth promotants (AGPs) as feed additives. To mitigate their removal, efficacious alternatives are required. AGPs are thought to operate through modulating the gut microbiome to limit opportunities for colonization by pathogens, increase nutrient utilization, and reduce inflammation. However, little is known concerning the underlying mechanisms. Previous studies investigating the effects of AGPs on the poultry gut microbiome have largely focused on 16S rDNA surveys based on a single gastrointestinal (GI) site, diet, and/or timepoint, resulting in an inconsistent view of their impact on community composition.In this study, we perform a systematic investigation of both the composition and function of the chicken gut microbiome, in response to AGPs. Birds were raised under two different diets and AGP treatments, and 16S rDNA surveys applied to six GI sites sampled at three key timepoints of the poultry life cycle. Functional investigations were performed through metatranscriptomics analyses and metabolomics.Our study reveals a more nuanced view of the impact of AGPs, dependent on age of bird, diet, and intestinal site sampled. Although AGPs have a limited impact on taxonomic abundances, they do appear to redefine influential taxa that may promote the exclusion of other taxa. Microbiome expression profiles further reveal a complex landscape in both the expression and taxonomic representation of multiple pathways including cell wall biogenesis, antimicrobial resistance, and several involved in energy, amino acid, and nucleotide metabolism. Many AGP-induced changes in metabolic enzyme expression likely serve to redirect metabolic flux with the potential to regulate bacterial growth or produce metabolites that impact the host.As alternative feed additives are developed to mimic the action of AGPs, our study highlights the need to ensure such alternatives result in functional changes that are consistent with site-, age-, and diet-associated taxa. The genes and pathways identified in this study are therefore expected to drive future studies, applying tools such as community-based metabolic modeling, focusing on the mechanistic impact of different dietary regimes on the microbiome. Consequently, the data generated in this study will be crucial for the development of next-generation feed additives targeting gut health and poultry production.

35914559,Oral ingestion of the environmental toxicant trichloroethylene in rats induces alterations in the gut microbiome: Relevance to idiopathic Parkinson's disease.,"Microbial alterations within the gut microbiome appear to be a common feature of individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD), providing further evidence for the role of the gut-brain axis in PD development. As a major site of contact with the environment, questions have emerged surrounding the cause and effect of alterations to the gut microbiome by environmental contaminants associated with PD risk, such as pesticides, metals, and organic solvents. Recent data from our lab shows that ingestion of the industrial byproduct and environmental pollutant trichloroethylene (TCE) induces key Parkinsonian pathology within aged rats, including the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, α-synuclein accumulation, neuroinflammation, and endolysosomal deficits. As TCE is the most common organic contaminant within drinking water, we postulated that ingestion of TCE associated with PD-related neurodegeneration may alter the gut microbiome to a similar extent as observed in persons with PD. To assess this, we collected fecal samples from adult rats treated with 200 mg/kg TCE over 6 weeks via oral gavage - the dose that produced nigrostriatal neurodegeneration - and analyzed the gut microbiome via whole genome shotgun sequencing. Our results showed changes in gut microorganisms reflective of the microbial signatures observed in individuals with idiopathic PD, such as decreased abundance of short-chain fatty acid producing Blautia and elevated lactic-acid producing Bifidobacteria, as well as genera who contain species previously reported as opportunistic pathogens such as Clostridium. From these experimental data, we postulate that TCE exposure within contaminated drinking water could induce alterations of the gut microbiome that contributes to chronic disease risk, including idiopathic PD.",Toxicology and applied pharmacology,2022,Neda M Ilieva; Zachary D Wallen; Briana R De Miranda
35855338,Effects of Ketogenic Diet on Neuroinflammation in Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"The ketogenic diet (KD) is a low-carbohydrate, high-fat and adequate-protein diet. As a diet mimicking fasting, it triggers the production of ketone bodies (KBs) and brings the body into a state of ketosis. Recent and accumulating studies on humans and animal models have shown that KD is beneficial to neurodegenerative diseases through modulating central and peripheral metabolism, mitochondrial function, inflammation, oxidative stress, autophagy, and the gut microbiome. Complicated interplay of metabolism, gut microbiome, and other mechanisms can regulate neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases by activating multiple molecular and cellular pathways. In this review, we detail the physiological basis of the KD, its functions in regulating neuroinflammation, and its protective role in normal brain aging and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington's disease (HD). We aimed to elucidate the underlying neuroinflammatory mechanisms of KD therapies in neurodegenerative diseases and provide novel insights into their application for neurodegenerative disease prevention and treatment.",Aging and disease,2022,Ziying Jiang; Xi Yin; Miao Wang; Tong Chen; Yuanyuan Wang; Zhongbao Gao; Zhenfu Wang
35798742,Oral and gut dysbiosis leads to functional alterations in Parkinson's disease.,"Although several studies have identified a distinct gut microbial composition in Parkinson's disease (PD), few studies have investigated the oral microbiome or functional alteration of the microbiome in PD. We aimed to investigate the connection between the oral and gut microbiome and the functional changes in the PD-specific gut microbiome using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. The taxonomic composition of the oral and gut microbiome was significantly different between PD patients and healthy controls (P = 0.003 and 0.001, respectively). Oral Lactobacillus was more abundant in PD patients and was associated with opportunistic pathogens in the gut (FDR-adjusted P < 0.038). Functional analysis revealed that microbial gene markers for glutamate and arginine biosynthesis were downregulated, while antimicrobial resistance gene markers were upregulated in PD patients than healthy controls (all P < 0.001). We identified a connection between the oral and gut microbiota in PD, which might lead to functional alteration of the microbiome in PD.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2022,Sungyang Jo; Woorim Kang; Yun Su Hwang; Seung Hyun Lee; Kye Won Park; Mi Sun Kim; Hyunna Lee; Hyung Jeong Yoon; Yoo Kyoung Park; Mauricio Chalita; Je Hee Lee; Hojun Sung; Jae-Yun Lee; Jin-Woo Bae; Sun Ju Chung
35786740,Gut instincts in neuroimmunity from the eighteenth to twenty-first centuries.,"In the past two decades, work on the microbiota-gut-brain axis has led to a renewed appreciation for the interconnectedness between body systems in both clinical and scientific circles. In the USA alone, millions of adults are burdened with non-communicable chronic diseases whose putative etiologies were previously thought to be restricted to either the gut or brain, such as inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, and autism spectrum disorder. However, the recent explosion of research into the impacts of the gut microbiome on diverse aspects of human health has revealed the potentially critical importance of reciprocal interactions between the gut microbiota, the immune system, and the brain in diverse diseases and disorders. In this review, we revisit the history of gut-brain interactions in science and medicine, which dates back to at least the eighteenth century, and outline how concepts in this field have shifted and evolved across eras. Next, we highlight the modern resurgence of gut-brain axis research, focusing on neuro-immune-microbiota interactions and recent progress towards a mechanistic understanding of the diverse impacts of the microbiome on human health. Finally, we offer a forward-looking perspective on the future of microbiota-gut-brain research, which may eventually reveal new paths towards the treatment of diverse diseases influenced by the complex connections between the microbiota and the brain.",Seminars in immunopathology,2022,Mytien Nguyen; Noah W Palm
35743072,PARK7/DJ-1 as a Therapeutic Target in Gut-Brain Axis Diseases.,"It is increasingly known that Parkinson's (PD) and Alzheimer's (AD) diseases occur more frequently in patients with inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases including inflammatory bowel (IBD) or celiac disease, indicating a pathological link between them. Although epidemiological observations suggest the existence of the gut-brain axis (GBA) involving systemic inflammatory and neural pathways, little is known about the exact molecular mechanisms. Parkinson's disease 7 (PARK7/DJ-1) is a multifunctional protein whose protective role has been widely demonstrated in neurodegenerative diseases, including PD, AD, or ischemic stroke. Recent studies also revealed the importance of PARK7/DJ-1 in the maintenance of the gut microbiome and also in the regulation of intestinal inflammation.

35723531,Bacterial Butyrate in Parkinson's Disease Is Linked to Epigenetic Changes and Depressive Symptoms.,"The gut microbiome and its metabolites can impact brain health and are altered in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. It has been recently demonstrated that PD patients have reduced fecal levels of the potent epigenetic modulator butyrate and its bacterial producers.Here, we investigate whether the changes in the gut microbiome and associated metabolites are related to PD symptoms and epigenetic markers in leucocytes and neurons.Stool, whole blood samples, and clinical data were collected from 55 PD patients and 55 controls. We performed DNA methylation analysis on whole blood samples and analyzed the results in relation to fecal short-chain fatty acid concentrations and microbiota composition. In another cohort, prefrontal cortex neurons were isolated from control and PD brains. We identified genome-wide DNA methylation by targeted bisulfite sequencing.We show that lower fecal butyrate and reduced counts of genera Roseburia, Romboutsia, and Prevotella are related to depressive symptoms in PD patients. Genes containing butyrate-associated methylation sites include PD risk genes and significantly overlap with sites epigenetically altered in PD blood leucocytes, predominantly neutrophils, and in brain neurons, relative to controls. Moreover, butyrate-associated methylated-DNA regions in PD overlap with those altered in gastrointestinal (GI), autoimmune, and psychiatric diseases.Decreased levels of bacterially produced butyrate are related to epigenetic changes in leucocytes and neurons from PD patients and to the severity of their depressive symptoms. PD shares common butyrate-dependent epigenetic changes with certain GI and psychiatric disorders, which could be relevant for their epidemiological relation. © 2022 The Authors.

35722294,"Integrated Microbiome and Host Transcriptome Profiles Link Parkinson's Disease to <i>Blautia</i> Genus: Evidence From Feces, Blood, and Brain.","A link between the gut microbiome and Parkinson's disease (PD) has been intensively studied, and more than 100 differential genera were identified across the studies. However, the predominant genera contributing to PD remain poorly understood. Inspired by recent advances showing microbiota distribution in the blood and brain, we, here, comprehensively investigated currently available fecal microbiome data (1,914 samples) to identify significantly altered genera, which were further validated by comparison to the results from microbiome analysis of blood (85 samples) and brain (268 samples). Our data showed that the composition of fecal microbiota was different from that of blood and brain. We found that <i>Blautia</i> was the unique genus consistently depleted across feces, blood, and brain samples of PD patients (<i>P</i> < 0.05), despite using rigorous criteria to remove contaminants. Moreover, enrichment analyses revealed that host genes correlated with <i>Blautia</i> genus abundance were mainly involved in mitochondrial function and energy metabolism, and mapped to neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) and metabolic diseases. A random forest classifier constructed with fecal microbiota data demonstrated that <i>Blautia</i> genus was an important feature contributing to discriminating PD patients from controls [receiver operating characteristic (ROC)-area under curve (AUC) = 0.704, precision-recall curve (PRC)-AUC = 0.787]. Through the integration of microbiome and transcriptome, our study depicted microbial profiles in the feces, blood, and brain of PD patients, and identified <i>Blautia</i> genus as a potential genus linked to PD. Further studies are greatly encouraged to determine the role of <i>Blautia</i> genus in the pathogenesis of PD.",Frontiers in microbiology,2022,Xingzhi Guo; Peng Tang; Chen Hou; Li Chong; Xin Zhang; Peng Liu; Li Chen; Yue Liu; Lina Zhang; Rui Li
35708472,Neuroinflammation: A Distal Consequence of Periodontitis.,"Periodontitis, a chronic, inflammatory disease, induces systemic inflammation and contributes to the development of neurodegenerative diseases. The precise etiology of the most common neurodegenerative disorders, such as sporadic Alzheimer's, Parkinson's diseases and multiple sclerosis (AD, PD, and MS, respectively), remains to be revealed. Chronic neuroinflammation is a well-recognized component of these disorders, and evidence suggests that systemic inflammation is a possible stimulus for neuroinflammation development. Systemic inflammation can lead to deleterious consequences on the brain if the inflammation is sufficiently severe or if the brain shows vulnerabilities due to genetic predisposition, aging, or neurodegenerative diseases. It has been proposed that periodontal disease can initiate or contribute to the AD pathogenesis through multiple pathways, including key periodontal pathogens. Dysbiotic oral bacteria can release bacterial products into the bloodstream and eventually cross the brain-blood barrier; these bacteria can also cause alterations to gut microbiota that enhance inflammation and potentially affect brain function via the gut-brain axis. The trigeminal nerve has been suggested as another route for connecting oral bacterial products to the brain. PD and MS are often preceded by gastrointestinal symptoms or aberrant gut microbiome composition, and alterations in the enteric nervous system accompany the disease. Clinical evidence has suggested that patients with periodontitis are at a higher risk of developing PD and MS. This nexus among the brain, periodontal disease, and systemic inflammation heralds new ways in which microglial cells, the main innate immune cells, and astrocytes, the crucial regulators of innate and adaptive immune responses in the brain, contribute to brain pathology. Currently, the lack of understanding of the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration is hindering treatment development. However, we may prevent this pathogenesis by tackling one of its possible contributors (periodontitis) for systemic inflammation through simple preventive oral hygiene measures.",Journal of dental research,2022,X Li; M Kiprowska; T Kansara; P Kansara; P Li
35674870,Neurodegeneration and Neuroinflammation in Parkinson's Disease: a Self-Sustained Loop.,"Neuroinflammation plays a significant role in Parkinson's disease (PD) etiology along with mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired proteostasis. In this context, mechanisms related to immune response can act as modifiers at different steps of the neurodegenerative process and justify the growing interest in anti-inflammatory agents as potential disease-modifying treatments in PD. The discovery of inherited gene mutations in PD has allowed researchers to develop cellular and animal models to study the mechanisms of the underlying biology, but the original cause of neuroinflammation in PD is still debated to date.Cell autonomous alterations in neuronal cells, including mitochondrial damage and protein aggregation, could play a role, but recent findings also highlighted the importance of intercellular communication at both local and systemic level. This has given rise to debate about the role of non-neuronal cells in PD and reignited intense research into the gut-brain axis and other non-neuronal interactions in the development of the disease. Whatever the original trigger of neuroinflammation in PD, what appears quite clear is that the aberrant activation of glial cells and other components of the immune system creates a vicious circle in which neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation nourish each other. In this review, we will provide an up-to-date summary of the main cellular alterations underlying neuroinflammation in PD, including those induced by environmental factors (e.g. the gut microbiome) and those related to the genetic background of affected patients. Starting from the lesson provided by familial forms of PD, we will discuss pathophysiological mechanisms linked to inflammation that could also play a role in idiopathic forms. Finally, we will comment on the potential clinical translatability of immunobiomarkers identified in PD patient cohorts and provide an update on current therapeutic strategies aimed at overcoming or preventing inflammation in PD.",Current neurology and neuroscience reports,2022,G Arena; K Sharma; G Agyeah; R Krüger; A Grünewald; J C Fitzgerald
35656540,The Gut Microbiome in Parkinson's Disease: A Longitudinal Study of the Impacts on Disease Progression and the Use of Device-Assisted Therapies.,"Altered gut microbiome (GM) composition has been established in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, few studies have longitudinally investigated the GM in PD, or the impact of device-assisted therapies.To investigate the temporal stability of GM profiles from PD patients on standard therapies and those initiating device-assisted therapies (DAT) and define multivariate models of disease and progression.We evaluated validated clinical questionnaires and stool samples from 74 PD patients and 74 household controls (HCs) at 0, 6, and 12 months. Faster or slower disease progression was defined from levodopa equivalence dose and motor severity measures. 19 PD patients initiating Deep Brain Stimulation or Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel were separately evaluated at 0, 6, and 12 months post-therapy initiation.Persistent underrepresentation of short-chain fatty-acid-producing bacteria, <i>Butyricicoccus, Fusicatenibacter, Lachnospiraceae ND3007 group</i>, and <i>Erysipelotrichaceae UCG-003</i>, were apparent in PD patients relative to controls. A sustained effect of DAT initiation on GM associations with PD was not observed. PD progression analysis indicated that the genus <i>Barnesiella</i> was underrepresented in faster progressing PD patients at <i>t</i> = 0 and <i>t</i> = 12 months. Two-stage predictive modeling, integrating microbiota abundances and nutritional profiles, improved predictive capacity (change in Area Under the Curve from 0.58 to 0.64) when assessed at Amplicon Sequence Variant taxonomic resolution.We present longitudinal GM studies in PD patients, showing persistently altered GM profiles suggestive of a reduced butyrogenic production potential. DATs exerted variable GM influences across the short and longer-term. We found that specific GM profiles combined with dietary factors improved prediction of disease progression in PD patients.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2022,Michal Lubomski; Xiangnan Xu; Andrew J Holmes; Samuel Muller; Jean Y H Yang; Ryan L Davis; Carolyn M Sue
35654142,Mechanistic insights into accelerated α-synuclein aggregation mediated by human microbiome-associated functional amyloids.,"The gut microbiome has been shown to have key implications in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). The Escherichia coli functional amyloid CsgA is known to accelerate α-synuclein aggregation in vitro and induce PD symptoms in mice. However, the mechanism governing CsgA-mediated acceleration of α-synuclein aggregation is unclear. Here, we show that CsgA can form stable homodimeric species that correlate with faster α-synuclein amyloid aggregation. Furthermore, we identify and characterize new CsgA homologs encoded by bacteria present in the human microbiome. These CsgA homologs display diverse aggregation kinetics, and they differ in their ability to modulate α-synuclein aggregation. Remarkably, we demonstrate that slowing down CsgA aggregation leads to an increased acceleration of α-synuclein aggregation, suggesting that the intrinsic amyloidogenicity of gut bacterial CsgA homologs affects their ability to accelerate α-synuclein aggregation. Finally, we identify a complex between CsgA and α-synuclein that functions as a platform to accelerate α-synuclein aggregation. Taken together, our work reveals complex interplay between bacterial amyloids and α-synuclein that better informs our understanding of PD causation.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2022,Sujeet S Bhoite; Yilin Han; Brandon T Ruotolo; Matthew R Chapman
35645785,Nutritional Intake and Gut Microbiome Composition Predict Parkinson's Disease.,"Models to predict Parkinson's disease (PD) incorporating alterations of gut microbiome (GM) composition have been reported with varying success.To assess the utility of GM compositional changes combined with macronutrient intake to develop a predictive model of PD.We performed a cross-sectional analysis of the GM and nutritional intake in 103 PD patients and 81 household controls (HCs). GM composition was determined by 16S amplicon sequencing of the V3-V4 region of bacterial ribosomal DNA isolated from stool. To determine multivariate disease-discriminant associations, we developed two models using Random Forest and support-vector machine (SVM) methodologies.Using updated taxonomic reference, we identified significant compositional differences in the GM profiles of PD patients in association with a variety of clinical PD characteristics. Six genera were overrepresented and eight underrepresented in PD patients relative to HCs, with the largest difference being overrepresentation of <i>Lactobacillaceae</i> at family taxonomic level. Correlation analyses highlighted multiple associations between clinical characteristics and select taxa, whilst constipation severity, physical activity and pharmacological therapies associated with changes in beta diversity. The random forest model of PD, incorporating taxonomic data at the genus level and carbohydrate contribution to total energy demonstrated the best predictive capacity [Area under the ROC Curve (AUC) of 0.74].The notable differences in GM diversity and composition when combined with clinical measures and nutritional data enabled the development of a predictive model to identify PD. These findings support the combination of GM and nutritional data as a potentially useful biomarker of PD to improve diagnosis and guide clinical management.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2022,Michal Lubomski; Xiangnan Xu; Andrew J Holmes; Samuel Muller; Jean Y H Yang; Ryan L Davis; Carolyn M Sue
35610236,Probiotics synergized with conventional regimen in managing Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is mainly managed by pharmacological therapy (e.g., Benserazide and dopamine agonists). However, prolonged use of these drugs would gradually diminish their dopaminergic effect. Gut dysbiosis was observed in some patients with PD, suggesting close association between the gut microbiome and PD. Probiotics modulate the host's gut microbiota beneficially. A 3-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted to investigate the beneficial effect of probiotic co-administration in patients with PD. Eighty-two PD patients were recruited and randomly divided into probiotic [n = 48; Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Probio-M8 (Probio-M8), Benserazide, dopamine agonists] and placebo (n = 34; placebo, Benserazide, dopamine agonists) groups. Finally, 45 and 29 patients from Probio-M8 and placebo groups provided complete fecal and serum samples for further omics analysis, respectively. The results showed that Probio-M8 co-administration conferred added benefits by improving sleep quality, alleviating anxiety, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Metagenomic analysis showed that, after the intervention, there were significantly more species-level genome bins (SGBs) of Bifidobacterium animalis, Ruminococcaceae, and Lachnospira, while less Lactobacillus fermentum and Klebsiella oxytoca in Probio-M8 group (P < 0.05). Interestingly, Lactobacillus fermentum correlated positively with the scores of UPDRS-III, HAMA, HAMD-17, and negatively with MMSE. Klebsiella oxytoca correlated negatively with feces hardness. Moreover, co-administering Probio-M8 increased SGBs involved in tryptophan degradation, gamma-aminobutyric acid, short-chain fatty acids, and secondary bile acid biosynthesis, as well as serum acetic acid and dopamine levels (P < 0.05). Taken together, Probio-M8 synergized with the conventional regimen and strengthened the clinical efficacy in managing PD, accompanied by modifications of the host's gut microbiome, gut microbial metabolic potential, and serum metabolites.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2022,Hairong Sun; Feiyan Zhao; Yuanyuan Liu; Teng Ma; Hao Jin; Keyu Quan; Bing Leng; Junwu Zhao; Xiaoling Yuan; Zhenguang Li; Fang Li; Lai-Yu Kwok; Shukun Zhang; Zhihong Sun; Jinbiao Zhang; Heping Zhang
35583791,Exploring the multifactorial aspects of Gut Microbiome in Parkinson's Disease.,"Advanced research in health science has broadened our view in approaching and understanding the pathophysiology of diseases and has also revolutionised diagnosis and treatment. Ever since the establishment of Braak's hypothesis in the propagation of alpha-synuclein from the distant olfactory and enteric nervous system towards the brain in Parkinson's Disease (PD), studies have explored and revealed the involvement of altered gut microbiota in PD. This review recapitulates the gut microbiome associated with PD severity, duration, motor and non-motor symptoms, and antiparkinsonian treatment from recent literature. Gut microbial signatures in PD are potential predictors of the disease and are speculated to be used in early diagnosis and treatment. In brief, the review also emphasises on implications of the prebiotic, probiotic, faecal microbiota transplantation, and dietary interventions as alternative treatments in modulating the disease symptoms in PD.",Folia microbiologica,2022,Sujith Pavan; Arvind N Prabhu; Sankar Prasad Gorthi; Bhabatosh Das; Ankur Mutreja; Vignesh Shetty; Thandavarayan Ramamurthy; Mamatha Ballal
35571084,Using <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> to Model Therapeutic Interventions of Neurodegenerative Diseases Targeting Microbe-Host Interactions.,"Emerging evidence from both clinical studies and animal models indicates the importance of the interaction between the gut microbiome and the brain in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). Although how microbes modulate neurodegeneration is still mostly unclear, recent studies have started to probe into the mechanisms for the communication between microbes and hosts in NDs. In this review, we highlight the advantages of using <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> (C. elegans) to disentangle the microbe-host interaction that regulates neurodegeneration. We summarize the microbial pro- and anti-neurodegenerative factors identified using the <i>C. elegans</i> ND models and the effects of many are confirmed in mouse models. Specifically, we focused on the role of bacterial amyloid proteins, such as curli, in promoting proteotoxicity and neurodegeneration by cross-seeding the aggregation of endogenous ND-related proteins, such as α-synuclein. Targeting bacterial amyloid production may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy for treating NDs, and several compounds, such as epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), were shown to suppress neurodegeneration at least partly by inhibiting curli production. Because bacterial amyloid fibrils contribute to biofilm formation, inhibition of amyloid production often leads to the disruption of biofilms. Interestingly, from a list of 59 compounds that showed neuroprotective effects in <i>C. elegans</i> and mouse ND models, we found that about half of them are known to inhibit bacterial growth or biofilm formation, suggesting a strong correlation between the neuroprotective and antibiofilm activities. Whether these potential therapeutics indeed protect neurons from proteotoxicity by inhibiting the cross-seeding between bacterial and human amyloid proteins awaits further investigations. Finally, we propose to screen the long list of antibiofilm agents, both FDA-approved drugs and novel compounds, for their neuroprotective effects and develop new pharmaceuticals that target the gut microbiome for the treatment of NDs. To this end, the <i>C. elegans</i> ND models can serve as a platform for fast, high-throughput, and low-cost drug screens that target the microbe-host interaction in NDs.",Frontiers in pharmacology,2022,Chenyin Wang; Chaogu Zheng
35565918,The Therapeutic Role of Ketogenic Diet in Neurological Disorders.,"The ketogenic diet (KD) is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate and adequate-protein diet that has gained popularity in recent years in the context of neurological diseases (NDs). The complexity of the pathogenesis of these diseases means that effective forms of treatment are still lacking. Conventional therapy is often associated with increasing tolerance and/or drug resistance. Consequently, more effective therapeutic strategies are being sought to increase the effectiveness of available forms of therapy and improve the quality of life of patients. For the moment, it seems that KD can provide therapeutic benefits in patients with neurological problems by effectively controlling the balance between pro- and antioxidant processes and pro-excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, and modulating inflammation or changing the composition of the gut microbiome. In this review we evaluated the potential therapeutic efficacy of KD in epilepsy, depression, migraine, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. In our opinion, KD should be considered as an adjuvant therapeutic option for some neurological diseases.",Nutrients,2022,Diana Pietrzak; Kamila Kasperek; Paweł Rękawek; Iwona Piątkowska-Chmiel
35513230,Evidence for immune system alterations in peripheral biological fluids in Parkinson's disease.,"Immune-related alterations in Parkinson's disease (PD) can be monitored by assessing peripheral biological fluids that show that specific inflammatory pathways contribute to a chronic pro-inflammatory status. This pro-inflammatory activity is hypothesized to be already present in the prodromal stages of PD. These pathways maintain and reinforce chronic neurodegeneration by stimulating cell activation and proliferation what triggers the pro-inflammatory status as well. The gut microbiome possibly contributes to inflammatory pathways and shows specific differences in fecal samples from PD compared to healthy controls. In PD, Bacteroides abundance correlates with inflammatory markers in blood and motor impairment. Increased pro-inflammatory and decreased anti-inflammatory bacterial colonization can lead to changes in the metabolic pathways of amino acids, inducing increased membrane permeability, described as a leaky gut, enabling advanced contact between immune cells and gut microbiome and potentially a spreading of neuroinflammation through the body via the blood. Increased cytokine blood levels in PD are correlated with disease severity, motor symptoms, and clinical phenotypes. α-synuclein is a central player in PD-associated inflammation, inducing specific T-cell activity and triggering microglial activation in the central nervous system (CNS). Misfolded α-synuclein propagation possibly results in the spreading of aggregated α-synuclein from neuron to neuron leading to a sustained neuroinflammation. This is supported by age-dependent defects of protein uptake in microglia and monocytes, so-called ""inflammaging"", including α-synuclein oligomers, as the key pathological protein in PD. Genetic risk markers and inherited forms of PD are also associated with inflammation, which is highly relevant for potential therapeutical targets. The documented associations of inflammatory markers and clinical phenotypes indicate a pro-inflammatory concept of specific PD pathophysiology here. An in-depth understanding of inflammatory mechanisms in PD from bottom (gut) to top (CNS) and vice versa is needed to design novel immunomodulatory approaches to delay or even stop PD. Future studies focusing on structured protocols in large patient cohorts with appropriate control groups and comparative analysis among studies will aid the discovery of novel candidate biomarkers.",Neurobiology of disease,2022,Michael Bartl; Mary Xylaki; Mathias Bähr; Sandrina Weber; Claudia Trenkwalder; Brit Mollenhauer
35477134,Effects of therapeutic levels of dietary antibiotics on the cecal microbiome composition of broiler chickens.,"Dietary antibiotics, including antibiotic growth promoters (AGPs), have been commonly used to improve health and growth of poultry. The present study investigated the effects of therapeutic doses of dietary antibiotics, including bacitracin methylene disalicylate (BMD), penicillin G potassium (PP) and an ionophore (salinomycin, SA), on the cecal microbiome of chickens. BMD and SA treatments were given as dietary supplements from d 1 to 35 of age. The SAPP (salinomycin+ penicillin G potassium) group was given SA as a dietary supplement from d 1 to 35 of age and PP was added to drinking water from d 19 to 24 of age to simulate common practices for control of necrotic enteritis in broilers. The cecal contents were collected from all treatment groups on d 10, 24, and 35 of age and DNA was extracted for metagenomic analysis of the cecal microbiome. The results revealed that dietary or water supplementation of therapeutic levels of antibiotics and ionophores to chickens significantly altered the cecal microbial homeostasis during different stages of the chicken life. The alpha diversity analysis showed that BMD, SA, and SAPP treatments decreased diversity and evenness of the cecal microbiome of treated chickens on d 10 of age. Species richness was also reduced on d 35 following treatment with BMD. Beta diversity analyses revealed that SAPP and BMD induced significant changes in the relative abundance of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria on d 10, while no significant differences were observed on d 24. On d 35, the non-treated control group had higher relative abundance of unclassified Gram-positive and -negative bacteria compared to SA, SAPP, and BMD treatment groups. Overall, despite their beneficial role in controlling necrotic enteritis outbreaks, the findings of this study highlight the potential negative effects of dietary supplementation of therapeutic levels of antibiotics on the gut microbiome and suggest that adjusting gut bacteria may be required to restore microbial richness and diversity of the gut microbiome following treatment with these antibiotics.",Poultry science,2022,Seyed Hossien Kairmi; Khaled Taha-Abdelaziz; Alexander Yitbarek; Mehdi Sargolzaei; Heidi Spahany; Jake Astill; Bahram Shojadoost; Mohammadali Alizadeh; Raveendra R Kulkarni; John Parkinson; Shayan Sharif
35443740,Role of diet and its effects on the gut microbiome in the pathophysiology of mental disorders.,"There is emerging evidence that diet has a major modulatory influence on brain-gut-microbiome (BGM) interactions with important implications for brain health, and for several brain disorders. The BGM system is made up of neuroendocrine, neural, and immune communication channels which establish a network of bidirectional interactions between the brain, the gut and its microbiome. Diet not only plays a crucial role in shaping the gut microbiome, but it can modulate structure and function of the brain through these communication channels. In this review, we summarize the evidence available from preclinical and clinical studies on the influence of dietary habits and interventions on a selected group of psychiatric and neurologic disorders including depression, cognitive decline, Parkinson's disease, autism spectrum disorder and epilepsy. We will particularly address the role of diet-induced microbiome changes which have been implicated in these effects, and some of which are shared between different brain disorders. While the majority of these findings have been demonstrated in preclinical and in cross-sectional, epidemiological studies, to date there is insufficient evidence from mechanistic human studies to make conclusions about causality between a specific diet and microbially mediated brain function. Many of the dietary benefits on microbiome and brain health have been attributed to anti-inflammatory effects mediated by the microbial metabolites of dietary fiber and polyphenols. The new attention given to dietary factors in brain disorders has the potential to improve treatment outcomes with currently available pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies.",Translational psychiatry,2022,J Horn; D E Mayer; S Chen; E A Mayer
35432226,To the Gut Microbiome and Beyond: The Brain-First or Body-First Hypothesis in Parkinson's Disease.,"There is continued debate regarding Parkinson's disease etiology and whether it originates in the brain or begins in the gut. Recently, evidence has been provided for both, with Parkinson's disease onset presenting as either a ""body-first"" or ""brain-first"" progression. Most research indicates those with Parkinson's disease have an altered gut microbiome compared to controls. However, some studies do not report gut microbiome differences, potentially due to the brain or body-first progression type. Based on the etiology of each proposed progression, individuals with the body-first progression may exhibit altered gut microbiomes, i.e., where short-chain fatty acid producing bacteria are reduced, while the brain-first progression may not. Future microbiome research should consider this hypothesis and investigate whether gut microbiome differences exist between each type of progression. This may further elucidate the impact of the gut microbiome in Parkinson's disease and show how it may not be homogenous across individuals with Parkinson's disease.",Frontiers in microbiology,2022,Nathan D Nuzum; Amy Loughman; Ewa A Szymlek-Gay; Wei-Peng Teo; Ashlee M Hendy; Helen Macpherson
35399136,"Intestinal Dopamine Receptor D2 is Required for Neuroprotection Against 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced Dopaminergic Neurodegeneration.","A wealth of evidence has suggested that gastrointestinal dysfunction is associated with the onset and progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the mechanisms underlying these links remain to be defined. Here, we investigated the impact of deregulation of intestinal dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) signaling in response to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Dopamine/dopamine signaling in the mouse colon decreased with ageing. Selective ablation of Drd2, but not Drd4, in the intestinal epithelium, caused a more severe loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra following MPTP challenge, and this was accompanied by a reduced abundance of succinate-producing Alleoprevotella in the gut microbiota. Administration of succinate markedly attenuated dopaminergic neuronal loss in MPTP-treated mice by elevating the mitochondrial membrane potential. This study suggests that intestinal epithelial DRD2 activity and succinate from the gut microbiome contribute to the maintenance of nigral DA neuron survival. These findings provide a potential strategy targeting neuroinflammation-related neurological disorders such as PD.",Neuroscience bulletin,2022,Hairong Peng; Shui Yu; Yukai Zhang; Yanqing Yin; Jiawei Zhou
35393656,The human microbiome in disease and pathology.,"This narrative review seeks to examine the relationships between bacterial microbiomes and infectious disease. This is achieved by detailing how different human host microbiomes develop and function, from the earliest infant acquisitions of maternal and environmental species through to the full development of microbiomes by adulthood. Communication between bacterial species or communities of species within and outside of the microbiome is a factor in both maintenance of homeostasis and management of threats from the external environment. Dysbiosis of this homeostasis is key to understanding the development of disease states. Several microbiomes and the microbiota within are used as prime examples of how changes in species composition, particularly at the phylum level, leads to such diverse conditions as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), type 2 diabetes, psoriasis, Parkinson's disease, reflux oesophagitis and others. The review examines spatial relationships between microbiomes to understand how dysbiosis in the gut microbiome in particular can influence diseases in distant host sites via routes such as the gut-lung, gut-skin and gut-brain axes. Microbiome interaction with host processes such as adaptive immunity is increasingly identified as critical to developing the capacity of the immune system to react to pathogens. Dysbiosis of essential bacteria involved in modification of host substrates such as bile acid components can result in development of Crohn's disease, small intestine bacterial overgrowth, hepatic cancer and obesity. Interactions between microbiomes in distantly located sites are being increasingly being identified, resulting in a 'whole of body' effect by the combined host microbiome.","APMIS : acta pathologica, microbiologica, et immunologica Scandinavica",2022,Jim Manos

The fruit fly, <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, is a valuable animal model for studying host-gut microbiota interactions in translational aspects. The availability of powerful genetic tools and resources in <i>Drosophila</i> allowed the scientists to unravel the mechanisms by which the gut microbes affect fitness, health, and behavior of their hosts. <i>Drosophila</i> models have been extensively used not only to study animal behaviors (i.e., courtship, aggression, sleep, and learning & memory), but also some human related neurodegenerative diseases (i.e., Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease) in the past.

35326429,Hydrogen Sulfide Produced by Gut Bacteria May Induce Parkinson's Disease.,"Several bacterial species can generate hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S). Study evidence favors the view that the microbiome of the colon harbors increased amounts of H<sub>2</sub>S producing bacteria in Parkinson's disease. Additionally, H<sub>2</sub>S can easily penetrate cell membranes and enter the cell interior. In the cells, excessive amounts of H<sub>2</sub>S can potentially release cytochrome c protein from the mitochondria, increase the iron content of the cytosolic iron pool, and increase the amount of reactive oxygen species. These events can lead to the formation of alpha-synuclein oligomers and fibrils in cells containing the alpha-synuclein protein. In addition, bacterially produced H<sub>2</sub>S can interfere with the body urate metabolism and affect the blood erythrocytes and lymphocytes. Gut bacteria responsible for increased H<sub>2</sub>S production, especially the mucus-associated species of the bacterial genera belonging to the Desulfovibrionaceae and Enterobacteriaceae families, are likely play a role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Special attention should be devoted to changes not only in the colonic but also in the duodenal microbiome composition with regard to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Influenza infections may increase the risk of Parkinson's disease by causing the overgrowth of H<sub>2</sub>S-producing bacteria both in the colon and duodenum.",Cells,2022,Kari Erik Murros
35317228,Analysis methods for the gut microbiome in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.,"For a long time, the central nervous system was believed to be the only regulator of cognitive functions. However, accumulating evidence suggests that the composition of the microbiome is strongly associated with brain functions and diseases. Indeed, the gut microbiome is involved in neuropsychiatric diseases (e.g., depression, autism spectrum disorder, and anxiety) and neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease). In this review, we provide an overview of the link between the gut microbiome and neuropsychiatric or neurodegenerative disorders. We also introduce analytical methods used to assess the connection between the gut microbiome and the brain. The limitations of the methods used at present are also discussed.

35307514,Gut dysbiosis and age-related neurological diseases in females.,"Historically, females have been underrepresented in biological research. With increased interest in the gut microbiome and the gut-brain axis, it is important for researchers to pursue studies that consider sex as a biological variable. The composition of the gut microbiome is influenced by environmental factors, disease, diet, and varies with age and by sex. Detrimental changes in the gut microbiome, referred to as dysbiosis, is believed to influence the development and progression of age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and stroke. Many are investigating the changes in microbial populations in order or to better understand the role of the gut immunity and the microbiome in neurodegenerative diseases, many of which the exact etiology remains elusive, and no cures exist.  Others are working to find diagnostic markers for earlier detection, or to therapeutically modulate microbial populations using probiotics. However, while all these diseases present in reproductively senescent females, most studies only use male animals for their experimental design. Reproductively senescent females have been shown to have differences in disease progression, inflammatory responses, and microbiota composition, therefore, for research to be translational to affected populations it is necessary for appropriate models to be used. This review discusses factors that influence the gut microbiome and the gut brain axis in females, and highlights studies that have investigated the role of dysbiosis in age-related neurodegenerative disorders that have included females in their study design.",Neurobiology of disease,2022,Janelle M Korf; Bhanu P Ganesh; Louise D McCullough
35281490,Mechanistic Insights Into Gut Microbiome Dysbiosis-Mediated Neuroimmune Dysregulation and Protein Misfolding and Clearance in the Pathogenesis of Chronic Neurodegenerative Disorders.,"The human gut microbiota is a complex, dynamic, and highly diverse community of microorganisms. Beginning as early as <i>in utero</i> fetal development and continuing through birth to late-stage adulthood, the crosstalk between the gut microbiome and brain is essential for modulating various metabolic, neurodevelopmental, and immune-related pathways. Conversely, microbial dysbiosis - defined as alterations in richness and relative abundances - of the gut is implicated in the pathogenesis of several chronic neurological and neurodegenerative disorders. Evidence from large-population cohort studies suggests that individuals with neurodegenerative conditions have an altered gut microbial composition as well as microbial and serum metabolomic profiles distinct from those in the healthy population. Dysbiosis is also linked to psychiatric and gastrointestinal complications - comorbidities often associated with the prodromal phase of Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Studies have identified potential mediators that link gut dysbiosis and neurological disorders. Recent findings have also elucidated the potential mechanisms of disease pathology in the enteric nervous system prior to the onset of neurodegeneration. This review highlights the functional pathways and mechanisms, particularly gut microbe-induced chronic inflammation, protein misfolding, propagation of disease-specific pathology, defective protein clearance, and autoimmune dysregulation, linking gut microbial dysbiosis and neurodegeneration. In addition, we also discuss how pathogenic transformation of microbial composition leads to increased endotoxin production and fewer beneficial metabolites, both of which could trigger immune cell activation and enteric neuronal dysfunction. These can further disrupt intestinal barrier permeability, aggravate the systemic pro-inflammatory state, impair blood-brain barrier permeability and recruit immune mediators leading to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Continued biomedical advances in understanding the microbiota-gut-brain axis will extend the frontier of neurodegenerative disorders and enable the utilization of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to mitigate the pathological burden of these diseases.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2022,Piyush Padhi; Carter Worth; Gary Zenitsky; Huajun Jin; Kumar Sambamurti; Vellareddy Anantharam; Arthi Kanthasamy; Anumantha G Kanthasamy
35207632,Gastrointestinal Dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease: Current and Potential Therapeutics.,"Abnormalities in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of Parkinson's disease (PD) sufferers were first reported over 200 years ago; however, the extent and role of GI dysfunction in PD disease progression is still unknown. GI dysfunctions, including dysphagia, gastroparesis, and constipation, are amongst the most prevalent non-motor symptoms in PD. These symptoms not only impact patient quality of life, but also complicate disease management. Conventional treatment pathways for GI dysfunctions (i.e., constipation), such as increasing fibre and fluid intake, and the use of over-the-counter laxatives, are generally ineffective in PD patients, and approved compounds such as guanylate cyclase C agonists and selective 5-hyroxytryptamine 4 receptor agonists have demonstrated limited efficacy. Thus, identification of potential targets for novel therapies to alleviate PD-induced GI dysfunctions are essential to improve clinical outcomes and quality of life in people with PD. Unlike the central nervous system (CNS), where PD pathology and the mechanisms involved in CNS damage are relatively well characterised, the effect of PD at the cellular and tissue level in the enteric nervous system (ENS) remains unclear, making it difficult to alleviate or reverse GI symptoms. However, the resurgence of interest in understanding how the GI tract is involved in various disease states, such as PD, has resulted in the identification of novel therapeutic avenues. This review focuses on common PD-related GI symptoms, and summarizes the current treatments available and their limitations. We propose that by targeting the intestinal barrier, ENS, and/or the gut microbiome, may prove successful in alleviating PD-related GI symptoms, and discuss emerging therapies and potential drugs that could be repurposed to target these areas.",Journal of personalized medicine,2022,Myat Noe Han; David I Finkelstein; Rachel M McQuade; Shanti Diwakarla
35203906,Parkinson's Disease in Light of the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"In this review we attempt to collate the existing scientific evidence regarding the possible role of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD), as well as to investigate the impact of PD/parkinsonism on the clinical course of the viral infection itself. Since etiology of PD is not completely understood, various studies suggest different potential links between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and PD. Suggested connections include, among others, similar prodromal symptoms, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system involvement, or gut microbiome dysbiosis participation. Despite the initial assumptions that, as a mainly elderly population suffering from rigidity of respiratory muscles, impairment of cough reflex, and dyspnea, PD patients would be more susceptible to viral infection, and would experience a more aggressive course of COVID-19, the published scientific reports contain mutually exclusive data that require further investigation and meta-analysis.",Brain sciences,2022,Anna Drelich-Zbroja; Mateusz Cheda; Maryla Kuczyńska; Izabela Dąbrowska; Ewa Kopyto; Izabela Halczuk
35189807,Rifaximin modulates TRH and TRH-like peptide expression throughout the brain and peripheral tissues of male rats.,"The TRH/TRH-R1 receptor signaling pathway within the neurons of the dorsal vagal complex is an important mediator of the brain-gut axis. Mental health and protection from a variety of neuropathologies, such as autism, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, major depression, migraine and epilepsy are influenced by the gut microbiome and is mediated by the vagus nerve. The antibiotic rifaximin (RF) does not cross the gut-blood barrier. It changes the composition of the gut microbiome resulting in therapeutic benefits for traveler's diarrhea, hepatic encephalopathy, and prostatitis. TRH and TRH-like peptides, with the structure pGlu-X-Pro-NH<sub>2</sub>, where ""X"" can be any amino acid residue, have reproduction-enhancing, caloric-restriction-like, anti-aging, pancreatic-β cell-, cardiovascular-, and neuroprotective effects. TRH and TRH-like peptides occur not only throughout the CNS but also in peripheral tissues. To elucidate the involvement of TRH-like peptides in brain-gut-reproductive system interactions 16 male Sprague-Dawley rats, 203 ± 6 g, were divided into 4 groups (n = 4/group): the control (CON) group remained on ad libitum Purina rodent chow and water for 10 days until decapitation, acute (AC) group receiving 150 mg RF/kg powdered rodent chow for 24 h providing 150 mg RF/kg body weight for 200 g rats, chronic (CHR) animals receiving RF for 10 days; withdrawal (WD) rats receiving RF for 8 days and then normal chow for 2 days.Significant changes in the levels of TRH and TRH-like peptides occurred throughout the brain and peripheral tissues in response to RF. The number of significant changes in TRH and TRH-like peptide levels in brain resulting from RF treatment, in descending order were: medulla (16), piriform cortex (8), nucleus accumbens (7), frontal cortex (5), striatum (3), amygdala (3), entorhinal cortex (3), anterior (2), and posterior cingulate (2), hippocampus (1), hypothalamus (0) and cerebellum (0). The corresponding ranking for peripheral tissues were: prostate (6), adrenals (4), pancreas (3), liver (2), testis (1), heart (0).The sensitivity of TRH and TRH-like peptide expression to RF treatment, particularly in the medulla oblongata and prostate, is consistent with the participation of these peptides in the therapeutic effects of RF.",BMC neuroscience,2022,Albert Eugene Pekary; Albert Sattin
35163103,Gut-Brain Axis as a Pathological and Therapeutic Target for Neurodegenerative Disorders.,"Human lifestyle and dietary behaviors contribute to disease onset and progression. Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), considered multifactorial disorders, have been associated with changes in the gut microbiome. NDDs display pathologies that alter brain functions with a tendency to worsen over time. NDDs are a worldwide health problem; in the US alone, 12 million Americans will suffer from NDDs by 2030. While etiology may vary, the gut microbiome serves as a key element underlying NDD development and prognosis. In particular, an inflammation-associated microbiome plagues NDDs. Conversely, sequestration of this inflammatory microbiome by a correction in the dysbiotic state of the gut may render therapeutic effects on NDDs. To this end, treatment with short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria, the main metabolites responsible for maintaining gut homeostasis, ameliorates the inflammatory microbiome. This intimate pathological link between the gut and NDDs suggests that the gut-brain axis (GBA) acts as an underexplored area for developing therapies for NDDs. Traditionally, the classification of NDDs depends on their clinical presentation, mostly manifesting as extrapyramidal and pyramidal movement disorders, with neuropathological evaluation at autopsy as the gold standard for diagnosis. In this review, we highlight the evolving notion that GBA stands as an equally sensitive pathological marker of NDDs, particularly in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and chronic stroke. Additionally, GBA represents a potent therapeutic target for treating NDDs.",International journal of molecular sciences,2022,Alma Rosa Lezama Toledo; Germán Rivera Monroy; Felipe Esparza Salazar; Jea-Young Lee; Shalini Jain; Hariom Yadav; Cesario Venturina Borlongan
35145822,Constipation and Cigarette Smoking Are Independent Influences for Parkinson's Disease.,"Background Tobacco smokers have reduced Parkinson's disease (PD) risk. Some patients with PD experience constipation long before they develop mobility problems, and constipation is a frequent complaint of people who try to stop smoking. Recently, the gut microbiome has been implicated in PD. Methods In the present study, we analyzed the relationship between smoking and constipation in subjects with PD and controls. We wished to determine whether the effects of smoking and constipation were independent or whether they might be interrelated. To evaluate the relationship, we used a cohort of subjects from the UK Biobank (UKB). Results In 501,174 subjects, the decreased risk of Parkinson's disease with increased smoking was significant (p < 0.001, two-tailed Fisher's exact test). The increased risk of constipation in subjects with PD was significant (p = 0.001, two-tailed Fisher's exact test). Logistic regression was performed; sex, age, constipation, and smoking were the independent variables, and PD present or absent was the dependent variable. The PD odds ratio (OR) for males was 1.790 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.629-1.966) times that for females, indicating that PD is more common in men. The risk of PD increased by 1.140 (95% CI: 1.131-1.149) with every year of age. Constipation increased the risk of PD by 4.043 (95% CI: 1.901-8.599). Smoking diminished PD risk by 0.772 (95% CI: 0.690-0.863). Drinking coffee was associated with a reduced risk of PD (OR: 0.815 (95% CI: 0.730-0.909). Drinking tea reduced PD risk by 0.979 (95% CI: 0.962-0.997) for each cup per day. The effects of sex, age, constipation, smoking, drinking coffee, and drinking tea were independent and significant. Conclusion Our analysis suggests that the favorable effect of smoking on PD is independent of the detrimental effect of constipation. Smoking reduces PD risk because it not only stimulates the bowel to empty and prevents constipation but also alters the gut microbiome. Another factor, perhaps the tobacco component diterpenoids, may be responsible for the PD risk-reducing effect.",Cureus,2022,Steven Lehrer; Peter H Rheinstein
35057561,Are We What We Eat? Impact of Diet on the Gut-Brain Axis in Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease is characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms, such as defects in the gut function, which may occur before the motor symptoms. To date, there are therapies that can improve these symptoms, but there is no cure to avoid the development or exacerbation of this disorder. Dysbiosis of gut microbiota could have a crucial role in the gut-brain axis, which is a bidirectional communication between the central nervous system and the enteric nervous system. Diet can affect the microbiota composition, impacting gut-brain axis functionality. Gut microbiome restoration through probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics or other dietary means could have the potential to slow PD progression. In this review, we will discuss the influence of diet on the bidirectional communication between gut and brain, thus supporting the hypothesis that this disorder could begin in the gut. We also focus on how food-based therapies might then have an influence on PD and could ameliorate non-motor as well as motor symptoms.",Nutrients,2022,Margherita Alfonsetti; Vanessa Castelli; Michele d'Angelo
35055364,Microbiome Changes in Humans with Parkinson's Disease after Photobiomodulation Therapy: A Retrospective Study.,"There is a paucity of information on the effect of photobiomodulation therapy on gut microbiome composition. Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder with few management options, although the gut microbiome has been suggested as a potential avenue of treatment. We retrospectively analysed the microbiome from human stool samples from a previously published study, which had demonstrated the efficacy of photobiomodulation to treat Parkinson's patients' symptoms. Specifically, we have observed changes in the microbiome of Parkinson's patients after a 12-week treatment regimen with photobiomodulation to the abdomen, neck, head and nose. Noted were positive changes in the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (F:B) ratio, which is often interpreted as a proxy for gut health.",Journal of personalized medicine,2022,Brian Bicknell; Ann Liebert; Craig S McLachlan; Hosen Kiat
35032636,Impact of intestinal disorders on central and peripheral nervous system diseases.,"Brain injuries and neurological diseases have a significant impact on the gut microbiome and the gut barrier. Reciprocally, gut disorders, such as Inflammatory Bowel Syndromes (IBS), can affect the development and pathology of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases, although this aspect is less well studied and is the focus of this review. Inflammatory Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a chronic and debilitating functional gastrointestinal disorder afflicting an estimated 9-23% of the world's population. A hallmark of this disease is leaky gut, a pathology in which the integrity of the gut blood barrier is compromised, causing gut contents such as immune cells and microbiota to enter the bloodstream leading to low-grade systemic inflammation. The increased levels of inflammation associated cytokines in circulation has the potential to affect all organs, including the brain. Although the brain is protected by the blood brain barrier, inflammation associated cytokines can damage the junctions in this barrier and allow brain infiltration of peripheral immune cells. Central inflammation in the brain is associated with various neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and neuropsychiatric disorders, namely, depression, and anxiety. Neurodegenerative diseases are of particular concern due to the anticipated rise in the population of the elderly and consequently, the prevalence of these diseases. Additionally, depression and anxiety are the most common mental illnesses affecting roughly 18% of the American population. In this review, we will explore the mechanisms by which IBS can influence the risk and severity of neurological disease.",Neurobiology of disease,2022,Yumna El-Hakim; Shameena Bake; Kathiresh Kumar Mani; Farida Sohrabji
34985325,A Comprehensive Review on the Role of the Gut Microbiome in Human Neurological Disorders.,"The human body is full of an extensive number of commensal microbes, consisting of bacteria, viruses, and fungi, collectively termed the human microbiome. The initial acquisition of microbiota occurs from both the external and maternal environments, and the vast majority of them colonize the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). These microbial communities play a central role in the maturation and development of the immune system, the central nervous system, and the GIT system and are also responsible for essential metabolic pathways. Various factors, including host genetic predisposition, environmental factors, lifestyle, diet, antibiotic or nonantibiotic drug use, etc., affect the composition of the gut microbiota. Recent publications have highlighted that an imbalance in the gut microflora, known as dysbiosis, is associated with the onset and progression of neurological disorders. Moreover, characterization of the microbiome-host cross talk pathways provides insight into novel therapeutic strategies. Novel preclinical and clinical research on interventions related to the gut microbiome for treating neurological conditions, including autism spectrum disorders, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and stroke, hold significant promise. This review aims to present a comprehensive overview of the potential involvement of the human gut microbiome in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders, with a particular emphasis on the potential of microbe-based therapies and/or diagnostic microbial biomarkers. This review also discusses the potential health benefits of the administration of probiotics, prebiotics, postbiotics, and synbiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation in neurological disorders.",Clinical microbiology reviews,2022,Shokufeh Ghasemian Sorboni; Hanieh Shakeri Moghaddam; Reza Jafarzadeh-Esfehani; Saman Soleimanpour
34980288,Performance of distinct microbial based solutions in a Campylobacter infection challenge model in poultry.,"Antibiotic growth promoters (AGPs) are commonly used within poultry production to improve feed conversion, bird growth, and reduce morbidity and mortality from clinical and subclinical diseases. Due to the association between AGP usage and rising antimicrobial resistance, the industry has explored new strategies including the use of probiotics and other microbial-based interventions to promote the development of a healthy microbiome in birds and mitigate against infections associated with food safety and food security. While previous studies have largely focused on the ability of probiotics to protect against Clostridium perfringens and Salmonella enterica, much less is known concerning their impact on Campylobacter jejuni, a near commensal of the chicken gut microbiome that nevertheless is a major cause of food poisoning in humans.Here we compare the efficacy of four microbial interventions (two single strain probiotics, the bacterium-Pediococcus acidilactici, and the yeast-Saccharomyces cerevisiae boulardii; and two complex, competitive exclusion, consortia-Aviguard and CEL) to bacitracin, a commonly used AGP, to modulate chicken gut microbiota and subsequently impact C. jejuni infection in poultry. Cecal samples were harvested at 30- and 39-days post hatch to assess Campylobacter burden and examine their impact on the gut microbiota. While the different treatments did not significantly decrease C. jejuni burden relative to the untreated controls, both complex consortia resulted in significant decreases relative to treatment with bacitracin. Analysis of 16S rDNA profiles revealed a distinct microbial signature associated with each microbial intervention. For example, treatment with Aviguard and CEL increased the relative abundance of Bacteroidaceae and Rikenellaceae respectively. Furthermore, Aviguard promoted a less complex microbial community compared to other treatments.Depending upon the individual needs of the producer, our results illustrate the potential of each microbial interventions to serve flock-specific requirements.",Animal microbiome,2022,Maxine Ty; Khaled Taha-Abdelaziz; Vanessa Demey; Mathieu Castex; Shayan Sharif; John Parkinson
38488556,Unraveling the gut-brain axis: the impact of steroid hormones and nutrition on Parkinson's disease.,"This comprehensive review explores the intricate relationship between nutrition, the gut microbiome, steroid hormones, and Parkinson's disease within the context of the gut-brain axis. The gut-brain axis plays a pivotal role in neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease, encompassing diverse components such as the gut microbiota, immune system, metabolism, and neural pathways. The gut microbiome, profoundly influenced by dietary factors, emerges as a key player. Nutrition during the first 1000 days of life shapes the gut microbiota composition, influencing immune responses and impacting both child development and adult health. High-fat, high-sugar diets can disrupt this delicate balance, contributing to inflammation and immune dysfunction. Exploring nutritional strategies, the Mediterranean diet's anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties show promise in reducing Parkinson's disease risk. Microbiome-targeted dietary approaches and the ketogenic diet hold the potential in improving brain disorders. Beyond nutrition, emerging research uncovers potential interactions between steroid hormones, nutrition, and Parkinson's disease. Progesterone, with its anti-inflammatory properties and presence in the nervous system, offers a novel option for Parkinson's disease therapy. Its ability to enhance neuroprotection within the enteric nervous system presents exciting prospects. The review addresses the hypothesis that α-synuclein aggregates originate from the gut and may enter the brain via the vagus nerve. Gastrointestinal symptoms preceding motor symptoms support this hypothesis. Dysfunctional gut-brain signaling during gut dysbiosis contributes to inflammation and neurotransmitter imbalances, emphasizing the potential of microbiota-based interventions. In summary, this review uncovers the complex web of interactions between nutrition, the gut microbiome, steroid hormones, and Parkinson's disease within the gut-brain axis framework. Understanding these connections not only offers novel therapeutic insights but also illuminates the origins of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease.",Neural regeneration research,2024,Paula Maria Neufeld; Ralf A Nettersheim; Veronika Matschke; Matthias Vorgerd; Sarah Stahlke; Carsten Theiss
38357211,Gut microbiota and metabolite variations in a migraine mouse model.,"Migraine is a prevalent clinical disorder characterized by recurrent unilateral throbbing headache episodes accompanied by symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia. Despite its common occurrence, the diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment of migraine remain controversial. Extensive research has implicated the gut microbiota in various central nervous system disorders, including anxiety disorders, depression, and Parkinson's disease. Some studies have also suggested that migraine may stem from disruptions to neurohormones and metabolism. This study aimed to investigate the disparities in gut microbiota and metabolites between migraine mice model and normal mice to shed light on the underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutic approaches. Distinct differences in gut microbial composition were observed between the migraine mouse model and normal mouse, indicating a potential correlation between these variations and the pathogenesis of migraine. This study provides evidence of differences in gut microbiota composition and metabolites between a migraine mouse model and normal mice, which showed that Akkermansiaceae constituted the most abundant taxon in the sham injection mouse group, while Lachnospiraceae constituted the most prevalent group in the migraine mouse model group. The associations between the abundances of <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> and Lachnospiraceae bacteria and metabolites suggested their potential roles in the pathogenesis of migraine. The altered abundance of Lachnospiraceae observed in migraine-afflicted mice and its correlations with changes in metabolites suggest that it may affect the host's health. Thus, probiotic therapy emerges as a possible treatment for migraine. Moreover, significant disparities in gut metabolites were observed between the migraine mouse model and normal mice. These alterations encompass multiple metabolic pathways, suggesting that metabolic disturbances may also contribute to the development of migraines.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2023,Dan Wang; Xu Liu; Suming Shi; Tongli Ren; Wuqing Wang
38275646,"Trihexyphenidyl Alters Its Host's Metabolism, Neurobehavioral Patterns, and Gut Microbiome Feedback Loop-The Modulating Role of <i>Anacyclus pyrethrum</i>.","Trihexyphenidyl (THP)-a synthetic anticholinergic medication used to manage parkinsonism and extrapyramidal symptoms-has gained significant clinical recognition. However, there is a critical gap in understanding its withdrawal effects. This study investigates the intricate interplay between gut microbiota and oxidative stress during THP withdrawal. Furthermore, it explores the therapeutic potential of <i>Anacyclus pyrethrum</i> (AEAP) for alleviating the associated adverse effects. This comprehensive research combines behavioral tests, biochemical analysis, gut microbiome assessment utilizing matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), and oxidative stress measures. The results reveal that the chronic administration of THP leads to severe withdrawal syndrome, marked by heightened anxiety, depressive-like behaviors, increased cortisol levels, elevated oxidative stress, and gut dysbiosis. However, the administration of AEAP alongside THP shows a significant capacity to mitigate these deleterious effects. Co-treatment and post-treatment with AEAP increased bacterial density and diversity, promoting the proliferation of beneficial bacteria associated with improved gut health. Furthermore, AEAP administration reduced cortisol levels and exhibited potent antioxidant properties, effectively countering the THP-induced oxidative damage. This study highlights the withdrawal effects of THP and underscores the therapeutic potential of AEAP for managing these symptoms. The findings reveal its promising effects in alleviating behavioral and biochemical impairments, reducing oxidative stress, and restoring gut microbiota, which could significantly impact the clinical management of THP withdrawal and potentially extend to other substance withdrawal scenarios.","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,Abdelmounaim Baslam; Hajar Azraida; Rachida Aboufatima; Mohamed Ait-El-Mokhtar; Ilham Dilagui; Samia Boussaa; Abderrahman Chait; Marouane Baslam
38229613,Dysbiosis of the Beneficial Gut Bacteria in Patients with Parkinson's Disease from India.,"Recent advancement in understanding neurological disorders has revealed the involvement of dysbiosis of the gut microbiota in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). We sequenced microbial DNA using fecal samples collected from PD cases and healthy controls (HCs) to evaluate the role of gut microbiota.Full-length bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing of fecal samples was performed using amplified polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products on the GridION Nanopore sequencer. Sequenced data were analyzed using web-based tools BugSeq and MicrobiomeAnalyst.We found that certain bacterial families like Clostridia UCG 014, Cristensenellaceae, and Oscillospiraceae are higher in abundance, and Lachinospiracea, Coriobacteriaceae and genera associated with short-chain fatty acid production, <i>Faecalibacterium</i>, <i>Fusicatenibacter</i>, <i>Roseburia</i> and <i>Blautia</i>, are lower in abundance among PD cases when compared with the HC. Genus <i>Akkermansia</i>, <i>Dialister</i>, <i>Bacteroides</i>, and <i>Lachnospiraceae NK4A136</i> group positively correlated with constipation in PD.Observations from this study support the other global research on the PD gut microbiome background and provide fresh insight into the gut microbial composition of PD patients from a south Indian population.

38203294,Molecular Mechanisms of Neuroprotection by Ketone Bodies and Ketogenic Diet in Cerebral Ischemia and Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Ketone bodies (KBs), such as acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate, serve as crucial alternative energy sources during glucose deficiency. KBs, generated through ketogenesis in the liver, are metabolized into acetyl-CoA in extrahepatic tissues, entering the tricarboxylic acid cycle and electron transport chain for ATP production. Reduced glucose metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction correlate with increased neuronal death and brain damage during cerebral ischemia and neurodegeneration. Both KBs and the ketogenic diet (KD) demonstrate neuroprotective effects by orchestrating various cellular processes through metabolic and signaling functions. They enhance mitochondrial function, mitigate oxidative stress and apoptosis, and regulate epigenetic and post-translational modifications of histones and non-histone proteins. Additionally, KBs and KD contribute to reducing neuroinflammation and modulating autophagy, neurotransmission systems, and gut microbiome. This review aims to explore the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms underpinning the neuroprotective effects of KBs and KD against brain damage in cerebral ischemia and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.",International journal of molecular sciences,2023,Jiwon Jang; Su Rim Kim; Jo Eun Lee; Seoyeon Lee; Hyeong Jig Son; Wonchae Choe; Kyung-Sik Yoon; Sung Soo Kim; Eui-Ju Yeo; Insug Kang
38176929,Research Progress of Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis in Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by misfolding of α-synuclein. Clinical manifestations include slowly developing resting tremor, muscle rigidity, bradykinesia and abnormal gait. The pathological mechanisms underlying PD are complex and yet to be fully elucidated. Clinical studies suggest that the onset of gastrointestinal symptoms may precede motor symptoms in PD patients. The microbiota-gut-brain axis plays a bidirectional communication role between the enteric nervous system and the central nervous system. This bidirectional communication between the brain and gut is influenced by the neural, immune and endocrine systems related to the gut microbiome. A growing body of evidence indicates a strong link between dysregulation of the gut microbiota and PD. In this review, we present recent progress in understanding the relationship between the microbiota-gut-brain axis and PD. We focus on the role of the gut microbiota, the unique changes observed in the microbiome of PD patients, and the impact of these changes on the progression of PD.

38106100,Hypothesizing mechanistic links between microbes and disease using knowledge graphs.,"Knowledge graphs have found broad biomedical applications, providing useful representations of complex knowledge. Although plentiful evidence exists linking the gut microbiome to disease, mechanistic understanding of those relationships remains generally elusive. Here we demonstrate the potential of knowledge graphs to hypothesize plausible mechanistic accounts of host-microbe interactions in disease. To do so, we constructed a knowledge graph of linked microbes, genes and metabolites called MGMLink. Using a semantically constrained shortest path search through the graph and a novel path prioritization methodology based on cosine similarity, we show that this knowledge supports inference of mechanistic hypotheses that explain observed relationships between microbes and disease phenotypes. We discuss specific applications of this methodology in inflammatory bowel disease and Parkinson's disease. This approach enables mechanistic hypotheses surrounding the complex interactions between gut microbes and disease to be generated in a scalable and comprehensive manner.",bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,2023,Brook Santangelo; Michael Bada; Lawrence Hunter; Catherine Lozupone
38078745,Microbiota-mediated effects of Parkinson's disease medications on Parkinsonian non-motor symptoms in male transgenic mice.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by motor symptoms and a loss of dopaminergic neurons, as well as a variety of non-motor symptoms, including constipation, depression, and anxiety. Recently, evidence has also accumulated for a link between gut microbiota and PD. Most PD patients are on dopamine replacement therapy, primarily a combination of L-DOPA and carbidopa; however, the effect of these medications on the microbiota and non-motor symptoms in PD is still unclear. In this study, we explored the effects of chronic oral treatment with L-DOPA plus carbidopa (LDCD) on the gut microbiota and non-motor symptoms in males of a transgenic mouse model of PD (dbl-PAC-Tg(<i>SNCA</i><sup>A53T</sup>);<i>Snca</i>-/-). To further test whether the effects of these PD medications were mediated by the gut microbiota, oral antibiotic treatment (Abx; vancomycin and neomycin) was included both with and without concurrent LDCD treatment. Post-treatment, the gastrointestinal, motor, and behavioral phenotypes were profiled, and fecal, ileal, and jejunal samples were analyzed for gut microbiota composition by 16S sequencing. LDCD treatment was found to improve symptoms of constipation and depression in this model, concurrent with increases in <i>Turicibacter</i> abundance in the ileum. Abx treatment worsened the symptoms of constipation, possibly through decreased levels of short-chain fatty acids and disrupted gut barrier function. LDCD + Abx treatment showed an interaction effect on behavioral symptoms that was also associated with ileal <i>Turicibacter</i> levels. This study demonstrates that, in a mouse model, PD medications and antibiotics affect PD-related non-motor symptoms potentially <i>via</i> the gut microbiota.IMPORTANCEThe motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) are caused by a loss of dopamine-producing neurons and are commonly treated with dopamine replacement therapy (L-DOPA plus carbidopa). PD has also been associated with altered gut microbiota composition. However, the effects of these PD medications on PD-related non-motor symptoms and the gut microbiota have not been well characterized. This study uses a transgenic mouse model of PD to help resolve medication-induced microbiota alterations from those that are potentially disease relevant within a PD context, and explores how long-term treatment may interact with the gut microbiota to impact non-motor symptoms.",mSphere,2024,Nina Radisavljevic; Avril Metcalfe-Roach; Mihai Cirstea; M Mahebali Tabusi; Tahereh Bozorgmehr; Haggai Bar-Yoseph; B Brett Finlay
38075261,Gut-brain axis: gut dysbiosis and psychiatric disorders in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.,"Gut dysbiosis and psychiatric symptoms are common early manifestations of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). These diseases, characterised by progressive neuron loss and pathological protein accumulation, impose debilitating effects on patients. Recently, these pathological proteins have been linked with gut dysbiosis and psychiatric disorders. The gut-brain axis links the enteric and central nervous systems, acting as a bidirectional communication pathway to influence brain function and behavior. The relationship triad between gut dysbiosis, psychiatric disorders, and neurodegeneration has been investigated in pairs; however, evidence suggests that they are all interrelated and a deeper understanding is required to unravel the nuances of neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, this review aims to summarise the current literature on the roles of gut dysbiosis and psychiatric disorders in pathological protein-related neurodegenerative diseases. We discussed how changes in the gut environment can influence the development of psychiatric symptoms and the progression of neurodegeneration and how these features overlap in AD and PD. Moreover, research on the interplay between gut dysbiosis, psychiatric disorders, and neurodegeneration remains in its early phase. In this review, we highlighted potential therapeutic approaches aimed at mitigating gastrointestinal problems and psychiatric disorders to alter the rate of neurodegeneration. Further research to assess the molecular mechanisms underlying AD and PD pathogenesis remains crucial for developing more effective treatments and achieving earlier diagnoses. Moreover, exploring non-invasive, early preventive measures and interventions is a relatively unexplored but important avenue of research in neurodegenerative diseases.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2023,Charlotte R Denman; Sang Myun Park; Junghyun Jo
38045924,Microbiota-gut-brain axis and ketogenic diet: how close are we to tackling epilepsy?,"The microbiota-gut-brain axis refers to the intricate bidirectional communication between commensal microorganisms residing in the digestive tract and the central nervous system, along neuroendocrine, metabolic, immune, and inflammatory pathways. This axis has been suggested to play a role in several neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy, paving the way for microbiome-based intervention strategies for the mitigation and treatment of symptoms. Epilepsy is a multifaceted neurological condition affecting more than 50 million individuals worldwide, 30% of whom do not respond to conventional pharmacological therapies. Among the first-hand microbiota modulation strategies, nutritional interventions represent an easily applicable option in both clinical and home settings. In this narrative review, we summarize the mechanisms underlying the microbiota-gut-brain axis involvement in epilepsy, discuss the impact of antiepileptic drugs on the gut microbiome, and then the impact of a particular dietary pattern, the ketogenic diet, on the microbiota-gut-brain axis in epileptic patients. The investigation of the microbiota response to non-pharmacological therapies is an ever-expanding field with the potential to allow the design of increasingly accessible and successful intervention strategies.",Microbiome research reports,2023,Mariachiara Mengoli; Gabriele Conti; Marco Fabbrini; Marco Candela; Patrizia Brigidi; Silvia Turroni; Monica Barone
38024855,Protective effects of dioscin against Parkinson's disease via regulating bile acid metabolism through remodeling gut microbiome/GLP-1 signaling.,"It is necessary to explore potent therapeutic agents via regulating gut microbiota and metabolism to combat Parkinson's disease (PD). Dioscin, a bioactive steroidal saponin, shows various activities. However, its effects and mechanisms against PD are limited. In this study, dioscin dramatically alleviated neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, and restored the disorders of mice induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). 16 S rDNA sequencing assay demonstrated that dioscin reversed MPTP-induced gut dysbiosis to decrease <i>Firmicutes</i>-to-<i>Bacteroidetes</i> ratio and the abundances of <i>Enterococcus</i>, <i>Streptococcus</i>, <i>Bacteroides</i> and <i>Lactobacillus genera</i>, which further inhibited bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity and blocked bile acid (BA) deconjugation. Fecal microbiome transplantation test showed that the <i>anti</i>-PD effect of dioscin was gut microbiota-dependent. In addition, non-targeted fecal metabolomics assays revealed many differential metabolites in adjusting steroid biosynthesis and primary bile acid biosynthesis. Moreover, targeted bile acid metabolomics assay indicated that dioscin increased the levels of ursodeoxycholic acid, tauroursodeoxycholic acid, taurodeoxycholic acid and β-muricholic acid in feces and serum. In addition, ursodeoxycholic acid administration markedly improved the protective effects of dioscin against PD in mice. Mechanistic test indicated that dioscin significantly up-regulated the levels of takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R), GLP-1, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and down-regulated NADPH oxidases 2 (NOX2) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) levels. Our data indicated that dioscin ameliorated PD phenotype by restoring gut dysbiosis and regulating bile acid-mediated oxidative stress and neuroinflammation via targeting GLP-1 signal in MPTP-induced PD mice, suggesting that the compound should be considered as a prebiotic agent to treat PD in the future.",Journal of pharmaceutical analysis,2023,Zhang Mao; Haochen Hui; Xuerong Zhao; Lina Xu; Yan Qi; Lianhong Yin; Liping Qu; Lan Han; Jinyong Peng
38014294,The Parkinson's drug entacapone disrupts gut microbiome homeostasis via iron sequestration.,"Increasing evidence shows that many human-targeted drugs alter the gut microbiome, leading to implications for host health. However, much less is known about the mechanisms by which drugs target the microbiome and how drugs affect microbial function. Here we combined quantitative microbiome profiling, long-read metagenomics, stable isotope probing and single-cell chemical imaging to investigate the impact of two widely prescribed nervous system-targeted drugs on the gut microbiome. <i>Ex vivo</i> supplementation of physiologically relevant concentrations of entacapone or loxapine succinate to faecal samples significantly impacted the abundance of up to one third of the microbial species present. Importantly, we demonstrate that the impact of these drugs on microbial metabolism is much more pronounced than their impact on abundances, with low concentrations of drugs reducing the activity, but not the abundance of key microbiome members like <i>Bacteroides, Ruminococcus</i> or <i>Clostridium</i> species. We further demonstrate that entacapone impacts the microbiome due to its ability to complex and deplete available iron, and that microbial growth can be rescued by replenishing levels of microbiota-accessible iron. Remarkably, entacapone-induced iron starvation selected for iron-scavenging organisms carrying antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes. Collectively, our study unveils the impact of two under-investigated drugs on whole microbiomes and identifies metal sequestration as a mechanism of drug-induced microbiome disturbance.",bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,2023,Fátima C Pereira; Xiaowei Ge; Jannie Munk Kristensen; Rasmus H Kirkegaard; Klara Maritsch; Yifan Zhu; Marie Decorte; Bela Hausmann; David Berry; Kenneth Wasmund; Arno Schintlmeister; Thomas Boettcher; Ji-Xin Cheng; Michael Wagner
38004795,A Catastrophic Biodiversity Loss in the Environment Is Being Replicated on the Skin Microbiome: Is This a Major Contributor to the Chronic Disease Epidemic?,"There has been a catastrophic loss of biodiversity in ecosystems across the world. A similar crisis has been observed in the human gut microbiome, which has been linked to ""all human diseases affecting westernized countries"". This is of great importance because chronic diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide and make up 90% of America's healthcare costs. Disease development is complex and multifactorial, but there is one part of the body's interlinked ecosystem that is often overlooked in discussions about whole-body health, and that is the skin microbiome. This is despite it being a crucial part of the immune, endocrine, and nervous systems and being continuously exposed to environmental stressors. Here we show that a parallel biodiversity loss of 30-84% has occurred on the skin of people in the developed world compared to our ancestors. Research has shown that dysbiosis of the skin microbiome has been linked to many common skin diseases and, more recently, that it could even play an active role in the development of a growing number of whole-body health problems, such as food allergies, asthma, cardiovascular diseases, and Parkinson's, traditionally thought unrelated to the skin. Damaged skin is now known to induce systemic inflammation, which is involved in many chronic diseases. We highlight that biodiversity loss is not only a common finding in dysbiotic ecosystems but also a type of dysbiosis. As a result, we make the case that biodiversity loss in the skin microbiome is a major contributor to the chronic disease epidemic. The link between biodiversity loss and dysbiosis forms the basis of this paper's focus on the subject. The key to understanding why biodiversity loss creates an unhealthy system could be highlighted by complex physics. We introduce entropy to help understand why biodiversity has been linked with ecosystem health and stability. Meanwhile, we also introduce ecosystems as being governed by ""non-linear physics"" principles-including chaos theory-which suggests that every individual part of any system is intrinsically linked and implies any disruption to a small part of the system (skin) could have a significant and unknown effect on overall system health (whole-body health). Recognizing the link between ecosystem health and human health allows us to understand how crucial it could be to maintain biodiversity across systems everywhere, from the macro-environment we inhabit right down to our body's microbiome. Further, in-depth research is needed so we can aid in the treatment of chronic diseases and potentially change how we think about our health. With millions of people currently suffering, research to help mitigate the crisis is of vital importance.",Microorganisms,2023,Christopher Wallen-Russell; Nancy Pearlman; Samuel Wallen-Russell; Dragos Cretoiu; Dana Claudia Thompson; Silviu Cristian Voinea
37927277,Pesticides and the Microbiome-Gut-Brain Axis: Convergent Pathways in the Pathogenesis of Parkinson's Disease.,"The increasing global burden of Parkinson's disease (PD), termed the PD pandemic, is exceeding expectations related purely to population aging and is likely driven in part by lifestyle changes and environmental factors. Pesticides are well recognized risk factors for PD, supported by both epidemiological and experimental evidence, with multiple detrimental effects beyond dopaminergic neuron damage alone. The microbiome-gut-brain axis has gained much attention in recent years and is considered to be a significant contributor and driver of PD pathogenesis. In this narrative review, we first focus on how both pesticides and the microbiome may influence PD initiation and progression independently, describing pesticide-related central and peripheral neurotoxicity and microbiome-related local and systemic effects due to dysbiosis and microbial metabolites. We then depict the bidirectional interplay between pesticides and the microbiome in the context of PD, synthesizing current knowledge about pesticide-induced dysbiosis, microbiome-mediated alterations in pesticide availability, metabolism and toxicity, and complex systemic pesticide-microbiome-host interactions related to inflammatory and metabolic pathways, insulin resistance and other mechanisms. An overview of the unknowns follows, and the role of pesticide-microbiome interactions in the proposed body-/brain-first phenotypes of PD, the complexity of environmental exposures and gene-environment interactions is discussed. The final part deals with possible further steps for translation, consisting of recommendations on future pesticide use and research as well as an outline of promising preventive/therapeutic approaches targeted on strengthening or restoring a healthy gut microbiome, closing with a summary of current gaps and future perspectives in the field.",Journal of Parkinson's disease,2023,Kristina Kulcsarova; Corinna Bang; Daniela Berg; Eva Schaeffer
37900921,"4-Ethylphenol-fluxes, metabolism and excretion of a gut microbiome derived neuromodulator implicated in autism.","Gut-microbiome-derived metabolites, such as 4-Ethylphenol [4EP], have been shown to modulate neurological health and function. Although the source of such metabolites is becoming better understood, knowledge gaps remain as to the mechanisms by which they enter host circulation, how they are transported in the body, how they are metabolised and excreted, and the way they exert their effects. High blood concentrations of host-modified 4EP, 4-ethylphenol sulfate [4EPS], are associated with an anxiety phenotype in autistic individuals. We have reviewed the existing literature and discuss mechanisms that are proposed to contribute influx from the gut microbiome, metabolism, and excretion of 4EP. We note that increased intestinal permeability is common in autistic individuals, potentially explaining increased flux of 4EP and/or 4EPS across the gut epithelium and the Blood Brain Barrier [BBB]. Similarly, kidney dysfunction, another complication observed in autistic individuals, impacts clearance of 4EP and its derivatives from circulation. Evidence indicates that accumulation of 4EPS in the brain of mice affects connectivity between subregions, particularly those linked to anxiety. However, we found no data on the presence or quantity of 4EP and/or 4EPS in human brains, irrespective of neurological status, likely due to challenges sampling this organ. We argue that the penetrative ability of 4EP is dependent on its form at the BBB and its physicochemical similarity to endogenous metabolites with dedicated active transport mechanisms across the BBB. We conclude that future research should focus on physical (e.g., ingestion of sorbents) or metabolic mechanisms (e.g., conversion to 4EP-glucuronide) that are capable of being used as interventions to reduce the flux of 4EP from the gut into the body, increase the efflux of 4EP and/or 4EPS from the brain, or increase excretion from the kidneys as a means of addressing the neurological impacts of 4EP.",Frontiers in molecular biosciences,2023,Francesca Day; Justin O'Sullivan; Chris Pook
37841274,"Melanin: a unifying theory of disease as exemplified by Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Lewy body dementia.","Melanin, a ubiquitous dark pigment, plays important roles in the immune system, including scavenging reactive oxygen species formed in response to ultraviolet radiation absorption, absorbing metals, thermal regulation, drug uptake, innate immune system functions, redox, and energy transduction. Many tissue types, including brain, heart, arteries, ovaries, and others, contain melanin. Almost all cells contain precursors to melanin. A growing number of diseases in which there is a loss of melanin and/or neuromelanin are increasingly thought to have infectious etiologies, for example, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Lewy Body Dementia (LBD), and vitiligo. AD, PD, LBD, and vitiligo have been linked with herpesvirus, which enters melanosomes and causes apoptosis, and with gut dysbiosis and inflammation. Herpesvirus is also linked with gut dysbiosis and inflammation. We theorize that under normal healthy states, melanin retains some of the energy it absorbs from electromagnetic radiation, which is then used to fuel cells, and energy from ATP is used to compliment that energy supply. We further theorize that loss of melanin reduces the energy supply of cells, which in the case of AD, PD, and LBD results in an inability to sustain immune system defenses and remove the plaques associated with the disease, which appear to be part of the immune system's attempt to eradicate the pathogens seen in these neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, in an attempt to explain why removing these plaques does not result in improvements in cognition and mood and why cognitions and moods in these individuals have ebbs and flows, we postulate that it is not the plaques that cause the cognitive symptoms but, rather, inflammation in the brain resulting from the immune system's response to pathogens. Our theory that energy retained in melanin fuels cells in an inverse relationship with ATP is supported by studies showing alterations in ATP production in relationship to melanin levels in melanomas, vitiligo, and healthy cells. Therefore, alteration of melanin levels may be at the core of many diseases. We propose regulating melanin levels may offer new avenues for treatment development.",Frontiers in immunology,2023,Stacie Z Berg; Jonathan Berg
37834373,Impact of Microbiome-Brain Communication on Neuroinflammation and Neurodegeneration.,"The gut microbiome plays a pivotal role in maintaining human health, with numerous studies demonstrating that alterations in microbial compositions can significantly affect the development and progression of various immune-mediated diseases affecting both the digestive tract and the central nervous system (CNS). This complex interplay between the microbiota, the gut, and the CNS is referred to as the gut-brain axis. The role of the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases has gained increasing attention in recent years, and evidence suggests that gut dysbiosis may contribute to disease development and progression. Clinical studies have shown alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota in multiple sclerosis patients, with a decrease in beneficial bacteria and an increase in pro-inflammatory bacteria. Furthermore, changes within the microbial community have been linked to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Microbiota-gut-brain communication can impact neurodegenerative diseases through various mechanisms, including the regulation of immune function, the production of microbial metabolites, as well as modulation of host-derived soluble factors. This review describes the current literature on the gut-brain axis and highlights novel communication systems that allow cross-talk between the gut microbiota and the host that might influence the pathogenesis of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.",International journal of molecular sciences,2023,Iris Stolzer; Eveline Scherer; Patrick Süß; Veit Rothhammer; Beate Winner; Markus F Neurath; Claudia Günther
37777156,Metaorganismal choline metabolism shapes olfactory perception.,"Microbes living in the intestine can regulate key signaling processes in the central nervous system that directly impact brain health. This gut-brain signaling axis is partially mediated by microbe-host-dependent immune regulation, gut-innervating neuronal communication, and endocrine-like small molecule metabolites that originate from bacteria to ultimately cross the blood-brain barrier. Given the mounting evidence of gut-brain crosstalk, a new therapeutic approach of ""psychobiotics"" has emerged, whereby strategies designed to primarily modify the gut microbiome have been shown to improve mental health or slow neurodegenerative diseases. Diet is one of the most powerful determinants of gut microbiome community structure, and dietary habits are associated with brain health and disease. Recently, the metaorganismal (i.e., diet-microbe-host) trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) pathway has been linked to the development of several brain diseases including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and ischemic stroke. However, it is poorly understood how metaorganismal TMAO production influences brain function under normal physiological conditions. To address this, here we have reduced TMAO levels by inhibiting gut microbe-driven choline conversion to trimethylamine (TMA), and then performed comprehensive behavioral phenotyping in mice. Unexpectedly, we find that TMAO is particularly enriched in the murine olfactory bulb, and when TMAO production is blunted at the level of bacterial choline TMA lyase (CutC/D), olfactory perception is altered. Taken together, our studies demonstrate a previously underappreciated role for the TMAO pathway in olfactory-related behaviors.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2023,William J Massey; Kristen E Kay; Thomas C Jaramillo; Anthony J Horak; Shijie Cao; Lucas J Osborn; Rakhee Banerjee; Marko Mrdjen; Michael K Hamoudi; Daniel J Silver; Amy C Burrows; Amanda L Brown; Ofer Reizes; Justin D Lathia; Zeneng Wang; Stanley L Hazen; J Mark Brown
37771782,Oral [60]fullerene reduces neuroinflammation to alleviate Parkinson's disease via regulating gut microbiome.,"Neuroinflammation is considered to drive the pathogenic process of neuronal degeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, effective anti-neuroinflammation therapeutics for PD still remain dissatisfactory. Here we explore a robust therapeutic strategy for PD using anti-neuroinflammatory fullerenes. <b>Methods:</b> Oral fullerene was prepared by a ball-milling method. 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse model was used to investigate the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of it. The gut microenvironment was evaluated by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR), and western blot (WB). The neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration were evaluated by pathological analysis, Elisa kits, transmission electron microscopy, Q-PCR, WB and so on. Toxicity was assessed by weight, blood test and hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. <b>Results:</b> Oral fullerene therapeutic system that dissolved [60]fullerene into olive oil (abbreviated as OFO) was dexterously designed, which could reduce neuroinflammation via regulating the diversity of gut microbiome, increasing the contents of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and recovering the integrity of gut barrier. Accordingly, the reduction of neuroinflammation prevented dopaminergic neuronal degeneration. And thus, OFO significantly ameliorated motor deficits and fundamentally reversed dopamine (DA) loss in MPTP-induced PD mice. Of note, OFO exhibited low toxicity towards the living body. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our findings suggest that OFO is a safe-to-use, easy-to-apply, and prospective candidate for PD treatment in clinic, opening a therapeutic window for neuroinflammation-triggered neurodegeneration.",Theranostics,2023,Xue Li; Ruijun Deng; Jie Li; Hui Li; Zhe Xu; Lei Zhang; Linyin Feng; Chunying Shu; Mingming Zhen; Chunru Wang
37764277,Therapeutic Effects of Baicalin on Diseases Related to Gut-Brain Axis Dysfunctions.,"The gut-brain axis is an active area of research. Several representative diseases, including central nervous system disorders (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and depression), metabolic disorders (obesity-related diseases), and intestinal disorders (inflammatory bowel disease and dysbiosis), are associated with the dysfunctional gut-brain axis. Baicalin, a bioactive flavonoid extracted from <i>Scutellaria baicalensis</i>, is reported to exert various pharmacological effects. This narrative review summarizes the molecular mechanisms and potential targets of baicalin in disorders of the gut-brain axis. Baicalin protects the central nervous system through anti-neuroinflammatory and anti-neuronal apoptotic effects, suppresses obesity through anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, and alleviates intestinal disorders through regulatory effects on intestinal microorganisms and short-chain fatty acid production. The bioactivities of baicalin are mediated through the gut-brain axis. This review comprehensively summarizes the regulatory role of baicalin in gut-brain axis disorders, laying a foundation for future research, although further confirmatory basic research is required.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,Qichao Hu; Shuyu Hou; Baoyi Xiong; Yueqiang Wen; Jundong Wang; Jinhao Zeng; Xiao Ma; Fang Wang
37761988,"Age-Related Cognitive Decline, Focus on Microbiome: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.","Aging is a complex process influenced by genetics and the environment, leading to physiological decline and increased susceptibility to diseases. Cognitive decline is a prominent feature of aging, with implications for different neurodegenerative disorders. The gut microbiome has gained attention for its potential impact on health and disease, including cognitive function. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the relationship between the gut microbiome and cognitive function in the context of aging. Following PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive search strategy was employed in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Studies exploring the role of the microbiome in cognition and neurodegenerative disorders, published between 2013 and 2023, were included. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed. Quantitative synthesis using statistical analyses was performed to examine microbial diversity and relative abundance in various cognitive conditions. Sixteen studies involving a total of 1303 participants were included in the analysis. The gut microbiota's relative abundance was different in individuals with cognitive impairments such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and dementia, compared to the healthy controls. The most prevalent phyla affected were Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria. Meta-analyses indicated substantial heterogeneity among studies focusing on Alzheimer's disease. The overall quality of evidence related to microbial analysis was moderate. The gut microbiome's role in cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disorders warrants investigation. Altered microbial abundance, particularly in specific phyla, is associated with cognitive impairments. However, variations in study findings and methodologies highlight the complexity of the relationship between the gut microbiome and cognitive function.

Autonomic symptoms of MSA include deficits associated with the gastrointestinal (GI) system, such as difficulty swallowing, abdominal pain and bloating, nausea, delayed gastric emptying, and constipation. To date, studies assessing GI dysfunctions in MSA have primarily focused on alterations of the gut microbiome, however growing evidence indicates other structural components of the GI tract, such as the enteric nervous system, the intestinal barrier, GI hormones, and the GI-driven immune response may contribute to MSA-related GI symptoms.

37690584,An updated overview on the relationship between human gut microbiome dysbiosis and psychiatric and psychological disorders.,"There is a lot of evidence establishing that nervous system development is related to the composition and functions of the gut microbiome. In addition, the central nervous system (CNS) controls the imbalance of the intestinal microbiota, constituting a bidirectional communication system. At present, various gut-brain crosstalk routes have been described, including immune, endocrine and neural circuits via the vagal pathway. Several empirical data have associated gut microbiota alterations (dysbiosis) with neuropsychiatric diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, autism and Parkinson's disease, and with other psychological disorders, like anxiety and depression. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) therapy has shown that the gut microbiota can transfer behavioral features to recipient animals, which provides strong evidence to establish a causal-effect relationship. Interventions, based on prebiotics, probiotics or synbiotics, have demonstrated an important influence of microbiota on neurological disorders by the synthesis of neuroactive compounds that interact with the nervous system and by the regulation of inflammatory and endocrine processes. Further research is needed to demonstrate the influence of gut microbiota dysbiosis on psychiatric and psychological disorders, and how microbiota-based interventions may be used as potential therapeutic tools.",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,2024,Alejandro Borrego-Ruiz; Juan J Borrego

Many PD risk factors are known, but those affecting disease progression are not. Lifestyle and microbial dysbiosis are candidates in this context. Diet-driven gut dysbiosis and reduced barrier function may increase exposure of enteric neurons to toxins. Here, we study whether fiber deprivation and exposure to bacterial curli, a protein cross-seeding with αSyn, individually or together, exacerbate disease in the enteric and central nervous systems of a transgenic PD mouse model. We analyze the gut microbiome, motor behavior, and gastrointestinal and brain pathologies. We find that diet and bacterial curli alter the microbiome and exacerbate motor performance, as well as intestinal and brain pathologies, but to different extents.

The gut microbiome communicates with the central nervous system via the gut-brain axis and affects behavioral and cognitive phenotypes. Dysbiosis (a dysfunctional microbiome) drives increased intestinal permeability and inflammation that can negatively affect the brain via the gut-brain axis. Healthier metabolic and lipid profiles and cognitive phenotypes are observed in individuals with more distinct microbiomes. In this review, we discuss the role of the gut microbiome and gut-brain axis in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease and related animal models, in cancer and cancer treatments, and in metabolic syndrome. We also discuss strategies to improve the gut microbiome and ultimately brain function. Because healthier cognitive phenotypes are observed in individuals with more distinct microbiomes, increased efforts are warranted to develop therapeutic strategies for those at increased risk of developing neurological disorders and patients diagnosed with those disorders.",Seminars in neurology,2023,Jacob Raber; Thomas J Sharpton

37571393,Underlying Mechanisms of Brain Aging and Neurodegenerative Diseases as Potential Targets for Preventive or Therapeutic Strategies Using Phytochemicals.,"During aging, several tissues and biological systems undergo a progressive decline in function, leading to age-associated diseases such as neurodegenerative, inflammatory, metabolic, and cardiovascular diseases and cancer. In this review, we focus on the molecular underpinning of senescence and neurodegeneration related to age-associated brain diseases, in particular, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, along with introducing nutrients or phytochemicals that modulate age-associated molecular dysfunctions, potentially offering preventive or therapeutic benefits. Based on current knowledge, the dysregulation of microglia genes and neuroinflammation, telomere attrition, neuronal stem cell degradation, vascular system dysfunction, reactive oxygen species, loss of chromosome X inactivation in females, and gut microbiome dysbiosis have been seen to play pivotal roles in neurodegeneration in an interactive manner. There are several phytochemicals (e.g., curcumin, EGCG, fucoidan, galangin, astin C, apigenin, resveratrol, phytic acid, acacetin, daucosterol, silibinin, sulforaphane, withaferin A, and betulinic acid) that modulate the dysfunction of one or several key genes (e.g., TREM2, C3, C3aR1, TNFA, NF-kb, TGFB1&2, SIRT1&6, HMGB1, and STING) affected in the aged brain. Although phytochemicals have shown promise in slowing down the progression of age-related brain diseases, more studies to identify their efficacy, alone or in combinations, in preclinical systems can help to design novel nutritional strategies for the management of neurodegenerative diseases in humans.",Nutrients,2023,Hamid Mostafavi Abdolmaleky; Jin-Rong Zhou
37481569,Study of the gut microbiome in Egyptian patients with Parkinson's Disease.,"Recently, an important relationship between Parkinson's disease and the gut microbiota, through the brain-gut axis interactions, has been established. Previous studies have declared that alterations in the gut microbiota have a great impact on the pathogenesis and clinical picture of Parkinson's disease (PD). The present study aimed to identify the gut microbiome that is likely related to Parkinson's disease as well as their possible relation to clinical phenotypes.Thirty patients with Parkinson's disease, who presented to the Parkinson's disease Neurology Clinic of Alexandria University Hospital were enrolled in our study. A cross-matching control group of 35 healthy subjects of similar age and sex were included. Stool specimens were taken from each. Quantitative SYBR Green Real-Time PCR was done for the identification and quantitation of selected bacterial phyla, genera and/or species.There was a significant increase in Bacteroides and a significant decrease of Firmicutes and Firmicutes / Bacteroidetes ratio and Bifidobacteria in PD patients. Although Prevotella was decreased among PD patients relative to the healthy control, the difference was not statistically significant. Comparing the PD clinical phenotypes with the control group, the Mixed phenotype had significantly higher Bacteroides, Tremors predominant had lower Firmicutes and Firmicutes / Bacteroidetes ratio, and both tremors and postural instability and gait disability (PIGD) phenotypes had lower Bifidobacteria. However, there was no statistically significant difference between these phenotypes. Furthermore, when comparing tremors and non-tremors predominant phenotypes; Lactobacilli showed a significant decrease in non-tremors predominant phenotypes.The current study showed evidence of changes in the gut microbiome of Parkinson's disease patients compared to the healthy controls. These observations may highlight the importance of the identification of microbiome and specific bacterial changes that can be targeted for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.",BMC microbiology,2023,Mohammad Mehanna; Suzan AbuRaya; Shwikar Mahmoud Ahmed; Ghada Ashmawy; Ahmed Ibrahim; Essameldin AbdelKhaliq
37449597,"Gut-microbiome-brain axis: the crosstalk between the vagus nerve, alpha-synuclein and the brain in Parkinson's disease.","This critical review of the literature shows that there is a close link between the microbiome, the gut, and the brain in Parkinson's disease. The vagus nerve, the main component of the parasympathetic nervous system, is involved in the regulation of immune response, digestion, heart rate, and control of mood. It can detect microbiota metabolites through its afferents, transferring this gut information to the central nervous system. Preclinical and clinical studies have shown the important role played by the gut microbiome and gut-related factors in disease development and progression, as well as treatment responses. These findings suggest that the gut microbiome may be a valuable target for new therapeutic strategies for Parkinson's disease. More studies are needed to better understand the underlying biology and how this axis can be modulated for the patient's benefit.",Neural regeneration research,2023,Júlio César Claudino Dos Santos; Leandro Freitas Oliveira; Felipe Micelli Noleto; Camilla Teixeira Pinheiro Gusmão; Gerly Anne de Castro Brito; Glauce Socorro de Barros Viana
37403161,Overexpression of human alpha-Synuclein leads to dysregulated microbiome/metabolites with ageing in a rat model of Parkinson disease.,"Braak's hypothesis states that sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD) follows a specific progression of pathology from the peripheral to the central nervous system, and this progression can be monitored by detecting the accumulation of alpha-Synuclein (α-Syn) protein. Consequently, there is growing interest in understanding how the gut (commensal) microbiome can regulate α-Syn accumulation, as this could potentially lead to PD.We used 16S rRNA and shotgun sequencing to characterise microbial diversity. <sup>1</sup>H-NMR was employed to understand the metabolite production and intestinal inflammation estimated using ELISA and RNA-sequencing from feces and the intestinal epithelial layer respectively. The Na<sup>+</sup> channel current and gut permeability were measured using an Ussing chamber. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence imaging were applied to detect the α-Syn protein. LC-MS/MS was used for characterization of proteins from metabolite treated neuronal cells. Finally, Metascape and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) bioinformatics tools were used for identification of dysregulated pathways.We studied a transgenic (TG) rat model overexpressing the human SNCA gene and found that a progressive gut microbial composition alteration characterized by the reduction of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio could be detected in the young TG rats. Interestingly, this ratio then increased with ageing. The dynamics of Lactobacillus and Alistipes were monitored and reduced Lactobacillus and increased Alistipes abundance was discerned in ageing TG rats. Additionally, the SNCA gene overexpression resulted in gut α-Syn protein expression and increased with advanced age. Further, older TG animals had increased intestinal inflammation, decreased Na<sup>+</sup> current and a robust alteration in metabolite production characterized by the increase of succinate levels in feces and serum. Manipulation of the gut bacteria by short-term antibiotic cocktail treatment revealed a complete loss of short-chain fatty acids and a reduction in succinate levels. Although antibiotic cocktail treatment did not change α-Syn expression in the enteric nervous system of the colon, however, reduced α-Syn expression was detected in the olfactory bulbs (forebrain) of the TG rats.Our data emphasize that the gut microbiome dysbiosis synchronous with ageing leads to a specific alteration of gut metabolites and can be modulated by antibiotics which may affect PD pathology.",Molecular neurodegeneration,2023,Yogesh Singh; Christoph Trautwein; Joan Romani; Madhuri S Salker; Peter H Neckel; Isabel Fraccaroli; Mahkameh Abeditashi; Nils Woerner; Jakob Admard; Achal Dhariwal; Morten K D Dueholm; Karl-Herbert Schäfer; Florian Lang; Daniel E Otzen; Hilal A Lashuel; Olaf Riess; Nicolas Casadei
37375679,"New Pieces for an Old Puzzle: Approaching Parkinson's Disease from Translatable Animal Models, Gut Microbiota Modulation, and Lipidomics.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is a severe neurodegenerative disease characterized by disabling motor alterations that are diagnosed at a relatively late stage in its development, and non-motor symptoms, including those affecting the gastrointestinal tract (mainly constipation), which start much earlier than the motor symptoms. Remarkably, current treatments only reduce motor symptoms, not without important drawbacks (relatively low efficiency and impactful side effects). Thus, new approaches are needed to halt PD progression and, possibly, to prevent its development, including new therapeutic strategies that target PD etiopathogeny and new biomarkers. Our aim was to review some of these new approaches. Although PD is complex and heterogeneous, compelling evidence suggests it might have a gastrointestinal origin, at least in a significant number of patients, and findings in recently developed animal models strongly support this hypothesis. Furthermore, the modulation of the gut microbiome, mainly through probiotics, is being tested to improve motor and non-motor symptoms and even to prevent PD. Finally, lipidomics has emerged as a useful tool to identify lipid biomarkers that may help analyze PD progression and treatment efficacy in a personalized manner, although, as of today, it has only scarcely been applied to monitor gut motility, dysbiosis, and probiotic effects in PD. Altogether, these new pieces should be helpful in solving the old puzzle of PD.",Nutrients,2023,Lorena Ortega Moreno; Ana Bagues; Vicente Martínez; Raquel Abalo
37375029,Therapeutic Prospect of New Probiotics in Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Increasing clinical and preclinical evidence implicates gut microbiome (GM) dysbiosis as a key susceptibility factor for neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). In recent years, neurodegenerative diseases have been viewed as being driven not solely by defects in the brain, and the role of GM in modulating central nervous system function via the gut-brain axis has attracted considerable interest. Encouraged by current GM research, the development of new probiotics may lead to tangible impacts on the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. This review summarizes current understandings of GM composition and characteristics associated with neurodegenerative diseases and research demonstrations of key molecules from the GM that affect neurodegeneration. Furthermore, applications of new probiotics, such as <i>Clostridium butyricum</i>, <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i>, <i>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</i>, and <i>Bacteroides fragilis</i>, for the remediation of neurodegenerative diseases are discussed.",Microorganisms,2023,Mingxia Bi; Chang Liu; Yulin Wang; Shuang-Jiang Liu
37374992,Gut Microbiome Transplants and Their Health Impacts across Species.,"The human gut, required for ingesting and processing food, extracting nutrients, and excreting waste, is made up of not just human tissue but also trillions of microbes that are responsible for many health-promoting functions. However, this gut microbiome is also associated with multiple diseases and negative health outcomes, many of which do not have a cure or treatment. One potential mechanism to alleviate these negative health effects caused by the microbiome is the use of microbiome transplants. Here, we briefly review the gut's functional relationships in laboratory model systems and humans, with a focus on the different diseases they directly affect. We then provide an overview of the history of microbiome transplants and their use in multiple diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, as well as <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> infections, and irritable bowel syndrome. We finally provide insights into areas of research in which microbiome transplant research is lacking, but that simultaneously may provide significant health improvements, including age-related neurodegenerative diseases.",Microorganisms,2023,Benjamin H Levine; Jessica M Hoffman
37368331,Gut Microbiota and Its Repercussion in Parkinson's Disease: A Systematic Review in Occidental Patients.,"(1) Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a relatively common and complex pathology, and some of its mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Change in host microbiota is related to the pathophysiology of numerous diseases. This systematic review aims to gather existing data on the occidental hemisphere, compare it, and search for any significant association between Parkinson's disease and gut microbiota dysbiosis. (2) Methods: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) and Meta-analyses Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) protocols were used for this systematic review. PubMed was used as the database search engine. Of the 166 studies found, only 10 were used, as they met our inclusion criteria: case-control studies, studies that assessed the correlation of PD and gut microbiome, studies that took place in occidental regions, and studies that were performed on humans and were written in English. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used as the assessment tool for overall risk of bias in this systematic review. (3) Results: The studies analyzed were divided into three geographic areas: Region 1: United States of America and Canada; Region 2: Germany, Ireland, and Finland; and Region 3: Italy; based on geographical similarities among these populations. The following statistically significant results were described in PD patients, compared with non-PD controls. In the first region, a significant increase in the following bacteria was seen: 1. Phylum: Actinobacteriota and its Genus: <i>Bifidobacterium</i>; 2. Phylum: Verrucomicrobiota and its Genus: <i>Akkermansia</i>; 3. Genus: <i>Enterococcus</i>, <i>Hungatella</i>, <i>Lactobacillus</i>, and <i>Oscillospira</i> of the Phylum: Firmicutes; 4. Family: <i>Ruminococcaceae</i> of Phylum: Firmicutes; 5. Phylum: Bacteroidetes and its Genus: <i>Bacteroides</i>; 6. Phylum: Proteobacteria. A significant decrease was described in the Family: <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> and its Genus: <i>Blautia</i>, <i>Coprococcus</i>, and <i>Roseburia</i>, which belong to the Phylum: Firmicutes. In the second region, a raised number of: 1. Phylum: Verrucomicrobiota, its Genus: <i>Akkermansia</i>, and its Species: <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i>; 2.

Family: <i>Lactobacillaceae</i> of the Phylum: Firmicutes; 5. Family: <i>Barnesiellaceae</i> of the Phylum: Bacteroidetes; 6. Genus: <i>Bifidobacterium</i> of the Phylum: Actinobacteriota; 7. Species: <i>Bilophila wadsworthia</i> of the Phylum: Thermodesulfobacteriota, was identified. Only one Genus: <i>Prevotella</i> of the Phylum: Bacteroidetes was decreased. In the third and last region, an augmented number of these bacteria were found: 1. Phylum: Verrucomicrobiota and its Genus: <i>Akkermansia</i>; 2. Family: <i>Bifidobacteriaceae</i> and <i>Coriobacteriaceae</i> of the Phylum: Actinobacteriota; 3. Phylum: Firmicutes and its Family: <i>Christensenellaceae</i> and <i>Lactobacillaceae</i>; 4. Family: <i>Enterococcaceae</i> and its Genus: <i>Enterococcus</i>, of the Phylum: Firmicutes; 5. Genus: <i>Lactococcus</i> and <i>Oscillospira</i>, of the Phylum: Firmicutes; 6. Phylum: Proteobacteria, its Family: <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i>, and the Genus: <i>Citrobacter</i>, <i>Klebsiella</i>, <i>Salmonella</i>, and <i>Shigella</i>; 7. Genus: <i>ParaBacteroides</i> of the Phylum: Bacteroidetes. In contrast, a significant decrease in 1. Phylum: Firmicutes, its Family: <i>Lachnospiraceae</i>, and its Genus: <i>Roseburia</i> and 2. Genus: <i>Ruminococcus</i> of the Phylum: Firmicutes, was described. (4) Conclusion: A significant gut dysbiosis, involving multiple bacterial taxa, was found in PD patients compared to healthy people in the occidental regions. However, more studies are needed to find the precise pathophysiologic involvement of other groups of pathogens, such as fungi and parasites, in the development and progression of PD.",Neurology international,2023,Ana Cristina Proano; Javier A Viteri; Eileen N Orozco; Marco Antonio Calle; Stefany Carolina Costa; Daniel V Reyes; Melissa German-Montenegro; David F Moncayo; Andrea C Tobar; Juan A Moncayo
37340511,Parkinson's disease: Are gut microbes involved?,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects more than 10 million individuals worldwide. It is characterized by motor and sensory deficits. Research studies have increasingly demonstrated a correlation between Parkinson's disease and alternations in the composition of the gut microbiota in affected patients. Also, the significant role of prebiotics and probiotics in gastrointestinal and neurological conditions is imperative to understand their relation to Parkinson's disease.To explore the scientific interaction of the gut-microbiota-brain axis and its association with Parkinson's disease, a comprehensive narrative review of the relevant literature was conducted. Articles were retrieved systematically from reputable sources, including PubMed, Science Direct, World Health Organization (WHO), and Advanced Google Scholar. Key search terms included are ""Parkinson's Disease"", ""Gut Microbiome"", ""Braak's Theory"", ""Neurological Disorders"", and ""Gut-brain axis"". Articles included in our review are published in English and they provide detailed information on the relationship between Parkinson's disease and gut microbiota RESULTS: This review highlights the impact of gut microbiota composition and associated factors on the progression of Parkinson's disease. Evidence-based studies highlighting the existing evidence of the relationship between Parkinson's disease and alteration in gut microbiota are discussed. Consequently, the potential mechanisms by which the gut microbiota may affect the composition of the gut microbiota were revealed, with a particular emphasis on the role of the gut-brain axis in this interplay.Understanding the complex interplay between gut microbiota and Parkinson's disease is a potential implication for the development of novel therapeutics against Parkinson's disease. Following the existing relationship demonstrated by different evidence-based studies on Parkinson's disease and gut microbiota, our review concludes by providing recommendations and suggestions for future research studies with a particular emphasis on the impact of the microbiota-brain axis on Parkinson's disease.",Brain and behavior,2023,Abass Olawale Omotosho; Yusuf Amuda Tajudeen; Habeebullah Jayeola Oladipo; Sodiq Inaolaji Yusuff; Muritala AbdulKadir; Abdulbasit Opeyemi Muili; Oluwaseyi Muyiwa Egbewande; Rashidat Onyinoyi Yusuf; Zaccheaus Oluwaseun Faniran; Abdullateef Opeyemi Afolabi; Mona Said El-Sherbini
37323145,Therapies for Parkinson's disease and the gut microbiome: evidence for bidirectional connection.,"The gut brain axis (GBA), a bidirectional communication pathway has often been linked to health and disease, and gut microbiota (GM), a key component of this pathway shown to be altered in Parkinson's disease (PD), are suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis of PD. There are few studies that report the impact of oral medication therapy on GM, however, there are even fewer studies that discuss the impact of other treatments such as device assisted therapies (DAT) including deep brain stimulation (DBS), levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel infusion (LCIG) and photobiomodulation (PBM) and how these might impact GM. Here, we review the literature and summarize findings of the potential contributions of GM to the heterogenous clinical response to pharmaceutical therapies among individuals with PD. We also discuss the potential interactions between the GM and DATs such as DBS and LCIG and present evidence for alterations in GM in response to DATs. Given the complexity and highly individual nature of the GM of patients with PD and the potential influence that other external factors such as diet, lifestyle, medications, stage of the disease and other comorbidities, further investigations into the response of GM to therapies are worthy of future study in prospective, controlled trials as well as medication naïve individuals. Such detailed studies will help us further comprehend the relationship between GM in PD patients, and will help investigate the potential of targeting GM associated changes as a treatment avenue for PD.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2023,Grace Hey; Navya Nair; Emily Klann; Anjela Gurrala; Delaram Safarpour; Volker Mai; Adolfo Ramirez-Zamora; Vinata Vedam-Mai
37305758,The role of the microbiota-gut-brain axis and intestinal microbiome dysregulation in Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex progressive neurodegenerative disease associated with aging. Its main pathological feature is the degeneration and loss of dopaminergic neurons related to the misfolding and aggregation of α-synuclein. The pathogenesis of PD has not yet been fully elucidated, and its occurrence and development process are closely related to the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Dysregulation of intestinal microbiota may promote the damage of the intestinal epithelial barrier, intestinal inflammation, and the upward diffusion of phosphorylated α-synuclein from the enteric nervous system (ENS) to the brain in susceptible individuals and further lead to gastrointestinal dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration of the central nervous system (CNS) through the disordered microbiota-gut-brain axis. The present review aimed to summarize recent advancements in studies focusing on the role of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in the pathogenesis of PD, especially the mechanism of intestinal microbiome dysregulation, intestinal inflammation, and gastrointestinal dysfunction in PD. Maintaining or restoring homeostasis in the gut microenvironment by targeting the gut microbiome may provide future direction for the development of new biomarkers for early diagnosis of PD and therapeutic strategies to slow disease progression.",Frontiers in neurology,2023,Qing Li; Ling-Bing Meng; Li-Jun Chen; Xia Shi; Ling Tu; Qi Zhou; Jin-Long Yu; Xin Liao; Yuan Zeng; Qiao-Ying Yuan
37298527,Neurodegenerative and Neurodevelopmental Diseases and the Gut-Brain Axis: The Potential of Therapeutic Targeting of the Microbiome.,"The human gut microbiome contains the largest number of bacteria in the body and has the potential to greatly influence metabolism, not only locally but also systemically. There is an established link between a healthy, balanced, and diverse microbiome and overall health. When the gut microbiome becomes unbalanced (dysbiosis) through dietary changes, medication use, lifestyle choices, environmental factors, and ageing, this has a profound effect on our health and is linked to many diseases, including lifestyle diseases, metabolic diseases, inflammatory diseases, and neurological diseases. While this link in humans is largely an association of dysbiosis with disease, in animal models, a causative link can be demonstrated. The link between the gut and the brain is particularly important in maintaining brain health, with a strong association between dysbiosis in the gut and neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases. This link suggests not only that the gut microbiota composition can be used to make an early diagnosis of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases but also that modifying the gut microbiome to influence the microbiome-gut-brain axis might present a therapeutic target for diseases that have proved intractable, with the aim of altering the trajectory of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, autism spectrum disorder, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, among others. There is also a microbiome-gut-brain link to other potentially reversible neurological diseases, such as migraine, post-operative cognitive dysfunction, and long COVID, which might be considered models of therapy for neurodegenerative disease. The role of traditional methods in altering the microbiome, as well as newer, more novel treatments such as faecal microbiome transplants and photobiomodulation, are discussed.",International journal of molecular sciences,2023,Brian Bicknell; Ann Liebert; Thomas Borody; Geoffrey Herkes; Craig McLachlan; Hosen Kiat
37239020,The Impact of microRNAs on Mitochondrial Function and Immunity: Relevance to Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's Disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, is characterised by the severe loss of dopaminergic neurons in the Substantia Nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and by the presence of Lewy bodies. PD is diagnosed upon the onset of motor symptoms, such as bradykinesia, resting tremor, rigidity, and postural instability. It is currently accepted that motor symptoms are preceded by non-motor features, such as gastrointestinal dysfunction. In fact, it has been proposed that PD might start in the gut and spread to the central nervous system. Growing evidence reports that the gut microbiota, which has been found to be altered in PD patients, influences the function of the central and enteric nervous systems. Altered expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) in PD patients has also been reported, many of which regulate key pathological mechanisms involved in PD pathogenesis, such as mitochondrial dysfunction and immunity. It remains unknown how gut microbiota regulates brain function; however, miRNAs have been highlighted as important players. Remarkably, numerous studies have depicted the ability of miRNAs to modulate and be regulated by the host's gut microbiota. In this review, we summarize the experimental and clinical studies implicating mitochondrial dysfunction and immunity in PD. Moreover, we gather recent data on miRNA involvement in these two processes. Ultimately, we discuss the reciprocal crosstalk between gut microbiota and miRNAs. Studying the bidirectional interaction of gut microbiome-miRNA might elucidate the aetiology and pathogenesis of gut-first PD, which could lead to the application of miRNAs as potential biomarkers or therapeutical targets for PD.",Biomedicines,2023,Beatriz F S Guedes; Sandra Morais Cardoso; Ana Raquel Esteves
37237983,Escalating Bi-Directional Feedback Loops between Proinflammatory Microglia and Mitochondria in Ageing and Post-Diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive age-related neurodegenerative disease affecting up to 3% of the global population over 65 years of age. Currently, the underlying physiological aetiology of PD is unknown. However, the diagnosed disorder shares many common non-motor symptoms associated with ageing-related neurodegenerative disease progression, such as neuroinflammation, microglial activation, neuronal mitochondrial impairment, and chronic autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Clinical PD has been linked to many interrelated biological and molecular processes, such as escalating proinflammatory immune responses, mitochondrial impairment, lower adenosine triphosphate (ATP) availability, increasing release of neurotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS), impaired blood brain barrier integrity, chronic activation of microglia, and damage to dopaminergic neurons consistently associated with motor and cognitive decline. Prodromal PD has also been associated with orthostatic hypotension and many other age-related impairments, such as sleep disruption, impaired gut microbiome, and constipation. Thus, this review aimed to present evidence linking mitochondrial dysfunction, including elevated oxidative stress, ROS, and impaired cellular energy production, with the overactivation and escalation of a microglial-mediated proinflammatory immune response as naturally occurring and damaging interlinked bidirectional and self-perpetuating cycles that share common pathological processes in ageing and PD. We propose that both chronic inflammation, microglial activation, and neuronal mitochondrial impairment should be considered as concurrently influencing each other along a continuum rather than as separate and isolated linear metabolic events that affect specific aspects of neural processing and brain function.","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,Shane Michael Ravenhill; Andrew Howard Evans; Sheila Gillard Crewther
37228957,The microbiota-gut-brain axis and three common neurological disorders: a mini-review.,"Neurological disorders are an important cause of disability and death globally. Recently, a large body of research shows that the gut microbiome affects the brain and its conditions, through the gut-brain axis. The purpose of this mini-review is to provide a brief overview of the relationship between the microbiota-gut-brain axis in three neurological disorders: epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, and migraine. The authors chose these three disorders because of their burdensome and great effect on health care. We live on a microbial planet. Before humans, microorganisms existed for a hundred million years. Today, there are trillions of these microbes living in our bodies, it is called human microbiota. These organisms have a crucial role in our homeostasis and survival. Most of the human microbiota live in the gut. The number of gut microbiota is much more than the number of body cells. Gut microbiota has been regarded as a crucial regulator of the gut-brain axis. The discovery of the microbiota-gut-brain axis is described as a major advancement in neuroscience because it influences the pathophysiology of several neurological and psychiatric disorders. From this, more studies of the microbiota-gut-brain axis are needed in the future, to provide a better understanding of brain disorders and so that better treatment and prognosis.",Annals of medicine and surgery (2012),2023,Amjad Mhanna; Zuheir Alshehabi
37212075,IgA-Biome Profiles Correlate with Clinical Parkinson's Disease Subtypes.,"Parkinson's disease is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder with distinctive gut microbiome patterns suggesting that interventions targeting the gut microbiota may prevent, slow, or reverse disease progression and severity.Because secretory IgA (SIgA) plays a key role in shaping the gut microbiota, characterization of the IgA-Biome of individuals classified into either the akinetic rigid (AR) or tremor dominant (TD) Parkinson's disease clinical subtypes was used to further define taxa unique to these distinct clinical phenotypes.Flow cytometry was used to separate IgA-coated and -uncoated bacteria from stool samples obtained from AR and TD patients followed by amplification and sequencing of the V4 region of the 16 S rDNA gene on the MiSeq platform (Illumina).IgA-Biome analyses identified significant alpha and beta diversity differences between the Parkinson's disease phenotypes and the Firmicutes/Bacteroides ratio was significantly higher in those with TD compared to those with AR. In addition, discriminant taxa analyses identified a more pro-inflammatory bacterial profile in the IgA+ fraction of those with the AR clinical subclass compared to IgA-Biome analyses of those with the TD subclass and with the taxa identified in the unsorted control samples.IgA-Biome analyses underscores the importance of the host immune response in shaping the gut microbiome potentially affecting disease progression and presentation. In the present study, IgA-Biome analyses identified a unique proinflammatory microbial signature in the IgA+ fraction of those with AR that would have otherwise been undetected using conventional microbiome analysis approaches.",Journal of Parkinson's disease,2023,Eric L Brown; Heather T Essigmann; Kristi L Hoffman; Ashley S Alexander; Michael Newmark; Zhi-Dong Jiang; Jessika Suescun; Mya C Schiess; Craig L Hanis; Herbert L DuPont
37207228,How Toll-like receptors influence Parkinson's disease in the microbiome-gut-brain axis.,"Recently, a large number of experimenters have found that the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease may be related to the gut microbiome and proposed the microbiome-gut-brain axis. Studies have shown that Toll-like receptors, especially Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), are key mediators of gut homeostasis. In addition to their established role in innate immunity throughout the body, research is increasingly showing that the Toll-like receptor 2 and Toll-like receptor 4 signaling pathways shape the development and function of the gut and enteric nervous system. Notably, Toll-like receptor 2 and Toll-like receptor 4 are dysregulated in Parkinson's disease patients and may therefore be identified as the core of early gut dysfunction in Parkinson's disease. To better understand the contribution of Toll-like receptor 2 and Toll-like receptor 4 dysfunction in the gut to early α-synuclein aggregation, we discussed the structural function of Toll-like receptor 2 and Toll-like receptor 4 and signal transduction of Toll-like receptor 2 and Toll-like receptor 4 in Parkinson's disease by reviewing clinical, animal models, and <i>in vitro</i> studies. We also present a conceptual model of the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease, in which microbial dysbiosis alters the gut barrier as well as the Toll-like receptor 2 and Toll-like receptor 4 signaling pathways, ultimately leading to a positive feedback loop for chronic gut dysfunction, promoting α-synuclein aggregation in the gut and vagus nerve.",Frontiers in immunology,2023,Ziyi Zhang; Zhihui Liu; Ao Lv; Chenhui Fan
37157885,The Endotoxin Hypothesis of Parkinson's Disease.,"The endotoxin hypothesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is the idea that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) endotoxins contribute to the pathogenesis of this disorder. LPS endotoxins are found in, and released from, the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, for example in the gut. It is proposed that gut dysfunction in early PD leads to elevated LPS levels in the gut wall and blood, which promotes both α-synuclein aggregation in the enteric neurons and a peripheral inflammatory response. Communication to the brain via circulating LPS and cytokines in the blood and/or the gut-brain axis leads to neuroinflammation and spreading of α-synuclein pathology, exacerbating neurodegeneration in brainstem nuclei and loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, and manifesting in the clinical symptoms of PD. The evidence supporting this hypothesis includes: (1) gut dysfunction, permeability, and bacterial changes occur early in PD, (2) serum levels of LPS are increased in a proportion of PD patients, (3) LPS induces α-synuclein expression, aggregation, and neurotoxicity, (4) LPS causes activation of peripheral monocytes leading to inflammatory cytokine production, and (5) blood LPS causes brain inflammation and specific loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons, mediated by microglia. If the hypothesis is correct, then treatment options might include: (1) changing the gut microbiome, (2) reducing gut permeability, (3) reducing circulating LPS levels, or (4) blocking the response of immune cells and microglia to LPS. However, the hypothesis has a number of limitations and requires further testing, in particular whether reducing LPS levels can reduce PD incidence, progression, or severity. © 2023 The Authors.

37130861,"Gut microbiome dysbiosis across early Parkinson's disease, REM sleep behavior disorder and their first-degree relatives.","The microbiota-gut-brain axis has been suggested to play an important role in Parkinson's disease (PD). Here we performed a cross-sectional study to profile gut microbiota across early PD, REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), first-degree relatives of RBD (RBD-FDR), and healthy controls, which could reflect the gut-brain staging model of PD. We show gut microbiota compositions are significantly altered in early PD and RBD compared with control and RBD-FDR. Depletion of butyrate-producing bacteria and enrichment of pro-inflammatory Collinsella have already emerged in RBD and RBD-FDR after controlling potential confounders including antidepressants, osmotic laxatives, and bowel movement frequency. Random forest modelling identifies 12 microbial markers that are effective to distinguish RBD from control. These findings suggest that PD-like gut dysbiosis occurs at the prodromal stages of PD when RBD develops and starts to emerge in the younger RBD-FDR subjects. The study will have etiological and diagnostic implications.",Nature communications,2023,Bei Huang; Steven W H Chau; Yaping Liu; Joey W Y Chan; Jing Wang; Suk Ling Ma; Jihui Zhang; Paul K S Chan; Yun Kit Yeoh; Zigui Chen; Li Zhou; Sunny Hei Wong; Vincent C T Mok; Ka Fai To; Hei Ming Lai; Simon Ng; Claudia Trenkwalder; Francis K L Chan; Yun Kwok Wing
37110302,Gut Dysbiosis: A Target for Protective Interventions against Parkinson's Disease.,"Sub-chronic inflammation, caused by age-related dysbiosis, primes the brain to neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative diseases. Evidence revealed that Parkinson's disease (PD) might originate in the gut, demonstrating gastro-intestinal disturbances, as reported by PD patients long before developing motor symptoms. In this study, we conducted comparative analyses in relatively young and old mice maintained in conventional or gnotobiotic conditions. We aimed to confirm that the effects induced by age-related dysbiosis, rather than aging itself, sensitize to PD onset. This hypothesis was confirmed in germ-free (GF) mice, which proved resistant to the pharmacological induction of PD, regardless of their age. Contrary to conventional animals, old GF mice did not develop an inflammatory phenotype or an accumulation of iron in the brain, two catalysts sensitizing to disease onset. The resistance of GF mice to PD is reverted when colonized with stool collected from conventional old animals, but not if receiving bacterial content from young mice. Hence, changes in gut microbiota composition are a risk factor for PD development and can be targeted preventively by iron chelators, shown to protect the brain from pro-inflammatory intestinal priming that sensitizes to neuroinflammation and the development of severe PD.",Microorganisms,2023,Illyane S Lima; Ana C Pêgo; Ana C Martins; Ana R Prada; João Tomás Barros; Gracelino Martins; Raffaella Gozzelino
37065853,Getting closer to modeling the gut-brain axis using induced pluripotent stem cells.,"The gut microbiome (GM), the gut barrier, and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) are key elements of the gut-brain axis (GBA). The advances in organ-on-a-chip and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSCs) technology might enable more physiological gut-brain-axis-on-a-chip models. The ability to mimic complex physiological functions of the GBA is needed in basic mechanistic research as well as disease research of psychiatric, neurodevelopmental, functional, and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. These brain disorders have been associated with GM dysbiosis, which may affect the brain <i>via</i> the GBA. Although animal models have paved the way for the breakthroughs and progression in the understanding of the GBA, the fundamental questions of exactly when, how, and why still remain unanswered. The research of the complex GBA have relied on equally complex animal models, but today's ethical knowledge and responsibilities demand interdisciplinary development of non-animal models to study such systems. In this review we briefly describe the gut barrier and BBB, provide an overview of current cell models, and discuss the use of iPSCs in these GBA elements.

Due to the dynamic progress of diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's Disease (PD), Schizophrenia, Depression, and Multiple Sclerosis (MD), scientists are mobilized to look for new and more effective methods of interventions. A growing body of evidence suggests that inflammatory processes and an imbalance in the composition and function of the gut microbiome, which play a critical role in the pathogenesis of various neurological diseases and dietary interventions, such as the Mediterranean diet the DASH diet, or the ketogenic diet can have beneficial effects on their course. The aim of this review was to take a closer look at the role of diet and its ingredients in modulating inflammation associated with the development and/or progression of central nervous system diseases. Presented data shows that consuming a diet abundant in fruits, vegetables, nuts, herbs, spices, and legumes that are sources of anti-inflammatory elements such as omega-3 fatty acids, polyphenols, vitamins, essential minerals, and probiotics while avoiding foods that promote inflammation, create a positive brain environment and is associated with a reduced risk of neurological diseases. Personalized nutritional interventions may constitute a non-invasive and effective strategy in combating neurological disorders.",Nutrients,2023,Antonina Kurowska; Wojciech Ziemichód; Mariola Herbet; Iwona Piątkowska-Chmiel
36984872,A Comprehensive NMR Analysis of Serum and Fecal Metabolites in Familial Dysautonomia Patients Reveals Significant Metabolic Perturbations.,"Central metabolism has a profound impact on the clinical phenotypes and penetrance of neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's (PD) diseases, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). In contrast to the multifactorial origin of these neurological diseases, neurodevelopmental impairment and neurodegeneration in Familial Dysautonomia (FD) results from a single point mutation in the <i>ELP1</i> gene. FD patients represent a well-defined population who can help us better understand the cellular networks underlying neurodegeneration, and how disease traits are affected by metabolic dysfunction, which in turn may contribute to dysregulation of the gut-brain axis of FD. Here, <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectroscopy was employed to characterize the serum and fecal metabolomes of FD patients, and to assess similarities and differences in the polar metabolite profiles between FD patients and healthy relative controls. Findings from this work revealed noteworthy metabolic alterations reflected in energy (ATP) production, mitochondrial function, amino acid and nucleotide catabolism, neurosignaling molecules, and gut-microbial metabolism. These results provide further evidence for a close interconnection between metabolism, neurodegeneration, and gut microbiome dysbiosis in FD, and create an opportunity to explore whether metabolic interventions targeting the gut-brain-metabolism axis of FD could be used to redress or slow down the progressive neurodegeneration observed in FD patients.",Metabolites,2023,Stephanann M Costello; Alexandra M Cheney; Annie Waldum; Brian Tripet; Maria Cotrina-Vidal; Horacio Kaufmann; Lucy Norcliffe-Kaufmann; Frances Lefcort; Valérie Copié
36984505,Controlling the Impact of <i>Helicobacter pylori</i>-Related Hyperhomocysteinemia on Neurodegeneration.,"<i>Helicobacter pylori</i> infection consists a high global burden affecting more than 50% of the world's population. It is implicated, beyond substantiated local gastric pathologies, i.e., peptic ulcers and gastric cancer, in the pathophysiology of several neurodegenerative disorders, mainly by inducing hyperhomocysteinemia-related brain cortical thinning (BCT). BCT has been advocated as a possible biomarker associated with neurodegenerative central nervous system disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and/or glaucoma, termed as ""ocular Alzheimer's disease"". According to the infection hypothesis in relation to neurodegeneration, <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> as non-commensal gut microbiome has been advocated as trigger and/or mediator of neurodegenerative diseases, such as the development of Alzheimer's disease. Among others, <i>Helicobacter pylori</i>-related inflammatory mediators, defensins, autophagy, vitamin D, dietary factors, role of probiotics, and some pathogenetic considerations including relevant involved genes are discussed within this opinion article. In conclusion, by controlling the impact of <i>Helicobacter pylori</i>-related hyperhomocysteinemia on neurodegenerative disorders might offer benefits, and additional research is warranted to clarify this crucial topic currently representing a major worldwide burden.","Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2023,Jannis Kountouras; Michael Doulberis; Apostolis Papaefthymiou; Stergios A Polyzos; Christos Zavos; Evangelos Kazakos; Stergios Arapoglou; Foteini Kyrailidi; Maria C Mouratidou; Marina Boziki; Elisabeth Vardaka
36978911,The Potential of Flavonoids and Flavonoid Metabolites in the Treatment of Neurodegenerative Pathology in Disorders of Cognitive Decline.,"Flavonoids are a biodiverse family of dietary compounds that have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and antibacterial cell protective profiles. They have received considerable attention as potential therapeutic agents in biomedicine and have been widely used in traditional complimentary medicine for generations. Such complimentary medical herbal formulations are extremely complex mixtures of many pharmacologically active compounds that provide a therapeutic outcome through a network pharmacological effects of considerable complexity. Methods are emerging to determine the active components used in complimentary medicine and their therapeutic targets and to decipher the complexities of how network pharmacology provides such therapeutic effects. The gut microbiome has important roles to play in the generation of bioactive flavonoid metabolites retaining or exceeding the antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties of the intact flavonoid and, in some cases, new antitumor and antineurodegenerative bioactivities. Certain food items have been identified with high prebiotic profiles suggesting that neutraceutical supplementation may be beneficially employed to preserve a healthy population of bacterial symbiont species and minimize the establishment of harmful pathogenic organisms. Gut health is an important consideration effecting the overall health and wellbeing of linked organ systems. Bioconversion of dietary flavonoid components in the gut generates therapeutic metabolites that can also be transported by the vagus nerve and systemic circulation to brain cell populations to exert a beneficial effect. This is particularly important in a number of neurological disorders (autism, bipolar disorder, AD, PD) characterized by effects on moods, resulting in depression and anxiety, impaired motor function, and long-term cognitive decline. Native flavonoids have many beneficial properties in the alleviation of inflammation in tissues, however, concerns have been raised that therapeutic levels of flavonoids may not be achieved, thus allowing them to display optimal therapeutic effects. Dietary manipulation and vagal stimulation have both yielded beneficial responses in the treatment of autism spectrum disorders, depression, and anxiety, establishing the vagal nerve as a route of communication in the gut-brain axis with established roles in disease intervention. While a number of native flavonoids are beneficial in the treatment of neurological disorders and are known to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, microbiome-generated flavonoid metabolites (e.g., protocatechuic acid, urolithins, γ-valerolactones), which retain the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potency of the native flavonoid in addition to bioactive properties that promote mitochondrial health and cerebrovascular microcapillary function, should also be considered as potential biotherapeutic agents. Studies are warranted to experimentally examine the efficacy of flavonoid metabolites directly, as they emerge as novel therapeutic options.","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,James Melrose
36938477,Evaluating the effectiveness of probiotics in relieving constipation in Parkinson's disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of probiotics on the treatment of constipation in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) by analyzing data from published randomized clinical trials (RCTs). PD is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by clinical symptoms such as rigidity, bradykinesia, and resting tremor. Constipation is a common complaint reported by PD patients. Probiotics are often used to treat functional constipation. The potential mechanisms behind PD-related constipation include dysfunction of the enteric nervous system due to alpha-synuclein aggregation, dyssynergic contractions of the puborectalis muscle, and alterations of the gut microbiome.To conduct this study, we searched Scopus, PubMed, and Google Scholar for published articles on PD, probiotics, and constipation. We selected RCTs from 944 studies, and ultimately included 3 RCTs in our meta-analysis. The frequency of bowel movements per week was the only index that could be summarized among the records. We extracted and analyzed the results as means and standard deviations.We calculated a standardized mean difference (SMD) of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.65 to 1.19; I-squared = 57.0%; p < 0.001) to determine the treatment effect in terms of frequency of bowel movements per week in the RCTs.Our results show that probiotic intake has beneficial effects on constipation in PD patients. Further research, including multicenter studies, is needed to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of probiotic supplements in neurodegenerative diseases.",Heliyon,2023,Nasibeh Ghalandari; Farhad Assarzadegan; Hossein Mahdavi; Elham Jamshidi; Hadi Esmaily
36843420,Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"A growing body of evidence has demonstrated an intricate association between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and neurodegenerative conditions, expanding beyond previous foci of comorbidities between IBD and mood disorders. These new discoveries stem from an improved understanding of the gut-microbiome-brain axis: specifically, the ability of the intestinal microbiota to modulate inflammation and regulate neuromodulatory compounds. Clinical retrospective studies incorporating large sample sizes and population-based cohorts have demonstrated and confirmed the relevance of IBD and chronic neurodegeneration in clinical medicine. In this review, we expound upon the current knowledge on the gut-microbiome-brain axis, highlighting several plausible mechanisms linking IBD with neurodegeneration. We also summarize the known associations between IBD with Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, vascular dementia and ischemic stroke, and multiple sclerosis in a clinical context. Finally, we discuss the implications of an improved understanding of the gut-microbiome-brain axis in preventing, diagnosing, and managing neurodegeneration among IBD and non-IBD patients.",Gut and liver,2023,Jin Sun Kim; Mu-Hong Chen; Hohui E Wang; Ching-Liang Lu; Yen-Po Wang; Bing Zhang
36816743,The Role of Gut Microbiota in Various Neurological and Psychiatric Disorders-An Evidence Mapping Based on Quantified Evidence.,"We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Epistemonikos to identify systematic reviews and meta-analysis (SRs). We searched for neurological diseases and psychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), anorexia nervosa (AN), bipolar disorder (BD), eating disorder (ED), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), major depressive disorder (MDD), multiple sclerosis (MS), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), Parkinson's disease (PD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), spinal cord injury (SCI), schizophrenia, and stroke. We used A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR-2) to evaluate the quality of included SRs. We also created an evidence map showing the role of gut microbiota in neurological diseases and the certainty of the evidence.In total, 42 studies were included in this evidence mapping. Most findings were obtained from observational studies. According to the AMSTAR-2 assessment, 21 SRs scored ""critically low"" in terms of methodological quality, 16 SR scored ""low,"" and 5 SR scored ""moderate."" A total of 15 diseases have been investigated for the potential association between gut microbiome alpha diversity and disease, with the Shannon index and Simpson index being the most widely studied. A total of 12 diseases were investigated for potential link between beta diversity and disease. At the phylum level, <i>Firmicutes</i>, <i>Bacteroidetes</i>, <i>Actinobacteria</i>, <i>Proteobacteria</i>, and <i>Verrucomicrobia</i> were more researched. At the genus level, <i>Prevotella</i>, <i>Coprococcus</i>, <i>Parabacteroides</i>, <i>Phascolarctobacterium</i>, <i>Escherichia Shigella</i>, <i>Alistipes</i>, <i>Sutteralla</i>, <i>Veillonella</i>, <i>Odoribacter</i>, <i>Faecalibacterium</i>, <i>Bacteroides</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, <i>Dialister</i>, and <i>Blautia</i> were more researched. Some diseases have been found to have specific flora changes, and some diseases have been found to have common intestinal microbiological changes.We found varied levels of evidence for the associations between gut microbiota and neurological diseases; some gut microbiota increased the risk of neurological diseases, whereas others showed evidence of benefit that gut microbiota might be promising therapeutic targets for such diseases.",Mediators of inflammation,2023,Yaning Zang; Xigui Lai; Conghui Li; Dongfang Ding; Ying Wang; Yi Zhu
36769029,Health Benefits of Coffee Consumption for Cancer and Other Diseases and Mechanisms of Action.,"Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages worldwide, and epidemiology studies associate higher coffee consumption with decreased rates of mortality and decreased rates of neurological and metabolic diseases, including Parkinson's disease and type 2 diabetes. In addition, there is also evidence that higher coffee consumption is associated with lower rates of colon and rectal cancer, as well as breast, endometrial, and other cancers, although for some of these cancers, the results are conflicting. These studies reflect the chemopreventive effects of coffee; there is also evidence that coffee consumption may be therapeutic for some forms of breast and colon cancer, and this needs to be further investigated. The mechanisms associated with the chemopreventive or chemotherapeutic effects of over 1000 individual compounds in roasted coffee are complex and may vary with different diseases. Some of these mechanisms may be related to nuclear factor erythroid 2 (Nrf2)-regulated pathways that target oxidative stress or pathways that induce reactive oxygen species to kill diseased cells (primarily therapeutic). There is evidence for the involvement of receptors which include the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and orphan nuclear receptor 4A1 (NR4A1), as well as contributions from epigenetic pathways and the gut microbiome. Further elucidation of the mechanisms will facilitate the potential future clinical applications of coffee extracts for treating cancer and other inflammatory diseases.",International journal of molecular sciences,2023,Stephen Safe; Jainish Kothari; Amanuel Hailemariam; Srijana Upadhyay; Laurie A Davidson; Robert S Chapkin
36750613,Gut microbiota of Parkinson's disease in an appendectomy cohort: a preliminary study.,"In patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), α-synuclein pathology is thought to spread to the brain via the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve. The link between the gut microbiome and PD has been explored in various studies. The appendix might play an important role in immunity by maintaining the microbiota as a reservoir. In recent times, appendectomy has been linked to a lower risk of PD, possibly owing to the role of the appendix in altering the gut microbiome. We aimed to elucidate whether the gut microbiota affects PD development in the appendectomy cohort. We analyzed the fecal microbial composition in patients with PD and healthy controls with and without a history of appendectomy. The abundance of microbes from the family Enterobacteriaceae was higher in feces samples from patients with Parkinson's disease compared to that in samples collected from healthy controls. Furthermore, there was a significant phylogenetic difference between patients with PD and healthy controls who had undergone appendectomy. There was a significant phylogenetic difference between patients with PD and HCs who had undergone APP. These results suggest the correlation between gut microbiota and PD in patients who have undergone APP.",Scientific reports,2023,Keiichi Nakahara; Shunya Nakane; Kazuo Ishii; Tokunori Ikeda; Yukio Ando
36674517,The Role of Fecal Microbiota Transplantation in the Treatment of Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Review.,"Neurodegenerative diseases are highly prevalent but poorly understood, and with few treatment options despite decades of intense research, attention has recently shifted toward other mediators of neurological disease that may present future targets for therapeutic research. One such mediator is the gut microbiome, which communicates with the brain through the gut-brain axis and has been implicated in various neurological disorders. Alterations in the gut microbiome have been associated with numerous neurological and other diseases, and restoration of the dysbiotic gut has been shown to improve disease conditions. One method of restoring a dysbiotic gut is via fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), recolonizing the ""diseased"" gut with normal microbiome. Fecal microbiota transplantation is a treatment method traditionally used for <i>Clostridium difficile</i> infections, but it has recently been used in neurodegenerative disease research as a potential treatment method. This review aims to present a summary of neurodegenerative research that has used FMT, whether as a treatment or to investigate how the microbiome influences pathogenesis.",International journal of molecular sciences,2023,Julie-Anne T Matheson; R M Damian Holsinger

The abundance of Bacteroides increased in Group 1, whereas it decreased in Group 2. The abundance of Prevotella increased while the abundance of Lactobacillus decreased in both Group 1 and Group 2. Among species, a decrease was seen in Escherichia coli, Akkermansia muciniphila CAG:154, Blautia spp., Coprobacillus sp., and Clostridium bolteae CAG:59, with an increase of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Prevotella copri, which are both beneficial.AFO-202 beta 1,3-1,6 glucan, in addition to balancing the gut microbiome in children with ASD and its role in effective control of curli-producing Enterobacteriaceae that leads to α-synuclein misfolding and accumulation, may have a prophylactic role in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases as well.",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2023,Kadalraja Raghavan; Vidyasagar Devaprasad Dedeepiya; Naoki Yamamoto; Nobunao Ikewaki; Tohru Sonoda; Masaru Iwasaki; Ramesh Shankar Kandaswamy; Rajappa Senthilkumar; Senthilkumar Preethy; Samuel J K Abraham
38694913,Current and further outlook on the protective potential of <i>Antrodia camphorata</i> against neurological disorders.,"Prevalent neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and stroke are increasingly becoming a global burden as society ages. It is well-known that degeneration and loss of neurons are the fundamental underlying processes, but there are still no effective therapies for these neurological diseases. In recent years, plenty of studies have focused on the pharmacology and feasibility of natural products as new strategies for the development of drugs that target neurological disorders. <i>Antrodia camphorata</i> has become one of the most promising candidates, and the crude extracts and some active metabolites of it have been reported to play various pharmacological activities to alleviate neurological symptoms at cellular and molecular levels. This review highlights the current evidence of <i>Antrodia camphorata</i> against neurological disorders, including safety evaluation, metabolism, blood-brain barrier penetration, neuroprotective activities, and the potential on regulating the gut-microbiome-brain axis. Furthermore, potential strategies to resolve problematic issues identified in previous studies are also discussed.

38686220,"Safety and efficacy of faecal microbiota transplantation in patients with mild to moderate Parkinson's disease (GUT-PARFECT): a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, phase 2 trial.","Dysregulation of the gut microbiome has been implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD). This study aimed to evaluate the clinical effects and safety of a single faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in patients with early-stage PD.The GUT-PARFECT trial, a single-centre randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at Ghent University Hospital between December 01, 2020 and December 12, 2022. Participants (aged 50-65 years, Hoehn and Yahr stage 2) were randomly assigned to receive nasojejunal FMT with either healthy donor stool or their own stool. Computer-generated randomisation was done in a 1:1 ratio through permutated-block scheduling. Treatment allocation was concealed for participants and investigators. The primary outcome measure at 12 months was the change in the Movement Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) motor score obtained during off-medication evaluations. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed using a mixed model for repeated measures analysis. This completed trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03808389).Between December 2020 and December 2021, FMT procedures were conducted on 46 patients with PD: 22 in the healthy donor group and 24 in the placebo group. Clinical evaluations were performed at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months post-FMT. Full data analysis was possible for 21 participants in the healthy donor group and 22 in the placebo group. After 12 months, the MDS-UPDRS motor score significantly improved by a mean of 5.8 points (95% CI -11.4 to -0.2) in the healthy donor group and by 2.7 points (-8.3 to 2.9) in the placebo group (p = 0.0235). Adverse events were limited to temporary abdominal discomfort.Our findings suggested a single FMT induced mild, but long-lasting beneficial effects on motor symptoms in patients with early-stage PD.

All the included studies exhibited reasonable quality. The included studies reported the data on the ratios of 10 families of GM. Of these 10 microbiota families, Bifidobacteriaceae, Ruminococcaceae, Rikenellaceae, Lactobacillaceae, Verrucomicrobiaceae and Christensenellaceae were found to have increased ratios according to the pooled ratios, while Prevotellaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Erysipelotrichaceae and Faecalibacterium were decreased in PD cases.Patients in the PD cohort exhibited distinctive microbiota compositions compared to healthy individuals, with unique differential patterns in gut microbiome abundance at the phylum, family, and genus levels that may be associated wtih PD pathogenesis.",Experimental gerontology,2024,Fusheng Bai; Lin You; Hongyan Lei; Xinming Li
38664425,Effects of microbiome-based interventions on neurodegenerative diseases: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are characterized by neuronal damage and progressive loss of neuron function. Microbiome-based interventions, such as dietary interventions, biotics, and fecal microbiome transplant, have been proposed as a novel approach to managing symptoms and modulating disease progression. Emerging clinical trials have investigated the efficacy of interventions modulating the GM in alleviating or reversing disease progression, yet no comprehensive synthesis have been done. A systematic review of the literature was therefore conducted to investigate the efficacy of microbiome-modulating methods. The search yielded 4051 articles, with 15 clinical trials included. The overall risk of bias was moderate in most studies. Most microbiome-modulating interventions changed the GM composition. Despite inconsistent changes in GM composition, the meta-analysis showed that microbiome-modulating interventions improved disease burden (SMD, - 0.57; 95% CI - 0.93 to - 0.21; I<sup>2</sup> = 42%; P = 0.002) with a qualitative trend of improvement in constipation.

38649365,Diet and the gut microbiome in patients with Parkinson's disease.,"It has been suggested that gut microbiota influence Parkinson's disease (PD) via the gut-brain axis. Here, we examine associations between diet and gut microbiome composition and its predicted functional pathways in patients with PD. We assessed gut microbiota in fecal samples from 85 PD patients in central California using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Diet quality was assessed by calculating the Healthy Eating Index 2015 (HEI-2015) based on the Diet History Questionnaire II. We examined associations of diet quality, fiber, and added sugar intake with microbial diversity, composition, taxon abundance, and predicted metagenomic profiles, adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and sequencing platform. Higher HEI scores and fiber intake were associated with an increase in putative anti-inflammatory butyrate-producing bacteria, such as the genera Butyricicoccus and Coprococcus 1. Conversely, higher added sugar intake was associated with an increase in putative pro-inflammatory bacteria, such as the genera Klebsiella. Predictive metagenomics suggested that bacterial genes involved in the biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharide decreased with higher HEI scores, whereas a simultaneous decrease in genes involved in taurine degradation indicates less neuroinflammation. We found that a healthy diet, fiber, and added sugar intake affect the gut microbiome composition and its predicted metagenomic function in PD patients. This suggests that a healthy diet may support gut microbiome that has a positive influence on PD risk and progression.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2024,Dayoon Kwon; Keren Zhang; Kimberly C Paul; Aline D Folle; Irish Del Rosario; Jonathan P Jacobs; Adrienne M Keener; Jeff M Bronstein; Beate Ritz
38648770,Role of the Gut Microbiome and Bacterial Amyloids in the Development of Synucleinopathies.,"Less than ten years ago, evidence began to accumulate about association between the changes in the composition of gut microbiota and development of human synucleinopathies, in particular sporadic form of Parkinson's disease. We collected data from more than one hundred and thirty experimental studies that reported similar results and summarized the frequencies of detection of different groups of bacteria in these studies. It is important to note that it is extremely rare that a unidirectional change in the population of one or another group of microorganisms (only an elevation or only a reduction) was detected in the patients with Parkinson's disease. However, we were able to identify several groups of bacteria that were overrepresented in the patients with Parkinson's disease in the analyzed studies. There are various hypotheses about the molecular mechanisms that explain such relationships. Usually, α-synuclein aggregation is associated with the development of inflammatory processes that occur in response to the changes in the microbiome. However, experimental evidence is accumulating on the influence of bacterial proteins, including amyloids (curli), as well as various metabolites, on the α-synuclein aggregation.

38627687,Ambient long-term exposure to organophosphorus pesticides and the human gut microbiome: an observational study.,"Organophosphorus pesticides (OP) have been associated with various human health conditions. Animal experiments and in-vitro models suggested that OP may also affect the gut microbiota. We examined associations between ambient chronic exposure to OP and gut microbial changes in humans.We recruited 190 participants from a community-based epidemiologic study of Parkinson's disease living in a region known for heavy agricultural pesticide use in California. Of these, 61% of participants had Parkinson's disease and their mean age was 72 years. Microbiome and predicted metagenome data were generated by 16S rRNA gene sequencing of fecal samples. Ambient long-term OP exposures were assessed using pesticide application records combined with residential addresses in a geographic information system. We examined gut microbiome differences due to OP exposures, specifically differences in microbial diversity based on the Shannon index and Bray-Curtis dissimilarities, and differential taxa abundance and predicted Metacyc pathway expression relying on regression models and adjusting for potential confounders.OP exposure was not associated with alpha or beta diversity of the gut microbiome. However, the predicted metagenome was sparser and less evenly expressed among those highly exposed to OP (p = 0.04). Additionally, we found that the abundance of two bacterial families, 22 genera, and the predicted expression of 34 Metacyc pathways were associated with long-term OP exposure. These pathways included perturbed processes related to cellular respiration, increased biosynthesis and degradation of compounds related to bacterial wall structure, increased biosynthesis of RNA/DNA precursors, and decreased synthesis of Vitamin B1 and B6.In support of previous animal studies and in-vitro findings, our results suggest that ambient chronic OP pesticide exposure alters gut microbiome composition and its predicted metabolism in humans.",Environmental health : a global access science source,2024,Keren Zhang; Kimberly Paul; Jonathan P Jacobs; Myles G Cockburn; Jeff M Bronstein; Irish Del Rosario; Beate Ritz

However, high-quality cohort studies focusing on a potential causal role of different types and sites of infection are lacking. Gastrointestinal infections are of a particular interest due to growing evidence implicating gut dysbiosis in Parkinson's disease aetiology. This population-based cohort study used the Swedish Total Population Register to identify individuals born during 1944-77 and resident in Sweden between 1990 and 2018 (<i>N</i> = 3 698 319). Hospital-treated infections at ages 21-30 and 31-40 years were identified from the National Patient Register. Participants were followed to identify Parkinson's disease diagnoses from age 41 years up to December 31, 2018, when the oldest individual reached 75 years. Cox regression with a sibling comparison design to tackle familial genetic and environmental confounding was used to derive hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for each infection site, type, or any infections at ages 21-30 and 31-40 years. During a median follow-up of 15.4 years, 8815 unique Parkinson's disease diagnoses were accrued, with a crude rate of 17.3 (95% confidence interval 17.0, 17.7) per 100 000 person-years. After controlling for shared familial factors, hospital-treated gastrointestinal and respiratory infections between 21 and 30 years of age were associated with a greater risk of Parkinson's disease [hazard ratios 1.35 (95% confidence interval: 1.05, 1.75) and 1.45 (95% confidence interval: 1.08, 1.95), respectively]; no association was found for any infections at age 31-40 [hazard ratio 1.05 (95% confidence interval: 0.93, 1.19)]. After adjustment, no statistically significant associations were observed for other sites including genitourinary and skin. These findings suggest that hospital-treated infections of the gastrointestinal tract and lungs, both of which may have an influence on the gut microbiome, by age 30 years may be risk factors for Parkinson's disease.",Brain communications,2024,Snieguole Vingeliene; Ayako Hiyoshi; Marleen A H Lentjes; Robert J Brummer; Katja Fall; Scott Montgomery
38540341,"Effects of Paraquat, Dextran Sulfate Sodium, and Irradiation on Behavioral and Cognitive Performance and the Gut Microbiome in A53T and A53T-L444P Mice.","Heterozygous carriers of the glucocerebrosidase 1 (GBA) L444P Gaucher mutation have an increased risk of developing Parkinson's disease (PD). The GBA mutations result in elevated alpha synuclein (aSyn) levels. Heterozygous mice carrying one allele with the L444P mutation knocked-into the mouse gene show increased aSyn levels and are more sensitive to motor deficits following exposure to the neurotoxin (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) MPTP than wild-type mice. Paraquat (PQ), a herbicide, increases PD risk in most studies. Its effects on the brain involve alterations in the gut microbiome. Exposure to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), a mouse model of colitis, can be used to determine whether gut microbiome alterations are sufficient to induce PD-relevant phenotypes. We rederived the A53T-L444P and A53T mouse lines to assess whether PQ, PQ in combination with radiation exposure (IR), and DSS have differential effects in A53T and A53T-L444P mice and whether these effects are associated with alterations in the gut microbiome. PQ and PQ + IR have differential effects in A53T and A53T-L444P mice. In contrast, effects of DSS are only seen in A53T-L444P mice. Exposure and genotype modulate the relationship between the gut microbiome and behavioral performance. The gut microbiome may be an important mediator of how environmental exposures or genetic mutations yield behavioral and cognitive impacts.",Genes,2024,Ariel Chaklai; Abigail O'Neil; Shrey Goel; Nick Margolies; Destine Krenik; Ruby Perez; Kat Kessler; Elizabeth Staltontall; Hong Ki Eric Yoon; Montzerrat Pantoja; Keaton Stagaman; Kristin Kasschau; Vivek Unni; Robert Duvoisin; Thomas Sharpton; Jacob Raber
