38694913,Current and further outlook on the protective potential of <i>Antrodia camphorata</i> against neurological disorders.,"Prevalent neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and stroke are increasingly becoming a global burden as society ages. It is well-known that degeneration and loss of neurons are the fundamental underlying processes, but there are still no effective therapies for these neurological diseases. In recent years, plenty of studies have focused on the pharmacology and feasibility of natural products as new strategies for the development of drugs that target neurological disorders. <i>Antrodia camphorata</i> has become one of the most promising candidates, and the crude extracts and some active metabolites of it have been reported to play various pharmacological activities to alleviate neurological symptoms at cellular and molecular levels. This review highlights the current evidence of <i>Antrodia camphorata</i> against neurological disorders, including safety evaluation, metabolism, blood-brain barrier penetration, neuroprotective activities, and the potential on regulating the gut-microbiome-brain axis. Furthermore, potential strategies to resolve problematic issues identified in previous studies are also discussed. We aim to provide an overview for the ongoing development and utilization of <i>Antrodia camphorata</i> in cerebral neuropathology.",Frontiers in pharmacology,2024,Weiling Li; Pin Wan; Jialu Qiao; Yuchen Liu; Qian Peng; Zehua Zhang; Xiji Shu; Yiyuan Xia; Binlian Sun
38686220,"Safety and efficacy of faecal microbiota transplantation in patients with mild to moderate Parkinson's disease (GUT-PARFECT): a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, phase 2 trial.","Dysregulation of the gut microbiome has been implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD). This study aimed to evaluate the clinical effects and safety of a single faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in patients with early-stage PD.The GUT-PARFECT trial, a single-centre randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at Ghent University Hospital between December 01, 2020 and December 12, 2022. Participants (aged 50-65 years, Hoehn and Yahr stage 2) were randomly assigned to receive nasojejunal FMT with either healthy donor stool or their own stool. Computer-generated randomisation was done in a 1:1 ratio through permutated-block scheduling. Treatment allocation was concealed for participants and investigators. The primary outcome measure at 12 months was the change in the Movement Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) motor score obtained during off-medication evaluations. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed using a mixed model for repeated measures analysis. This completed trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03808389).Between December 2020 and December 2021, FMT procedures were conducted on 46 patients with PD: 22 in the healthy donor group and 24 in the placebo group. Clinical evaluations were performed at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months post-FMT. Full data analysis was possible for 21 participants in the healthy donor group and 22 in the placebo group. After 12 months, the MDS-UPDRS motor score significantly improved by a mean of 5.8 points (95% CI -11.4 to -0.2) in the healthy donor group and by 2.7 points (-8.3 to 2.9) in the placebo group (p = 0.0235). Adverse events were limited to temporary abdominal discomfort.Our findings suggested a single FMT induced mild, but long-lasting beneficial effects on motor symptoms in patients with early-stage PD. These findings highlight the potential of modulating the gut microbiome as a therapeutic approach and warrant a further exploration of FMT in larger cohorts of patients with PD in various disease stages.Flemish PD patient organizations (VPL and Parkili), Research Foundation Flanders (FWO), Biocodex Microbiota Foundation.",EClinicalMedicine,2024,Arnout Bruggeman; Charysse Vandendriessche; Hannelore Hamerlinck; Danny De Looze; David J Tate; Marnik Vuylsteke; Lindsey De Commer; Lindsay Devolder; Jeroen Raes; Bruno Verhasselt; Debby Laukens; Roosmarijn E Vandenbroucke; Patrick Santens
38679353,Association between increased and decreased gut microbiota abundance and Parkinson's disease: A systematic review and subgroup meta-analysis.,"The objective of the study was to systematically investigate the association between gut microbiota (GM) abundance and Parkinson's disease (PD).PubMed, Medline, Cochrane Library and other literature datebase platforms were searched for eligible studies in the English-language from conception to March 1, 2024. Studies evaluating the association between GM and PD were included. The results of the included studies were analyzed using a random effects model with calculation of the mean difference (MD) with the 95 % confidence interval to quantify the incidence of differences in abundance of various bacterial families in PD patients. Continuous models were used to analyze the extracted data.A total of 14 studies with 1045 PD cases and 821 healthy controls were included for data extraction and meta-analysis. All the included studies exhibited reasonable quality. The included studies reported the data on the ratios of 10 families of GM. Of these 10 microbiota families, Bifidobacteriaceae, Ruminococcaceae, Rikenellaceae, Lactobacillaceae, Verrucomicrobiaceae and Christensenellaceae were found to have increased ratios according to the pooled ratios, while Prevotellaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Erysipelotrichaceae and Faecalibacterium were decreased in PD cases.Patients in the PD cohort exhibited distinctive microbiota compositions compared to healthy individuals, with unique differential patterns in gut microbiome abundance at the phylum, family, and genus levels that may be associated wtih PD pathogenesis.",Experimental gerontology,2024,Fusheng Bai; Lin You; Hongyan Lei; Xinming Li
38664425,Effects of microbiome-based interventions on neurodegenerative diseases: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are characterized by neuronal damage and progressive loss of neuron function. Microbiome-based interventions, such as dietary interventions, biotics, and fecal microbiome transplant, have been proposed as a novel approach to managing symptoms and modulating disease progression. Emerging clinical trials have investigated the efficacy of interventions modulating the GM in alleviating or reversing disease progression, yet no comprehensive synthesis have been done. A systematic review of the literature was therefore conducted to investigate the efficacy of microbiome-modulating methods. The search yielded 4051 articles, with 15 clinical trials included. The overall risk of bias was moderate in most studies. Most microbiome-modulating interventions changed the GM composition. Despite inconsistent changes in GM composition, the meta-analysis showed that microbiome-modulating interventions improved disease burden (SMD, - 0.57; 95% CI - 0.93 to - 0.21; I<sup>2</sup> = 42%; P = 0.002) with a qualitative trend of improvement in constipation. However, current studies have high methodological heterogeneity and small sample sizes, requiring more well-designed and controlled studies to elucidate the complex linkage between microbiome, microbiome-modulating interventions, and NDDs.",Scientific reports,2024,Zara Siu Wa Chui; Lily Man Lee Chan; Esther Wan Hei Zhang; Suisha Liang; Edmond Pui Hang Choi; Kris Yuet Wan Lok; Hein Min Tun; Jojo Yan Yan Kwok
38649365,Diet and the gut microbiome in patients with Parkinson's disease.,"It has been suggested that gut microbiota influence Parkinson's disease (PD) via the gut-brain axis. Here, we examine associations between diet and gut microbiome composition and its predicted functional pathways in patients with PD. We assessed gut microbiota in fecal samples from 85 PD patients in central California using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Diet quality was assessed by calculating the Healthy Eating Index 2015 (HEI-2015) based on the Diet History Questionnaire II. We examined associations of diet quality, fiber, and added sugar intake with microbial diversity, composition, taxon abundance, and predicted metagenomic profiles, adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and sequencing platform. Higher HEI scores and fiber intake were associated with an increase in putative anti-inflammatory butyrate-producing bacteria, such as the genera Butyricicoccus and Coprococcus 1. Conversely, higher added sugar intake was associated with an increase in putative pro-inflammatory bacteria, such as the genera Klebsiella. Predictive metagenomics suggested that bacterial genes involved in the biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharide decreased with higher HEI scores, whereas a simultaneous decrease in genes involved in taurine degradation indicates less neuroinflammation. We found that a healthy diet, fiber, and added sugar intake affect the gut microbiome composition and its predicted metagenomic function in PD patients. This suggests that a healthy diet may support gut microbiome that has a positive influence on PD risk and progression.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2024,Dayoon Kwon; Keren Zhang; Kimberly C Paul; Aline D Folle; Irish Del Rosario; Jonathan P Jacobs; Adrienne M Keener; Jeff M Bronstein; Beate Ritz
38648770,Role of the Gut Microbiome and Bacterial Amyloids in the Development of Synucleinopathies.,"Less than ten years ago, evidence began to accumulate about association between the changes in the composition of gut microbiota and development of human synucleinopathies, in particular sporadic form of Parkinson's disease. We collected data from more than one hundred and thirty experimental studies that reported similar results and summarized the frequencies of detection of different groups of bacteria in these studies. It is important to note that it is extremely rare that a unidirectional change in the population of one or another group of microorganisms (only an elevation or only a reduction) was detected in the patients with Parkinson's disease. However, we were able to identify several groups of bacteria that were overrepresented in the patients with Parkinson's disease in the analyzed studies. There are various hypotheses about the molecular mechanisms that explain such relationships. Usually, α-synuclein aggregation is associated with the development of inflammatory processes that occur in response to the changes in the microbiome. However, experimental evidence is accumulating on the influence of bacterial proteins, including amyloids (curli), as well as various metabolites, on the α-synuclein aggregation. In the review, we provided up-to-date information about such examples.",Biochemistry.

38627687,Ambient long-term exposure to organophosphorus pesticides and the human gut microbiome: an observational study.,"Organophosphorus pesticides (OP) have been associated with various human health conditions. Animal experiments and in-vitro models suggested that OP may also affect the gut microbiota. We examined associations between ambient chronic exposure to OP and gut microbial changes in humans.We recruited 190 participants from a community-based epidemiologic study of Parkinson's disease living in a region known for heavy agricultural pesticide use in California. Of these, 61% of participants had Parkinson's disease and their mean age was 72 years. Microbiome and predicted metagenome data were generated by 16S rRNA gene sequencing of fecal samples. Ambient long-term OP exposures were assessed using pesticide application records combined with residential addresses in a geographic information system. We examined gut microbiome differences due to OP exposures, specifically differences in microbial diversity based on the Shannon index and Bray-Curtis dissimilarities, and differential taxa abundance and predicted Metacyc pathway expression relying on regression models and adjusting for potential confounders.OP exposure was not associated with alpha or beta diversity of the gut microbiome. However, the predicted metagenome was sparser and less evenly expressed among those highly exposed to OP (p = 0.04). Additionally, we found that the abundance of two bacterial families, 22 genera, and the predicted expression of 34 Metacyc pathways were associated with long-term OP exposure. These pathways included perturbed processes related to cellular respiration, increased biosynthesis and degradation of compounds related to bacterial wall structure, increased biosynthesis of RNA/DNA precursors, and decreased synthesis of Vitamin B1 and B6.In support of previous animal studies and in-vitro findings, our results suggest that ambient chronic OP pesticide exposure alters gut microbiome composition and its predicted metabolism in humans.",Environmental health : a global access science source,2024,Keren Zhang; Kimberly Paul; Jonathan P Jacobs; Myles G Cockburn; Jeff M Bronstein; Irish Del Rosario; Beate Ritz
38582855,Gut microbiome is not associated with mild cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease.,"Gut microbiome differences between people with Parkinson's disease (PD) and control subjects without Parkinsonism are widely reported, but potential alterations related to PD with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have yet to be comprehensively explored. We compared gut microbial features of PD with MCI (n = 58) to cognitively unimpaired PD (n = 60) and control subjects (n = 90) with normal cognition. Our results did not support a specific microbiome signature related to MCI in PD.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2024,Velma T E Aho; Matthias Klee; Zied Landoulsi; Anna Heintz-Buschart; Lukas Pavelka; Anja K Leist; Rejko Krüger; Patrick May; Paul Wilmes; 
38562309,Hospital-treated infections and subsequent Parkinson's disease risk: a register-based sibling comparison study.,"Serious infections may result in greater risk of Parkinson's disease. However, high-quality cohort studies focusing on a potential causal role of different types and sites of infection are lacking. Gastrointestinal infections are of a particular interest due to growing evidence implicating gut dysbiosis in Parkinson's disease aetiology. This population-based cohort study used the Swedish Total Population Register to identify individuals born during 1944-77 and resident in Sweden between 1990 and 2018 (<i>N</i> = 3 698 319). Hospital-treated infections at ages 21-30 and 31-40 years were identified from the National Patient Register. Participants were followed to identify Parkinson's disease diagnoses from age 41 years up to December 31, 2018, when the oldest individual reached 75 years. Cox regression with a sibling comparison design to tackle familial genetic and environmental confounding was used to derive hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for each infection site, type, or any infections at ages 21-30 and 31-40 years. During a median follow-up of 15.4 years, 8815 unique Parkinson's disease diagnoses were accrued, with a crude rate of 17.3 (95% confidence interval 17.0, 17.7) per 100 000 person-years. After controlling for shared familial factors, hospital-treated gastrointestinal and respiratory infections between 21 and 30 years of age were associated with a greater risk of Parkinson's disease [hazard ratios 1.35 (95% confidence interval: 1.05, 1.75) and 1.45 (95% confidence interval: 1.08, 1.95), respectively]; no association was found for any infections at age 31-40 [hazard ratio 1.05 (95% confidence interval: 0.93, 1.19)]. After adjustment, no statistically significant associations were observed for other sites including genitourinary and skin. These findings suggest that hospital-treated infections of the gastrointestinal tract and lungs, both of which may have an influence on the gut microbiome, by age 30 years may be risk factors for Parkinson's disease.",Brain communications,2024,Snieguole Vingeliene; Ayako Hiyoshi; Marleen A H Lentjes; Robert J Brummer; Katja Fall; Scott Montgomery
38540341,"Effects of Paraquat, Dextran Sulfate Sodium, and Irradiation on Behavioral and Cognitive Performance and the Gut Microbiome in A53T and A53T-L444P Mice.","Heterozygous carriers of the glucocerebrosidase 1 (GBA) L444P Gaucher mutation have an increased risk of developing Parkinson's disease (PD). The GBA mutations result in elevated alpha synuclein (aSyn) levels. Heterozygous mice carrying one allele with the L444P mutation knocked-into the mouse gene show increased aSyn levels and are more sensitive to motor deficits following exposure to the neurotoxin (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) MPTP than wild-type mice. Paraquat (PQ), a herbicide, increases PD risk in most studies. Its effects on the brain involve alterations in the gut microbiome. Exposure to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), a mouse model of colitis, can be used to determine whether gut microbiome alterations are sufficient to induce PD-relevant phenotypes. We rederived the A53T-L444P and A53T mouse lines to assess whether PQ, PQ in combination with radiation exposure (IR), and DSS have differential effects in A53T and A53T-L444P mice and whether these effects are associated with alterations in the gut microbiome. PQ and PQ + IR have differential effects in A53T and A53T-L444P mice. In contrast, effects of DSS are only seen in A53T-L444P mice. Exposure and genotype modulate the relationship between the gut microbiome and behavioral performance. The gut microbiome may be an important mediator of how environmental exposures or genetic mutations yield behavioral and cognitive impacts.",Genes,2024,Ariel Chaklai; Abigail O'Neil; Shrey Goel; Nick Margolies; Destine Krenik; Ruby Perez; Kat Kessler; Elizabeth Staltontall; Hong Ki Eric Yoon; Montzerrat Pantoja; Keaton Stagaman; Kristin Kasschau; Vivek Unni; Robert Duvoisin; Thomas Sharpton; Jacob Raber
