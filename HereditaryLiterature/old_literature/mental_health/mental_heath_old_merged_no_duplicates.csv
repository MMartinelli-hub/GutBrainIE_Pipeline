31859119,"Infections, antibiotic treatment and the Microbiome in relation to schizophrenia.","Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder with several potential pathophysiological mechanisms, including immune activation. Infections have been identified as a significant contributing risk factor for schizophrenia; this association is reviewed together with the potential impact of antibiotic treatment and alterations of the intestinal microbiota. Both infections and the treatment with antibiotics may alter the composition of the gut microbiota, causing dysbiosis, which in animal studies has been associated with alterations of behavior. Of the few studies that have been conducted on humans, some have suggested alterations in the microbial composition of individuals with schizophrenia compared to healthy controls, albeit with conflicting results. Recently, increased attention has emerged regarding potential adverse effects from antibiotics, as a number of these have been associated with an increased risk of psychotic episodes. Particularly, the fluoroquinolones have been associated with neurotoxic adverse events. The association between schizophrenia and infections, antibiotic treatment and dysbiosis, may be an epiphenomenon, which could be explained by other confounding factors. However, these associations could be causal and could therefore be important risk factors in a subgroup of patients. Large-scale well-matched longitudinal studies are needed with measurements of immune markers from multiple biological samples, ranging from material close to the brain, as cerebrospinal fluid and brain-scans targeting neuroinflammation, to analysis of blood and intestinal microbiota. This would help to obtain more definite results on the association between infections, immune components and microbiota alterations in relation to schizophrenia.",Schizophrenia research,2021,Amalie W Klein-Petersen; Ole Köhler-Forsberg; Michael E Benros
31685046,Shotgun metagenomics reveals both taxonomic and tryptophan pathway differences of gut microbiota in major depressive disorder patients.,"The microbiota-gut-brain axis, especially the microbial tryptophan (Trp) biosynthesis and metabolism pathway (MiTBamp), may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder (MDD). However, studies on the MiTBamp in MDD are lacking. The aim of the present study was to analyze the gut microbiota composition and the MiTBamp in MDD patients.We performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing of stool samples from 26 MDD patients and 29 healthy controls (HCs). In addition to the microbiota community and the MiTBamp analyses, we also built a classification based on the Random Forests (RF) and Boruta algorithm to identify the gut microbiota as biomarkers for MDD.The Bacteroidetes abundance was strongly reduced whereas that of Actinobacteria was significantly increased in the MDD patients compared with the abundance in the HCs. Most noteworthy, the MDD patients had increased levels of Bifidobacterium, which is commonly used as a probiotic. Four Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) orthologies (KOs) (K01817, K11358, K01626, K01667) abundances in the MiTBamp were significantly lower in the MDD group. Furthermore, we found a negative correlation between the K01626 abundance and the HAMD scores in the MDD group. Finally, RF classification at the genus level can achieve an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.890.The present findings enabled a better understanding of the changes in gut microbiota and the related Trp pathway in MDD. Alterations of the gut microbiota may have the potential as biomarkers for distinguishing MDD patients form HCs.",Psychological medicine,2021,Wen-Tao Lai; Wen-Feng Deng; Shu-Xian Xu; Jie Zhao; Dan Xu; Yang-Hui Liu; Yuan-Yuan Guo; Ming-Bang Wang; Fu-Sheng He; Shu-Wei Ye; Qi-Fan Yang; Tie-Bang Liu; Ying-Li Zhang; Sheng Wang; Min-Zhi Li; Ying-Jia Yang; Xin-Hui Xie; Han Rong
30794085,"Associations among diet, the gastrointestinal microbiota, and negative emotional states in adults.","<b>Objective:</b> Habitual diet impacts mood and the human gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota. Yet, studies infrequently control for diet when evaluating associations between mood and GI microbiota. Accordingly, we aimed to investigate relationships among diet, GI microbiota, and mood in adults without mood disorders by conducting a cross-sectional examination of dietary intake, subjective emotional state, and fecal microbial taxa abundances. <b>Methods:</b> Adults (<i>N</i> = 133; 25-45 years of age) without physician-diagnosed mood disorders were studied. Fecal DNA was extracted, and the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced. Sequences were analyzed using QIIME2. Subjective mood state was assessed using the 42-item Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-42). Habitual dietary intake was measured with the National Cancer Institute's Diet History Questionnaire II, and diet quality was evaluated with the 2010 Healthy Eating Index (HEI). <b>Results:</b> Relationships were observed between 28 bacterial taxa and DASS-42 scores. Sex-dependent associations were observed among 21 bacterial taxa and DASS-42 scores, including an inverse relationship between Anxiety scale scores and <i>Bifidobacterium</i> in females and an inverse relationship between Depression scale scores and <i>Lactobacillus</i> in males. HEI total fruit and dairy components were inversely associated with Depression and Stress scales, respectively. <b>Conclusions:</b> These results suggest GI microbes are related to mood in adults without diagnosed mood disorders and that these relationships differ by sex and are influenced by dietary fiber intake. Incorporating dietary intake data in gut-microbiota-brain studies may help clarify the roles of specific microbes and dietary components in mental health symptoms.",Nutritional neuroscience,2020,Andrew M Taylor; Sharon V Thompson; Caitlyn G Edwards; Salma M A Musaad; Naiman A Khan; Hannah D Holscher
30415609,"Fermented foods, the gut and mental health: a mechanistic overview with implications for depression and anxiety.","Mental disorders including depression and anxiety are often comorbid with gut problems, suggesting a bidirectional relationship between mental health and gut function. Several mechanisms might explain this comorbidity, such as inflammation and immune activation; intestinal permeability; perturbations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis; neurotransmitter/neuropeptide dysregulation; dietary deficiencies; and disturbed gut microbiome composition. The potential of modulating the microbiome-gut-brain axis, and subsequently mental health, through the use of functional foods, is an emerging and novel topic of interest. Fermented foods are considered functional foods due to their putative health benefits. The process of microbial fermentation converts food substrates into more nutritionally and functionally rich products, resulting in functional microorganisms (probiotics), substrates that enhance proliferation of beneficial bacteria in the gut (prebiotics), and bioactive components (biogenics). These functional ingredients act biologically in the gastrointestinal tract and have the ability to modify the gut microbiota, influence translocation of endotoxins and subsequent immune activation, and promote host nutrition. This narrative review explores the theoretical potential of the functional components present in fermented foods to alter gut physiology and to impact the biological mechanisms thought to underpin depression and anxiety. Pre-clinical studies indicate the benefits of fermented foods in relieving perturbed gut function and for animal models of depression and anxiety. However, in humans, the literature relating to the relevance of fermented food for treating or preventing depression and anxiety is sparse, heterogeneous and has significant limitations. This review identifies a critical research gap for further evaluation of fermented foods in the management of depression anxiety in humans.",Nutritional neuroscience,2020,Hajara Aslam; Jessica Green; Felice N Jacka; Fiona Collier; Michael Berk; Julie Pasco; Samantha L Dawson
30466372,"An intermittent hypercaloric diet alters gut microbiota, prefrontal cortical gene expression and social behaviours in rats.","<b>Objectives:</b> Excessive consumption of high fat and high sugar (HFHS) diets alters reward processing, behaviour, and changes gut microbiota profiles. Previous studies in gnotobiotic mice also provide evidence that these gut microorganisms may influence social behaviour. To further investigate these interactions, we examined the impact of the intermittent access to a HFHS diet on social behaviour, gene expression and microbiota composition in adolescent rats. <b>Methods:</b> Male rats were permitted intermittent daily access (2 h / day) to a palatable HFHS chow diet for 28 days across adolescence. Social interaction, social memory and novel object recognition were assessed during this period. Following testing, RT-PCR was conducted on hippocampal and prefrontal cortex (PFC) samples. 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing was used for identification and relative quantification of bacterial taxa in faecal samples. <b>Results:</b> We observed reduced social interaction behaviours, impaired social memory and novel object recognition in HFHS diet rats compared to chow controls. RT-PCR revealed reduced levels of monoamine oxidase A (<i>Maoa</i>), catechol-O-methyltransferase (<i>Comt</i>) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (<i>Bdnf</i>) mRNA in the PFC of HFHS diet rats. Faecal microbiota analysis demonstrated that the relative abundance of a number of specific bacterial taxa differed significantly between the two diet groups, in particular, <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> and <i>Ruminoccoceae</i> bacteria. <b>Discussion:</b> Intermittent HFHS diet consumption evoked physiological changes to the brain, particularly expression of mRNA associated with reward and neuroplasticity, and gut microbiome. These changes may underpin the observed alterations to social behaviours.",Nutritional neuroscience,2020,Amy C Reichelt; Amy Loughman; Ashton Bernard; Mukesh Raipuria; Kirsten N Abbott; James Dachtler; Thi Thu Hao Van; Robert J Moore
31610228,Plasma cytokine levels in patients with chronic alcohol overconsumption: Relations to gut microbiota markers and clinical correlates.,"Alcohol-related morbidity may involve changes in the gut microbiota and immune dysregulation. We have previously demonstrated alterations in gut microbiota composition and functions in patients with alcohol overconsumption, and now aimed to investigate possible associations between cytokine levels, gut microbiota, and clinical symptoms.We included hospital inpatients with a history of chronic alcohol overconsumption. For comparison, we included control patients with a low alcohol intake. Cytokine levels (TGF-β1, TNF-α, IL-10, IL-8, IL-6, IFN-γ, MCP-1, IL-1RA, IL-1β, and IL-17) were determined using a customized V-plex assay. We then examined associations of cytokine levels with the abundance of Proteobacteria and Faecalibacterium, percentage of the short-chain fatty acid butyrate, psychiatric symptoms (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), and biochemical liver variables.We included 28 patients with alcohol overconsumption (79% men), and 25 control patients (72% men). Patients with alcohol overconsumption had higher levels of IL-6 (p = 0.002), IFN-γ (p = 0.018), and MCP-1 (p = 0.006), and lower levels of TGF-β1 (p = 0.017) compared with control patients. Inverse correlations were found between Proteobacteria abundance and TNF-α (R<sub>s</sub> = -0.55, p = 0.02) and IL-8 (R<sub>s</sub> = -0.58, p = 0.014), and between Faecalibacterium and MCP-1 levels (R<sub>s</sub> = -0.56, p = 0.02) in the control patients, but not in patients with alcohol overconsumption. Patients with alcohol overconsumption reported more psychiatric symptoms, and these symptoms were inversely correlated with IL-10 levels. There were positive correlations between several of the assessed cytokines and biochemical liver variables, and negative correlations between cytokine levels and albumin.Patients with alcohol overconsumption had a cytokine profile suggestive of increased systemic inflammatory activity, with higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IFN-γ, and MCP-1) and lower levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines (TGF-β1). The findings may represent a link between alcohol use and alcohol-related morbidity.","Alcohol (Fayetteville, N.Y.)",2020,Steinar Traae Bjørkhaug; Sudan Prasad Neupane; Jørgen G Bramness; Håvard Aanes; Viggo Skar; Asle W Medhus; Jørgen Valeur
31255682,Altered gut microbiota and mucosal immunity in patients with schizophrenia.,"Evidence shows that gut microbiota may play important roles in schizophrenia pathogenesis via the ""gut-brain"" axis, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Here, eighty-four patients with schizophrenia and 84 sex- and age-matched healthy controls were enrolled. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing and 16S rRNA sequencing were performed, and the gut microbiota-associated epitopes (MEs) were predicted, which, together with IgA content, were used to determine the gut microbiota composition associated with gut immune status. Patients with schizophrenia had significantly reduced gut microbiota richnesses compared with those of the healthy controls, and the gut microbiota compositions clearly distinguished the patients with schizophrenia from the healthy controls. Based on two-stage metagenomic-wide association studies, nineteen gut microbiota taxonomies were associated with schizophrenia, and the microbial dysbiosis (MD) index was calculated based on the abundance of differential taxonomies. We found that MD index was positively correlated with MEs diversity and gut IgA levels, and negatively correlated with gut microbiota richness. Glutamate synthase (GOGAT) was more active in the guts of patients with schizophrenia than in those of healthy controls, and high GOGAT activity was associated with altered gut microbiota taxonomies associated with gut IgA levels. Our results may imply a role of the microbiome in the etiology of schizophrenia and contribute to the development of microbiome targeted interventions for schizophrenia.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2020,Ruihuan Xu; Bingbing Wu; Jingwen Liang; Fusheng He; Wen Gu; Kang Li; Yi Luo; Jianxia Chen; Yongbo Gao; Ze Wu; Yongqiang Wang; Wenhao Zhou; Mingbang Wang
30818031,Impact of chemotherapy on the association between fear of cancer recurrence and the gut microbiota in breast cancer survivors.,"Dysfunctional processing of fear memory may be involved in the pathophysiology of fear of cancer recurrence (FCR), which is cited as the major unmet psychological need of cancer survivors. Emerging evidence has shown that the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis affects depressive and anxiety disorders, and chemotherapy-associated psychological distress. We therefore hypothesized that the gut microbiota is associated with FCR in cancer survivors.This cross-sectional study enrolled women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer who were not currently undergoing chemotherapy. Fecal samples were obtained to assess the gut microbiota. FCR grade was assessed using the Concerns About Recurrence Scale (CARS).Mean age of the participants (n = 126) was 58 years; 47% had stage I disease. Multiple regression analysis with adjustment for possible confounders showed that the relative abundance of the Bacteroides genus (beta = 0.180, p = 0.03) was significantly and directly associated with FCR. In the 57 participants with a history of chemotherapy, higher FCR was associated with lower microbial diversity (p = 0.04), lower relative abundance of Firmicutes (p = 0.03) and higher relative abundance of Bacteroidetes (p = 0.04) at the phylum level, and higher relative abundance of Bacteroides (p < 0.01) and lower relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae.g (p = 0.03) and Ruminococcus (p = 0.02) at the genus level.Our findings provide the first evidence of an association between the gut microbiota and FCR and suggest that chemotherapy-induced changes in gut microbiota can influence FCR. Further studies should examine the effects of the gut microbiota on FCR using a prospective design.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2020,Ryo Okubo; Takayuki Kinoshita; Noriko Katsumata; Yasuhito Uezono; Jinzhong Xiao; Yutaka J Matsuoka
31955786,"Neuroactive compounds in foods: Occurrence, mechanism and potential health effects.","Neuroactive compounds are synthesized by certain plants and microorganisms by undertaking different tasks, especially as a stress response. Most common neuroactive compounds in foods are gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), serotonin, melatonin, kynurenine, kynurenic acid, dopamine, norepinephrine, histamine, tryptamine, tyramine and β-phenylethylamine. Fermented foods contain some of these compounds, which can affect human health and mood. Moreover, food processing such as roasting and malting alter amount and profile of neuroactive compounds in foods. In addition to plant-origin and microbially-formed neuroactive compounds in foods, these substances are also formed by gut microbiota, which is the most attractive subject to assess the interaction between gut microbiota and mental health. The discovery of microbiota-gut-brain axis calls for the investigation of the effects of diet on the formation of neuroactive compounds in the gut. Furthermore, probiotics and prebiotics are indispensable elements for the understanding of the food-mood relationship. The focus of this comprehensive review is to investigate the neuroactive compounds found naturally in foods or formed during fermentation. Their formation pathways in humans, plants and microorganisms, potential health effects, effects of diet on the formation of microbial metabolites including neuroactive compounds in the gut are discussed throughout this review. Furthermore, the importance of gut-brain axis, probiotics and prebiotics are discussed.","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2020,Cemile Yılmaz; Vural Gökmen
31628992,"Exercise, diet and stress as modulators of gut microbiota: Implications for neurodegenerative diseases.","The last decade has witnessed an exponentially growing interest in gut microbiota and the gut-brain axis in health and disease. Accumulating evidence from preclinical and clinical research indicate that gut microbiota, and their associated microbiomes, may influence pathogenic processes and thus the onset and progression of various diseases, including neurological and psychiatric disorders. In fact, gut dysbiosis (microbiota dysregulation) has been associated with a range of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's and motor neuron disease, as well as multiple sclerosis. The gut microbiota constitutes a dynamic microbial system constantly challenged by many biological variables, including environmental factors. Since the gut microbiota constitute a changeable and experience-dependent ecosystem, they provide potential therapeutic targets that can be modulated as new interventions for dysbiosis-related disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases. This article reviews the evidence for environmental modulation of gut microbiota and its relevance to brain disorders, exploring in particular the implications for neurodegenerative diseases. We will focus on three major environmental factors that are known to influence the onset and progression of those diseases, namely exercise, diet and stress. Further exploration of environmental modulation, acting via both peripheral (e.g. gut microbiota and associated metabolic dysfunction or 'metabolopathy') and central (e.g. direct effects on CNS neurons and glia) mechanisms, may lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches, such as enviromimetics, for a wide range of neurological and psychiatric disorders.",Neurobiology of disease,2020,Carolina Gubert; Geraldine Kong; Thibault Renoir; Anthony J Hannan
31154909,"Unravelled facets of milk derived opioid peptides: a focus on gut physiology, fractures and obesity.","Beyond being a source of key nutrients, bovine milk influences physiological functions by synthesising bioactive peptides during the process of digestion. Some of the claimed negative health outcomes associated with milk consumption, such as cardiovascular diseases and type 1 diabetes may be attributed to an opioid peptide, beta-casomorphin-7 (BCM-7), derived from A1 beta-casein. BCM-7 exerts its function by binding to the μ-opioid receptors in the body. It is hypothesised that activation of the μ-opioid receptors in the gut can alter gut microbial composition, impair gut barrier integrity and bile acid metabolism, in addition to increasing gastrointestinal transit time and gut inflammation. Further, it is hypothesised that BCM-7 may influence fractures and obesity via μ-opioid receptor pathways. In conclusion, it appears that BCM-7 might have multiple functions pertinent to human health; however, the evidence is limited and warrants further pre-clinical and clinical studies for hypothesis confirmation.",International journal of food sciences and nutrition,2020,Hajara Aslam; Anu Ruusunen; Michael Berk; Amy Loughman; Leni Rivera; Julie A Pasco; Felice N Jacka
31704402,Naturally-diverse airborne environmental microbial exposures modulate the gut microbiome and may provide anxiolytic benefits in mice.,"Growing epidemiological evidence links natural green space exposure with a range of health benefits, including for mental health. Conversely, greater urbanisation associates with increased risk of mental health disorders. Microbiomes are proposed as an important but understudied link that may help explain many green space-human health associations. However, there remains a lack of controlled experimental evidence testing possible beneficial effects from passive exposure to natural biodiversity via airborne microbiota. Previous mouse model studies have used unrealistic environmental microbial exposures-including excessive soil and organic matter contact, feed supplements and injections-to demonstrate host microbiota, immune biomarker, and behavioural changes. Here, in a randomised controlled experiment, we demonstrate that realistic exposures to trace-level dust from a high biodiversity soil can change mouse gut microbiota, in comparison to dust from low biodiversity soil or no soil (control) (n = 54 total mice, comprising 3 treatments × 18 mice, with 9 females + 9 males per group). Furthermore, we found a nominal soil-derived anaerobic spore-forming butyrate-producer, Kineothrix alysoides, was supplemented to a greater extent in the gut microbiomes of high biodiversity treatment mice. Also, increasing relative abundance of this rare organism correlated with reduced anxiety-like behaviour in the most anxious mice. Our results point to an intriguing new hypothesis: that biodiverse soils may represent an important supplementary source of butyrate-producing bacteria capable of resupplying the mammalian gut microbiome, with potential for gut health and mental health benefits. Our findings have potential to inform cost-effective population health interventions through microbiome-conscious green space design and, ultimately, the mainstreaming of biodiversity into health care.",The Science of the total environment,2020,Craig Liddicoat; Harrison Sydnor; Christian Cando-Dumancela; Romy Dresken; Jiajun Liu; Nicholas J C Gellie; Jacob G Mills; Jennifer M Young; Laura S Weyrich; Mark R Hutchinson; Philip Weinstein; Martin F Breed
31821833,The connection between microbiome and schizophrenia.,"There has been an accumulation of knowledge about the human microbiome, some detailed investigations of the gastrointestinal microbiota and its functions, and the highlighting of complex interactions between the gut, the gut microbiota, and the central nervous system. That assumes the involvement of the microbiome in the pathogenesis of various CNS diseases, including schizophrenia. Given this information and the fact, that the gut microbiota is sensitive to internal and environmental influences, we have speculated that among the factors that influence the formation and composition of gut microbiota during life, possible key elements in the schizophrenia development chain are hidden where gut microbiota is a linking component. This article aims to describe and understand the developmental relationships between intestinal microbiota and the risk of developing schizophrenia.",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,2020,Bogdana Golofast; Karel Vales
31726457,Gut Microbiota: A Perspective for Psychiatrists.,"There is mounting evidence that the trillions of microbes that inhabit our gut are a substantial contributing factor to mental health and, equally, to the progression of neuropsychiatric disorders. The extraordinary complexity of the gut ecosystem, and how it interacts with the intestinal epithelium to manifest physiological changes in the brain to influence mood and behaviour, has been the subject of intense scientific scrutiny over the last 2 decades. To further complicate matters, we each harbour a unique microbiota community that is subject to change by a number of factors including diet, exercise, stress, health status, genetics, medication, and age, amongst others. The microbiota-gut-brain axis is a dynamic matrix of tissues and organs including the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota, immune cells, gut tissue, glands, the autonomic nervous system (ANS), and the brain that communicate in a complex multidirectional manner through a number of anatomically and physiologically distinct systems. Long-term perturbations to this homeostatic environment may contribute to the progression of a number of disorders by altering physiological processes including hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation, neurotransmitter systems, immune function, and the inflammatory response. While an appropriate, co-ordinated physiological response, such as an immune or stress response, is necessary for survival, a dysfunctional response can be detrimental to the host, contributing to the development of a number of central nervous system disorders.",Neuropsychobiology,2020,Kieran Rea; Timothy G Dinan; John F Cryan
31722343,The Gut Microbiome in Bipolar Disorder and Pharmacotherapy Management.,"The gut microbiome is a complex and dynamic community of commensal, symbiotic, and pathogenic microorganisms that exist in a bidirectional relationship with the host. Bacterial functions in the gut play a critical role in healthy host functioning, and its disruption can contribute to many medical conditions. The relationship between gut microbiota and the brain has gained attention in mental health due to the mounting evidence supporting the association of gut bacteria with mood and behavior. Patients with bipolar disorder exhibit an increased frequency of gastrointestinal illnesses such as inflammatory bowel disease, which mechanistically has been linked to microbial community function. While the heterogeneity in microbial communities between individuals might be associated with disease risk, it may also moderate the efficacy or adverse effects associated with the use of medication. The following review highlights published evidence linking the function of gut microbiota both to bipolar disorder risk and to the effect of medications that influence microbiota, inflammation, and mood symptoms.",Neuropsychobiology,2020,Stephanie A Flowers; Kristen M Ward; Crystal T Clark
31539679,Antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion is associated with resilience in mice after chronic social defeat stress.,"The brain-gut axis plays a role in the pathogenesis of stress-related disorders such as depression. However, the role of brain-gut axis in the resilience versus susceptibility after stress remains unclear. Here, we examined the effects of antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion on an anhedonia-like phenotype in adult mice subjected to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS).Using CSDS paradigm, we investigated the effects of antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion on the resilience versus susceptibility in mice.Treatment with an antibiotic cocktail for 14 days significantly decreased the diversity and composition of the microbiota in the host gut. Proteobacteria were markedly increased after treatment with the antibiotic cocktail. At the genus and species levels, the antibiotic-treated group exhibited marked alterations in the microbiota compared with a control group. CSDS was shown to significantly improve the abnormal composition of gut microbiota in the antibiotic-treated group. CSDS did not produce an anhedonia-like phenotype in the antibiotic-treated mice, but did induce an anhedonia-like phenotype in control mice, suggesting that gut bacteria are essential for the development of CSDS-induced anhedonia. CSDS treatment did not alter the plasma levels of interleukin-6 or the expression of synaptic proteins, such as PSD-95 and GluA1, in the prefrontal cortex of antibiotic-treated mice.Specific microbiome were not determined.These findings suggest that antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion contributed to resilience to anhedonia in mice subjected to CSDS. Therefore, it is likely that the brain-gut axis plays a role in resilience versus susceptibility to stress.",Journal of affective disorders,2020,Siming Wang; Youge Qu; Lijia Chang; Yaoyu Pu; Kai Zhang; Kenji Hashimoto
31870331,"The chemo-gut study: investigating the long-term effects of chemotherapy on gut microbiota, metabolic, immune, psychological and cognitive parameters in young adult Cancer survivors; study protocol.","The gut microbiota is an important modulator of immune, metabolic, psychological and cognitive mechanisms. Chemotherapy adversely affects the gut microbiota, inducing acute dysbiosis, and alters physiological and psychological function. Cancer among young adults has risen 38% in recent decades. Understanding chemotherapy's long-term effects on gut microbiota and psycho-physiological function is critical to improve survivors' physical and mental health, but remains unexamined. Restoration of the gut microbiota via targeted therapies (e.g. probiotics) could potentially prevent or reverse the psycho-physiological deficits often found in young survivors following chemotherapy, ultimately leading to reduced symptom burden and improved health.This longitudinal study investigates chemotherapy induced long-term gut dysbiosis, and associations between gut microbiota, and immune, metabolic, cognitive and psychological parameters using data collected at < 2 month (T1), 3-4 months (T2), and 5-6 months (T3) post-chemotherapy. Participants will be 18-39 year old blood or solid tumor cancer survivors (n = 50), and a healthy sibling, partner or friend as a control (n = 50). Gut microbiota composition will be measured from fecal samples using 16 s RNA sequencing. Psychological and cognitive patient reported outcome measures will include depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, pain, fatigue, and social and cognitive function. Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) will be used to measure fat and lean mass, and bone mineral concentration. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, C-reactive protein (CRP), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), serotonin, and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) will be measured in serum, and long-term cortisol will be assayed from hair. Regression and linear mixed model (LMM) analyses will examine associations across time points (T1 - T3), between groups, and covariates with gut microbiota, cognitive, psychological, and physiological parameters.Knowing what bacterial species are depleted after chemotherapy, how long these effects last, and the physiological mechanisms that may drive psychological and cognitive issues among survivors will allow for targeted, integrative interventions to be developed, helping to prevent or reverse some of the late-effects of treatment that many young cancer survivors face.

31493127,Probiotics and Psychobiotics: the Role of Microbial Neurochemicals.,"In light of recent data, microorganisms should be construed as organisms that are capable of communication and collective behaviors. Microbial communication signals are involved both in interactions among microbial cells within microbial social systems, including the human body-inhabiting microconsortium, and the dialog between the microbiota and the host organism. The microbiota inhabits various niches of the host organism, especially the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Microorganisms release diverse signal molecules and, in addition, specifically respond to host signals. This enables them to constantly interact with the nervous system including the brain and the immune system of the host organism. Evolutionarily conserved signals that are involved in the communication between microbiota and the host include neuroactive substances (neurochemicals) such as peptides, amino acids, biogenic amines, short-chain fatty acids, and gaseous substances. This ongoing dialog may either stabilize the host's physical and mental health state or, alternatively, cause serious health problems. Attempts are made to correct imbalances in the brain-gut-microbiota axis with probiotics including their subgroup called psychobiotics that release neuroactive substances directly influencing the human brain, psyche, and behavior. A number of recent review works address the microbiota-host system and its communication signals. Some of the publications focus on the involvement of neurochemicals in the bidirectional communication within the host-microbiota system. However, this work concentrates on the impact of bacterial cell components, metabolites, and signal molecules as promising alternatives to the currently widespread probiotics that have both advantages and disadvantages. Such biologically active agents of microbial origin are referred to as postbiotics or, alternatively, metabiotics (the term preferred in this work).",Probiotics and antimicrobial proteins,2019,Alexander V Oleskin; Boris A Shenderov

31568686,"The role of the brain-gut-microbiota axis in psychology: The importance of considering gut microbiota in the development, perpetuation, and treatment of psychological disorders.","The prevalence of psychological disorders remains stable despite steady increases in pharmacological treatments suggesting the need for auxiliary treatment options. Consideration of the brain-gut-microbiota axis (BGMA) has made inroads into reconceptualizing psychological illness from a more holistic perspective. While our understanding of the precise role of gut microbiota (GM) in psychological illness is in its infancy, it represents an attractive target for novel interventions.An extensive review of relevant literature was undertaken.Gut microbiota are proposed to directly and indirectly influence mood, cognition, and behavior which are key components of mental health. This paper outlines how GM may be implicated in psychological disorders from etiology through to treatment and prevention using the Four P model of case formulation.Moving forward, integration of GM into the conceptualization and treatment of psychological illness will require the discipline of psychology to undergo a significant paradigm shift. While the importance of the GM in psychological well-being must be respected, it is not proposed to be a panacea, but instead, an additional arm to a multidisciplinary approach to treatment and prevention.",Brain and behavior,2019,Michael Ganci; Emra Suleyman; Henry Butt; Michelle Ball
31736803,Gut Microbiota in Bipolar Depression and Its Relationship to Brain Function: An Advanced Exploration.,"The mechanism of bipolar disorder is unclear. Growing evidence indicates that gut microbiota plays a pivotal role in mental disorders. This study aimed to find out changes in the gut microbiota in bipolar depression (BD) subjects following treatment with quetiapine and evaluate their correlations with the brain and immune function. Totally 36 subjects with BD and 27 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited. The severity of depression was evaluated with the Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale (MADRS). At baseline, fecal samples were collected and analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). T lymphocyte subsets were measured to examine immune function. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was used to assess brain function. All BD subjects received quetiapine treatment (300 mg/d) for four weeks, following which the fecal microbiota and immune profiles were reexamined. Here, we first put forward the new concept of brain-gut coefficient of balance (B-G<sub>CB</sub>), which referred to the ratio of [oxygenated hemoglobin]/(<i>Bifidobacteria</i> to <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> ratio), to analyze the linkage between the gut microbiota and brain function. At baseline, the CD3<sup>+</sup> T cell proportion was positively correlated with log<sub>10</sub> Enterobacter spp count, whereas the correlativity between the other bacteria and immune profiles were negative. Log<sub>10</sub> B-G<sub>CB</sub> was positively correlated with CD3<sup>+</sup> T cell proportion. In subjects with BD, counts of <i>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</i>, <i>Bacteroides-Prevotella group</i>, <i>Atopobium Cluster</i>, <i>Enterobacter spp</i>, and <i>Clostridium Cluster IV</i> were higher, whereas the log<sub>10</sub> (B/E) were lower than HCs (B/E refers to <i>Bifidobacteria</i> to <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> ratio and represents microbial colonization resistance). After treatment, MADRS scores were reduced, whereas the levels of <i>Eubacterium rectale</i>, <i>Bifidobacteria</i>, and B/E increased. The composition of the gut microbiota and its relationship to brain function were altered in BD subjects. Quetiapine treatment was effective for depression and influenced the composition of gut microbiota in patients. <b>Clinical Trial Registration:</b> http://www.chictr.org.cn/index.aspx, identifier ChiCTR-COC-17011401, URL: http://www.chictr.org.cn/listbycreater.aspx.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2019,Qiaoqiao Lu; Jianbo Lai; Haifeng Lu; Chee Ng; Tingting Huang; Hua Zhang; Kaijing Ding; Zheng Wang; Jiajun Jiang; Jianbo Hu; Jing Lu; Shaojia Lu; Tingting Mou; Dandan Wang; Yanli Du; Caixi Xi; Hailong Lyu; Jingkai Chen; Yi Xu; Zhuhua Liu; Shaohua Hu
31709198,"Characteristics of Gut Microbiota in Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis in Shanghai, China.","Little is known regarding differences in the gut microbiomes of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and healthy cohorts in China. This study aimed to identify differences in the fecal microbiomes of 66 Chinese patients with RA and 60 healthy Chinese controls. The V3-V4 variable regions of bacterial 16S rRNA genes were sequenced with the Illumina system to define the bacterial composition. The alpha-diversity index of the microbiome of the RA patients was significantly lower than that of the control group. The bacterial genera <i>Bacteroides</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.02202) and <i>Escherichia-Shigella</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.03137) were more abundant in RA patients. In contrast, <i>Lactobacillus</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.000014)<i>, Alloprevotella</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.0000008615)<i>, Enterobacter</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.000005759), and <i>Odoribacter</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.0000166) were less abundant in the RA group than in the control group. Spearman correlation analysis of blood physiological measures of RA showed that bacterial genera such as <i>Dorea</i> and <i>Ruminococcus</i> were positively correlated with RF-IgA and anti-CCP antibodies. Furthermore, <i>Alloprevotella</i> and <i>Parabacteroides</i> were positively correlated with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and <i>Prevotella</i>-2 and <i>Alloprevotella</i> were positively correlated with C-reactive protein, both biomarkers of inflammation.

Associations between Diet, Faecal Microbiota, and Short-Chain Fatty Acids in Morbidly Obese Subjects.","Obesity has been associated with changes in the gut microbiota and its metabolites. The study explored changes in the faecal microbiota and short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) associated with the diet (including nonnutritive sweeteners (NNSs)) and evaluated metabolic consequences in subjects with morbid obesity. The diet was assessed with a validated food frequency questionnaire. One unit of NNSs was 100 mL beverage with NNSs or 2 tablets/teaspoons of NNSs. The faecal microbiota was assessed with GA-map® dysbiosis test and SCFA with gas chromatography and flame ionisation detection. Fourteen men and 75 women with a mean age of 44.6 (SD 8.7) years, BMI 41.8 (SD 3.6) kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and intake of NNSs 7.5 units/day (SD 3.2; range 0-43) were included. Faecal butyric acid was positively and negatively associated with the intake of starch (partial correlation = 0.264; <i>p</i>=0.015) and NNSs (partial correlation = -0.274; <i>p</i>=0.011), respectively. NNSs were associated with changes in four out of 39 bacterial groups. Butyric acid has antiobesogenic effects, reduces insulin resistance, and improves dyslipidaemia. Since the weight-reducing effect of NNSs on obese adults trying to lose weight is dubious, it seems imprudent to use NNSs that might counteract the favourable effects of butyric acid.",Journal of obesity,2019,Per G Farup; Stian Lydersen; Jørgen Valeur
31488882,Sodium oligomannate therapeutically remodels gut microbiota and suppresses gut bacterial amino acids-shaped neuroinflammation to inhibit Alzheimer's disease progression.,"Recently, increasing evidence has suggested the association between gut dysbiosis and Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression, yet the role of gut microbiota in AD pathogenesis remains obscure. Herein, we provide a potential mechanistic link between gut microbiota dysbiosis and neuroinflammation in AD progression. Using AD mouse models, we discovered that, during AD progression, the alteration of gut microbiota composition leads to the peripheral accumulation of phenylalanine and isoleucine, which stimulates the differentiation and proliferation of pro-inflammatory T helper 1 (Th1) cells. The brain-infiltrated peripheral Th1 immune cells are associated with the M1 microglia activation, contributing to AD-associated neuroinflammation. Importantly, the elevation of phenylalanine and isoleucine concentrations and the increase of Th1 cell frequency in the blood were also observed in two small independent cohorts of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD. Furthermore, GV-971, a sodium oligomannate that has demonstrated solid and consistent cognition improvement in a phase 3 clinical trial in China, suppresses gut dysbiosis and the associated phenylalanine/isoleucine accumulation, harnesses neuroinflammation and reverses the cognition impairment. Together, our findings highlight the role of gut dysbiosis-promoted neuroinflammation in AD progression and suggest a novel strategy for AD therapy by remodelling the gut microbiota.",Cell research,2019,Xinyi Wang; Guangqiang Sun; Teng Feng; Jing Zhang; Xun Huang; Tao Wang; Zuoquan Xie; Xingkun Chu; Jun Yang; Huan Wang; Shuaishuai Chang; Yanxue Gong; Lingfei Ruan; Guanqun Zhang; Siyuan Yan; Wen Lian; Chen Du; Dabing Yang; Qingli Zhang; Feifei Lin; Jia Liu; Haiyan Zhang; Changrong Ge; Shifu Xiao; Jian Ding; Meiyu Geng

This has led to the strategy of targeting the gut microbiota to ameliorate disorders of the central nervous system. Understanding the underlying signalling pathways in which the microbiota impacts these disorders is crucial for the development of future therapeutics for improving CNS functionality. One of the major pathways through which the microbiota influences the brain is the immune system, where there is an increasing appreciation for the role of monocyte trafficking in regulating brain homeostasis. In this review, we will shed light on the role of monocyte trafficking as a relay of microbiota signals in conditions where the central nervous system is in disorder, such as stress, peripheral inflammation, ageing, traumatic brain injury, stroke, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. We also cover how the gastrointestinal microbiota is implicated in these mental illnesses. In addition, we aim to discuss how the monocyte system can be modulated by the gut microbiota to mitigate disorders of the central nervous system, which will lead to novel microbiota-targeted strategies.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2019,Marcel van de Wouw; Marcus Boehme; Timothy G Dinan; John F Cryan
31260640,Microbiota-gut brain axis involvement in neuropsychiatric disorders.,"<b>Introduction</b>: The microbiota-gut brain (MGB) axis is the bidirectional communication between the intestinal microbiota and the brain. An increasing body of preclinical and clinical evidence has revealed that the gut microbial ecosystem can affect neuropsychiatric health. However, there is still a need of further studies to elucidate the complex gene-environment interactions and the role of the MGB axis in neuropsychiatric diseases, with the aim of identifying biomarkers and new therapeutic targets, to allow early diagnosis and improving treatments. <b>Areas covered</b>: To review the role of MGB axis in neuropsychiatric disorders, prediction and prevention of disease through exploitation, integration, and combination of data from existing gut microbiome/microbiota projects and appropriate other International '-Omics' studies. The authors also evaluated the new technological advances to investigate and modulate, through nutritional and other interventions, the gut microbiota. <b>Expert opinion</b>: The clinical studies have documented an association between alterations in gut microbiota composition and/or function, whereas the preclinical studies support a role for the gut microbiota in impacting behaviors which are of relevance to psychiatry and other central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Targeting MGB axis could be an additional approach for treating CNS disorders and all conditions in which alterations of the gut microbiota are involved.",Expert review of neurotherapeutics,2019,Luigi Francesco Iannone; Alberto Preda; Hervé M Blottière; Gerard Clarke; Diego Albani; Vincenzo Belcastro; Marco Carotenuto; Annamaria Cattaneo; Rita Citraro; Cinzia Ferraris; Francesca Ronchi; Gaia Luongo; Elisa Santocchi; Letizia Guiducci; Pietro Baldelli; Paola Iannetti; Sigrid Pedersen; Andrea Petretto; Stefania Provasi; Kaja Selmer; Alberto Spalice; Anna Tagliabue; Alberto Verrotti; Nicola Segata; Jakob Zimmermann; Carlo Minetti; Paolo Mainardi; Carmen Giordano; Sanjay Sisodiya; Federico Zara; Emilio Russo; Pasquale Striano
31215725,"Rapid-acting antidepressant ketamine, its metabolites and other candidates: A historical overview and future perspective.","Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most disabling psychiatric disorders. Approximately one-third of the patients with MDD are treatment resistant to the current antidepressants. There is also a significant therapeutic time lag of weeks to months. Furthermore, depression in patients with bipolar disorder (BD) is typically poorly responsive to antidepressants. Therefore, there exists an unmet medical need for rapidly acting antidepressants with beneficial effects in treatment-resistant patients with MDD or BD. Accumulating evidence suggests that the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist ketamine produces rapid and sustained antidepressant effects in treatment-resistant patients with MDD or BD. Ketamine is a racemic mixture comprising equal parts of (R)-ketamine (or arketamine) and (S)-ketamine (or esketamine). Because (S)-ketamine has higher affinity for NMDAR than (R)-ketamine, esketamine was developed as an antidepressant. On 5 March 2019, esketamine nasal spray was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. However, preclinical data suggest that (R)-ketamine exerts greater potency and longer-lasting antidepressant effects than (S)-ketamine in animal models of depression and that (R)-ketamine has less detrimental side-effects than (R,S)-ketamine or (S)-ketamine. In this article, the author reviews the historical overview of the antidepressant actions of enantiomers of ketamine and its major metabolites norketamine and hydroxynorketamine. Furthermore, the author discusses the other potential rapid-acting antidepressant candidates (i.e., NMDAR antagonists and modulators, low-voltage-sensitive T-type calcium channel inhibitor, potassium channel Kir4.1 inhibitor, negative modulators of γ-aminobutyric acid, and type A [GABA<sub>A</sub> ] receptors) to compare them with ketamine. Moreover, the molecular and cellular mechanisms of ketamine's antidepressant effects are discussed.",Psychiatry and clinical neurosciences,2019,Kenji Hashimoto
31646148,Gut microbial metabolites in depression: understanding the biochemical mechanisms.,"Gastrointestinal and central function are intrinsically connected by the gut microbiota, an ecosystem that has co-evolved with the host to expand its biotransformational capabilities and interact with host physiological processes by means of its metabolic products. Abnormalities in this microbiota-gut-brain axis have emerged as a key component in the pathophysiology of depression, leading to more research attempting to understand the neuroactive potential of the products of gut microbial metabolism. This review explores the potential for the gut microbiota to contribute to depression and focuses on the role that microbially-derived molecules - neurotransmitters, short-chain fatty acids, indoles, bile acids, choline metabolites, lactate and vitamins - play in the context of emotional behavior. The future of gut-brain axis research lies is moving away from association, towards the mechanisms underlying the relationship between the gut bacteria and depressive behavior. We propose that direct and indirect mechanisms exist through which gut microbial metabolites affect depressive behavior: these include (i) direct stimulation of central receptors, (ii) peripheral stimulation of neural, endocrine, and immune mediators, and (iii) epigenetic regulation of histone acetylation and DNA methylation. Elucidating these mechanisms is essential to expand our understanding of the etiology of depression, and to develop new strategies to harness the beneficial psychotropic effects of these molecules. Overall, the review highlights the potential for dietary interventions to represent such novel therapeutic strategies for major depressive disorder.","Microbial cell (Graz, Austria)",2019,Giorgia Caspani; Sidney Kennedy; Jane A Foster; Jonathan Swann
31530799,Abnormal composition of gut microbiota is associated with resilience versus susceptibility to inescapable electric stress.,"Increasing evidence indicates that abnormalities in the composition of gut microbiota might play a role in stress-related disorders. In the learned helplessness (LH) paradigm, ~60-70% rats are susceptible to LH in the face of inescapable electric stress. The role of gut microbiota in susceptibility in the LH paradigm is unknown. In this study, male rats were exposed to inescapable electric stress under the LH paradigm. The compositions of gut microbiota and short-chain fatty acids were assessed in fecal samples from control rats, non-LH (resilient) rats, and LH (susceptible) rats. Members of the order Lactobacillales were present at significantly higher levels in the susceptible rats than in control and resilient rats. At the family level, the number of Lactobacillaceae in the susceptible rats was significantly higher than in control and resilient rats. At the genus level, the numbers of Lactobacillus, Clostridium cluster III, and Anaerofustis in susceptible rats were significantly higher than in control and resilient rats. Levels of acetic acid and propionic acid in the feces of susceptible rats were lower than in those of control and resilient rats; however, the levels of lactic acid in the susceptible rats were higher than those of control and resilient rats. There was a positive correlation between lactic acid and Lactobacillus levels among these three groups. These findings suggest that abnormal composition of the gut microbiota, including organisms such as Lactobacillus, contributes to susceptibility versus resilience to LH in rats subjected to inescapable electric foot shock. Therefore, it appears likely that brain-gut axis plays a role in stress susceptibility in the LH paradigm.",Translational psychiatry,2019,Kai Zhang; Yuko Fujita; Lijia Chang; Youge Qu; Yaoyu Pu; Siming Wang; Yukihiko Shirayama; Kenji Hashimoto

This study was undertaken to investigate whether antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion affects dopaminergic neurotoxicity in the mouse brain after administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). MPTP significantly decreased dopamine transporter (DAT) immunoreactivity in the striatum and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity in the substantia nigra of water-treated mice. However, MPTP did not decrease DAT or TH immunoreactivity in the brains of mice treated with an antibiotic cocktail. Furthermore, antibiotic treatment significantly decreased the diversity and altered the composition of the host gut microbiota at the genus and species levels. Interestingly, MPTP also altered microbiome composition in antibiotic-treated mice. These findings suggest that antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion might protect against MPTP-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity in the brain via the brain-gut axis.",Aging,2019,Yaoyu Pu; Lijia Chang; Youge Qu; Siming Wang; Kai Zhang; Kenji Hashimoto

31356838,Diet and Alzheimer's dementia - Nutritional approach to modulate inflammation.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease causing dementia in the elderly population. Due to the fact that there is still no cure for Alzheimer's dementia and available treatment strategies bring only symptomatic benefits, there is a pressing demand for other effective strategies such as diet. Since the inflammation hypothesis gained considerable significance in the AD pathogenesis, elucidating the modulatory role of dietary factors on inflammation may help to prevent, delay the onset and slow the progression of AD. Current evidence clearly shows that synergistic action of combined supplementation and complex dietary patterns provides stronger benefits than any single component considered separately. Recent studies reveal the growing importance of novel factors such as dietary advanced glycation end products (d-AGE), gut microbiota, butyrate and vitamin D<sub>3</sub> on inflammatory processes in AD.This paper summarizes the available evidence of pro- and anti-inflammatory activity of some dietary components including fatty acids, vitamins, flavonoids, polyphenols, probiotics and d-AGE, and their potential for AD prevention and treatment.","Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior",2019,Katarzyna Szczechowiak; Breno S Diniz; Jerzy Leszek
31124390,Fecal microbiota transplantation from chronic unpredictable mild stress mice donors affects anxiety-like and depression-like behavior in recipient mice via the gut microbiota-inflammation-brain axis.,"Recent studies have demonstrated that there are significant changes in the gut microbiota (GM) of humans with depression and animal models of depression and chronic stress. In our present study, we determined whether an alteration in GM is a decisive factor in anxiety-like and depression-like behavior and its impact on brain neurochemistry. An antibiotic cocktail was used to deplete the GM of mice before they were colonized, via fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), by the GM of control mice or mice that had been exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS donors). The CUMS-donor group of mice and the mice that were colonized by their microbiota (the CUMS-recipient group) both showed higher levels of anxiety- and depression-like behavior compared to the controls. The GM community of the CUMS-donor and CUMS-recipient was distinctively different from the controls, with the CUMS group characterized by a lower relative abundance of <i>Lactobacillus</i> and a higher relative abundance of <i>Akkermansia</i>. Interestingly, FMT affected both behavior and neuroinflammation. Mice given the CUMS microbiota had significant elevations of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in the hippocampus, which were accompanied by upregulated indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) in the hippocampus. These results suggest that GM modulates pro-inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus through dysfunctional microbiota-gut-brain axis, exacerbating anxiety- and depression-like phenotypes. Key Points Chronic unpredictable mild stress increased anxiety- and depression-like behavior in mice. Mice colonized with gut microbiota (GM) from stressed mice showed similar behaviors. The GM composition of the donor and recipient mice was also comparable. Their relative pattern of two bacteria has been tied to neuroinflammatory activity. The results suggest a link between GM, brain function, and anxiety and depression.","Stress (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2019,Nannan Li; Qi Wang; Yan Wang; Anji Sun; Yiwei Lin; Ye Jin; Xiaobai Li

Sixty Japanese medical students (41 men and 19 women) preparing for the national examination for medical practitioners ingested CP2305-containing or placebo tablets once daily for 24 weeks. Intake of the CP2305 tablet significantly reduced anxiety and sleep disturbance relative to placebo, as quantitated by the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Single-channel sleep electroencephalograms show that CP2305 significantly shortened sleep latency and wake time after sleep onset and increased the delta power ratio in the first sleep cycle. CP2305 also significantly lowered salivary chromogranin A levels compared with placebo. Furthermore, 16S rRNA gene sequencing of participant feces demonstrated that CP2305 administration attenuated the stress-induced decline of <i>Bifidobacterium</i> spp. and the stress-induced elevation of <i>Streptococcus</i> spp. We conclude that the long-term use of CP2305-containing tablets may improve the mental state, sleep quality, and gut microbiota of healthy adults under stressful conditions.",Nutrients,2019,Kensei Nishida; Daisuke Sawada; Yuki Kuwano; Hiroki Tanaka; Kazuhito Rokutan
31377712,Biopsychosocial model of resilience in young adults with multiple sclerosis (BPS-ARMS): an observational study protocol exploring psychological reactions early after diagnosis.,"Multiple sclerosis (MS), the most common neurological disease causing disability in young adults, is widely recognised as a major stress factor. Studies have shown that the first years after the diagnosis are distressing in terms of adjustment to the disease and that MS negatively affects patients' psychological well-being, quality of life (QoL) and social functioning. However, the links between disease-specific variables at diagnosis, resilience and psychological adjustment of patients with MS remain largely unexplored, especially in adolescents and young adults. This observational study aims to fill the gap of knowledge on <u>b</u>io<u>p</u>sycho<u>s</u>ocial characteristics and <u>r</u>esilience of young <u>a</u>dults with MS to evaluate the relationship among these variables and to develop a biopsychosocial model of resilience.Biological and clinical characteristics of young adults newly diagnosed with MS will be investigated by collecting clinical information, performing neurological examinations, MRI and analysing cerebrospinal fluid and blood biomarkers (eg, measures of inflammation), body composition, gut microbiota and movement/perceptual markers. Psychosocial characteristics (eg, psychological distress, coping strategies), QoL, psychological well-being and resilience will be assessed by self-report questionnaires. Comparative statistics (ie, analysis of variance or unpaired samples t-test, correlation and regression analyses) will be applied to evaluate the relationship among biological, psychological and social factors. The results are expected to allow a comprehensive understanding of the determinants of resilience in young patients with MS and to inform resilience interventions, tailored to young patients' specific needs, aiming to reduce the risk of maladaptive reactions to the disease and to improve psychological well-being and QoL.The study has been approved by the Verona University Hospital Ethics Committee (approval number: 2029CESC).

31132457,Gut microbiota composition is associated with temperament traits in infants.,"One of the key behavioral phenotypes in infancy are different temperament traits, and certain early life temperament traits have been shown to precede later mental health problems. Differences in the gut microbiota composition (GMC) have been suggested to link with neurodevelopment. For example, toddler temperament traits have been found to associate with differences in GMC; however, studies in infants are lacking although infancy is a rapid period of neurodevelopment as well as GM development. Thus, we aimed to investigate association between infant GMC and temperament.The study population (n = 301, 53% boys) was drawn from the FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study. Stool samples were collected from the 2.5-month-old infants and sequenced with 16S Illumina MiSeq platform. GMC taxonomic composition (at Genus and OTU level), observed sample clusters, diversity and richness were investigated in relation to the maternal reports of Infant Behavior Questionnaire -Revised (IBQ-R) at the age of 6 months.Three sample clusters (Bifidobacterium/Enterobacteriaceae, Bacteroides, V. Dispar) based on GMC were identified, of which Bifidobacterium/Enterobacteriaceae-cluster presented with higher scores on the IBQ-R main dimension regulation and its subscale duration of orienting compared to Bacteroides-cluster. The clusters associated with temperament in a sex-dependent manner. The IBQ-R main dimension surgency (positive emotionality) was associated positively both with genus Bifidobacterium and Streptococcus. Alpha diversity had a negative association with negative emotionality and fear reactivity.This is the first study demonstrating associations, but not causal connections, between GMC and temperament in young infants in a prospective design.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2019,Anna-Katariina Aatsinki; Leo Lahti; Henna-Maria Uusitupa; Eveliina Munukka; Anniina Keskitalo; Saara Nolvi; Siobhain O'Mahony; Sami Pietilä; Laura L Elo; Erkki Eerola; Hasse Karlsson; Linnea Karlsson
31341063,The gut microbiota influences skeletal muscle mass and function in mice.,"The functional interactions between the gut microbiota and the host are important for host physiology, homeostasis, and sustained health. We compared the skeletal muscle of germ-free mice that lacked a gut microbiota to the skeletal muscle of pathogen-free mice that had a gut microbiota. Compared to pathogen-free mouse skeletal muscle, germ-free mouse skeletal muscle showed atrophy, decreased expression of insulin-like growth factor 1, and reduced transcription of genes associated with skeletal muscle growth and mitochondrial function. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry analysis of skeletal muscle, liver, and serum from germ-free mice revealed multiple changes in the amounts of amino acids, including glycine and alanine, compared to pathogen-free mice. Germ-free mice also showed reduced serum choline, the precursor of acetylcholine, the key neurotransmitter that signals between muscle and nerve at neuromuscular junctions. Reduced expression of genes encoding Rapsyn and Lrp4, two proteins important for neuromuscular junction assembly and function, was also observed in skeletal muscle from germ-free mice compared to pathogen-free mice. Transplanting the gut microbiota from pathogen-free mice into germ-free mice resulted in an increase in skeletal muscle mass, a reduction in muscle atrophy markers, improved oxidative metabolic capacity of the muscle, and elevated expression of the neuromuscular junction assembly genes <i>Rapsyn</i> and <i>Lrp4</i> Treating germ-free mice with short-chain fatty acids (microbial metabolites) partly reversed skeletal muscle impairments.

Phylum <i>Bacteroidetes</i> and <i>Firmicutes</i> are the predominant bacterial communities in BD patients and HCs, respectively. Lower levels of butyrate-producing bacteria are observed in untreated patients. Microbial composition changes following quetiapine treatment in BD patients. Notably, 30 microbial markers are identified on a random forest model and achieve an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.81 between untreated patients and HCs. Ten microbial markers are identified with the AUC of 0.93 between responder and nonresponder patients. This study characterizes the gut microbiota in BD and is the first to evaluate microbial changes following quetiapine monotherapy.

The 6 biweekly lifestyle sessions will involve education on the promotion of a whole foods GFD, sleep hygiene, psychosocial coping skills (eg, self-compassion), and self-regulatory skills to master changes in behaviors. Assessments will occur at pre and post 12-week intervention and 3-month follow-up. WLC participants will be offered a 12-week HIIT program + online lifestyle education sessions after completing the final assessment. The primary outcomes are QoL and gut microbiota composition assessed with 16S rRNA sequencing. The secondary outcomes are markers of metabolic syndrome (waist circumference, fasting glucose, serum lipids, blood pressure, and body composition), gastrointestinal symptoms, sleep quality, adherence to a GFD, exercise behavior, self-regulatory efficacy, and self-compassion. It is hypothesized that participants in the HIIT+ will experience improvements in all outcomes when compared to those in the WLC. These improvements are expected to be maintained at the 3-month follow-up.The findings from this study will advance the knowledge regarding the effects of HIIT and lifestyle education on key outcomes for an at-risk chronic disease population. Furthermore, the findings can be used to inform future programs to improve fitness and physical and mental health outcomes for people with celiac disease.",Global advances in health and medicine,2019,A Justine Dowd; Liam Kronlund; Candice Parmar; Julia T Daun; Kathryn Wytsma-Fisher; Raylene A Reimer; Guillaume Y Millet; S Nicole Culos-Reed
30991255,The gut-brain relationship: Investigating the effect of multispecies probiotics on anxiety in a randomized placebo-controlled trial of healthy young adults.,"There has been an increased interest in understanding the therapeutic effect of gut-microbiota on health, particularly in mental health. However, limited research into the connection between gut-microbiota and mental health makes this study an important endeavor in exploring the effect of gut-microbiota, through probiotics intervention, on mental health like anxiety and factors related to anxiety (e.g., anxiety control, affect, negative mood regulation, and worry).Healthy college students (N = 86; 75.6% female), average age of 20.59, participated in a double-blind, placebo-control, and randomization-control study. Eligible participants completed a baseline survey before being assigned to a condition, which consisted of four probiotics conditions and one placebo condition. After 28 days of daily intake, the participants returned to complete their exit survey.Probiotics were observed to improve panic anxiety, neurophysiological anxiety, negative affect, worry, and increase negative mood regulation. Furthermore, post hoc analyses revealed that the CFU (colony-forming unit) level was more effective than species counts in accounting for the number of significant improvements. A ceiling effect was detected in the study, participants with high distress reported higher number of improvements than those with normative distress.Overall, this study is the first to examine the effect of CFU and species count on probiotics' efficacy. The study's finding suggested that probiotics may have the therapeutic potential to treat anxiety, however, further research is necessary to make that determination.",Journal of affective disorders,2019,Nhan Tran; Masha Zhebrak; Christine Yacoub; Joseph Pelletier; Darby Hawley
30680947,Abnormal composition of gut microbiota contributes to delirium-like behaviors after abdominal surgery in mice.,"Anesthesia and surgery can cause delirium-like symptoms postoperatively. Increasing evidence suggests that gut microbiota is a physiological regulator of the brain. Herein, we investigated whether gut microbiota plays a role in postoperative delirium (POD).Mice were separated into non-POD and POD phenotypes after abdominal surgery by applying hierarchical clustering analysis to behavioral tests. Fecal samples were collected, and 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing was performed to detect differences in gut microbiota composition among sham, non-POD, and POD mice. Fecal bacteria from non-POD and POD mice were transplanted into antibiotics-induced pseudo-germ-free mice to investigate the effects on behaviors.α-diversity and β-diversity indicated differences in gut microbiota composition between the non-POD and POD mice. At the phylum level, the non-POD mice had significantly higher levels of Tenericutes, which were not detected in the POD mice. At the class level, levels of Gammaproteobacteria were higher in the POD mice, whereas the non-POD mice had significantly higher levels of Mollicutes, which were not detected in the POD mice. A total of 20 gut bacteria differed significantly between the POD and non-POD mice. Interestingly, the pseudo-germ-free mice showed abnormal behaviors prior to transplant. The pseudo-germ-free mice that received fecal bacteria transplants from non-POD mice but not from POD mice showed improvements in behaviors.Abnormal gut microbiota composition after abdominal surgery may contribute to the development of POD. A therapeutic strategy that targets gut microbiota could provide a novel alterative for POD treatment.",CNS neuroscience & therapeutics,2019,Jie Zhang; Jiang-Jiang Bi; Guo-Jun Guo; Ling Yang; Bin Zhu; Gao-Feng Zhan; Shan Li; Nian-Nian Huang; Kenji Hashimoto; Chun Yang; Ai-Lin Luo
31179435,Effects of regulating intestinal microbiota on anxiety symptoms: A systematic review.,"Anxiety symptoms are common in mental diseases and a variety of physical disorders, especially in disorders related to stress. More and more basic studies have indicated that gut microbiota can regulate brain function through the gut-brain axis, and dysbiosis of intestinal microbiota was related to anxiety. However, there is no specific evidence to support treatment of anxiety by regulating intestinal microbiota.To find evidence supporting improvement of anxiety symptoms by regulation of intestinal microbiota.This systematic review of randomised controlled trials was searched based on the following databases: PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, OVID, Web of Knowledge, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data, VIP databases and SinoMed. The retrieval time dated back to 25 July 2018. Then we screened research literatures based on established inclusion and exclusion criteria. Quality evaluation for each included study was done using the Cochrane risk of bias and the Jadad scale.A total of 3334 articles were retrieved and 21 studies were included which contained 1503 subjects. In the 21 studies, 15 chose probiotics as interventions to regulate intestinal microbiota and six chose non-probiotic ways such as adjusting daily diets. Probiotic supplements in seven studies contained only one kind of probiotic, two studies used a product that contained two kinds of probiotics and the supplements used in the other five studies included at least three kinds of probiotics. In the studies that used treatment as usual plus interventions regulating intestinal flora (IRIF) as interventions (five studies), only non-probiotic ways were effective (two studies), which means 40% of studies were effective; in the studies that used IRIF alone (16 studies, 11 studies used probiotic ways and 5 studies used non-probiotic ways), 56% of studies could improve anxiety symptoms, and 80% of studies that conducted the non-probiotic interventions were effective, while 45% of studies that used probiotic supplementations had positive effects on anxiety symptoms. Overall, 11 studies showed a positive effect on anxiety symptoms by regulating intestinal microbiota, which indicated 52% of the 21 studies were effective, and there were five studies that used probiotic supplements as interventions and six used non-probiotic interventions. In addition, it should be noted that six of seven studies showed that regulation of intestinal microbiota could treat anxiety symptoms, the rate of efficacy was 86%.We find that more than half of the studies included showed it was positive to treat anxiety symptoms by regulation of intestinal microbiota. There are two kinds of interventions (probiotic and non-probiotic interventions) to regulate intestinal microbiota, and it should be highlighted that the non-probiotic interventions were more effective than the probiotic interventions. More studies are needed to clarify this conclusion since we still cannot run meta-analysis so far.",General psychiatry,2019,Beibei Yang; Jinbao Wei; Peijun Ju; Jinghong Chen
31083360,A Systematic Review of the Role of Prebiotics and Probiotics in Autism Spectrum Disorders.,"<i>Background</i>: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex developmental condition typically characterized by deficits in social and communicative behaviors as well as repetitive patterns of behaviors. Despite its prevalence (affecting 0.1% to 1.8% of the global population), the pathogenesis of ASD remains incompletely understood. Patients with ASD are reported to have more frequent gastrointestinal (GI) complaints. There is some anecdotal evidence that probiotics are able to alleviate GI symptoms as well as improve behavioral issues in children with ASD. However, systematic reviews of the effect of prebiotics/probiotics on ASD and its associated symptoms are lacking. <i>Methods</i>: Using the keywords (prebiotics OR probiotics OR microbiota OR gut) AND (autism OR social OR ASD), a systematic literature search was conducted on PubMed, EMBASE, Medline, Clinicaltrials.gov and Google Scholar databases. The inclusion criteria were original clinical trials, published in English between the period 1st January 1988 and 1st February 2019. <i>Results</i>: A total of eight clinical trials were systematically reviewed. Two clinical trials examined the use of prebiotic and/or diet exclusion while six involved the use of probiotic supplementation in children with ASD. Most of these were prospective, open-label studies. Prebiotics only improved certain GI symptoms; however, when combined with an exclusion diet (gluten and casein free) showed a significant reduction in anti-sociability scores. As for probiotics, there is limited evidence to support the role of probiotics in alleviating the GI or behavioral symptoms in children with ASD. The two available double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials found no significant difference in GI symptoms and behavior. <i>Conclusion</i>: Despite promising preclinical findings, prebiotics and probiotics have demonstrated an overall limited efficacy in the management of GI or behavioral symptoms in children with ASD. In addition, there was no standardized probiotics regimen, with multiple different strains and concentrations of probiotics, and variable duration of treatments.","Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2019,Qin Xiang Ng; Wayren Loke; Nandini Venkatanarayanan; Donovan Yutong Lim; Alex Yu Sen Soh; Wee Song Yeo
31053995,Gender specific decrease of a set of circulating N-acylphosphatidyl ethanolamines (NAPEs) in the plasma of Parkinson's disease patients.,"Current markers of Parkinson's disease (PD) fail to detect the early progression of disease state. Conversely, current omics techniques allow the investigation of hundreds of molecules potentially altered by disease conditions. Based on evidence previously collected by our group in a mouse model of PD, we speculated that a particular set of circulating lipids might be significantly altered by the pathology.The aim of current study was to evaluate the potential of a particular set of N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamines (NAPEs) as potential non-invasive plasma markers of ongoing neurodegeneration from Parkinson's disease in human subjects.A panel of seven NAPEs were quantified by LC-MS/MS in the plasma of 587 individuals (healthy controls, n = 319; Parkinson's disease, n = 268); Random Forest classification and statistical modeling was applied to compare Parkinson's disease versus controls. All p-values obtained in different tests were corrected for multiplicity by controlling the false discovery rate (FDR).The results indicate that this panel of NAPEs is able to distinguish female PD patients from the corresponding healthy controls. Further to this, the observed downregulation of these NAPEs is in line with the results in plasma of a mouse model of Parkinson's (6-OHDA).In the current study we have shown the downregulation of NAPEs in plasma of PD patients and we thus speculate that these lipids might serve as candidate biomarkers for PD. We also suggest a molecular mechanism, explaining our findings, which involves gut microbiota.",Metabolomics : Official journal of the Metabolomic Society,2019,Zeeshan Hamid; Abdul Basit; Silvia Pontis; Fabrizio Piras; Francesca Assogna; Paola Bossù; Francesco Ernesto Pontieri; Alessandro Stefani; Gianfranco Spalletta; Pietro Franceschi; Angelo Reggiani; Andrea Armirotti
30900006,Microbe and host interaction in gastrointestinal homeostasis.,"Researchers in psychiatry and neuroscience are increasingly recognizing the importance of gut-brain communication in mental health. Both genetics and environmental factors influence gut microbiota composition and function. This study examines host-microbe signaling at the gastrointestinal barrier to identify bottom-up mechanisms of microbiota-brain communication.We examined differences in gut microbiota composition and fecal miRNA profiles in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice, in relation to gastrointestinal homeostasis and evaluated the response to perturbation of the gut microbiota by broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment.Differences in the gut microbiota composition between BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice, evaluated by fecal 16S rRNA gene sequencing, included significant differences in genera Prevotella, Alistipes, Akkermansia, and Ruminococcus. Significant differences in fecal miRNA profiles were determined using the nCounter NanoString platform. A BLASTn analysis identified conserved fecal miRNA target regions in bacterial metagenomes with 14 significant correlations found between fecal miRNA and predicted taxa relative abundance in our dataset. Treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics for 2 weeks resulted in a host-specific physiological response at the gastrointestinal barrier including a decrease in barrier permeability in BALB/c mice and alterations in the expression of barrier regulating genes in both strains. Genera Parabacteroides and Bacteroides were associated with changes in barrier function.The results of this study provide insight into how specific taxa influence gut barrier integrity and function. More generally, these data in the context of recent published studies makes a significant contribution to our understanding of host-microbe interactions providing new knowledge that can be harnessed by us and others in future mechanistic studies.",Psychopharmacology,2019,Rachael Horne; James St Pierre; Sufian Odeh; Michael Surette; Jane A Foster
30718848,The neuroactive potential of the human gut microbiota in quality of life and depression.,"The relationship between gut microbial metabolism and mental health is one of the most intriguing and controversial topics in microbiome research. Bidirectional microbiota-gut-brain communication has mostly been explored in animal models, with human research lagging behind. Large-scale metagenomics studies could facilitate the translational process, but their interpretation is hampered by a lack of dedicated reference databases and tools to study the microbial neuroactive potential. Surveying a large microbiome population cohort (Flemish Gut Flora Project, n = 1,054) with validation in independent data sets (n<sub>total</sub> = 1,070), we studied how microbiome features correlate with host quality of life and depression. Butyrate-producing Faecalibacterium and Coprococcus bacteria were consistently associated with higher quality of life indicators. Together with Dialister, Coprococcus spp. were also depleted in depression, even after correcting for the confounding effects of antidepressants. Using a module-based analytical framework, we assembled a catalogue of neuroactive potential of sequenced gut prokaryotes. Gut-brain module analysis of faecal metagenomes identified the microbial synthesis potential of the dopamine metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid as correlating positively with mental quality of life and indicated a potential role of microbial γ-aminobutyric acid production in depression. Our results provide population-scale evidence for microbiome links to mental health, while emphasizing confounder importance.",Nature microbiology,2019,Mireia Valles-Colomer; Gwen Falony; Youssef Darzi; Ettje F Tigchelaar; Jun Wang; Raul Y Tito; Carmen Schiweck; Alexander Kurilshikov; Marie Joossens; Cisca Wijmenga; Stephan Claes; Lukas Van Oudenhove; Alexandra Zhernakova; Sara Vieira-Silva; Jeroen Raes
30499231,Effect of probiotic interventions on depressive symptoms: A narrative review evaluating systematic reviews.,"Depression is one of the most prevalent mental illnesses and is often associated with various other medical disorders. Since the 1980s, the primary pharmacological treatment has been antidepressants, but due to the recent discovery of the association between the gut microbiome and mental health, probiotics have been proposed as an adjunctive or alternate treatment. In this narrative review, we aim to provide a holistic perspective by synthesizing and evaluating existing evidence, discussing key biological mechanisms, exploring the history of probiotic use, and appreciating the influence of modern diet on mental health. Five online databases were searched for relevant studies up to December 2017. Systematic reviews that included randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy of probiotics in the treatment of depressive symptoms were included. Seven systematic reviews met the inclusion criteria. Three of these reviews conducted meta-analyses, out of which, two concluded that probiotics improved depressive symptoms in the sample population. Out of the four reviews that conducted qualitative analysis, three reviews concluded that probiotics have the potential to be used as a treatment. Due to the differences in clinical trials, a definitive effect of probiotics on depressive symptoms cannot be concluded. Nonetheless, probiotics seem to potentially produce a significant therapeutic effect for subjects with pre-existing depressive symptoms. Further studies are warranted for definitive conclusions.",Psychiatry and clinical neurosciences,2019,Ibrahim Nadeem; Mohammed Z Rahman; Yasser Ad-Dab'bagh; Mahmood Akhtar
30525951,Bifidobacterium infantis M-63 improves mental health in victims with irritable bowel syndrome developed after a major flood disaster.,"Individuals in a community who developed irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) after major floods have significant mental health impairment. We aimed to determine if Bifidobacterium infantis M-63 was effective in improving symptoms, psychology and quality of life measures in flood-affected individuals with IBS and if the improvement was mediated by gut microbiota changes. Design was non-randomised, open-label, controlled before-and-after. Of 53 participants, 20 with IBS were given B. infantis M-63 (1×10<sup>9</sup> cfu/sachet/day) for three months and 33 were controls. IBS symptom severity scale, hospital anxiety and depression scale, SF-36 Questionnaire, hydrogen breath testing for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and stools for 16S rRNA metagenomic analysis were performed before and after intervention. 11 of 20 who were given probiotics (M-63) and 20 of 33 controls completed study as per-protocol. Mental well-being was improved with M-63 vs controls for full analysis (P=0.03) and per-protocol (P=0.01) populations. Within-group differences were observed for anxiety and bodily pain (both P=0.04) in the M-63 per-protocol population. Lower ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes was observed with M-63 vs controls (P=0.01) and the lower ratio was correlated with higher post-intervention mental score (P=0.04). B. infantis M-63 is probably effective in improving mental health of victims who developed IBS after floods and this is maybe due to restoration of microbial balance and the gut-brain axis. However, our conclusion must be interpreted within the context of limited sample size. The study was retrospectively registered on 12 October 2017 and the Trial Registration Number (TRN) was NCT03318614.",Beneficial microbes,2019,Z F Ma; N Yusof; N Hamid; R M Lawenko; W M Z Wan Mohammad; M T Liong; H Sugahara; T Odamaki; J Xiao; Y Y Lee
30826885,The Relationship Between Perinatal Mental Health and Stress: a Review of the Microbiome.,"Our current understanding of the underlying mechanisms and etiologies of perinatal mood and anxiety disorders (PMADs) is not clearly identified. The relationship of stress-induced adaptations (i.e., the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the autonomic nervous system (ANS), the immune system) and the microbiota are potential contributors to psychopathology exhibited in women during pregnancy and postpartum and should be investigated.The stress response activates the HPA axis and dysregulates the ANS, leading to the inhibition of the parasympathetic system. Sustained high levels of cortisol, reduced heart variability, and modulated immune responses increase the vulnerability to PMAD. Bidirectional communication between the nervous system and the microbiota is an important factor to alter host homeostasis and development of PMAD. Future research in the relationship between the psychoneuroimmune system, the gut microbiota, and PMAD has the potential to be integrated in clinical practice to improve screening, diagnosis, and treatment.",Current psychiatry reports,2019,Nusiebeh Redpath; Hannah S Rackers; Mary C Kimmel
30838027,Current Understanding of Gut Microbiota in Mood Disorders: An Update of Human Studies.,"Gut microbiota plays an important role in the bidirectional communication between the gut and the central nervous system. Mounting evidence suggests that gut microbiota can influence the brain function via neuroimmune and neuroendocrine pathways as well as the nervous system. Advances in gene sequencing techniques further facilitate investigating the underlying relationship between gut microbiota and psychiatric disorders. In recent years, researchers have preliminarily explored the gut microbiota in patients with mood disorders. The current review aims to summarize the published human studies of gut microbiota in mood disorders. The findings showed that microbial diversity and taxonomic compositions were significantly changed compared with healthy individuals. Most of these findings revealed that short-chain fatty acids-producing bacterial genera were decreased, while pro-inflammatory genera and those involved in lipid metabolism were increased in patients with depressive episodes. Interestingly, the abundance of <i>Actinobacteria</i>, <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> was increased and <i>Faecalibacterium</i> was decreased consistently in patients with either bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder. Some studies further indicated that specific bacteria were associated with clinical characteristics, inflammatory profiles, metabolic markers, and pharmacological treatment. These studies present preliminary evidence of the important role of gut microbiota in mood disorders, through the brain-gut-microbiota axis, which emerges as a promising target for disease diagnosis and therapeutic interventions in the future.",Frontiers in genetics,2019,Ting-Ting Huang; Jian-Bo Lai; Yan-Li Du; Yi Xu; Lie-Min Ruan; Shao-Hua Hu
30828318,Disentangling What We Know About Microbes and Mental Health.,"Much has been written in recent years about the gut-brain axis. Exciting pilot studies suggest probiotic applications to the gut can reduce anxiety and depression via the vagus nerve. But not to diminish such findings, much still needs to be considered, including the fact that the vagus nerve links to many other body sites that also host a microbiome. Questions remain that touch the core of being human: (i) Do our microbes influence happiness and to what extent? (ii) What components of the gut microbiota and their function, including as it relates to mental health, are critical and how do they differ between agile, fit hunter gatherers and obese westerners or Danes described as the happiest people on the planet? (iii) What role do environmental pollutants play in this microbes-host ecosystem? While approaching life from a reductionist perspective has a long history in science, we need to try to interrogate these health and disease issues from a wider perspective. For verification of a link between the gut microbiota and brain, and to test new therapies, human studies are needed, and are long overdue.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2019,Gregor Reid
30717162,Fecal Microbiota Analysis in Patients Going through a Depressive Episode during Treatment in a Psychiatric Hospital Setting.,"There is a worldwide prevalence of generalized anxiety and major depressive disorders (MDD). Gut⁻brain axis dysfunction, antibacterial activity, and modulatory effects of antidepressants toward intestinal bacteria have been shown both in vitro and in vivo.In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of hospital stay, including escitalopram administration, on gut microbiota in patients with depressive episodes.After admission to the hospital and 7-days washout from all medications the composition of fecal microbiota samples was evaluated at baseline (W0) and after 6 weeks (W6), using 16S rRNA sequencing. The study was conducted on 17 inpatients (52.9% females), who followed the same daily hospital routine, including a standard diet and received 5⁻20 mg daily doses of escitalopram.At the end of treatment (W6), no change was observed in the Chao1 index. However, Shannon (median (Q1⁻Q3): W0 2.78 (2.67⁻3.02) vs. W6 3.11 (2.80⁻3.30)), and inverse Simpson (median (Q1⁻Q3): W0 9.26 (7.26⁻13.76) vs. W6 12.13 (9.17⁻15.73)) indices increased significantly compared to baseline values (False Discovery Rate <i>p</i> (<i>q</i>) = 0.031 and <i>q</i> = 0.011, respectively). We also found that between-subject W0 Bray⁻Curtis dissimilarities were significantly higher than W0⁻W6 within-subject dissimilarities (median (Q1⁻Q3): 0.68 (0.56⁻0.77) vs. 0.38 (0.35⁻0.52), two sided Mann⁻Whitney test <i>p</i> < 0.00001. The within-subject dissimilarities did not depend on sex, age, BMI, illness duration and a daily dose of escitalopram. No significant differences between taxa levels, at the studied time points, were observed when adjusted for multiple hypotheses testing procedures.We conclude that a six-week treatment in a psychiatric hospital setting resulted in increased alpha biodiversity in fecal microbiota, however its causal relationship with patients' mental health was not proved. We have also found that individual microbiome stability was not affected by hospitalization.",Journal of clinical medicine,2019,Paweł Liśkiewicz; Justyna Pełka-Wysiecka; Mariusz Kaczmarczyk; Igor Łoniewski; Michał Wroński; Agata Bąba-Kubiś; Karolina Skonieczna-Żydecka; Wojciech Marlicz; Błażej Misiak; Jerzy Samochowiec
30707176,Gut microbiota analysis and its significance in vasovagal syncope in children.,"Vasovagal syncope (VVS) is common in children and greatly affect both physical and mental health. But the mechanisms have not been completely explained. This study was designed to analyze the gut microbiota in children with VVS and explore its clinical significance.Fecal samples from 20 VVS children and 20 matched controls were collected, and the microbiota were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The diversity and microbiota compositions of the VVS cases and controls were compared with the independent sample t test or Mann-Whitney U test. The correlation between the predominant bacteria and clinical symptoms was analyzed using Pearson or Spearman correlation test.No significant differences in diversity were evident between VVS and controls (P > 0.05). At the family level, the relative abundance of Ruminococcaceae was significantly higher in VVS children than in controls (median [Q1, Q3]: 22.10% [16.89%, 27.36%] vs. 13.92% [10.31%, 20.18%], Z = -2.40, P < 0.05), and LEfSe analysis revealed Ruminococcaceae as a discriminative feature (linear discriminant analysis [LDA] score > 4, P < 0.05). The relative abundance of Ruminococcaceae in VVS patients was positively correlated with the frequency of syncope (r = 0.616, P < 0.01). In terms of its correlation with hemodynamics, we showed that relative abundance of Ruminococcaceae was negatively correlated with the systolic and diastolic pressure reduction at the positive response in head-up tilt test (HUTT; r = -0.489 and -0.448, all P < 0.05), but was positively correlated with the mean pressure drop and decline rate (r = 0.489 and 0.467, all P < 0.05) as well as diastolic pressure drop and decline rate at the HUTT positive response (r = 0.579 and 0.589, all P < 0.01) in VVS patients.Ruminococcaceae was the predominant gut bacteria and was associated with the clinical symptoms and hemodynamics of VVS, suggesting that gut microbiota might be involved in the development of VVS.",Chinese medical journal,2019,Wei Bai; Selena Chen; Chao-Shu Tang; Jian-Guang Qi; Qing-Hua Cui; Ming Xu; Jun-Bao Du; Hong-Fang Jin
30317530,An insight into gut microbiota and its functionalities.,"Gut microbiota has evolved along with their hosts and is an integral part of the human body. Microbiota acquired at birth develops in parallel as the host develops and maintains its temporal stability and diversity through adulthood until death. Recent developments in genome sequencing technologies, bioinformatics and culturomics have enabled researchers to explore the microbiota and in particular their functions at more detailed level than before. The accumulated evidences suggest that though a part of the microbiota is conserved, the dynamic members vary along the gastrointestinal tract, from infants to elderly, primitive tribes to modern societies and in different health conditions. Though the gut microbiota is dynamic, it performs some basic functions in the immunological, metabolic, structural and neurological landscapes of the human body. Gut microbiota also exerts significant influence on both physical and mental health of an individual. An in-depth understanding of the functioning of gut microbiota has led to some very exciting developments in therapeutics, such as prebiotics, probiotics, drugs and faecal transplantation leading to improved health.",Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,2019,Atanu Adak; Mojibur R Khan
30705252,Key role of gut microbiota in anhedonia-like phenotype in rodents with neuropathic pain.,"Patients with chronic neuropathic pain frequently suffer from symptoms of anhedonia, which is a core symptom of depression. Accumulating studies suggest that gut microbiota may play a role in depression via gut-microbiota-brain axis. However, it is unknown whether gut microbiota plays a role in neuropathic pain-associated anhedonia. Here, we used a rat model of spared nerve injury (SNI). Hierarchical cluster analysis of sucrose preference test (SPT) results was used to classify the SNI rats with or without anhedonia-like phenotype. The 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing analysis showed abnormal composition of gut microbiota in the anhedonia susceptible compared to sham-operated rats and resilient rats. Furthermore, antibiotics-treated mice showed pain as well as depression-like and anhedonia-like phenotypes, suggesting a role of gut microbiota in these abnormal behaviors. Transplantation of fecal microbiota from anhedonia susceptible rats into antibiotics-treated pseudo-germ-free mice significantly exaggerated pain and depression-like phenotypes, including anhedonia. In contrast, transplantation of fecal microbiota from resilient rats into antibiotics-treated pseudo-germ-free mice significantly improved pain and depression-like phenotypes, including anhedonia. In conclusion, this study suggests that abnormal composition of gut microbiota may contribute to anhedonia susceptibility post SNI surgery, and that gut microbiota also plays a role in the pain as well as depression-like phenotypes. Interestingly, fecal microbiota transplantation from SNI rats with or without anhedonia can alter pain, depression-like and anhedonia-like phenotypes in the pseudo-germ-free mice. Therefore, it is likely that gut microbiota plays a key role in the pain as well as depression-like phenotypes including anhedonia in rodents with neuropathic pain.",Translational psychiatry,2019,Chun Yang; Xi Fang; Gaofeng Zhan; Niannian Huang; Shan Li; Jiangjiang Bi; Riyue Jiang; Ling Yang; Liying Miao; Bin Zhu; Ailin Luo; Kenji Hashimoto
30701194,Alterations in Gut Glutamate Metabolism Associated with Changes in Gut Microbiota Composition in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.,"Changes in the gut microenvironment may influence the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Here, we investigated the composition of the gut microbiota and metabolites in children with ASD. Ninety-two children with ASD and 42 age-matched children exhibiting typical development (TD) were enrolled in the two-stage study. In the discovery stage, shotgun metagenomic sequencing and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) were performed simultaneously on fecal samples obtained from 43 children in the ASD group and 31 children in the TD group. Systematic bioinformatic analyses were performed to identify gut metabolites associated with altered gut microbiota composition. At the validation stage, differential metabolites were tested using LC-MS with an additional 49 and 11 children in the ASD and TD groups, respectively. Altered glutamate metabolites were found in the ASD group, along with a decline in 2-keto-glutaramic acid and an abundance of microbiota associated with glutamate metabolism. These changes in glutamate metabolism were correlated with lower levels of the highly abundant bacteria Bacteroides vulgatus and higher levels of the potentially harmful Eggerthella lenta and Clostridium botulinum. Lower gut cortisol levels have also been identified in the ASD group and associated with changes in gut microbiota glutamate metabolism. Finally, gut 2-keto-glutaramic acid was validated as a potential biomarker for ASD. The significant changes in the gut microenvironment in children with ASD may provide new insight into the cause of ASD and aid in the search for diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the gut microbiota may play an important role in the pathogenesis of ASD, but the specific mechanism is still unclear. Through a comprehensive gut metagenomic and metabolome study of children with ASD, alterations in gut metabolite composition were found in children with ASD, and these alterations were linked to changes in gut microbiota composition. This may give us a deeper understanding of the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of ASD.",mSystems,2019,Mingbang Wang; Jing Wan; Han Rong; Fusheng He; Hui Wang; Jiaxiu Zhou; Chunquan Cai; Yan Wang; Ruihuan Xu; Zhaoqing Yin; Wenhao Zhou
30611275,The Australian Research Council Longevity Intervention (ARCLI) study protocol (ANZCTR12611000487910) addendum: neuroimaging and gut microbiota protocol.,"The Australian Research Council Longevity Intervention (ARCLI) was designed to investigate the effects of two active supplements, Pycnogenol and Bacopa monnieri (CDRI08) on cognitive performance in a cohort of elderly participants. An additional antioxidant supplement has been included into the trial. A neuroimaging component has also been added to the ARCLI study to investigate the neurochemical biomarkers of oxidative stress in vivo, as well as structural and functional changes associated with ageing and oxidative stress. Faecal biomarkers of gut microflora will also be analysed to investigate if gut microbiota are associated with domains of cognition (e.g., attention, processing speed, memory), mood or other ARCLI outcome variables. The aim of this paper is to update the published methods of the ARCLI clinical trial before it is completed, and data analysis commences.ARCLI is a randomised, placebo controlled, double-blind, now 4-arm clinical trial including neuroimaging and gut microflora sub-studies. Along with the demographic, haematological, mood, cardiovascular and cognitive assessments described in the initial protocol, 80 eligible participants from the overall study pool of ~ 400 will be recruited into the neuroimaging study and undergo scans at baseline, 3 months and 12 months. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, resting state functional connectivity and arterial spin labelled perfusion sequences are neuroimaging techniques included for each MRI visit in the study. Similarly, approximately 300 participants from the main study pool will be recruited to provide faecal samples at baseline, 3 months and 12 months so that the gut microbiome can be studied.ARCLI is 12-month intervention study, currently underway with a group of older adults, investigating a range of outcomes and their association with ageing.

31784958,Neuroimmune Advance in Depressive Disorder.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) or depression is one of the most highly prevalent, chronic, and recurrent disorders, which is associated with a high burden of disease and substantial impairment in social functions. Both immune molecules and cells have been implicated in the pathophysiology and maintenance of MDD. Findings in animals and MDD patients have suggested that both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines are activated in the neuroinflammation which contribute to behavioral symptoms and changes in the course of depression. There is a growing body of evidence to support that neuroinflammation is a mediator for the communication among stress response, neuroendocrine, neurotransmission, neurogenesis, and gut microbiota. These communications have been known as risk factors in the pathogenesis of MDD. In the meantime, accumulating evidence has suggested that some interventions targeting the inflammatory processes may play an important role in the treatment of MDD.",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,2019,Guoqing Zhao; Xiaohua Liu
31636495,"The ""systems approach"" to treating the brain: opportunities in developmental psychopharmacology.","The significance of early life for the long-term programming of mental health is increasingly being recognized. However, most psychotropic medications are currently intended for adult patients, and early psychopharmacological approaches aimed at reverting aberrant neurodevelopmental trajectories are missing. Psychopharmacologic intervention at an early age faces the challenge of operating in a highly plastic system and requires a comprehensive knowledge of neurodevelopmental mechanisms. Recently the systems biology approach has contributed to the understanding of neuroplasticity mechanisms from a new perspective that interprets them as the result of complex and dynamic networks of signals from different systems. This approach is creating opportunities for developmental psychopharmacology, suggesting novel targets that can modulate the course of development by interfering with neuroplasticity at an early age. We will discuss two interconnected systems-the immune and gut microbiota-that regulate neurodevelopment and that have been implicated in preclinical research as new targets in the prevention of aberrant brain development..",Dialogues in clinical neuroscience,2019,Silvia Bussone; Luisa Lo Iacono
31273718,The Contribution of Inflammation to Autism Spectrum Disorders: Recent Clinical Evidence.,"Autism comprises a complex and heterogeneous spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders, usually termed autism spectrum disorders (ASD). It is more prevalent in males than females, and genetic and environmental factors are believed to account in similar percentages to the development of ASD. In recent years, the contribution of inflammation and inflammatory mediators to disease aetiology and perpetuation has been the object of intense research. In this chapter, inflammatory aspects that contribute to ASD are discussed, including abnormal microglia activation and polarization phenotypes, increased systemic levels of pro-inflammatory mediators, and altered patterns of immune cell response to activation stimuli. Also, inflammation in the context of gut microbiome and the impact of inflammation on gender prevalence of ASD are considered. Finally, treatment impact on inflammatory parameters and the potential for use of anti-inflammatory drugs, alone or in combination with antipsychotics, to manage ASD are examined.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2019,J Prata; A S Machado; O von Doellinger; M I Almeida; M A Barbosa; R Coelho; S G Santos
30894059,Characterization of gut microbiota composition and functions in patients with chronic alcohol overconsumption.,"Excessive alcohol intake can alter the gut microbiota, which may underlie the pathophysiology of alcohol-related diseases. We examined gut microbiota composition and functions in patients with alcohol overconsumption for >10 years, compared to a control group of patients with a history of no or low alcohol intake. Faecal microbiota composition was assessed by 16S rRNA sequencing. Gut microbiota functions were evaluated by quantification of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and predictive metagenome profiling (PICRUSt). Twenty-four patients, mean age 64.8 years (19 males), with alcohol overconsumption, and 18 control patients, mean age 58.2 years (14 males) were included. The two groups were comparable regarding basic clinical variables. Nutritional assessment revealed lower total score on the screening tool Mini Nutritional Assessment, lower muscle mass as assessed by handgrip strength, and lower plasma vitamin C levels in the alcohol overconsumption group. Bacteria from phylum <i>Proteobacteria</i> were found in higher relative abundance, while bacteria from genus <i>Faecalibacterium</i> were found in lower relative abundance in the group of alcohol overconsumers. The group also had higher levels of the genera <i>Sutterella, Holdemania</i> and <i>Clostridium</i>, and lower concentration and percentage of butyric acid. When applying PICRUSt to predict the metagenomic composition, we found that genes related to invasion of epithelial cells were more common in the group of alcohol overconsumers. We conclude that gut microbiota composition and functions in patients with alcohol overconsumption differ from patients with low consumption of alcohol, and seem to be skewed into a putative pro-inflammatory direction.",Gut microbes,2019,Steinar Traae Bjørkhaug; Håvard Aanes; Sudan Prasad Neupane; Jørgen G Bramness; Stine Malvik; Christine Henriksen; Viggo Skar; Asle W Medhus; Jørgen Valeur
30747427,Role of the Gut Microbiome in Autism Spectrum Disorders.,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a severe neurodevelopmental or neuropsychiatric disorder with elusive etiology and obscure pathophysiology. Cognitive inabilities, impaired communication, repetitive behavior pattern, and restricted social interaction and communication lead to a debilitating situation in autism. The pattern of co-occurrence of medical comorbidities is most intriguing in autism, compared to any other neurodevelopmental disorders. They have an elevated comorbidity burden among which most frequently are seizures, psychiatric illness, and gastrointestinal disorders. The gut microbiota is believed to play a pivotal role in human health and disease through involvement in physiological homoeostasis, immunological development, glutathione metabolism, amino acid metabolism, etc., which in a reasonable way explain the role of gut-brain axis in autism. Branded as a neurodevelopmental disorder with psychiatric impairment and often misclassified as a mental disorder, many experts in the field think that a therapeutic solution to autism is unlikely to emerge. As the pathophysiology is still elusive, taking into account of the various symptoms that are concurrent in autism is important. Gastrointestinal problems that are seen associated with most of the autism cases suggest that it is not just a psychiatric disorder as many claim but have a physiological base, and alleviating the gastrointestinal problems could help alleviating the symptoms by bringing out the much needed overall improvement in the affected victims. A gut disorder akin to Crohn's disease is, sometimes, reported in autistic children, an extremely painful gastrointestinal disease which is named as autistic enterocolitis. This disturbed situation hypothesized to be initiated by dysbiosis or microbial imbalance could in turn perturb the coordination of microbiota-gut-brain axis which is important in human mental health as goes the popular dictum: ""fix your gut, fix your brain.""",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,2019,Joby Pulikkan; Agnisrota Mazumder; Tony Grace
30528936,Role of Actinobacteria and Coriobacteriia in the antidepressant effects of ketamine in an inflammation model of depression.,"Ketamine, an N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, elicits rapid-acting and sustained antidepressant effects in treatment-resistant depressed patients. Accumulating evidence suggests that gut microbiota via the gut-brain axis play a role in the pathogenesis of depression, thereby contributing to the antidepressant actions of certain compounds. Here we investigated the role of gut microbiota in the antidepressant effects of ketamine in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation model of depression. Ketamine (10 mg/kg) significantly attenuated the increased immobility time in forced swimming test (FST), which was associated with the improvements in α-diversity, consisting of Shannon, Simpson and Chao 1 indices. In addition to α-diversity, β-diversity, such as principal coordinates analysis (PCoA), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) coupled with effect size measurements (LEfSe), showed a differential profile after ketamine treatment. Furthermore, a total of 30 bacteria were significantly altered in the LPS + saline treated mice and LPS + ketamine treated mice. Interestingly, two bacteria, including the phylum Actinobacteria and the class Coriobacteriia were significantly correlated with the immobility time of FST. Importantly, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves demonstrated that the phylum Actinobacteria and the class Coriobacteriia were potential biomarker for the antidepressant effects of ketamine in an inflammation model. These findings suggest that antidepressant effects of ketamine might be related to the regulation of abnormal composition of gut microbiota, and that the phylum Actinobacteria and the class Coriobacteriia might be potential biomarkers for ketamine's antidepressant efficacy.","Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior",2019,Niannian Huang; Dongyu Hua; Gaofeng Zhan; Shan Li; Bin Zhu; Riyue Jiang; Ling Yang; Jiangjiang Bi; Hui Xu; Kenji Hashimoto; Ailin Luo; Chun Yang
30394313,Alteration of gut microbiota-associated epitopes in children with autism spectrum disorders.,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects 1% of children and has no cure. Gastrointestinal (GI) problems are common in children with ASD, and although gut microbiota is known to play an important role in ASD through the gut-brain axis, the specific mechanism is unknown. Recent evidence suggests that gut microbiota may participate in the pathogenesis of ASD through immune- and inflammation-mediated pathways. Here, we identified potentially immunogenic epitopes derived from gut microbiota in stool samples from ASD children with and without GI problems and typically developing (TD) children.Candidate gut microbiota-associated epitopes (MEs) were identified by blast shotgun metagenomic sequencing of fecal samples from 43 ASD children (19 with and 24 without GI involvement) and 31 sex- and age-matched typically developing (TD) children. Potentially immunogenic epitopes were screened against a predictive human Immune Epitope Database. The composition and abundance of candidate MEs were compared between the three groups of children.MEs identified in ASD children with GI problems were significantly more diverse than those in TD children. ME composition could discriminate between the three groups of children. We identified 34 MEs that were significantly more or less abundant in ASD children than TD children, most (29/34) of the differences in MEs were reduced in ASD and associated with abnormal gut IgA level and altered gut microbiota composition, these MEs were limited effected by clinical factors such as age, gender, and GI problems, of which eleven MEs were pathogenic microorganisms peptides with strong T or B cell response, nine MEs showed high homology to peptides from human self proteins associated with autoimmune disease occurrence, eliciting immune attack against hematopoietic stem cells and inhibition antigen binding. We also found that the abundance of five MEs were increased in ASD, including three human self proteins, gap junction alpha-1 (GJA1), paired box protein Pax-3 (PAX3) and eyes absent homolog 1 isoform 4 (EYA1) which associated with cancer, and a ME with homology to a Listeriolysin O peptide from the pathogenic bacterium Listeria monocytogenes was significantly increased in ASD children compared with TD children.Our findings demonstrate the abnormal of MEs composition in the gut of children with ASD, moreover, the abnormality in MEs composition was associated with abnormal gut IgA levels and altered gut microbiota composition, this abnormality also suggests that there may be abnormalities in intestinal immunity in children with ASD; In all, thirty-four MEs identified were potential biomarker of ASD, and alterations in MEs may contribute to abnormalities in gut immunity and/or homeostasis in ASD children. Further study of the MEs identified here may advance our understanding of the pathogenesis of ASD.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2019,Mingbang Wang; Jiaxiu Zhou; Fusheng He; Chunquan Cai; Hui Wang; Yan Wang; Yin Lin; Han Rong; Guoqiang Cheng; Ruihuan Xu; Wenhao Zhou
30659564,Can microbiology affect psychiatry? A link between gut microbiota and psychiatric disorders.,"Every single human consists of thousands of genes, billions of neurons and trillions of bacteria. There is a rapidly growing number of data that links the gut microbiome to the development and functioning of the central nervous system, which is a currently proposed paradigm shift in neuroscience. Knowledge on the relationship between gut microbiota and mental disorders is constantly increasing. This phenomenon is known as ""gut-brain axis"". The strongest evidence for the role of microbes in the gut-brain axis comes from animal studies. Nevertheless, the gutbrain crosstalk is a bidirectional communication system that not only provides gastrointestinal homeostasis, but can also affect motivation as well as higher cognitive functions. Moreover, gut microbiome can be associated with obesity and inflammatory gastrointestinal disorders. According to the recent studies, there is a link between the composition of gut microbiota and mental disorders in animals (response to depression and chronic stress).

30544486,Microbiome-The Missing Link in the Gut-Brain Axis: Focus on Its Role in Gastrointestinal and Mental Health.,"The central nervous system (CNS) and the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract communicate through the gut-brain axis (GBA). Such communication is bi-directional and involves neuronal, endocrine, and immunological mechanisms. There is mounting data that gut microbiota is the source of a number of neuroactive and immunocompetent substances, which shape the structure and function of brain regions involved in the control of emotions, cognition, and physical activity. Most GI diseases are associated with altered transmission within the GBA that are influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Current treatment protocols for GI and non-GI disorders may positively or adversely affect the composition of intestinal microbiota with a diverse impact on therapeutic outcome(s). Alterations of gut microbiota have been associated with mood and depressive disorders. Moreover, mental health is frequently affected in GI and non-GI diseases. Deregulation of the GBA may constitute a grip point for the development of diagnostic tools and personalized microbiota-based therapy. For example, next generation sequencing (NGS) offers detailed analysis of microbiome footprints in patients with mental and GI disorders. Elucidating the role of stem cell⁻host microbiome cross talks in tissues in GBA disorders might lead to the development of next generation diagnostics and therapeutics. Psychobiotics are a new class of beneficial bacteria with documented efficacy for the treatment of GBA disorders.

30518033,Differences in Anxiety Levels of Various Murine Models in Relation to the Gut Microbiota Composition.,"Psychobiotics are probiotic strains that confer mental health benefits to the host through the modulation of the gut microbial population. Mounting evidence shows that the gut microbiota play an important role in communication within the gut⁻brain axis. However, the relationship between the host genetics and the gut microbiota and their influence on anxiety are still not fully understood. Hence, in our research, we attempted to draw a connection between host genetics, microbiota composition, and anxiety by performing an elevated plus maze (EPM) test on four genetically different mice. Four different breeds of 5-week-old mice were used in this experiment: Balb/c, Orient C57BL/6N, Taconic C57BL/6N, and Taconic C57BL/6J. After 1 week of adaptation, their initial anxiety level was monitored using the EPM test via an EthoVision XT, a standardized software used for behavorial testing. Significant differences in the initial anxiety level and microbial composition were detected. Subsequently, the microbiota of each group was modulated by the administration of either a probiotic, fecal microbiota transplantation, or antibiotics. Changes were observed in host anxiety levels in correlation to the shift of the gut microbiota. Our results suggest that the microbiota, host genetics, and psychological symptoms are strongly related, yet the deeper mechanistic links need further exploration.",Biomedicines,2018,Eunchong Huang; Shinwon Kang; Haryung Park; Soyoung Park; Yosep Ji; Wilhelm H Holzapfel
30584306,Possible association of Firmicutes in the gut microbiota of patients with major depressive disorder.,"Gut microbiota can affect human behavior and mood in many ways. Several studies have shown that patients with depression were also accompanied with gut microbiota disorder, in which Firmicutes are related to the protective function of intestinal barrier. In this study, we explore the changes and effects of Firmicutes in the patients with major depressive disorder (MDD).We recruited 54 subjects, including 27 patients with MDD. Fecal samples were collected for identification by 16S rRNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis.The study shows that the alpha diversity indices of MDD patients are lower than those of the healthy controls. Firmicutes is the most significantly decreased phylum in the MDD samples. There are totally 13 taxonomic biomarkers with <i>P</i>-value <0.01 from Firmicutes. There are differences in 17 KEGG pathways between the two groups.This study found that there is a significant disorder of gut microbiota in the patients with depression, in which the Firmicutes decreased significantly. Defects of the Firmicutes may lead to the depression in short-chain fatty acids, which could account for the physiological basis of low-level inflammation of depression.This is a cross-sectional study and the sample size is comparatively small.

30513869,"One Health, Fermented Foods, and Gut Microbiota.","Changes in present-day society such as diets with more sugar, salt, and saturated fat, bad habits and unhealthy lifestyles contribute to the likelihood of the involvement of the microbiota in inflammatory diseases, which contribute to global epidemics of obesity, depression, and mental health concerns. The microbiota is presently one of the hottest areas of scientific and medical research, and exerts a marked influence on the host during homeostasis and disease. Fermented foods and beverages are generally defined as products made by microbial organisms and enzymatic conversions of major and minor food components. Further to the commonly-recognized effects of nutrition on the digestive health (e.g., dysbiosis) and well-being, there is now strong evidence for the impact of fermented foods and beverages (e.g., yoghurt, pickles, bread, kefir, beers, wines, mead), produced or preserved by the action of microorganisms, on general health, namely their significance on the gut microbiota balance and brain functionality. Fermented products require microorganisms, i.e., <i>Saccharomyces</i> yeasts and lactic acid bacteria, yielding alcohol and lactic acid. Ingestion of vibrant probiotics, especially those contained in fermented foods, is found to cause significant positive improvements in balancing intestinal permeability and barrier function. Our guts control and deal with every aspect of our health. How we digest our food and even the food sensitivities we have is linked with our mood, behavior, energy, weight, food cravings, hormone balance, immunity, and overall wellness. We highlight some impacts in this domain and debate calls for the convergence of interdisciplinary research fields from the United Nations' initiative. Worldwide human and animal medicine are practiced separately; veterinary science and animal health are generally neither considered nor inserted within national or international Health discussions. The absence of a clear definition and subsequent vision for the future of One Health may act as a barrier to transdisciplinary collaboration. The point of this mini review is to highlight the role of fermented foods and beverages on gut microbiota and debate if the need for confluence of transdisciplinary fields of One Health is feasible and achievable, since they are managed by separate sectors with limited communication.","Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",2018,Victoria Bell; Jorge Ferrão; Lígia Pimentel; Manuela Pintado; Tito Fernandes
30033172,Towards microbiome-informed dietary recommendations for promoting metabolic and mental health: Opinion papers of the MyNewGut project.,"The gut microbiota coexists in partnership with the human host through adaptations to environmental and physiological changes that help maintain dynamic homeostatic healthy states. Break-down of this delicate balance under sustained exposure to stressors (e.g. unhealthy diets) can, however, contribute to the onset of disease. Diet is a key modifiable environmental factor that modulates the gut microbiota and its metabolic capacities that, in turn, could impact human physiology. On this basis, the diet and the gut microbiota could act as synergistic forces that provide resilience against disease or that speed the progress from health to disease states. Associations between unhealthy dietary patterns, non-communicable diseases and intestinal dysbiosis can be explained by this hypothesis. Translational studies showing that dietary-induced alterations in microbial communities recapitulate some of the pathological features of the original host further support this notion. In this introductory paper by the European project MyNewGut, we briefly summarize the investigations conducted to better understand the role of dietary patterns and food components in metabolic and mental health and the specificities of the microbiome-mediating mechanisms. We also discuss how advances in the understanding of the microbiome's role in dietary health effects can help to provide acceptable scientific grounds on which to base dietary advice for promoting healthy living.","Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)",2018,Yolanda Sanz; Marina Romaní-Perez; Alfonso Benítez-Páez; Kevin J Portune; Patrizia Brigidi; Simone Rampelli; Ted Dinan; Catherine Stanton; Nathalie Delzenne; François Blachier; Audrey M Neyrinck; Martin Beaumont; Marta Olivares; Peter Holzer; Kathrin Günther; Maike Wolters; Wolfgang Ahrens; Sandrine P Claus; Cristina Campoy; Rinki Murphy; Christina Sadler; Laura Fernández; Jan-Willem van der Kamp

30532687,Gut thinking: the gut microbiome and mental health beyond the head.,"<b>Background:</b> In recent decades, dominant models of mental illness have become increasingly focused on the head, with mental disorders being figured as brain disorders. However, research into the active role that the microbiome-gut-brain axis plays in affecting mood and behaviour may lead to the conclusion that mental health is more than an internalised problem of individual brains. <b>Objective:</b> This article explores the implications of shifting understandings about mental health that have come about through research into links between the gut microbiome and mental health problems such as depression and anxiety. It aims to analyse the different ways that the lines between mind and body and mental and physical health are re-shaped by this research, which is starting to inform clinical and public understanding. <b>Design:</b> As mental health has become a pressing issue of political and public concern it has become increasingly constructed in socio-cultural and personal terms beyond clinical spaces, requiring a conceptual response that exceeds biomedical inquiry. This article argues that an interdisciplinary critical medical humanities approach is well positioned to analyse the impact of microbiome-gut-brain research on conceptions of mind. <b>Results:</b> The entanglement of mind and matter evinced by microbiome-gut-brain axis research potentially provides a different way to conceptualise the physical and social concomitants of mental distress. <b>Conclusion:</b> Mental health is not narrowly located in the head but is assimilated by the physical body and intermingled with the natural world, requiring different methods of research to unfold the meanings and implications of gut thinking for conceptions of human selfhood.",Microbial ecology in health and disease,2018,Grace Lucas

In this study, we explored the potential antidepressant efficacy of a multi-strain probiotics treatment (<i>Lactobacillus helveticus R0052</i>, <i>Lactobacillus plantarum R1012</i>, and <i>Bifidobacterium longum R0175</i>) in a chronic mild stress (CMS) mouse model of depression and determined its probable mechanism of action. Our findings revealed that mice subjected to CMS exhibited anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors in the sucrose preference test, elevated plus maze, and forced swim test, along with increased interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 levels in the hippocampus. Moreover, the microbiota distinctly changed from the non-stress group and was characterized by highly diverse bacterial communities associated with significant reductions in <i>Lactobacillus</i> species. Probiotics attenuated CMS-induced anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors, significantly increased <i>Lactobacillus</i> abundance, and reversed the CMS-induced immune changes in the hippocampus. Thus, the possible mechanism involved in the antidepressant-like activity of probiotics is correlated with <i>Lactobacillus</i> species via the gut microbiota-inflammation-brain axis.",Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience,2018,Nannan Li; Qi Wang; Yan Wang; Anji Sun; Yiwei Lin; Ye Jin; Xiaobai Li
30405455,Metabolic and Microbiota Measures as Peripheral Biomarkers in Major Depressive Disorder.,"Advances in understanding the role of the microbiome in physical and mental health are at the forefront of medical research and hold potential to have a direct impact on precision medicine approaches. In the past 7 years, we have studied the role of microbiota-brain communication on behavior in mouse models using germ-free mice, mice exposed to antibiotics, and healthy specific pathogen free mice. Through our work and that of others, we have seen an amazing increase in our knowledge of how bacteria signal to the brain and the implications this has for psychiatry. Gut microbiota composition and function are influenced both by genetics, age, sex, diet, life experiences, and many other factors of psychiatric and bodily disorders and thus may act as potential biomarkers of the gut-brain axis that could be used in psychiatry and co-morbid conditions. There is a particular need in major depressive disorder and other mental illness to identify biomarkers that can stratify patients into more homogeneous groups to provide better treatment and for development of new therapeutic approaches. Peripheral outcome measures of host-microbe bidirectional communication have significant translational value as biomarkers. Enabling stratification of clinical populations, based on individual biological differences, to predict treatment response to pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions.

30248988,A Meta-Analysis of the Clinical Use of Curcumin for Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS).,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) remains a prevalent and difficult-to-manage gastrointestinal condition. There is growing interest in the use of traditional medicine to manage IBS. In particular, curcumin, a biologically active phytochemical, has demonstrated anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties and mucosal protective effects in rat models of colitis. This meta-analysis thus aimed to investigate the hypothesis that curcumin improves IBS symptoms. Using the keywords (curcumin OR turmeric OR Indian saffron OR diferuloylmethane OR curcuminoid) AND (irritable bowel syndrome OR IBS), a preliminary search on the PubMed, Medline, Embase, PsychINFO, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases yielded 1080 papers published in English between 1 January 1988 and 1 May 2018. Five randomized, controlled trials were systematically reviewed and 3 were included in the final meta-analysis. Random-effects meta-analysis based on three studies and 326 patients found curcumin to have a beneficial albeit not statistically significant effect on IBS symptoms (pooled standardized mean difference from baseline IBS severity rating -0.466, 95% CI: -1.113 to 0.182, <i>p</i> = 0.158). This is the first meta-analysis to examine the use of curcumin in IBS. With its unique anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities and ability to modulate gut microbiota, curcumin is a potentially useful addition to our armamentarium of agents for IBS. It also appears safe and well-tolerated, with no adverse events reported in the available trials. However, current findings are based on a considerably limited evidence base with marked heterogeneity. More robust clinical trials involving a standardized curcumin preparation and larger sample sizes should be encouraged.",Journal of clinical medicine,2018,Qin Xiang Ng; Alex Yu Sen Soh; Wayren Loke; Nandini Venkatanarayanan; Donovan Yutong Lim; Wee-Song Yeo
30223263,The Role of Nutrition and the Gut-Brain Axis in Psychiatry: A Review of the Literature.,"Individuals suffering from psychiatric disorders experience high levels of illness burden and a significantly reduced quality of life. Despite targeted psychopharmacological strategies and complementary psychotherapeutic procedures only moderate effects are obtained, and the risk of relapse is high in many patients. Worldwide, psychiatric diseases such as depression are continuously increasing, challenging the personal life of the affected as well as their families, but also whole societies by increasing disability, early retirement and hospitalization. According to current scientific knowledge psychiatric disorders are caused by a multifactorial pathogenesis, including genetics, inflammation and neurotransmitter imbalance; furthermore, also lifestyle-associated factors gain rising importance. In line with this, there is growing evidence that the gut microbiota and nutrition have an impact on the onset and course of psychiatric disorders.This narrative review highlights the important role of nutrition in psychiatric care and underlines the significance of nutritional advice in the multifactorial, biopsychosocial treatment of patients. It focuses on current dietary interventions such as the Mediterranean diet, dietary supplements and modifications of the gut microbiota with pre-, pro- and postbiotics.Recent studies support the connection between the quality of diet, gut microbiota and mental health through regulation of metabolic functions, anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic properties and the support of neurogenesis. Dietary coaching to improve mental health seems to be an additional, cost-effective, practical, nonpharmacological intervention for individuals with psychiatric disorders.The use of nutritional interventions in psychiatry equips therapists with a promising tool for both the prevention and treatment of psychiatric disorders. Besides pharmacological therapy, psychotherapy and physical activity, nutritional interventions are an important pillar in the multifactorial, biopsychosocial treatment of psychiatric disease and could be used as a potential therapeutic target.",Neuropsychobiology,2018,Sabrina Mörkl; Jolana Wagner-Skacel; Theresa Lahousen; Sonja Lackner; Sandra Johanna Holasek; Susanne Astrid Bengesser; Annamaria Painold; Anna Katharina Holl; Eva Reininghaus
30207256,Microbiota-gut-brain research: A critical analysis.,"Microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) research is a fast-growing field of inquiry with important implications for how human brain function and behaviour are understood. Researchers manipulate gut microbes (""microbiota"") to reveal connections between intestinal microbiota and normal brain functions (e.g., cognition, emotion, and memory) or pathological states (e.g., anxiety, mood disorders, and neural developmental disorders such as autism). Many claims are made about causal relationships between gut microbiota and human behaviour. By uncovering these relationships, MGB research aims to offer new explanations of mental health and potential avenues of treatment.So far, limited evaluation has been made of MGB's methods and its core experimental findings, many of which are extensively reiterated in copious reviews of the field. These factors, plus the self-help potential of MGB, have combined to encourage uncritical public uptake of MGB discoveries. Both social and professional media focus on the potential for dietary intervention in mental health, and causal relationships are assumed to be established.Our target article has two main aims. One is to examine critically the core practices and findings of experimental MGB research and to raise questions about them for brain and behavioural scientists who may not be familiar with the field. The other is to challenge the way in which MGB findings are presented. Our positive goal is to suggest how current problems and weaknesses may be addressed, in order for both scientific and public audiences to gain a clearer picture of MGB research and its strengths and limitations.",The Behavioral and brain sciences,2018,Katarzyna B Hooks; Jan Pieter Konsman; Maureen A O'Malley

The current dilemma reminds us that the human being is a superorganism. Only when we take the human self and its partner microbiota into consideration at the same time, can we better understand these diseases. Over the last few centuries, the partner microbiota has experienced tremendous change, much more than human genes, because of the modern transformations in diet, lifestyle, medical care, and so on, parallel to the modern epidemiological transition. Existing research indicates that gut microbiota plays an important role in this transition. According to gut-brain psychology, the gut microbiota is a crucial part of the gut-brain network, and it communicates with the brain via the microbiota-gut-brain axis. The gut microbiota almost develops synchronously with the gut-brain, brain, and mind. The gut microbiota influences various normal mental processes and mental phenomena, and is involved in the pathophysiology of numerous mental and neurological diseases. Targeting the microbiota in therapy for these diseases is a promising approach that is supported by three theories: the gut microbiota hypothesis, the ""old friend"" hypothesis, and the leaky gut theory. The effects of gut microbiota on the brain and behavior are fulfilled by the microbiota-gut-brain axis, which is mainly composed of the nervous pathway, endocrine pathway, and immune pathway. Undoubtedly, gut-brain psychology will bring great enhancement to psychology, neuroscience, and psychiatry. Various microbiota-improving methods including fecal microbiota transplantation, probiotics, prebiotics, a healthy diet, and healthy lifestyle have shown the capability to promote the function of the gut-brain, microbiota-gut-brain axis, and brain. It will be possible to harness the gut microbiota to improve brain and mental health and prevent and treat related diseases in the future.",Frontiers in integrative neuroscience,2018,Shan Liang; Xiaoli Wu; Feng Jin
29870894,Gut microbiome and magnetic resonance spectroscopy study of subjects at ultra-high risk for psychosis may support the membrane hypothesis.,"The microbiota-gut-brain axis and membrane dysfunction in the brain has attracted increasing attention in the field of psychiatric research. However, the possible interactive role of gut microbiota and brain function in the prodromal stage of schizophrenia has not been studied yet.To explore this, we collected fecal samples and performed Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) scans in 81 high risk (HR) subjects, 19 ultra-high risk (UHR) subjects and 69 health controls (HC). Then we analyzed the differences in gut microbiota and choline concentrations in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC).Presences of the orders Clostridiales, Lactobacillales and Bacteroidales were observed at increase levels in fecal samples of UHR subjects compared to the other two groups. The composition changes of gut microbiota indicate the increased production of Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs), which could activate microglia and then disrupt membrane metabolism. Furthermore, this was confirmed by an increase of choline levels, a brain imaging marker of membrane dysfunction, which is also significantly elevated in UHR subjects compared to the HR and HC groups.Both gut microbiome and imaging studies of UHR subjects suggest the membrane dysfunction in the brain and hence might support the membrane hypothesis of schizophrenia.",European psychiatry : the journal of the Association of European Psychiatrists,2018,Ying He; Tomasz Kosciolek; Jinsong Tang; Yao Zhou; Zongchang Li; Xiaoqian Ma; Qiyun Zhu; Ning Yuan; Liu Yuan; Chunwang Li; Ke Jin; Rob Knight; Ming T Tsuang; Xiaogang Chen
29542066,A systematic review of studies on the faecal microbiota in anorexia nervosa: future research may need to include microbiota from the small intestine.,"Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a poorly understood and often chronic condition. Deviations in the gut microbiota have been reported to influence the gut-brain axis in other disorders. Therefore, if present in AN, it may impact on symptoms and illness progression. A review of the gut microbiota studies in AN is presented.A literature search on PubMed yielded 27 articles; 14 were selected and based on relevance, 9 articles were included. The findings were interpreted in the larger context of preclinical research and clinical observations.8 out of 9 included studies analysed microbiota from faeces samples, while the last analysed a protein in plasma produced by the gut. Two studies were longitudinal and included an intervention (i.e., weight restoration), five were cross-sectional, one was a case report, and the last was a case series consisting of three cases. Deviations in abundance, diversity, and microbial composition of the faecal microbiota in AN were found.There are currently only a few studies on the gut microbiota in AN, all done on faeces samples, and not all describe the microbiota at the species level extensively. The Archaeon Methanobrevibacter smithii was increased in participants with a BMI < 25 in one study and specifically in AN patients in three studies. Methanobrevibacter smithii may, if detected, be a benchmark biomarker for future studies. We propose that microbiota samples could also be collected from the small intestine, where a major exchange of nutrients takes place and where the microbiota may have a biological impact on AN.",Eating and weight disorders : EWD,2018,Hanna Ferløv Schwensen; Carol Kan; Janet Treasure; Niels Høiby; Magnus Sjögren
29352709,Analysis of gut microbiota diversity and auxiliary diagnosis as a biomarker in patients with schizophrenia: A cross-sectional study.,"With the advent of sequencing technology, characterization of schizophrenia with underlying probing of gut microbiome can provide abundant clues for diagnosis and prognosis of schizophrenia. In this study, we first compared the difference of gut microbiota between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls by 16S rRNA sequencing. We further explored whether gut microbiota can be used as a biomarker to assist in the diagnosis of schizophrenia. We restricted inclusion criteria strictly to control confounding bias. Finally, we investigated differences in fecal microbiota between 64 schizophrenia patients and 53 healthy controls. At the phylum level, we found that the abundance of Proteobacteria in the schizophrenia patients was significantly increased. At the genus level, the relative abundance of Succinivibrio, Megasphaera, Collinsella, Clostridium, Klebsiella and Methanobrevibacter was significantly higher whereas the abundance of Blautia, Coprococcus, Roseburia was decreased compared to health controls. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated that 12 significant microbiota biomarkers were capable of being used as diagnostic factors for distinguishing the schizophrenia cohort from those in the control cohort (AUC = 0.837). We performed PICRUSt analysis and found that several metabolic pathways differed significantly between healthy controls and schizophrenia patients, including vitamin B6 and fatty acid. In conclusion, there are some difference of gut microbiota between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls and the insights from this study could be used to develop microbiota-based diagnosis for schizophrenia.",Schizophrenia research,2018,Yang Shen; Jintian Xu; Zhiyong Li; Yichen Huang; Ye Yuan; Jixiang Wang; Meng Zhang; Songnian Hu; Ying Liang

Emerging evidence suggests that above dietary components can directly impact the composition and metabolic activity of the mammalian gut microbiota and in turn, affect both physical and mental health. There is a growing recognition that rise in chronic disease burden in Western countries may due to progressive loss of beneficial bacteria and microbial diversity. This perspective explores the possibility of using Indian <i>thali</i>, an ancient approach to diet that provides both fiber and different phytochemicals by incorporating a variety of plant foods in different colors.

29843470,Recognizing Depression from the Microbiota⁻Gut⁻Brain Axis.,"Major depression is one of the leading causes of disability, morbidity, and mortality worldwide. The brain⁻gut axis functions are disturbed, revealed by a dysfunction of the brain, immune system, endocrine system, and gut. Traditional depression treatments all target the brain, with different drugs and/or psychotherapy. Unfortunately, most of the patients have never received any treatment. Studies indicate that gut microbiota could be a direct cause for the disorder. Abnormal microbiota and the microbiota⁻gut⁻brain dysfunction may cause mental disorders, while correcting these disturbance could alleviate depression. Nowadays, the gut microbiota modulation has become a hot topic in treatment research of mental disorders. Depression is closely related with the health condition of the brain⁻gut axis, and maintaining/restoring the normal condition of gut microbiota helps in the prevention/therapy of mental disorders.",International journal of molecular sciences,2018,Shan Liang; Xiaoli Wu; Xu Hu; Tao Wang; Feng Jin
29407287,Overview and systematic review of studies of microbiome in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.,"Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are among the leading causes of disability, morbidity, and mortality worldwide. In addition to being serious mental illnesses, these disorders are associated with considerable systemic physiological dysfunction, including chronic inflammation and elevated oxidative stress. The advent of sophisticated sequencing techniques has led to a growing interest in the potential role of gut microbiota in human health and disease. Advances in this area have transformed our understanding of a number of medical conditions and have generated a new perspective suggesting that gut microbiota might be involved in the development and maintenance of brain/mental health. Animal models have demonstrated strong though indirect evidence for a contributory role of intestinal microbiota in psychiatric symptomatology and have linked the microbiome with neuropsychiatric conditions. We present a systematic review of clinical studies of microbiome in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The published literature has a number of limitations; however, the investigations suggest that these disorders are associated with reduced microbial diversity and show global community differences compared to non-psychiatric comparison samples. In some reports, specific microbial taxa were associated with clinical disease characteristics, including physical health, depressive and psychotic symptoms, and sleep, but little information on the functional potential of those community changes. Studies also suggest increased intestinal inflammation and permeability, which may be among the principal mechanisms by which microbial dysbiosis impacts systemic physiological functioning. We highlight gaps in the current literature and implications for diagnosis and therapeutic interventions, and outline future directions for microbiome research in psychiatry.",Journal of psychiatric research,2018,Tanya T Nguyen; Tomasz Kosciolek; Lisa T Eyler; Rob Knight; Dilip V Jeste
29489753,Environment dominates over host genetics in shaping human gut microbiota.,"Human gut microbiome composition is shaped by multiple factors but the relative contribution of host genetics remains elusive. Here we examine genotype and microbiome data from 1,046 healthy individuals with several distinct ancestral origins who share a relatively common environment, and demonstrate that the gut microbiome is not significantly associated with genetic ancestry, and that host genetics have a minor role in determining microbiome composition. We show that, by contrast, there are significant similarities in the compositions of the microbiomes of genetically unrelated individuals who share a household, and that over 20% of the inter-person microbiome variability is associated with factors related to diet, drugs and anthropometric measurements. We further demonstrate that microbiome data significantly improve the prediction accuracy for many human traits, such as glucose and obesity measures, compared to models that use only host genetic and environmental data. These results suggest that microbiome alterations aimed at improving clinical outcomes may be carried out across diverse genetic backgrounds.",Nature,2018,Daphna Rothschild; Omer Weissbrod; Elad Barkan; Alexander Kurilshikov; Tal Korem; David Zeevi; Paul I Costea; Anastasia Godneva; Iris N Kalka; Noam Bar; Smadar Shilo; Dar Lador; Arnau Vich Vila; Niv Zmora; Meirav Pevsner-Fischer; David Israeli; Noa Kosower; Gal Malka; Bat Chen Wolf; Tali Avnit-Sagi; Maya Lotan-Pompan; Adina Weinberger; Zamir Halpern; Shai Carmi; Jingyuan Fu; Cisca Wijmenga; Alexandra Zhernakova; Eran Elinav; Eran Segal
28901279,The Role of Physical Exercise and Omega-3 Fatty Acids in Depressive Illness in the Elderly.,"In adulthood, depression is the most common type of mental illness and will be the second leading cause of disease by 2020. Major depression dramatically affects the function of the central nervous system and degrades the quality of life, especially in old age. Several mechanisms underlie the pathophysiology of depressive illness, since it has a multifactorial etiology. Human and animal studies have demonstrated that depression is mainly associated with imbalances in neurotransmitters and neurotrophins, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis alterations, brain volume changes, neurogenesis dysfunction, and dysregulation of inflammatory pathways. Also the gut microbiota may influence mental health outcomes. Although depression is not a consequence of normal aging, depressive disorders are common in later life, even if often undiagnosed or mis-diagnosed in old age. When untreated, depression reduces life expectancy, worsens medical illnesses, enhances health care costs and is the primary cause of suicide among older people. To date, the underpinnings of depression in the elderly are still to be understood, and the pharmacological treatment is the most commonly used therapy.Since a sedentary lifestyle and poor eating habits have recently emerged as crucial contributors to the genesis and course of depression, in the present review, we have focused on the effects of physical activity and omega-3 fatty acids on depressive illness in the elderly.A growing literature indicates that both exercise and dietary interventions can promote mental health throughout one's lifespan.There thus emerges the awareness that an active lifestyle and a balanced diet may constitute valid low-cost prevention strategies to counteract depressive illness in the elderly.",Current neuropharmacology,2018,Stefano Farioli Vecchioli; Stefano Sacchetti; V Nicolis di Robilant; Debora Cutuli
29031410,Harnessing Gut Microbes for Mental Health: Getting From Here to There.,"There has been an explosion of interest in the study of microorganisms inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract (gut microbiota) and their impact on host health and physiology. Accumulating data suggest that altered communication between gut microbiota and host systems could participate in disorders such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, and autoimmune disorders as well as neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism, anxiety, and major depressive disorders. The conceptual development of the microbiome-gut-brain axis has facilitated understanding of the complex and bidirectional networks between gastrointestinal microbiota and their host, highlighting potential mechanisms through which this environment influences central nervous system physiology. Communication pathways between gut microbiota and the central nervous system could include autonomic, neuroendocrine, enteric, and immune systems, with pathology resulting in disruption to neurotransmitter balance, increases in chronic inflammation, or exacerbated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity. However, uncertainty remains regarding the generalizability of controlled animal studies to the more multifaceted pattern of human pathophysiology, especially with regard to the therapeutic potential for neuropsychiatric health. This narrative review summarizes current understanding of gut microbial influence over physiological function, with an emphasis on neurobehavioral and neurological impairment based on growing understanding of the gut-brain axis. Experimental and clinical data regarding means of therapeutic manipulation of gut microbiota as a novel treatment option for mental health are described, and important knowledge gaps are identified and discussed.",Biological psychiatry,2018,Annadora J Bruce-Keller; J Michael Salbaum; Hans-Rudolf Berthoud
28767318,The Gut Microbiome and Mental Health: Implications for Anxiety- and Trauma-Related Disorders.,"Biological psychiatry research has long focused on the brain in elucidating the neurobiological mechanisms of anxiety- and trauma-related disorders. This review challenges this assumption and suggests that the gut microbiome and its interactome also deserve attention to understand brain disorders and develop innovative treatments and diagnostics in the 21st century. The recent, in-depth characterization of the human microbiome spurred a paradigm shift in human health and disease. Animal models strongly suggest a role for the gut microbiome in anxiety- and trauma-related disorders. The microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis sits at the epicenter of this new approach to mental health. The microbiome plays an important role in the programming of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis early in life, and stress reactivity over the life span. In this review, we highlight emerging findings of microbiome research in psychiatric disorders, focusing on anxiety- and trauma-related disorders specifically, and discuss the gut microbiome as a potential therapeutic target. 16S rRNA sequencing has enabled researchers to investigate and compare microbial composition between individuals. The functional microbiome can be studied using methods involving metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metaproteomics, and metabolomics, as discussed in the present review. Other factors that shape the gut microbiome should be considered to obtain a holistic view of the factors at play in the complex interactome linked to the MGB. In all, we underscore the importance of microbiome science, and gut microbiota in particular, as emerging critical players in mental illness and maintenance of mental health. This new frontier of biological psychiatry and postgenomic medicine should be embraced by the mental health community as it plays an ever-increasing transformative role in integrative and holistic health research in the next decade.",Omics : a journal of integrative biology,2018,Stefanie Malan-Muller; Mireia Valles-Colomer; Jeroen Raes; Christopher A Lowry; Soraya Seedat; Sian M J Hemmings
28624847,The microbiome-gut-brain axis: implications for schizophrenia and antipsychotic induced weight gain.,"With the emergence of knowledge implicating the human gut microbiome in the development and regulation of several physiological systems, evidence has accumulated to suggest a role for the gut microbiome in psychiatric conditions and drug response. A complex relationship between the enteric nervous system, the gut microbiota and the central nervous system has been described which allows for the microbiota to influence and respond to a variety of behaviors and psychiatric conditions. Additionally, the use of pharmaceuticals may interact with and alter the microbiota to potentially contribute to adverse effects of the drug. The gut microbiota has been described in several psychiatric disorders including depression and anxiety, but only a few reports have discussed the role of the microbiome in schizophrenia. The following review examines the evidence surrounding the gut microbiota in behavior and psychiatric illness, the role of the microbiota in schizophrenia and the potential for antipsychotics to alter the gut microbiota and promote adverse metabolic events.",European archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience,2018,S Kanji; T M Fonseka; V S Marshe; V Sriretnakumar; M K Hahn; D J Müller
28442250,Analysis of microbiota in first episode psychosis identifies preliminary associations with symptom severity and treatment response.,"The effects of gut microbiota on the central nervous system, along its possible role in mental disorders, have received increasing attention. Here we investigated differences in fecal microbiota between 28 patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP) and 16 healthy matched controls and explored whether such differences were associated with response after up to 12months of treatment. Numbers of Lactobacillus group bacteria were elevated in FEP-patients and significantly correlated with severity along different symptom domains. A subgroup of FEP patients with the strongest microbiota differences also showed poorer response after up to 12months of treatment. The present findings support the involvement of microbiota alterations in psychotic illness and may provide the basis for exploring the benefit of their modulation on treatment response and remission.",Schizophrenia research,2018,Emanuel Schwarz; Johanna Maukonen; Tiina Hyytiäinen; Tuula Kieseppä; Matej Orešič; Sarven Sabunciyan; Outi Mantere; Maria Saarela; Robert Yolken; Jaana Suvisaari
29249803,Possible role of the gut microbiota-brain axis in the antidepressant effects of (R)-ketamine in a social defeat stress model.,"Accumulating evidence suggests that the gut microbiota-brain axis plays a role in the pathogenesis of depression, thereby contributing to the antidepressant actions of certain compounds. (R)-ketamine has a greater potency and longer-lasting antidepressant effects than (S)-ketamine. Here, we investigated whether the gut microbiota plays a role in the antidepressant effects of these two ketamine enantiomers. The role of the gut microbiota in the antidepressant effects of ketamine enantiomers in a chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) model of depression was examined using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing of fecal samples. At the phylum level, CSDS-susceptible mice showed alterations in the levels of Tenericutes and Actinobacteria; however, neither ketamine enantiomers influenced these alterations. At the class level, both ketamine enantiomers significantly attenuated the increase in the levels of Deltaproteobacteria in the susceptible mice after CSDS. Furthermore, (R)-ketamine, but not (S)-ketamine, significantly attenuated the reduction in the levels of Mollicutes in the susceptible mice. At the genus level, both ketamine enantiomers significantly attenuated the decrease in the levels of Butyricimonas in the susceptible mice. Notably, (R)-ketamine was more potent than (S)-ketamine at reducing the levels of Butyricimonas in the susceptible mice. In conclusion, this study suggests that the antidepressant effects of two enantiomers of ketamine in CSDS model may be partly mediated by the restoration of the gut microbiota. Furthermore, the specific effect of (R)-ketamine on the levels of Mollicutes and Butyricimonas may explain its robust antidepressant action.",Translational psychiatry,2017,Chun Yang; Youge Qu; Yuko Fujita; Qian Ren; Min Ma; Chao Dong; Kenji Hashimoto
29276734,Stress & the gut-brain axis: Regulation by the microbiome.,"The importance of the gut-brain axis in regulating stress-related responses has long been appreciated. More recently, the microbiota has emerged as a key player in the control of this axis, especially during conditions of stress provoked by real or perceived homeostatic challenge. Diet is one of the most important modifying factors of the microbiota-gut-brain axis. The routes of communication between the microbiota and brain are slowly being unravelled, and include the vagus nerve, gut hormone signaling, the immune system, tryptophan metabolism, and microbial metabolites such as short chain fatty acids. The importance of the early life gut microbiota in shaping later health outcomes also is emerging. Results from preclinical studies indicate that alterations of the early microbial composition by way of antibiotic exposure, lack of breastfeeding, birth by Caesarean section, infection, stress exposure, and other environmental influences - coupled with the influence of host genetics - can result in long-term modulation of stress-related physiology and behaviour. The gut microbiota has been implicated in a variety of stress-related conditions including anxiety, depression and irritable bowel syndrome, although this is largely based on animal studies or correlative analysis in patient populations. Additional research in humans is sorely needed to reveal the relative impact and causal contribution of the microbiome to stress-related disorders. In this regard, the concept of psychobiotics is being developed and refined to encompass methods of targeting the microbiota in order to positively impact mental health outcomes. At the 2016 Neurobiology of Stress Workshop in Newport Beach, CA, a group of experts presented the symposium ""The Microbiome: Development, Stress, and Disease"". This report summarizes and builds upon some of the key concepts in that symposium within the context of how microbiota might influence the neurobiology of stress.",Neurobiology of stress,2017,Jane A Foster; Linda Rinaman; John F Cryan
27900676,Functional Implications of the IL-23/IL-17 Immune Axis in Schizophrenia.,"The aetiology of schizophrenia seems to stem from complex interactions amongst environmental, genetic, metabolic, immunologic and oxidative components. Chronic low-grade inflammation has been persistently linked to schizophrenia, and this has primarily been based on the findings derived from Th1/Th2 cytokine balance. While the IL-23/IL-17 axis plays crucial role in the pathogenesis of several immune-mediated disorders, it has remained relatively unexplored in neuropsychiatric disorders. Altered levels of cytokines related to IL-23/IL-17 axis have been observed in schizophrenia patients in a few studies. In addition, other indirect factors known to confer schizophrenia risk like complement activation and altered gut microbiota are shown to modulate the IL-23/IL-17 axis. These preliminary observations provide crucial clues about the functional implications of IL-23/IL-17 axis in schizophrenia. In this review, an attempt has been made to highlight the biology of IL-23/IL-17 axis and its relevance to schizophrenia risk and pathogenesis. Given the pathogenic potential of the IL-23/IL-17 axis, therapeutic targeting of this axis may be a promising approach to benefit patients suffering from this devastating disorder.",Molecular neurobiology,2017,Monojit Debnath; Michael Berk
29213271,Visceral Inflammation and Immune Activation Stress the Brain.,"Stress refers to a dynamic process in which the homeostasis of an organism is challenged, the outcome depending on the type, severity, and duration of stressors involved, the stress responses triggered, and the stress resilience of the organism. Importantly, the relationship between stress and the immune system is bidirectional, as not only stressors have an impact on immune function, but alterations in immune function themselves can elicit stress responses. Such bidirectional interactions have been prominently identified to occur in the gastrointestinal tract in which there is a close cross-talk between the gut microbiota and the local immune system, governed by the permeability of the intestinal mucosa. External stressors disturb the homeostasis between microbiota and gut, these disturbances being signaled to the brain <i>via</i> multiple communication pathways constituting the gut-brain axis, ultimately eliciting stress responses and perturbations of brain function. In view of these relationships, the present article sets out to highlight some of the interactions between peripheral immune activation, especially in the visceral system, and brain function, behavior, and stress coping. These issues are exemplified by the way through which the intestinal microbiota as well as microbe-associated molecular patterns including lipopolysaccharide communicate with the immune system and brain, and the mechanisms whereby overt inflammation in the GI tract impacts on emotional-affective behavior, pain sensitivity, and stress coping. The interactions between the peripheral immune system and the brain take place along the gut-brain axis, the major communication pathways of which comprise microbial metabolites, gut hormones, immune mediators, and sensory neurons. Through these signaling systems, several transmitter and neuropeptide systems within the brain are altered under conditions of peripheral immune stress, enabling adaptive processes related to stress coping and resilience to take place. These aspects of the impact of immune stress on molecular and behavioral processes in the brain have a bearing on several disturbances of mental health and highlight novel opportunities of therapeutic intervention.",Frontiers in immunology,2017,Peter Holzer; Aitak Farzi; Ahmed M Hassan; Geraldine Zenz; Angela Jačan; Florian Reichmann
29147024,Comparison of (R)-ketamine and lanicemine on depression-like phenotype and abnormal composition of gut microbiota in a social defeat stress model.,"Accumulating evidence suggests a key role of the gut-microbiota-brain axis in the antidepressant actions of certain compounds. Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, showed rapid and sustained antidepressant effects in treatment-resistant depressed patients. In contrast, another NMDAR antagonist, lanicemine, did not exhibit antidepressant effects in such patients. (R)-ketamine, the (R)-enantiomer of ketamine, has rapid-acting and long-lasting antidepressant effects in rodent models of depression. Here we compared the effects of (R)-ketamine and lanicemine on depression-like phenotype and the composition of the gut microbiota in susceptible mice after chronic social defeat stress (CSDS). In behavioral tests, (R)-ketamine showed antidepressant effects in the susceptible mice, whereas lanicemine did not. The 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing of feces demonstrated that (R)-ketamine, but not lanicemine, significantly attenuated the altered levels of Bacteroidales, Clostridiales and Ruminococcaceae in the susceptible mice after CSDS. At the genus level, (R)-ketamine significantly attenuated the marked increase of Clostridium in the susceptible mice. In contrast, the effects of lanicemine were less potent than those of (R)-ketamine. This study suggests that the antidepressant effects of (R)-ketamine might be partly mediated by the restoration of altered compositions of the gut microbiota in a CSDS model.",Scientific reports,2017,Youge Qu; Chun Yang; Qian Ren; Min Ma; Chao Dong; Kenji Hashimoto
28899766,Health relevance of the modification of low grade inflammation in ageing (inflammageing) and the role of nutrition.,"Ageing of the global population has become a public health concern with an important socio-economic dimension. Ageing is characterized by an increase in the concentration of inflammatory markers in the bloodstream, a phenomenon that has been termed ""inflammageing"". The inflammatory response is beneficial as an acute, transient reaction to harmful conditions, facilitating the defense, repair, turnover and adaptation of many tissues. However, chronic and low grade inflammation is likely to be detrimental for many tissues and for normal functions. We provide an overview of low grade inflammation (LGI) and determine the potential drivers and the effects of the ""inflamed"" phenotype observed in the elderly. We discuss the role of gut microbiota and immune system crosstalk and the gut-brain axis. Then, we focus on major health complications associated with LGI in the elderly, including mental health and wellbeing, metabolic abnormalities and infections. Finally, we discuss the possibility of manipulating LGI in the elderly by nutritional interventions. We provide an overview of the evidence that exists in the elderly for omega-3 fatty acid, probiotic, prebiotic, antioxidant and polyphenol interventions as a means to influence LGI. We conclude that slowing, controlling or reversing LGI is likely to be an important way to prevent, or reduce the severity of, age-related functional decline and the onset of conditions affecting health and well-being; that there is evidence to support specific dietary interventions as a strategy to control LGI; and that a continued research focus on this field is warranted.",Ageing research reviews,2017,Philip C Calder; Nabil Bosco; Raphaëlle Bourdet-Sicard; Lucile Capuron; Nathalie Delzenne; Joel Doré; Claudio Franceschi; Markus J Lehtinen; Tobias Recker; Stefano Salvioli; Francesco Visioli
28716445,Feeding Systems and the Gut Microbiome: Gut-Brain Interactions With Relevance to Psychiatric Conditions.,"Physical and mental health is dependent on the environment, and feeding is a prime example of this environmental exchange. While the hypothalamus controls both feeding behavior and the stress response, the integration of the neural control centers and the peripheral gut allows for disruption in the gastrointestinal systems and dysfunctional communication to the brain.The purpose of this review is to familiarize clinicians with the physiology controlling feeding behavior and its implications for psychiatric conditions, such as anorexia nervosa and depression. Growing understanding of how integrated bacterial life is in the body has shown that gut bacteria regulate basic physiologic processes and are implicated in various disease states and contribute to regulation of mood. Responses to stress have effects on feeding behavior and mood and the regulation of the stress response by the gut microbiota could contribute to the dysfunction seen in patients with psychiatric illnesses.Gut microbiota may contribute to dysfunction in psychiatric illnesses. New opportunities to modulate existing gut microbiota using probiotics could be novel targets for clinical interventions.",Psychosomatics,2017,Brittany L Mason
28629758,Implications of the gut microbiota in vulnerability to the social avoidance effects of chronic social defeat in male mice.,"Appreciable evidence suggests that perturbations within the gut microbiome and the immune system may play a key role in the pathogenesis of depression stemming from earlier stressful experiences. In the present investigation we examined whether microbial changes in cecum contents were associated with social avoidance behaviors, a feature of depression, and pro-inflammatory variations among socially stressed mice. Male C57BL/6 mice experienced social defeat or a control condition once a day for 10 consecutive days. Social avoidance behaviors were examined three weeks after the last defeat or control episode and blood, brain, and cecum contents were collected 24h afterward for the determination of corticosterone, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and microbial populations. Mice that were most susceptible to the behavioral effects of chronic social defeat (reflected by severe social avoidance behaviors) displayed the greatest changes within particular sets of bacteria at the phylum and genus taxonomic ranks. Although plasma and brain cytokines were not significantly altered in socially defeated mice, changes in the mRNA expression of interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6 within the prefrontal cortex were associated with elevated abundance of Flavobacterium spp. and reduced abundance of Turicibacter spp., which were also strongly correlated to social avoidance severity. Although at this time a causal connection cannot be inferred, these results point to the possibility that specific clusters of bacterial communities in cecum contents may be linked to vulnerability to social deficits stemming from prolonged social stressor experiences.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2017,Joanna Kasia Szyszkowicz; Alex Wong; Hymie Anisman; Zul Merali; Marie-Claude Audet
28536926,Structural changes of gut microbiota in Parkinson's disease and its correlation with clinical features.,"The aim of this study was to compare the structure of gut microbiota in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and healthy controls; and to explore correlations between gut microbiota and PD clinical features. We analyzed fecal bacterial composition of 24 PD patients and 14 healthy volunteers by using 16S rRNA sequencing. There were significant differences between PD and healthy controls, as well as among different PD stages. The putative cellulose degrading bacteria from the genera Blautia (P=0.018), Faecalibacterium (P=0.048) and Ruminococcus (P=0.019) were significantly decreased in PD compared to healthy controls. The putative pathobionts from the genera Escherichia-Shigella (P=0.038), Streptococcus (P=0.01), Proteus (P=0.022), and Enterococcus (P=0.006) were significantly increased in PD subjects. Correlation analysis indicated that disease severity and PD duration negatively correlated with the putative cellulose degraders, and positively correlated with the putative pathobionts. The results suggest that structural changes of gut microbiota in PD are characterized by the decreases of putative cellulose degraders and the increases of putative pathobionts, which may potentially reduce the production of short chain fatty acids, and produce more endotoxins and neurotoxins; and these changes is potentially associated with the development of PD pathology.",Science China.

28593878,Microbiota abnormalities and the therapeutic potential of probiotics in the treatment of mood disorders.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD) are among the leading causes of burden and disability worldwide. Despite intensified research efforts to improve the treatment options and remission rates in mood disorders, no disease modifying treatment exists for these disorders. Accumulating evidence implicates the involvement of the gut microbiota in processes relevant to etiopathology of central nervous system-based disorders. The objective of this article was to critically evaluate the evidence supporting the link between gastrointestinal microbiota and mood disorders and to discuss the potential benefits of using probiotics in the treatment of MDD and BD. The concept of psychobiotics, which is bacterial-based interventions with mental health benefit, is emerging in the field.

We investigated the contribution of the maternal microbiota to the microbiota of infant gut and nose in the context of mode of delivery and feeding. Using 16S rRNA sequencing and specific qPCR, we profiled microbiota of 42 mother-infant pairs from the GUSTO birth cohort, at body sites including maternal vagina, rectum and skin; and infant stool and nose. In our study, overlap between maternal vaginal microbiota and infant faecal microbiota was minimal, while the similarity between maternal rectal microbiota and infant microbiota was more pronounced. However, an infant's nasal and gut microbiota were no more similar to that of its own mother, than to that of unrelated mothers. These findings were independent of delivery mode. We conclude that the transfer of maternal vaginal microbes play a minor role in seeding infant stool microbiota. Transfer of maternal rectal microbiota could play a larger role in seeding infant stool microbiota, but approaches other than the generally used analyses of community similarity measures are likely to be needed to quantify bacterial transmission. We confirmed the clear difference between microbiota of infants born by Caesarean section compared to vaginally delivered infants and the impact of feeding mode on infant gut microbiota. Only vaginally delivered, fully breastfed infants had gut microbiota dominated by Bifidobacteria. Our data suggest that reduced transfer of maternal vaginal microbial is not the main mechanism underlying the differential infant microbiota composition associated with Caesarean delivery. The sources of a large proportion of infant microbiota could not be identified in maternal microbiota, and the sources of seeding of infant gut and nasal microbiota remain to be elucidated.",Beneficial microbes,2017,O Sakwinska; F Foata; B Berger; H Brüssow; S Combremont; A Mercenier; S Dogra; S-E Soh; J C K Yen; G Y S Heong; Y S Lee; F Yap; M J Meaney; Y-S Chong; K M Godfrey; J D Holbrook
29023380,The Gut Microbiome Feelings of the Brain: A Perspective for Non-Microbiologists.,"<b>Objectives:</b> To comprehensively review the scientific knowledge on the gut-brain axis. <b>Methods:</b> Various publications on the gut-brain axis, until 31 July 2017, were screened using the Medline, Google, and Cochrane Library databases. The search was performed using the following keywords: ""gut-brain axis"", ""gut-microbiota-brain axis"", ""nutrition microbiome/microbiota"", ""enteric nervous system"", ""enteric glial cells/network"", ""gut-brain pathways"", ""microbiome immune system"", ""microbiome neuroendocrine system"" and ""intestinal/gut/enteric neuropeptides"". Relevant articles were selected and reviewed. <b>Results:</b> Tremendous progress has been made in exploring the interactions between nutrients, the microbiome, and the intestinal, epithelium-enteric nervous, endocrine and immune systems and the brain. The basis of the gut-brain axis comprises of an array of multichannel sensing and trafficking pathways that are suggested to convey the enteric signals to the brain. These are mediated by neuroanatomy (represented by the vagal and spinal afferent neurons), the neuroendocrine-hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (represented by the gut hormones), immune routes (represented by multiple cytokines), microbially-derived neurotransmitters, and finally the gate keepers of the intestinal and brain barriers. Their mutual and harmonious but intricate interaction is essential for human life and brain performance. However, a failure in the interaction leads to a number of inflammatory-, autoimmune-, neurodegenerative-, metabolic-, mood-, behavioral-, cognitive-, autism-spectrum-, stress- and pain-related disorders. The limited availability of information on the mechanisms, pathways and cause-and-effect relationships hinders us from translating and implementing the knowledge from the bench to the clinic. <b>Implications:</b> Further understanding of this intricate field might potentially shed light on novel preventive and therapeutic strategies to combat these disorders. Nutritional approaches, microbiome manipulations, enteric and brain barrier reinforcement and sensing and trafficking modulation might improve physical and mental health outcomes.",Microorganisms,2017,Aaron Lerner; Sandra Neidhöfer; Torsten Matthias
28976454,The Gut and Its Microbiome as Related to Central Nervous System Functioning and Psychological Well-being: Introduction to the Special Issue of Psychosomatic Medicine.,"Accumulating evidence indicates bidirectional associations between the brain and the gut microbiome with both top-down and bottom-up processes. This article describes new developments in brain-gut interactions as an introduction to a special issue of Psychosomatic Medicine, based on a joint symposium of the American Psychosomatic Society and the American Gastroenterological Association. Literature review articles indicate that several psychiatric disorders are associated with altered gut microbiota, whereas evidence linking functional gastrointestinal disorders and dysbiosis has not been firmly established. The association between dysbiosis with obesity, metabolic syndrome, and Type 2 diabetes mellitus is still inconclusive, but evidence suggests that bariatric surgery may favorably alter the gut microbial community structure. Consistent with the literature linking psychiatric disorders with dysbiosis is that life adversity during childhood and certain temperaments that develop early in life are associated with altered gut microbiota, particularly the Prevotella species. Some studies reported in this issue support the hypothesis that brain-gut interactions are adversely influenced by reduced functional activation of the hippocampus and autonomic nervous system dysregulation. The evidence for the effects of probiotics in the treatment of Clostridium difficile colitis is relatively well established, but effects on mental health and psychophysiological stress reactivity are either inconclusive or still in progress. To conceptualize brain-gut interactions, a holistic, systems-based perspective on health and disease is needed, integrating gut microbial with environmental ecology. More translational research is needed to examine the mental and physical health effects of prebiotics and probiotics, in well-phenotyped human populations with sufficiently large sample sizes.",Psychosomatic medicine,2017,Emeran A Mayer; Elaine Y Hsiao
28816544,Animal inflammation-based models of depression and their application to drug discovery.,"Depression, anxiety and other affective disorders are globally widespread and severely debilitating human brain diseases. Despite their high prevalence and mental health impact, affective pathogenesis is poorly understood, and often remains recurrent and resistant to treatment. The lack of efficient antidepressants and presently limited conceptual innovation necessitate novel approaches and new drug targets in the field of antidepressant therapy. Areas covered: Herein, the authors discuss the emerging role of neuro-immune interactions in affective pathogenesis, which can become useful targets for CNS drug discovery, including modulating neuroinflammatory pathways to alleviate affective pathogenesis. Expert opinion: Mounting evidence implicates microglia, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), glucocorticoids and gut microbiota in both inflammation and depression. It is suggested that novel antidepressants can be developed based on targeting microglia-, PUFAs-, glucocorticoid- and gut microbiota-mediated cellular pathways. In addition, the authors call for a wider application of novel model organisms, such as zebrafish, in studying shared, evolutionarily conserved (and therefore, core) neuro-immune mechanisms of depression.",Expert opinion on drug discovery,2017,Li Ma; Konstantin A Demin; Tatyana O Kolesnikova; Sergey L Khatsko; Xiaokang Zhu; Xiaodong Yuan; Cai Song; Darya A Meshalkina; Brian E Leonard; Li Tian; Allan V Kalueff
28806201,Brain-Gut-Microbiota Axis and Mental Health.,"The brain-gut-microbiota axis has been put forward as a new paradigm in neuroscience, which may be of relevance to mental illness. The mechanisms of signal transmission in the brain-gut-microbiota axis are complex and involve bidirectional communications that enable gut microbes to communicate with the brain and the brain to communicate with the microbes. This review assesses the potential usefulness and limitations of the paradigm.A selective literature review was conducted to evaluate the current knowledge in clinical and preclinical brain-gut-microbiota interactions as related to psychiatric disorders.Most published studies in the field are preclinical, and there is so far a lack of clinical studies. Preliminary studies in psychiatric populations support the view of a dysbiosis in some conditions, but studies are often small scale and marred by potential confounding variables. Preclinical studies support the view that psychobiotics (""bacteria which when ingested in adequate amounts have a positive mental health benefit"") might be of use in treating some patients with mental health difficulties. To date, we have no well-conducted studies in clinical populations, although there are some studies in healthy volunteers. A cocktail of probiotics has been shown to alter brain activity as monitored by functional magnetic resonance imaging, and Bifidobacterium longum was reported to alter brain electrical activity.It has yet to be convincingly demonstrated that the exciting findings of psychobiotic efficacy demonstrated in preclinical models of psychiatric illness will translate to patients.",Psychosomatic medicine,2017,Timothy G Dinan; John F Cryan
29071061,Gut microbiota's effect on mental health: The gut-brain axis.,"The bidirectional communication between the central nervous system and gut microbiota, referred to as the gut-brain-axis, has been of significant interest in recent years. Increasing evidence has associated gut microbiota to both gastrointestinal and extragastrointestinal diseases. Dysbiosis and inflammation of the gut have been linked to causing several mental illnesses including anxiety and depression, which are prevalent in society today. Probiotics have the ability to restore normal microbial balance, and therefore have a potential role in the treatment and prevention of anxiety and depression. This review aims to discuss the development of the gut microbiota, the linkage of dysbiosis to anxiety and depression, and possible applications of probiotics to reduce symptoms.",Clinics and practice,2017,Megan Clapp; Nadia Aurora; Lindsey Herrera; Manisha Bhatia; Emily Wilen; Sarah Wakefield
28852308,Influence of gut microbiota on neuropsychiatric disorders.,"The last decade has witnessed a growing appreciation of the fundamental role played by an early assembly of a diverse and balanced gut microbiota and its subsequent maintenance for future health of the host. Gut microbiota is currently viewed as a key regulator of a fluent bidirectional dialogue between the gut and the brain (gut-brain axis). A number of preclinical studies have suggested that the microbiota and its genome (microbiome) may play a key role in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, alterations in the gut microbiota composition in humans have also been linked to a variety of neuropsychiatric conditions, including depression, autism and Parkinson's disease. However, it is not yet clear whether these changes in the microbiome are causally related to such diseases or are secondary effects thereof. In this respect, recent studies in animals have indicated that gut microbiota transplantation can transfer a behavioral phenotype, suggesting that the gut microbiota may be a modifiable factor modulating the development or pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric conditions. Further studies are warranted to establish whether or not the findings of preclinical animal experiments can be generalized to humans. Moreover, although different communication routes between the microbiota and brain have been identified, further studies must elucidate all the underlying mechanisms involved. Such research is expected to contribute to the design of strategies to modulate the gut microbiota and its functions with a view to improving mental health, and thus provide opportunities to improve the management of psychiatric diseases. Here, we review the evidence supporting a role of the gut microbiota in neuropsychiatric disorders and the state of the art regarding the mechanisms underlying its contribution to mental illness and health. We also consider the stages of life where the gut microbiota is more susceptible to the effects of environmental stressors, and the possible microbiota-targeted intervention strategies that could improve health status and prevent psychiatric disorders in the near future.",World journal of gastroenterology,2017,María Carmen Cenit; Yolanda Sanz; Pilar Codoñer-Franch
28027925,Impact of prebiotics on metabolic and behavioral alterations in a mouse model of metabolic syndrome.,"Mounting evidence shows that the gut microbiota, an important player within the gut-brain communication axis, can affect metabolism, inflammation, brain function and behavior. Interestingly, gut microbiota composition is known to be altered in patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS), who also often display neuropsychiatric symptoms. The use of prebiotics, which beneficially alters the microbiota, may therefore be a promising way to potentially improve physical and mental health in MetS patients. This hypothesis was tested in a mouse model of MetS, namely the obese and type-2 diabetic db/db mice, which display emotional and cognitive alterations associated with changes in gut microbiota composition and hippocampal inflammation compared to their lean db/+ littermates. We assessed the impact of chronic administration (8weeks) of prebiotics (oligofructose) on both metabolic (body weight, food intake, glucose homeostasis) and behavioral (increased anxiety-like behavior and impaired spatial memory) alterations characterizing db/db mice, as well as related neurobiological correlates, with particular attention to neuroinflammatory processes. Prebiotic administration improved excessive food intake and glycemic dysregulations (glucose tolerance and insulin resistance) in db/db mice. This was accompanied by an increase of plasma anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 levels and hypothalamic mRNA expression of the anorexigenic cytokine IL-1β, whereas unbalanced mRNA expression of hypothalamic orexigenic (NPY) and anorexigenic (CART, POMC) peptides was unchanged. We also detected signs of improved blood-brain-barrier integrity in the hypothalamus of oligofructose-treated db/db mice (normalized expression of tight junction proteins ZO-1 and occludin). On the contrary, prebiotic administration did not improve behavioral alterations and associated reduction of hippocampal neurogenesis displayed by db/db mice, despite normalization of increased hippocampal IL-6 mRNA expression. Of note, we found a relationship between the effect of treatment on dentate gyrus neurons and spatial memory. These findings may prove valuable for introducing novel approaches to treat some of the comorbidities associated with MetS.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2017,Lourdes Fernández de Cossío; Célia Fourrier; Julie Sauvant; Amandine Everard; Lucile Capuron; Patrice D Cani; Sophie Layé; Nathalie Castanon
28399458,The role of maternal anxiety and depressive disorders prior to and during pregnancy and perinatal psychopathological symptoms for early infant diseases and drug administration.,"Maternal mental health prior to and during pregnancy has been shown to be associated with inflammatory diseases and gastrointestinal complaints in the offspring. Unfortunately, many studies merely focused on perinatal distress without consideration of lifetime anxiety and depressive disorders.To prospectively investigate associations of anxiety and depressive disorders prior to and during pregnancy as well as perinatal distress with infants' inflammatory diseases, gastrointestinal complaints and corresponding drug administration.Prospective-longitudinal study initiated in 2009/2010.N=306 (expectant) mothers with and without DSM-IV lifetime anxiety and depressive disorders (Composite International Diagnostic Interview for Women) and low vs. high severity of psychopathological symptoms during pregnancy (Brief Symptom Inventory) enrolled in early pregnancy and repeatedly assessed during peripartum period.Infant inflammatory diseases, gastrointestinal complaints and drug administration assessed via questionnaire (maternal report) at four months postpartum (n=279).Severe psychopathological symptoms during pregnancy were associated with inflammatory diseases and anti-infective medication, whereas anxiety and depressive disorders prior to and during pregnancy were related to gastrointestinal complaints (diarrhea, colic complaints) and corresponding medication.These results have to be discussed with caution, because information on infants' diseases were based exclusively on maternal self-reports. However, they suggest promising directions regarding our current knowledge about the relevance of maternal perinatal distress for infant inflammatory diseases (e.g. fetal programming). Moreover, the association between maternal anxiety and depressive disorders and infant gastrointestinal complaints may be explained by an anxious misinterpretation of 'normal' infant signals or a transmission of adverse gut microbiota, respectively.",Early human development,2017,Linda Krause; Franziska Einsle; Johanna Petzoldt; Hans-Ulrich Wittchen; Julia Martini
28556833,Blockade of interleukin-6 receptor in the periphery promotes rapid and sustained antidepressant actions: a possible role of gut-microbiota-brain axis.,"Depression is a common, severe and chronic psychiatric disease. Although the currently available antidepressants have been used in the treatment of depression, their beneficial effects are limited. Accumulating evidence suggests that pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) have an important role in the pathogenesis of depression. This study was undertaken to examine whether anti-mouse IL-6 receptor antibody (MR16-1) induces antidepressant effects in a social defeat stress model. Intravenous injection of MR16-1 induced rapid-onset and long-lasting antidepressant effects in susceptible mice after social defeat stress through its anti-inflammatory actions. In contrast, intracerebroventricular injection of MR16-1 induced no antidepressant effects in susceptible mice. Furthermore, treatment with MR16-1 could significantly normalize alterations in the expression of synaptic proteins (postsynaptic density protein 95 and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor 1) and dendritic spine density in the brain regions of susceptible mice. Gut microbiota analysis using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing showed that MR16-1 significantly improved decreased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in susceptible mice. It also significantly improved decreased levels of Oscillospira in susceptible mice. These findings suggest that peripheral IL-6 has a key role in the pathogenesis of depression and that the blockade of IL-6 receptor in the periphery might have rapid-onset and long-lasting antidepressant effects by normalizing the altered composition of gut microbiota in susceptible mice after social defeat stress. Therefore, the blockade of IL-6 receptor in the periphery shows promise as a novel therapeutic approach for depressed patients with higher IL-6 blood levels.",Translational psychiatry,2017,J-C Zhang; W Yao; C Dong; C Yang; Q Ren; M Ma; K Hashimoto
28368029,Bifidobacterium in the gut microbiota confer resilience to chronic social defeat stress in mice.,"Accumulating evidence suggests that abnormalities in the composition of the gut microbiota may play a role in the pathogenesis of depression. Although approximately 30% mice are resilient to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS), the role of gut microbiota in this stress resilience is unknown. In this study, male C57BL/6 mice were exposed to a different CD1 aggressor mouse for 10 min on 10 consecutive days. A social interaction test was applied to distinguish between resilient and susceptible mice. Using 16S rRNA analysis, we examined the composition of gut microbiota in feces from control, resilient, and susceptible mice. The marked appearance of Bifidobacterium was detected in the resilient mice, whereas in the control and susceptible mice, Bifidobacterium were below the detection limit. Oral intake of Bifidobacterium significantly increased the number of resilient mice after CSDS compared with vehicle-treated mice. These findings suggest that Bifidobacterium may confer resilience to CSDS. Therefore, supplementation of Bifidobacterium may prevent the onset of depression from stress in humans. In addition, supplementation of Bifidobacterium may prevent or minimize relapse from remission induced by inflammation and/or stress in depressed patients.",Scientific reports,2017,Chun Yang; Yuko Fujita; Qian Ren; Min Ma; Chao Dong; Kenji Hashimoto

We aimed to explore the effect of chronic alcohol overconsumption on gut microbial metabolism, as assessed by evaluating <sup>13</sup>C-D-xylose breath test results. <b>Materials and methods</b>: We investigated all <sup>13</sup>C-D-xylose breath tests performed at Lovisenberg Diaconal Hospital during the years 2005 to 2011, using patient files for diagnosing the patients into one of three patient categories: alcohol overconsumption, coeliac disease and functional bowel disorder. In addition, a group of healthy controls was included. The time curves of <sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> excretion in breath samples were divided into two phases, evaluating small intestinal absorption (0-60 min) and colonic microbial metabolism (90-240 min), respectively. <b>Results</b>: A total of 719 patients underwent <sup>13</sup>C-D-xylose breath testing during the inclusion period. Thirty-five had a history of alcohol overconsumption, 66 had coeliac disease, and 216 had a functional bowel disorder, while 44 healthy controls were included for comparison. The alcohol overconsumption group had similar small intestinal phase results as the group of patients with untreated coeliac disease. During the colonic phase, the group of patients with alcohol overconsumption differed from all the other groups in terms of <sup>13</sup>C-xylose recovery, with significantly less <sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> excretion compared to the other groups. <b>Conclusion</b>: The results suggest that patients with a history of alcohol overconsumption suffer from both small intestinal malabsorption and impaired colonic microbial metabolism.

Many lay publications enthusiastically tout the potential health benefits of an optimized microbiome — or conversely, the risks of dysbiosis. Depression, stress, anxiety and autism are all proposed to be at least partially sensitive to manipulation of the gut microbiome. Studies have suggested that a variety of conditions are influenced by the microbiome, including obesity, functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, chronic fatigue syndrome and inflammatory illnesses.

28158162,Potential Beneficial Effects of Probiotics on Human Migraine Headache: A Literature Review.,"Recent studies have shown that migraine headache is often associated with concomitant gastrointestinal diseases. There is a higher prevalence of headaches in patients with gastrointestinal disorders. These associations between migraine and gastrointestinal disorders suggest a potential link to a bidirectional modulation of gut microbiota and brain function. The underlying working mechanistic links between migraine and gastrointestinal diseases may include increased intestinal epithelial permeability and inflammation.This review presents an overview of the relationship between gut microbiota and brain function, especially with regard to migraine headache.Literature review.Anesthesia and Operation Center, Department of Anesthesiology, Chinese PLA General Hospital.The present investigation included a PubMed search using the following terms: migraine headache, gut microbiota, brain function, and probiotics.In this literature review, we mainly discussed the relationship between gut microbiota and brain function, especially with regard to migraine headache.

27763700,Early life diets with prebiotics and bioactive milk fractions attenuate the impact of stress on learned helplessness behaviours and alter gene expression within neural circuits important for stress resistance.,"Manipulating gut microbes may improve mental health. Prebiotics are indigestible compounds that increase the growth and activity of health-promoting microorganisms, yet few studies have examined how prebiotics affect CNS function. Using an acute inescapable stressor known to produce learned helplessness behaviours such as failure to escape and exaggerated fear, we tested whether early life supplementation of a blend of two prebiotics, galactooligosaccharide (GOS) and polydextrose (PDX), and the glycoprotein lactoferrin (LAC) would attenuate behavioural and biological responses to stress later in life. Juvenile, male F344 rats were fed diets containing either GOS and PDX alone, LAC alone, or GOS, PDX and LAC. All diets altered gut bacteria, while diets containing GOS and PDX increased Lactobacillus spp. After 4 weeks, rats were exposed to inescapable stress, and either immediately killed for blood and tissues, or assessed for learned helplessness 24 h later. Diets did not attenuate stress effects on spleen weight, corticosterone and blood glucose; however, all diets differentially attenuated stress-induced learned helplessness. Notably, in situ hybridization revealed that all diets reduced stress-evoked cfos mRNA in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), a structure important for learned helplessness behaviours. In addition, GOS, PDX and LAC diet attenuated stress-evoked decreases in mRNA for the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> autoreceptor in the DRN and increased basal BDNF mRNA within the prefrontal cortex. These data suggest early life diets containing prebiotics and/or LAC promote behavioural stress resistance and uniquely modulate gene expression in corresponding circuits.",The European journal of neuroscience,2017,Agnieszka Mika; Heidi E W Day; Alexander Martinez; Nicole L Rumian; Benjamin N Greenwood; Maciej Chichlowski; Brian M Berg; Monika Fleshner
28121994,"Diet and ADHD, Reviewing the Evidence: A Systematic Review of Meta-Analyses of Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trials Evaluating the Efficacy of Diet Interventions on the Behavior of Children with ADHD.","Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a debilitating mental health problem hampering the child's development. The underlying causes include both genetic and environmental factors and may differ between individuals. The efficacy of diet treatments in ADHD was recently evaluated in three reviews, reporting divergent and confusing conclusions based on heterogeneous studies and subjects. To address this inconsistency we conducted a systematic review of meta-analyses of double-blind placebo-controlled trials evaluating the effect of diet interventions (elimination and supplementation) on ADHD.Our literature search resulted in 14 meta-analyses, six of which confined to double-blind placebo-controlled trials applying homogeneous diet interventions, i.e. artificial food color (AFC) elimination, a few-foods diet (FFD) and poly-unsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation. Effect sizes (ES) and Confidence intervals (CI) of study outcomes were depicted in a forest plot. I2 was calculated to assess heterogeneity if necessary and additional random effects subgroup meta-regression was conducted if substantial heterogeneity was present.The AFC ESs were 0.44 (95% CI: 0.16-0.72, I2 = 11%) and 0.21 (95% CI: -0.02-0.43, I2 = 68%) [parent ratings], 0.08 (95% CI: -0.07-0.24, I2 = 0%) [teacher ratings] and 0.11 (95% CI: -0.13-0.34, I2 = 12%) [observer ratings]. The FFD ESs were 0.80 (95% CI: 0.41-1.19, I2 = 61%) [parent ratings] and 0.51 (95% CI: -0.02-1.04, I2 = 72%) [other ratings], while the PUFA ESs were 0.17 (95% CI: -0.03-0.38, I2 = 38%) [parent ratings], -0.05 (95% CI: -0.27-0.18, I2 = 0%) [teacher ratings] and 0.16 (95% CI: 0.01-0.31, I2 = 0%) [parent and teacher ratings]. Three meta-analyses (two FFD and one AFC) resulted in high I2 without presenting subgroup results. The FFD meta-analyses provided sufficient data to perform subgroup analyses on intervention type, resulting in a decrease of heterogeneity to 0% (diet design) and 37.8% (challenge design).Considering the small average ESs PUFA supplementation is unlikely to provide a tangible contribution to ADHD treatment, while further research is required for AFC elimination before advising this intervention as ADHD treatment. The average FFD ES is substantial, offering treatment opportunities in subgroups of children with ADHD not responding to or too young for medication. Further FFD research should focus on establishing the underlying mechanisms of food (e.g. incrimination of gut microbiota) to simplify the FFD approach in children with ADHD.",PloS one,2017,Lidy M Pelsser; Klaas Frankena; Jan Toorman; Rob Rodrigues Pereira
28073356,Gut microbiota disturbance during helminth infection: can it affect cognition and behaviour of children?,"Bidirectional signalling between the brain and the gastrointestinal tract is regulated at neural, hormonal, and immunological levels. Recent studies have shown that helminth infections can alter the normal gut microbiota. Studies have also shown that the gut microbiota is instrumental in the normal development, maturation and function of the brain. The pathophysiological pathways by which helminth infections contribute to altered cognitive function remain poorly understood.We put forward the hypothesis that gastrointestinal infections with parasitic worms, such as helminths, induce an imbalance of the gut-brain axis, which, in turn, can detrimentally manifest in brain development. Factors supporting this hypothesis are: 1) research focusing on intelligence and school performance in school-aged children has shown helminth infections to be associated with cognitive impairment, 2) disturbances in gut microbiota have been shown to be associated with important cognitive developmental effects, and 3) helminth infections have been shown to alter the gut microbiota structure. Evidence on the complex interactions between extrinsic (parasite) and intrinsic (host-derived) factors has been synthesised and discussed. While evidence in favour of the helminth-gut microbiota-central nervous system hypothesis is circumstantial, it would be unwise to rule it out as a possible mechanism by which gastrointestinal helminth infections induce childhood cognitive morbidity. Further empirical studies are necessary to test an indirect effect of helminth infections on the modulation of mood and behaviour through its effects on the gut microbiota.",BMC infectious diseases,2017,Vanina Guernier; Bradley Brennan; Laith Yakob; Gabriel Milinovich; Archie C A Clements; Ricardo J Soares Magalhaes

27319972,"Microbes, Immunity, and Behavior: Psychoneuroimmunology Meets the Microbiome.","There is now a large volume of evidence to support the view that the immune system is a key communication pathway between the gut and brain, which plays an important role in stress-related psychopathologies and thus provides a potentially fruitful target for psychotropic intervention. The gut microbiota is a complex ecosystem with a diverse range of organisms and a sophisticated genomic structure. Bacteria within the gut are estimated to weigh in excess of 1 kg in the adult human and the microbes within not only produce antimicrobial peptides, short chain fatty acids, and vitamins, but also most of the common neurotransmitters found in the human brain. That the microbial content of the gut plays a key role in immune development is now beyond doubt. Early disruption of the host-microbe interplay can have lifelong consequences, not just in terms of intestinal function but in distal organs including the brain. It is clear that the immune system and nervous system are in continuous communication in order to maintain a state of homeostasis. Significant gaps in knowledge remain about the effect of the gut microbiota in coordinating the immune-nervous systems dialogue. However, studies using germ-free animals, infective models, prebiotics, probiotics, and antibiotics have increased our understanding of the interplay. Early life stress can have a lifelong impact on the microbial content of the intestine and permanently alter immune functioning. That early life stress can also impact adult psychopathology has long been appreciated in psychiatry. The challenge now is to fully decipher the molecular mechanisms that link the gut microbiota, immune, and central nervous systems in a network of communication that impacts behavior patterns and psychopathology, to eventually translate these findings to the human situation both in health and disease. Even at this juncture, there is evidence to pinpoint key sites of communication where gut microbial interventions either with drugs or diet or perhaps fecal microbiota transplantation may positively impact mental health.",Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,2017,Timothy G Dinan; John F Cryan
27930574,A MeSH-based text mining method for identifying novel prebiotics.,"Prebiotics contribute to the well-being of their host by altering the composition of the gut microbiota. Discovering new prebiotics is a challenging and arduous task due to strict inclusion criteria; thus, highly limited numbers of prebiotic candidates have been identified. Notably, the large numbers of published studies may contain substantial information attached to various features of known prebiotics that can be used to predict new candidates. In this paper, we propose a medical subject headings (MeSH)-based text mining method for identifying new prebiotics with structured texts obtained from PubMed. We defined an optimal feature set for prebiotics prediction using a systematic feature-ranking algorithm with which a variety of carbohydrates can be accurately classified into different clusters in accordance with their chemical and biological attributes. The optimal feature set was used to separate positive prebiotics from other carbohydrates, and a cross-validation procedure was employed to assess the prediction accuracy of the model. Our method achieved a specificity of 0.876 and a sensitivity of 0.838. Finally, we identified a high-confidence list of candidates of prebiotics that are strongly supported by the literature. Our study demonstrates that text mining from high-volume biomedical literature is a promising approach in searching for new prebiotics.",Medicine,2016,Guangyu Shan; Yiming Lu; Bo Min; Wubin Qu; Chenggang Zhang

Germ-free animals, antibiotics, probiotics intervention and diet can induce alterations of gut microbiota and gut physiology and also host cognitive behavior, increasing or decreasing risks of AD. The increased permeability of intestine and blood-brain barrier induced by gut microbiota disturbance will increase the incidence of neurodegeneration disorders. Gut microbial metabolites and their effects on host neurochemical changes may increase or decrease the risk of AD. Pathogenic microbes infection will also increase the risk of AD, and meanwhile, the onset of AD support the ""hygiene hypothesis"". All the results suggest that AD may begin in the gut, and is closely related to the imbalance of gut microbiota. Modulation of gut microbiota through personalized diet or beneficial microbiota intervention will probably become a new treatment for AD.",Science China. Life sciences,2016,Xu Hu; Tao Wang; Feng Jin
27698624,Integrative Therapies in Anxiety Treatment with Special Emphasis on the Gut Microbiome.,"Over the past decade, research has shown that diet and gut health affects symptoms expressed in stress related disorders, depression, and anxiety through changes in the gut microbiota. Psycho-behavioral function and somatic health interaction have often been ignored in health care with resulting deficits in treatment quality and outcomes. While mental health care requires the professional training in counseling, psychotherapy and psychiatry, complimentary therapeutic strategies, such as attention to a nutritional and diverse diet and supplementation of probiotic foods, may be integrated alongside psychotherapy treatment models. Development of these alternative strategies is predicated on experimental evidence and diligent research on the biology of stress, fear, anxiety-related behaviors, and the gut-brain connection. This article provides a brief overview on biological markers of anxiety and the expanding nutritional literature relating to brain health and mental disorders. A case study demonstrates an example of a biopsychosocial approach integrating cognitive psychotherapy, dietary changes, and mindfulness activities, in treating symptoms of anxiety. This case study shows a possible treatment protocol to explore the efficacy of targeting the gut-brain-axis that may be used as an impetus for future controlled studies.",The Yale journal of biology and medicine,2016,Stephanie L Schnorr; Harriet A Bachner
25034760,"Autoimmune diseases, gastrointestinal disorders and the microbiome in schizophrenia: more than a gut feeling.","Autoimmunity, gastrointestinal (GI) disorders and schizophrenia have been associated with one another for a long time. This paper reviews these connections and provides a context by which multiple risk factors for schizophrenia may be related. Epidemiological studies strongly link schizophrenia with autoimmune disorders including enteropathic celiac disease. Exposure to wheat gluten and bovine milk casein also contribute to non-celiac food sensitivities in susceptible individuals. Co-morbid GI inflammation accompanies humoral immunity to food antigens, occurs early during the course of schizophrenia and appears to be independent from antipsychotic-generated motility effects. This inflammation impacts endothelial barrier permeability and can precipitate translocation of gut bacteria into systemic circulation. Infection by the neurotropic gut pathogen, Toxoplasma gondii, will elicit an inflammatory GI environment. Such processes trigger innate immunity, including activation of complement C1q, which also functions at synapses in the brain. The emerging field of microbiome research lies at the center of these interactions with evidence that the abundance and diversity of resident gut microbiota contribute to digestion, inflammation, gut permeability and behavior. Dietary modifications of core bacterial compositions may explain inefficient gluten digestion and how immigrant status in certain situations is a risk factor for schizophrenia. Gut microbiome research in schizophrenia is in its infancy, but data in related fields suggest disease-associated altered phylogenetic compositions. In summary, this review surveys associative and experimental data linking autoimmunity, GI activity and schizophrenia, and proposes that understanding of disrupted biological pathways outside of the brain can lend valuable information regarding pathogeneses of complex, polygenic brain disorders.",Schizophrenia research,2016,Emily G Severance; Robert H Yolken; William W Eaton
26923630,Cognitive impairment by antibiotic-induced gut dysbiosis: Analysis of gut microbiota-brain communication.,"Emerging evidence indicates that disruption of the gut microbial community (dysbiosis) impairs mental health. Germ-free mice and antibiotic-induced gut dysbiosis are two approaches to establish causality in gut microbiota-brain relationships. However, both models have limitations, as germ-free mice display alterations in blood-brain barrier and brain ultrastructure and antibiotics may act directly on the brain. We hypothesized that the concerns related to antibiotic-induced gut dysbiosis can only adequately be addressed if the effect of intragastric treatment of adult mice with multiple antibiotics on (i) gut microbial community, (ii) metabolite profile in the colon, (iii) circulating metabolites, (iv) expression of neuronal signaling molecules in distinct brain areas and (v) cognitive behavior is systematically investigated. Of the antibiotics used (ampicillin, bacitracin, meropenem, neomycin, vancomycin), ampicillin had some oral bioavailability but did not enter the brain. 16S rDNA sequencing confirmed antibiotic-induced microbial community disruption, and metabolomics revealed that gut dysbiosis was associated with depletion of bacteria-derived metabolites in the colon and alterations of lipid species and converted microbe-derived molecules in the plasma. Importantly, novel object recognition, but not spatial, memory was impaired in antibiotic-treated mice. This cognitive deficit was associated with brain region-specific changes in the expression of cognition-relevant signaling molecules, notably brain-derived neurotrophic factor, N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subunit 2B, serotonin transporter and neuropeptide Y system. We conclude that circulating metabolites and the cerebral neuropeptide Y system play an important role in the cognitive impairment and dysregulation of cerebral signaling molecules due to antibiotic-induced gut dysbiosis.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2016,Esther E Fröhlich; Aitak Farzi; Raphaela Mayerhofer; Florian Reichmann; Angela Jačan; Bernhard Wagner; Erwin Zinser; Natalie Bordag; Christoph Magnes; Eleonore Fröhlich; Karl Kashofer; Gregor Gorkiewicz; Peter Holzer
26810963,Dietary fiber intake and depressive symptoms in Japanese employees: The Furukawa Nutrition and Health Study.,"Dietary fiber may play a favorable role in mood through gut microbiota, but epidemiologic evidence linking mood to dietary fiber intake is scarce in free-living populations. We investigated cross-sectionally the associations of dietary intakes of total, soluble, insoluble, and sources of fiber with depressive symptoms among Japanese workers.Participants were 1977 employees ages 19-69 y. Dietary intake was assessed via a validated, brief self-administered diet history questionnaire. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios of depressive symptoms adjusted for a range of dietary and non-dietary potential confounders.Dietary fiber intake from vegetables and fruits was significantly inversely associated with depressive symptoms. The multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for the lowest through the highest tertile of vegetable and fruit fiber were 1.00 (reference), 0.80 (0.60-1.05), and 0.65 (0.45-0.95), respectively (P for trend = 0.03). Dietary intake of total, soluble, insoluble, and cereal fiber was not associated with depressive symptoms.Higher dietary fiber intake from vegetables and fruits may be associated with lower likelihood of having depressive symptoms.","Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)",2016,Takako Miki; Masafumi Eguchi; Kayo Kurotani; Takeshi Kochi; Keisuke Kuwahara; Rie Ito; Yasumi Kimura; Hiroko Tsuruoka; Shamima Akter; Ikuko Kashino; Isamu Kabe; Norito Kawakami; Tetsuya Mizoue
26438800,Gut Microbiota and Brain Function: An Evolving Field in Neuroscience.,"There is a growing appreciation of the importance of gut microbiota to health and disease. This has been driven by advances in sequencing technology and recent findings demonstrating the important role of microbiota in common health disorders such as obesity. Moreover, the potential role of gut microbiota in influencing brain function, behavior, and mental health has attracted the attention of neuroscientists and psychiatrists. At the 29(th) International College of Neuropsychopharmacology (CINP) World Congress held in Vancouver, Canada, in June 2014, a group of experts presented the symposium, ""Gut microbiota and brain function: Relevance to psychiatric disorders"" to review the latest findings in how gut microbiota may play a role in brain function, behavior, and disease. The symposium covered a broad range of topics, including gut microbiota and neuroendocrine function, the influence of gut microbiota on behavior, probiotics as regulators of brain and behavior, and imaging the gut-brain axis in humans.

27793226,Gut Microbiome and Behavior: Focus on Neuroimmune Interactions.,"As neuroscientists, psychologists, and psychiatrists are starting to appreciate the importance of the gut microbiota to mental health, it is critical to determine the mechanisms of microbiota to brain communication and thereby provide a better understanding of the aspects that may be modifiable with proper intervention in individuals with mental illness. Microbiota-brain communication is emerging as an important factor in brain development and function. Further, immune dysfunction is clearly established to play a role in mental illness. Investigators in the field have established expertise in studying the microbiota, the immune system, brain, and behavior and are poised to contribute significant novel findings to our understanding of microbiota-immune-brain communication in mental illness. This chapter provides a review of the literature related to the influence of microbiota-immune-brain communication to behavior.

27793225,The Importance of Diet and Gut Health to the Treatment and Prevention of Mental Disorders.,"The departure from traditional lifestyles and the rising disease burden of mental disorders are increasing global health concerns. Changes in diet around the world mean that populations are now increasingly reliant on highly processed, poor quality foods, which have been linked to increased risk for mental disorder. Conversely, a nutrient-rich diet is understood to be protective of mental health, and researchers are now aiming to understand the biological underpinnings of this relationship. The gut microbiota has been proposed as a key mediator of this link, given its association with both diet and mental health. Importantly, several critical ""windows of opportunity"" for prevention and intervention have been identified, particularly early life and adolescence; these are periods of rapid development and transition that provide a foundation for future health. Strategies that promote overall diet quality, high in fiber and nutrients, have been linked to increased microbial diversity and gut health. Improving diet quality and subsequent gut health may have benefits for individuals' mental health, as well as the mental health of future generations. Here we discuss specific, targeted dietary and gut focused strategies for the prevention and treatment of mental disorder.",International review of neurobiology,2016,S L Dawson; S R Dash; F N Jacka
26927355,Letter to the Editor: The Surge of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in China - an International Alert: Physical Exercise and Low-Caloric Diet May Reduce the Risks of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Dementia.,"The prevalence of diabetes in China has surged from 0.67% before 1980 to 11.6% currently. It is even higher than the prevalence in the United States. Certainly, China's economic open-ups, improving living standard, and modernization have propagated the surge. From a traditional public-health point of view, increased food intake and decreased exercise were the main contributors. A new knowledge of colon microbiota could be applied to provide a second harvest of food energy; for example, large molecules of carbohydrates, which are undigested by the stomach and small intestine, produce by-products that the body can absorb in the colon. Colon microbiota can ferment these carbohydrates to the short-chain fatty acid butyrate. This is an energy source that may even cause nonalcoholic fatty liver. How these colon microbiota contribute to the surge of diabetes and whether this new knowledge can be used to control diabetes and metabolic syndrome are questions for future scientific studies. Clinically, however, colon microbiota have had immediate applications; fecal microbiota have been transplanted from healthy persons to treat recurrent Clostridium difficile infection at Mayo Clinic. In addition, a stool biobank of healthy persons was established at Mayo Clinic for future clinical applications.",Annals of clinical and laboratory science,2016,Pai C Kao; Qiao Jun Han; Shuyi Liu; Xiu Jun Li; Kristin S Inman; Nicholas Chia
26633823,Prevention of Diet-Induced Obesity Effects on Body Weight and Gut Microbiota in Mice Treated Chronically with Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol.,"Acute administration of cannabinoid CB1 receptor agonists, or the ingestion of cannabis, induces short-term hyperphagia. However, the incidence of obesity is lower in frequent cannabis users compared to non-users. Gut microbiota affects host metabolism and altered microbial profiles are observed in obese states. Gut microbiota modifies adipogenesis through actions on the endocannabinoid system. This study investigated the effect of chronic THC administration on body weight and gut microbiota in diet-induced obese (DIO) and lean mice.Adult male DIO and lean mice were treated daily with vehicle or THC (2mg/kg for 3 weeks and 4 mg/kg for 1 additional week). Body weight, fat mass, energy intake, locomotor activity, whole gut transit and gut microbiota were measured longitudinally.THC reduced weight gain, fat mass gain and energy intake in DIO but not lean mice. DIO-induced changes in select gut microbiota were prevented in mice chronically administered THC. THC had no effect on locomotor activity or whole gut transit in either lean or DIO mice.Chronic THC treatment reduced energy intake and prevented high fat diet-induced increases in body weight and adiposity; effects that were unlikely to be a result of sedation or altered gastrointestinal transit. Changes in gut microbiota potentially contribute to chronic THC-induced actions on body weight in obesity.",PloS one,2015,Nina L Cluny; Catherine M Keenan; Raylene A Reimer; Bernard Le Foll; Keith A Sharkey
26408987,"Administration of Lactobacillus helveticus NS8 improves behavioral, cognitive, and biochemical aberrations caused by chronic restraint stress.","Increasing numbers of studies have suggested that the gut microbiota is involved in the pathophysiology of stress-related disorders. Chronic stress can cause behavioral, cognitive, biochemical, and gut microbiota aberrations. Gut bacteria can communicate with the host through the microbiota-gut-brain axis (which mainly includes the immune, neuroendocrine, and neural pathways) to influence brain and behavior. It is hypothesized that administration of probiotics can improve chronic-stress-induced depression. In order to examine this hypothesis, the chronic restraint stress depression model was established in this study. Adult specific pathogen free (SPF) Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 21 days of restraint stress followed by behavioral testing (including the sucrose preference test (SPT), elevated-plus maze test, open-field test (OFT), object recognition test (ORT), and object placement test (OPT)) and biochemical analysis. Supplemental Lactobacillus helveticus NS8 was provided every day during stress until the end of experiment, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram (CIT) served as a positive control. Results showed that L. helveticus NS8 improved chronic restraint stress-induced behavioral (anxiety and depression) and cognitive dysfunction, showing an effect similar to and better than that of CIT. L. helveticus NS8 also resulted in lower plasma corticosterone (CORT) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels, higher plasma interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels, restored hippocampal serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE) levels, and more hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA expression than in chronic stress rats. Taken together, these results indicate an anti-depressant effect of L. helveticus NS8 in rats subjected to chronic restraint stress depression and that this effect could be due to the microbiota-gut-brain axis. They also suggest the therapeutic potential of L. helveticus NS8 in stress-related and possibly other kinds of depression.",Neuroscience,2015,S Liang; T Wang; X Hu; J Luo; W Li; X Wu; Y Duan; F Jin

26590418,Personalized Nutrition by Prediction of Glycemic Responses.,"Elevated postprandial blood glucose levels constitute a global epidemic and a major risk factor for prediabetes and type II diabetes, but existing dietary methods for controlling them have limited efficacy. Here, we continuously monitored week-long glucose levels in an 800-person cohort, measured responses to 46,898 meals, and found high variability in the response to identical meals, suggesting that universal dietary recommendations may have limited utility. We devised a machine-learning algorithm that integrates blood parameters, dietary habits, anthropometrics, physical activity, and gut microbiota measured in this cohort and showed that it accurately predicts personalized postprandial glycemic response to real-life meals. We validated these predictions in an independent 100-person cohort. Finally, a blinded randomized controlled dietary intervention based on this algorithm resulted in significantly lower postprandial responses and consistent alterations to gut microbiota configuration. Together, our results suggest that personalized diets may successfully modify elevated postprandial blood glucose and its metabolic consequences.

26129950,Antibiotic-induced imbalances in gut microbiota aggravates cholesterol accumulation and liver injuries in rats fed a high-cholesterol diet.,"Increasing evidence suggests that maintenance of homeostasis between gut microbiota and host plays an important role in human health. Many diseases, such as those affecting the liver, have been linked to imbalances in gut microbial communities. However, it is not clear whether an imbalance in gut microbiota promotes the onset of liver injury or if the imbalance results from the pathological state. In the current study, antibiotics were used to disturb the gut microbiota of both rats fed a high-cholesterol diet and rats fed a normal diet (controls). The prevalence of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were reduced, and Proteobacteria was greatly increased in the guts of rats after antibiotic treatment. The antibiotic-induced perturbation of gut microbiota aggravated cholesterol accumulation and liver injury in rats fed a high-cholesterol diet. This may have been due to an increase in intestinal permeability and plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which lead to an increase in LPS absorption and activation of TLR4 signaling, resulting in the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in liver tissues. This study suggests that imbalances in gut microbiota may be a predisposing factor for the onset of metabolic diseases and liver injuries related to cholesterol and high-cholesterol diets. Modulation of gut microbiota could be a novel target for preventing cholesterol-related metabolic disorders.",Applied microbiology and biotechnology,2015,Xu Hu; Tao Wang; Shan Liang; Wei Li; Xiaoli Wu; Feng Jin
26497477,The Microbiome in Mental Health: Potential Contribution of Gut Microbiota in Disease and Pharmacotherapy Management.,"The gut microbiome is composed of ~10(13) -10(14) microbial cells and viruses that exist in a symbiotic bidirectional communicative relationship with the host. Bacterial functions in the gut have an important role in healthy host metabolic function, and dysbiosis can contribute to the pathology of many medical conditions. Alterations in the relationship between gut microbiota and host have gained some attention in mental health because new evidence supports the association of gut bacteria to cognitive and emotional processes. Of interest, illnesses such as major depressive disorder are disproportionately prevalent in patients with gastrointestinal illnesses such as inflammatory bowel disease, which pathologically has been strongly linked to microbiome function. Not only is the microbiome associated with the disease itself, but it may also influence the effectiveness or adverse effects associated with pharmacologic agents used to treat these disorders. This field of study may also provide new insights on how dietary agents may help manage mental illness both directly as well as though their influence on the therapeutic and adverse effects of psychotropic agents.",Pharmacotherapy,2015,Stephanie A Flowers; Vicki L Ellingrod
26370263,Systematic review of evidence to support the theory of psychobiotics.,"The theory that supplemented probiotic bacteria could affect psychological outcomes has recently been outlined in narrative reviews; to date, however, this area of research has not been systematically reviewed.The objective of this review was to compare the effects of probiotics with those of placebo on psychological outcomes and symptoms of psychiatric disorders.The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, PsycINFO, and PsycARTICLES databases were searched electronically for studies published up to July 17, 2014. Reference lists of relevant articles were searched manually.Only double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled human trials that used a standardized, validated scale to assess the effects of probiotic interventions compared with placebo on psychological outcomes or symptoms of psychiatric disorders were included.Two researchers independently assessed trials and evaluated them for methodological quality. Data were extracted from the included studies using a data extraction form.Ten trials met the inclusion criteria. Overall, there is very limited evidence for the efficacy of probiotic interventions in psychological outcomes. The evidence base is incomplete and lacks applicability.More trials are necessary before any inferences can be made about the efficacy of probiotics in mental health applications.",Nutrition reviews,2015,Amy R Romijn; Julia J Rucklidge
26242295,The link between obesity and vitamin D in bariatric patients with omega-loop gastric bypass surgery - a vitamin D supplementation trial to compare the efficacy of postoperative cholecalciferol loading (LOAD): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,"Beyond its classical role in calcium homoeostasis and bone metabolism, vitamin D deficiency has been found to be associated with several diseases, including diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and even obesity itself. Importantly, there are limited data on therapeutic strategies for vitamin D deficiency in bariatric patients, and the procedure-specific guidelines may not be sufficient. To improve long-term outcomes, nutritional screening and appropriate supplementation to prevent nutrient deficiencies are urgently needed. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine effects and safety of a forced dosing regimen of vitamin D versus conventional dose supplementation on vitamin D levels and other parameters in bariatric patients.The study includes loading plus repeat dosing compared with repeated administration of vitamin D without a loading dose, according to guidelines, in a prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial. Up to a triple oral loading dose is given on day 1, then 2 and 4 weeks after surgery (100,000 IU dose each time), followed by an oral maintenance dose (3420 IU/day). The control group (n = 25) will receive placebo, followed by administration of a standard dose (3420 IU/day). We hypothesize that a significant increase in vitamin D levels will occur in patients in the treatment group (n = 25) by 24 weeks after surgery. Further measurements are aimed at evaluating changes in inflammation, bone turnover, insulin resistance, blood pressure, liver, mental health, and gut microbiota of patients undergoing omega-loop gastric bypass surgery. Furthermore, possible associations between concentrations of vitamin D, the involved enzymes, or vitamin D receptor in adipose and/or liver tissues will be determined.To our knowledge, this trial is the first of its kind with this type of vitamin D supplementation in bariatric patients. Its major strength is the design and implementation of evaluation of influencing factors such as liver function, bone health, inflammation, insulin resistance, blood pressure, symptoms of depression, or microbiota. This alternative vitamin D dosing regimen has the potential to be a safe, fast, evidence-based treatment of vitamin D deficiency in bariatric patients. Owing to the increasing number of bariatric patients, it is also of interest to elucidate the link between obesity and vitamin D.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02092376 .

26190966,Role of neuroinflammation in the emotional and cognitive alterations displayed by animal models of obesity.,"Obesity is associated with a high prevalence of mood disorders and cognitive dysfunctions in addition to being a significant risk factor for important health complications such as cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. Identifying the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these health issues is a major public health challenge. Based on recent findings, from studies conducted on animal models of obesity, it has been proposed that inflammatory processes may participate in both the peripheral and brain disorders associated with the obesity condition including the development of emotional and cognitive alterations. This is supported by the fact that obesity is characterized by peripheral low-grade inflammation, originating from increased adipose tissue mass and/or dysbiosis (changes in gut microbiota environment), both of which contribute to increased susceptibility to immune-mediated diseases. In this review, we provide converging evidence showing that obesity is associated with exacerbated neuroinflammation leading to dysfunction in vulnerable brain regions associated with mood regulation, learning, and memory such as the hippocampus. These findings give new insights to the pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to the development of brain disorders in the context of obesity and provide valuable data for introducing new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of neuropsychiatric complications often reported in obese patients.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2015,Nathalie Castanon; Giamal Luheshi; Sophie Layé
25772005,Collective unconscious: how gut microbes shape human behavior.,"The human gut harbors a dynamic and complex microbial ecosystem, consisting of approximately 1 kg of bacteria in the average adult, approximately the weight of the human brain. The evolutionary formation of a complex gut microbiota in mammals has played an important role in enabling brain development and perhaps sophisticated social interaction. Genes within the human gut microbiota, termed the microbiome, significantly outnumber human genes in the body, and are capable of producing a myriad of neuroactive compounds. Gut microbes are part of the unconscious system regulating behavior. Recent investigations indicate that these microbes majorly impact on cognitive function and fundamental behavior patterns, such as social interaction and stress management. In the absence of microbes, underlying neurochemistry is profoundly altered.

25173628,Obese-type gut microbiota induce neurobehavioral changes in the absence of obesity.,"The prevalence of mental illness, particularly depression and dementia, is increased by obesity. Here, we test the hypothesis that obesity-associated changes in gut microbiota are intrinsically able to impair neurocognitive behavior in mice.Conventionally housed, nonobese, adult male C57BL/6 mice maintained on a normal chow diet were subjected to a microbiome depletion/transplantation paradigm using microbiota isolated from donors on either a high-fat diet (HFD) or control diet. Following re-colonization, mice were subjected to comprehensive behavioral and biochemical analyses.The mice given HFD microbiota had significant and selective disruptions in exploratory, cognitive, and stereotypical behavior compared with mice with control diet microbiota in the absence of significant differences in body weight. Sequencing-based phylogenetic analysis confirmed the presence of distinct core microbiota between groups, with alterations in α- and β-diversity, modulation in taxonomic distribution, and statistically significant alterations to metabolically active taxa. HFD microbiota also disrupted markers of intestinal barrier function, increased circulating endotoxin, and increased lymphocyte expression of ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1, toll-like receptor 2, and toll-like receptor 4. Finally, evaluation of brain homogenates revealed that HFD-shaped microbiota increased neuroinflammation and disrupted cerebrovascular homeostasis.Collectively, these data reinforce the link between gut dysbiosis and neurologic dysfunction and suggest that dietary and/or pharmacologic manipulation of gut microbiota could attenuate the neurologic complications of obesity.",Biological psychiatry,2015,Annadora J Bruce-Keller; J Michael Salbaum; Meng Luo; Eugene Blanchard; Christopher M Taylor; David A Welsh; Hans-Rudolf Berthoud
25634609,The human gut microbiota with reference to autism spectrum disorder: considering the whole as more than a sum of its parts.,"The human gut microbiota is a complex microbial ecosystem that contributes an important component towards the health of its host. This highly complex ecosystem has been underestimated in its importance until recently, when a realization of the enormous scope of gut microbiota function has been (and continues to be) revealed. One of the more striking of these discoveries is the finding that the gut microbiota and the brain are connected, and thus there is potential for the microbiota in the gut to influence behavior and mental health. In this short review, we outline the link between brain and gut microbiota and urge the reader to consider the gut microbiota as an ecosystem 'organ' rather than just as a collection of microbes filling a niche, using the hypothesized role of the gut microbiota in autism spectrum disorder to illustrate the concept.",Microbial ecology in health and disease,2015,Michael C Toh; Emma Allen-Vercoe
25911232,Microbiota regulation of the Mammalian gut-brain axis.,"The realization that the microbiota-gut-brain axis plays a critical role in health and disease has emerged over the past decade. The brain-gut axis is a bidirectional communication system between the central nervous system (CNS) and the gastrointestinal tract. Regulation of the microbiota-brain-gut axis is essential for maintaining homeostasis, including that of the CNS. The routes of this communication are not fully elucidated but include neural, humoral, immune, and metabolic pathways. A number of approaches have been used to interrogate this axis including the use of germ-free animals, probiotic agents, antibiotics, or animals exposed to pathogenic bacterial infections. Together, it is clear that the gut microbiota can be a key regulator of mood, cognition, pain, and obesity. Understanding microbiota-brain interactions is an exciting area of research which may contribute new insights into individual variations in cognition, personality, mood, sleep, and eating behavior, and how they contribute to a range of neuropsychiatric diseases ranging from affective disorders to autism and schizophrenia. Finally, the concept of psychobiotics, bacterial-based interventions with mental health benefit, is also emerging.",Advances in applied microbiology,2015,Aurelijus Burokas; Rachel D Moloney; Timothy G Dinan; John F Cryan
25869281,Lactobacillus fermentum NS9 restores the antibiotic induced physiological and psychological abnormalities in rats.,"Gut microbiota play a vital role in maintaining the health of the host. Many factors affect gut microbiota; application of broad range antibiotics disturb microbiota, while probiotic application protects the microbiota. To investigate how probiotics alter the physiological and psychological changes induced by antibiotics, we tested the performance of ampicillin-treated rats in the presence or absence of Lactobacillus fermentum strain NS9, in elevated plus maze and Morris water maze. The results showed that NS9 normalised the composition of gut microbiota and alleviated the ampicillin-induced inflammation in the colon. The levels of the mineralocorticoid and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors were also elevated in the hippocampus of the ampillicin+NS9 treated group. NS9 administration also reduced the anxiety-like behaviour and alleviated the ampicillin-induced impairment in memory retention. These findings suggest that NS9 is beneficial to the host, because it restores the physiological and psychological abnormalities induced by ampicillin. Our results highlight how gut contents regulate the brain, and shed light on the clinical applications of probiotics to treat the side effect of antibiotics and mental disorders.",Beneficial microbes,2015,T Wang; X Hu; S Liang; W Li; X Wu; L Wang; F Jin
25567038,The gut microbiota and inflammatory noncommunicable diseases: associations and potentials for gut microbiota therapies.,"Rapid environmental transition and modern lifestyles are likely driving changes in the biodiversity of the human gut microbiota. With clear effects on physiologic, immunologic, and metabolic processes in human health, aberrations in the gut microbiome and intestinal homeostasis have the capacity for multisystem effects. Changes in microbial composition are implicated in the increasing propensity for a broad range of inflammatory diseases, such as allergic disease, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), obesity, and associated noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). There are also suggestive implications for neurodevelopment and mental health. These diverse multisystem influences have sparked interest in strategies that might favorably modulate the gut microbiota to reduce the risk of many NCDs. For example, specific prebiotics promote favorable intestinal colonization, and their fermented products have anti-inflammatory properties. Specific probiotics also have immunomodulatory and metabolic effects. However, when evaluated in clinical trials, the effects are variable, preliminary, or limited in magnitude. Fecal microbiota transplantation is another emerging therapy that regulates inflammation in experimental models. In human subjects it has been successfully used in cases of Clostridium difficile infection and IBD, although controlled trials are lacking for IBD. Here we discuss relationships between gut colonization and inflammatory NCDs and gut microbiota modulation strategies for their treatment and prevention.",The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,2015,Christina E West; Harald Renz; Maria C Jenmalm; Anita L Kozyrskyj; Katrina J Allen; Peter Vuillermin; Susan L Prescott; 
25415497,The gut microbiome and diet in psychiatry: focus on depression.,"With depressive disorders the leading source of disability globally, the identification of new targets for prevention and management is imperative. A rapidly emerging field of research suggests that the microbiome-gut-brain axis is of substantial relevance to mood and behaviour. Similarly, unhealthy diet has recently emerged as a significant correlate of and risk factor for depression. This review provides evidence for the gut microbiota as a key factor mediating the link between diet and depressive illness.The development of new technologies is affording a better understanding of how diet influences gut microbiota composition and activity and how this may, in turn, influence depressive illness. New interventions are also suggesting the possible utility of pre and probiotic formulations and fermented food in influencing mental health.Although in its early stages, the emerging field of research focused on the human microbiome suggests an important role for the gut microbiota in influencing brain development, behaviour and mood in humans. The recognition that the gut microbiota interacts bidirectionally with other environmental risk factors, such as diet and stress, suggests promise in the development of interventions targeting the gut microbiota for the prevention and treatment of common mental health disorders.",Current opinion in psychiatry,2015,Sarah Dash; Gerard Clarke; Michael Berk; Felice N Jacka
25231862,Artificial sweeteners induce glucose intolerance by altering the gut microbiota.,"Non-caloric artificial sweeteners (NAS) are among the most widely used food additives worldwide, regularly consumed by lean and obese individuals alike. NAS consumption is considered safe and beneficial owing to their low caloric content, yet supporting scientific data remain sparse and controversial. Here we demonstrate that consumption of commonly used NAS formulations drives the development of glucose intolerance through induction of compositional and functional alterations to the intestinal microbiota. These NAS-mediated deleterious metabolic effects are abrogated by antibiotic treatment, and are fully transferrable to germ-free mice upon faecal transplantation of microbiota configurations from NAS-consuming mice, or of microbiota anaerobically incubated in the presence of NAS. We identify NAS-altered microbial metabolic pathways that are linked to host susceptibility to metabolic disease, and demonstrate similar NAS-induced dysbiosis and glucose intolerance in healthy human subjects. Collectively, our results link NAS consumption, dysbiosis and metabolic abnormalities, thereby calling for a reassessment of massive NAS usage.",Nature,2014,Jotham Suez; Tal Korem; David Zeevi; Gili Zilberman-Schapira; Christoph A Thaiss; Ori Maza; David Israeli; Niv Zmora; Shlomit Gilad; Adina Weinberger; Yael Kuperman; Alon Harmelin; Ilana Kolodkin-Gal; Hagit Shapiro; Zamir Halpern; Eran Segal; Eran Elinav
24956966,Microbiota and neurodevelopmental windows: implications for brain disorders.,"Gut microbiota is essential to human health, playing a major role in the bidirectional communication between the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system. The microbiota undergoes a vigorous process of development throughout the lifespan and establishes its symbiotic rapport with the host early in life. Early life perturbations of the developing gut microbiota can impact neurodevelopment and potentially lead to adverse mental health outcomes later in life. This review compares the parallel early development of the intestinal microbiota and the nervous system. The concept of parallel and interacting microbial-neural critical windows opens new avenues for developing novel microbiota-modulating based therapeutic interventions in early life to combat neurodevelopmental deficits and brain disorders.",Trends in molecular medicine,2014,Yuliya E Borre; Gerard W O'Keeffe; Gerard Clarke; Catherine Stanton; Timothy G Dinan; John F Cryan

24103493,Excess body weight during pregnancy and offspring obesity: potential mechanisms.,"The rates of child and adult obesity have increased in most developed countries over the past several decades. The health consequences of obesity affect both physical and mental health, and the excess body weight can be linked to an elevated risk for developing type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular problems, and depression. Among the factors that can influence the development of obesity are higher infant weights and increased weight gain, which are associated with higher risk for excess body weight later in life. In turn, mother's excess body weight during and after pregnancy can be linked to the risk for offspring overweight and obesity through dietary habits, mode of delivery and feeding, breast milk composition, and through the influence on infant gut microbiota. This review considers current knowledge of these potential mechanisms that threaten to create an intergenerational cycle of obesity.","Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)",2014,Oleg Paliy; Chandrika J Piyathilake; Anita Kozyrskyj; Gulcin Celep; Francesco Marotta; Reza Rastmanesh
21167931,"Lymphocytes in neuroprotection, cognition and emotion: is intolerance really the answer?","Clinical, epidemiological and therapeutic studies indicate that some human depression is associated with proinflammatory cytokines, chronic inflammatory disorders, and inflammation-inducing lifestyle factors. Moreover depression can be induced by administration of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-2 or IFN-α. However, recent studies in specific pathogen-free (SPF) rodents suggest a different--and potentially contradictory--relationship between immune processes and mental health. These studies suggest that effector T cells specific for central nervous system (CNS) antigens can assist recovery from an array of environmental insults ranging from nerve injury to psychological stress, while in contrast, regulatory T cells (Treg) oppose such recovery. Indeed, some reported effects of this so-called ""protective autoimmunity"" seem of direct relevance to depressive disorders. These findings pose a dilemma for those intending to manipulate inflammatory pathways as a treatment for depression. Should we administer anti-inflammatory treatments, or should we induce self-reactive T cells? We re-examine the rodent findings and outline immunological peculiarities of SPF rodents, the abnormal properties of their regulatory T cells, and the impact of gut microbiota. We find that ""protective autoimmunity"" is likely to be relevant only to very clean SPF animals that lack normal levels of activated T cells, CNS T cell traffic and mature Treg. The data indicate that even in SPF models the effectors of beneficial effects are not the proinflammatory autoimmune cells themselves, but rather unidentified regulatory cells. This reinterpretation of findings relevant to ""protective autoimmunity"" suggests that ongoing, and planned, clinical trials of anti-inflammatory strategies to treat depressive disorders are justified.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2011,Graham A W Rook; Christopher A Lowry; Charles L Raison
31952911,Gut microbial changes of patients with psychotic and affective disorders: A systematic review.,"Many diverse inflammatory pathophysiologic mechanisms have been linked to mental disorders, and through the past decade an increasing interest in the gut microbiota and its relation to mental health has been arising. We aimed to systematically review studies of alterations in gut microbiota of patients suffering from psychotic disorders, bipolar disorder or depression compared to healthy controls.We systematically searched the databases CENTRAL, PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO and LILACS. Primary outcome was to compare the gut microbiota of patients suffering from psychotic disorders, bipolar disorder or depression with healthy controls.We identified 17 studies, covering 744 patients and 620 healthy controls. The most consistent microbiota changes were a tendency towards higher abundance of Actinobacteria and lower abundance of Firmicutes at the phylum level, lower abundance of Lachnospiraceae at family level and lower abundance of Faecalibacterium at genus level for the mental disorders overall. However, we found that all studies had risk of bias and that the included studies displayed great variability in methods of storage, analysis of the fecal samples, reporting of results and statistics used.Due to the many limitations of the included studies the findings should be interpreted with caution. Larger studies (especially of schizophrenia and major depressive disorder) are needed, but it is also of great importance to gather information of and control for factors that influence the result of a microbiota analysis including body mass index (BMI), smoking, alcohol consumption, diet habits, antibiotics, sample handling, wet laboratory methods and statistics.",Schizophrenia research,2021,Nina Vindegaard; Helene Speyer; Merete Nordentoft; Simon Rasmussen; Michael Eriksen Benros
33249563,Microbiota-immune alterations in adolescents following early life adversity: A proof of concept study.,"Early adverse care has long-term impacts on physical and mental health. The influence of rearing conditions on the infant's gut microbiota and its relationship with developmental health has become more evident. The microbiome is essential for normal growth and metabolism, and the signaling from the gut to the brain may underlie individual differences in resilience later in life. Microbial diversity and composition were determined using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing in fecal samples from 17 adolescents adopted internationally from orphanages into the United States and 18 adolescents reared in birth families who had similar educational and income levels. Analyses focused on diversity of the microbial community structure and differences in the abundance of specific bacterial taxa. Blood samples were used to immunophenotype the numbers of several T-cell subsets and cytomegalovirus (CMV) seropositivity. Negative binomial regression analysis revealed several operational taxonomic units that were significantly different based on early rearing conditions and CMV seropositivity. There were significant associations between the relative abundance of certain taxa, the percentages of T-cell subsets in circulation, and CMV seropositivity. These findings demonstrate a possible link between the gut microbiota and associations with immune alterations initiated by early life adversity.",Developmental psychobiology,2021,Brie M Reid; Rachael Horne; Bonny Donzella; Jake C Szamosi; Christopher L Coe; Jane A Foster; Megan R Gunnar
33094505,Gut dysbiosis associated with the rats' responses in methamphetamine-induced conditioned place preference.,"Methamphetamine (MA) is a potent stimulant and notoriously addictive. Individuals respond to MA effects differently and thus have a varying susceptible risk of developing MA use disorder. Cumulative evidence has indicated that gut dysbiosis contributes to behavioral response to drug effects. However, the role of gut microbiota in the susceptible risk of developing MA use disorder has remained elusive. Using an MA-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) rat model, we administrated the same dose of MA to rats, which then showed distinct preferences in drug-related place, indicating their different responses to MA. From all of the MA-exposed rats, the eight with the highest CPP scores were labeled as group high CPP (H-CPP), and the eight with the lowest were labeled as group low CPP (L-CPP). By 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequencing, we found that the gut microbiota compositions differed between H-CPP and L-CPP. Specifically, Akkermansia was significantly higher in H-CPP and positively correlated with the CPP scores. Notably, H-CPP and L-CPP differed in the gut microbiota composition prior to the CPP training; Ruminococcus was the dominant phylotype in H-CPP at baseline. More importantly, rats pretreated by antibiotics showed a significantly stronger MA-induced CPP than did the controls. Our study demonstrates that the gut dysbiosis was associated with the MA-induced CPP, indicating that the gut microbiota might be important modulators for MA-induced behavior and vulnerability to MA use disorder.",Addiction biology,2021,Cheng Yang; Xiaoya Fu; Wei Hao; Xiaojun Xiang; Tieqiao Liu; Bao-Zhu Yang; Xiaojie Zhang
33271210,A systematic review of microbiome changes and impact of probiotic supplementation in children and adolescents with neuropsychiatric disorders.,"In recent decades, the diagnostic and therapeutic implications of the microbiome changes and the impact of probiotic supplementation have increased rapidly. However, the potential for clinical translation of microbiome research for children and adolescents with psychiatric disorders is unclear. This review examined available evidence related to gut microbiota as well as the impact of probiotic supplementation on psychiatric disorders in the pediatric population reported to date.We performed a literature search for the gut microbiota in child and adolescent population (0-18 years old) with mental health disorders from July 1999 through July 2019 in several databases: ClinicalTrials.gov, Ovid EBM Reviews, Ovid Embase, Ovid Medline, Ovid PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science.A total of 7 studies met inclusion criteria consisting of randomized controlled trials and cohort studies that examined various associations between psychiatric disorders and gut microbiota in youth. Six studies examined the effects of various treatment interventions such as probiotic supplementation on microbiota composition and behaviors. One study showed an increase in prosocial behavior in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and an increase in the Lachnospiraceae family following prebiotic supplementation. Another study suggested that prebiotic supplementation increased bifidobacterial populations for ASD and healthy controls. A study evaluating infant supplementation of prebiotics showed both a decreased likelihood of developing Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or ASD and decreased gut Bifidobacterium. One study did not find significant differences in microbiome composition after micronutrient treatment.The main goal of this systematic review was to comprehensively examine and summarize the current evidence focused on the potential effect of the relationship between microbiota gut composition as well as the effects of probiotic supplementation on psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents. This is a relatively new area of research and the number of included studies is limited. More studies are needed to determine whether gut dysbiosis leads to the development and/or contributes to the severity of mental disorders or whether gut dysbiosis is a result of other processes that accompany mental disorders.A better understanding of the specific bacteria contributions, gut-brain pathways, and role in pathophysiological mechanisms in neuropsychiatric disorders in the child and adolescent populations can possibly provide alternative tools for a clinical psychiatrist. Moreover, it may ultimately aid the clinician with intervention strategies, or detect populations at risk for developing neuropsychiatric disorders.",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,2021,Anna N Ligezka; A Irem Sonmez; Martha P Corral-Frias; Raphael Golebiowski; Brian Lynch; Paul E Croarkin; Magdalena Romanowicz
33307114,Possible use of fermented foods in rehabilitation of anorexia nervosa: the gut microbiota as a modulator.,"Anorexia nervosa is a serious psychiatric disorder with high morbidity and mortality rate. Evidence for the optimal psychopharmacological approach to managing the disorder remains limited, with nutritional treatment, focused on weight restoration through the consumption of high energy diet, regarded as one of the fundamental steps in treatment. The human gut microbiome is increasingly recognised for its proposed role in gastrointestinal, metabolic, immune and mental health, all of which may be compromised in individuals with anorexia nervosa. Dietary intake plays an important role in shaping gut microbiota composition, whilst the use of fermented foods, foods with potential psychobiotic properties that deliver live bacteria, bacterial metabolites, prebiotics and energy, have been discussed to a lesser extent. However, fermented foods are of increasing interest due to their potential capacity to affect gut microbiota composition, provide beneficial bacterial metabolites, and confer beneficial outcomes to host health. This review provides an overview of the role of the gut microbiota in relation to the disease pathology in anorexia nervosa and especially focuses on the therapeutic potential of fermented foods, proposed here as a recommended addition to the current nutritional treatment protocols warranting further investigation.",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,2021,Tetyana Rocks; Madeline West; Meghan Hockey; Hajara Aslam; Melissa Lane; Amy Loughman; Felice N Jacka; Anu Ruusunen
32279681,Infant microbiota in colic: predictive associations with problem crying and subsequent child behavior.,"Infant colic is a condition of unknown cause which can result in carer distress and attachment difficulties. Recent studies have implicated the gut microbiota in infant colic, and certain probiotics have demonstrated possible efficacy. We aim to investigate whether the intestinal microbiota composition in infants with colic is associated with cry/fuss time at baseline, persistence of cry/fuss at 4-week follow-up, or child behavior at 2 years of age. Fecal samples from infants with colic (n = 118, 53% male) were analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing. After examining the alpha and beta diversity of the clinical samples, we performed a differential abundance analysis of the 16S data to look for taxa that associate with baseline and future behavior, while adjusting for potential confounding variables. In addition, we used random forest classifiers to evaluate how well baseline gut microbiota can predict future crying time. Alpha diversity of the fecal microbiota was strongly influenced by birth mode, feed type, and child gender, but did not significantly associate with crying or behavioral outcomes. Several taxa within the microbiota (including Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, Lactobacillus, and Klebsiella) associate with colic severity, and the baseline microbiota composition can predict further crying at 4 weeks with up to 65% accuracy. The combination of machine learning findings with associative relationships demonstrates the potential prognostic utility of the infant fecal microbiota in predicting subsequent infant crying problems.",Journal of developmental origins of health and disease,2021,Amy Loughman; Thomas Quinn; Monica L Nation; Amy Reichelt; Robert J Moore; Thi Thu Hao Van; Valerie Sung; Mimi L K Tang
33045322,Targeting the microbiome-gut-brain axis for improving cognition in schizophrenia and major mood disorders: A narrative review.,"Cognitive impairment has been consistently found to be a core feature of serious mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and major mood disorders (major depression and bipolar disorder). In recent years, a great effort has been made in elucidating the biological causes of cognitive deficits and the search for new biomarkers of cognition. Microbiome and gut-brain axis (MGB) hormones have been postulated to be potential biomarkers of cognition in serious mental illnesses. The main aim of this review was to synthesize current evidence on the association of microbiome and gut-brain hormones on cognitive processes in schizophrenia and major mood disorders and the association of MGB hormones with stress and the immune system. Our review underscores the role of the MGB axis on cognitive aspects of serious mental illnesses with the potential use of agents targeting the gut microbiota as cognitive enhancers. However, the current evidence for clinical trials focused on the MGB axis as cognitive enhancers in these clinical populations is scarce. Future clinical trials using probiotics, prebiotics, antibiotics, or faecal microbiota transplantation need to consider potential mechanistic pathways such as the HPA axis, the immune system, or gut-brain axis hormones involved in appetite control and energy homeostasis.",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,2021,Miquel Bioque; Alexandre González-Rodríguez; Clemente Garcia-Rizo; Jesús Cobo; José Antonio Monreal; Judith Usall; Virginia Soria; ; Javier Labad
33301807,Spinal cord injury and gut microbiota: A review.,"After spinal cord injury (SCI), intestinal dysfunction has a serious impact on physical and mental health, quality of life, and social participation. Recent data from rodent and human studies indicated that SCI causes gut dysbiosis. Remodeling gut microbiota could be beneficial for the recovery of intestinal function and motor function after SCI. However, few studies have explored SCI with focus on the gut microbiota and ""microbiota-gut-brain"" axis. In this review, the complications following SCI, including intestinal dysfunction, anxiety and depression, metabolic disorders, and neuropathic pain, are directly or indirectly related to gut dysbiosis, which may be mediated by ""gut-brain"" interactions. Furthermore, we discuss the research strategies that can be beneficial in this regard, including germ-free animals, fecal microbiota transplantation, probiotics, phages, and brain imaging techniques. The current microbial research has shifted from descriptive to mechanismal perspective, and future research using new technologies may further demonstrate the pathophysiological mechanism of association of SCI with gut microbiota, elucidate the mode of interaction of gut microbiota and hosts, and help develop personalized microbiota-targeted therapies and drugs based on microbiota or corresponding metabolites.",Life sciences,2021,Yingli Jing; Fan Bai; Yan Yu
33271426,The gut microbiota in anxiety and depression - A systematic review.,"Growing evidence indicates the community of microorganisms throughout the gastrointestinal tract, (i.e., gut microbiota), is associated with anxiety and depressive disorders. We present the first systematic review of the gut microbiota in anxiety disorders, along with an update in depression. Consideration of shared underlying features is essential due to the high rates of comorbidity. Systematic searches, following PRISMA guidelines, identified 26 studies (two case-control comparisons of the gut microbiota in generalised anxiety disorder, 18 in depression, one incorporating both anxiety/depression, and five including symptom-only measures). Alpha and beta diversity findings were inconsistent; however, differences in bacterial taxa indicated disorders may be characterised by a higher abundance of proinflammatory species (e.g., Enterobacteriaceae and Desulfovibrio), and lower short-chain fatty acid producing-bacteria (e.g., Faecalibacterium). Several taxa, and their mechanisms of action, may relate to anxiety and depression pathophysiology via communication of peripheral inflammation to the brain. Although the gut microbiota remains a promising target for prevention and therapy, future research should assess confounders, particularly diet and psychotropic medications, and should examine microorganism function.",Clinical psychology review,2021,Carra A Simpson; Carmela Diaz-Arteche; Djamila Eliby; Orli S Schwartz; Julian G Simmons; Caitlin S M Cowan
33206326,Gut-Brain-Skin Axis in Psoriasis: A Review.,"Psoriasis is a common skin disease, with chronic inflammation and a complex etiology. It has long been recognized that chronic skin conditions and mental health disorders are often co-morbid. Thus, the concept of the gut-brain-skin axis emphasized in mental health disorders may also regulate the health of skin.The gut microbiota has been found to be the bridge between the immune system and nervous system. By leveraging clinical cases and animal models of psoriasis, an important communication pathway has been identified along the gut-brain-skin axis that is associated with the modulation of neurotransmitters from the microbiota. Furthermore, mammalian neurotransmitters, including dopamine, serotonin, or γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), can be produced and/or consumed by several types of bacteria. Other studies suggest that manipulating these neurotransmitters by bacteria may have an effect on host physiology, and the levels of neurotransmitter can be altered by microbiota-based interventions.Nonetheless, it is unknown whether or not the manipulation of neurotransmitter levels by bacteria can affect the occurrence and development of psoriasis. Notably, preliminary experiments found that oral consumption of probiotics improves the clinical symptoms in patients with psoriasis, perhaps correlated with the gut microbiome-mediated crosstalk between the immune system and the nervous system by secreting neurotransmitters in psoriasis. In this review, the communication along the gut-brain-skin axis is discussed.",Dermatology and therapy,2021,Guang Chen; Zai-Ming Chen; Xiao-Yan Fan; Yue-Lei Jin; Xin Li; Shi-Ren Wu; Wei-Wei Ge; Cao-Hua Lv; Yao-Kun Wang; Jin-Guang Chen
33144709,Diet and depression: exploring the biological mechanisms of action.,"The field of nutritional psychiatry has generated observational and efficacy data supporting a role for healthy dietary patterns in depression onset and symptom management. To guide future clinical trials and targeted dietary therapies, this review provides an overview of what is currently known regarding underlying mechanisms of action by which diet may influence mental and brain health. The mechanisms of action associating diet with health outcomes are complex, multifaceted, interacting, and not restricted to any one biological pathway. Numerous pathways were identified through which diet could plausibly affect mental health. These include modulation of pathways involved in inflammation, oxidative stress, epigenetics, mitochondrial dysfunction, the gut microbiota, tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism, the HPA axis, neurogenesis and BDNF, epigenetics, and obesity. However, the nascent nature of the nutritional psychiatry field to date means that the existing literature identified in this review is largely comprised of preclinical animal studies. To fully identify and elucidate complex mechanisms of action, intervention studies that assess markers related to these pathways within clinically diagnosed human populations are needed.",Molecular psychiatry,2021,Wolfgang Marx; Melissa Lane; Meghan Hockey; Hajara Aslam; Michael Berk; Ken Walder; Alessandra Borsini; Joseph Firth; Carmine M Pariante; Kirsten Berding; John F Cryan; Gerard Clarke; Jeffrey M Craig; Kuan-Pin Su; David Mischoulon; Fernando Gomez-Pinilla; Jane A Foster; Patrice D Cani; Sandrine Thuret; Heidi M Staudacher; Almudena Sánchez-Villegas; Husnain Arshad; Tasnime Akbaraly; Adrienne O'Neil; Toby Segasby; Felice N Jacka
33067643,Profiling the differences of gut microbial structure between schizophrenia patients with and without violent behaviors based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing.,"Understanding the violence behaviors in schizophrenia patients has always been the focus of forensic psychiatry. Although many studies show gut microbiota could regulate behavior, to our knowledge, no studies have profiled the gut microbiota structure in schizophrenia patients with violence. We profiled the characteristics of gut microbiota structure in 26 schizophrenia patients with violence (V.SCZ) by comparing with that of 16 schizophrenia patients without violence (NV.SCZ) under the control of confounders, and found the differences of gut microbiota structure between the two groups. Violence was assessed by the MacArthur Community Violence Instrument. Psychiatric symptoms were assessed by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to identify and relatively quantify gut microbial composition. Bioinformatics analysis was used to find differential gut microbial composition between the V.SCZ and NV.SCZ groups. Fifty-nine differential microbial taxonomic compositions were found between the two groups. Fifteen gut microbial compositions were the key microbial taxonomic compositions responsible for the differences between the V.SCZ and NV.SCZ groups, including five enriched microbial taxonomic compositions (p_Bacteroidetes, c_Bacteroidia, o_Bacteroidales, f_Prevotellaceae, s_Bacteroides_uniformis), and ten impoverished microbial taxonomic compositions (p_Actinobacteria, c_unidentified_Actinobacteria, o_Bifidobacteriales, f_ Enterococcaceae, f_Veillonellaceae, f_Bifidobacteriaceae, g_Enterococcus, g_Candidatus_Saccharimonas, g_Bifidobacterium, and s_Bifidobacterium_pseudocatenulatum). This study profiled the differences of gut microbiota between schizophrenia patients with violence and without violence. These results could enrich the etiological understanding of violence in schizophrenia and might be helpful to violence management in the future.",International journal of legal medicine,2021,Xiacan Chen; Jiajun Xu; Hongren Wang; Jiaguo Luo; Zheng Wang; Gang Chen; Dan Jiang; Ruochen Cao; Haolan Huang; Dan Luo; Xiao Xiao; Junmei Hu
32979562,Shotgun metagenomics reveals both taxonomic and tryptophan pathway differences of gut microbiota in bipolar disorder with current major depressive episode patients.,"The microbiome-gut-brain axis, especially the microbial tryptophan biosynthesis and metabolism pathway (MiTBamp), is closely connected to bipolar disorder with current major depressive episode (BPD).We performed shotgun metagenomics sequencing (SMS) of faecal samples from 25 BPD patients and 28 healthy controls (HCs). Except for the microbiota taxa and MiTBamp analyses, we also built a classification model using the Random Forests (RF) and Boruta algorithm to find the microbial biomarkers for BPD.Compared to HCs, the phylum Bacteroidetes abundance was significantly reduced, whereas that of the Actinobacteria and Firmicutes were significantly increased in BPD patients. We also identified 38 species increased and 6 species decreased significantly in the BPD group. In the MiTBamp, we identified that two Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) orthologies (KOs) (K00658 and K00837) were significantly lower in the BPD, and five KOs (K01696, K00382, K00626, K01667, and K03781) were significantly higher in the BPD group. We also identified significant genera and species which were closely related to these KOs. Finally, RF classification based on gut microbiota at the genus level can achieve an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.997.The features of cross-sectional design, limited sample size, the heterogeneity of bipolar disorders, and a lack of serum/plasma tryptophan concentration measurements.The present findings enable a better understanding of changes in gastrointestinal microbiome and MiTBamp in BPD.

33334010,Food Addiction and Tobacco Use Disorder: Common Liability and Shared Mechanisms.,"As food addiction is being more commonly recognized within the scientific community, parallels can be drawn between it and other addictive substance use disorders, including tobacco use disorder. Given that both unhealthy diets and smoking are leading risk factors for disability and death, a greater understanding of how food addiction and tobacco use disorder overlap with one another is necessary. This narrative review aimed to highlight literature that investigated prevalence, biology, psychology, and treatment options of food addiction and tobacco use disorder. Published studies up to August 2020 and written in English were included. Using a biopsychosocial lens, each disorder was assessed together and separately, as there is emerging evidence that the two disorders can develop concurrently or sequentially within individuals. Commonalities include but are not limited to the dopaminergic neurocircuitry, gut microbiota, childhood adversity, and attachment insecurity. In addition, the authors conducted a feasibility study with the purpose of examining the association between food addiction symptoms and tobacco use disorder among individuals seeking tobacco use disorder treatment. To inform future treatment approaches, more research is necessary to identify and understand the overlap between the two disorders.",Nutrients,2020,Laurie Zawertailo; Sophia Attwells; Wayne K deRuiter; Thao Lan Le; Danielle Dawson; Peter Selby
33327540,Ketogenic Diet: A Dietary Modification as an Anxiolytic Approach?,"Anxiety disorders comprise persistent, disabling conditions that are distributed across the globe, and are associated with the high medical and socioeconomic burden of the disease. Within the array of biopsychosocial treatment modalities-including monoaminergic antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and CBT-there is an unmet need for the effective treatment of anxiety disorders resulting in full remission and recovery. Nutritional intervention may be hypothesized as a promising treatment strategy; in particular, it facilitates relapse prevention. Low-carbohydrate high-fat diets (LCHF) may provide a rewarding outcome for some anxiety disorders; more research is needed before this regimen can be recommended to patients on a daily basis, but the evidence mentioned in this paper should encourage researchers and clinicians to consider LCHF as a piece of advice somewhere between psychotherapy and pharmacology, or as an add-on to those two.",Nutrients,2020,Adam Włodarczyk; Wiesław Jerzy Cubała; Aleksandra Wielewicka
33318317,Mental awareness improved mild cognitive impairment and modulated gut microbiome.,"There is ample scientific and clinical evidence of the effects of gut microbiota on the brain but no definitive evidence that the brain can affect changes in gut microbiota under the bi-directional gut-brain axis concept. As there is no pharmacotherapeutic intervention for the early stages of cognitive decline, research has focused on cognitive stimulation in reversing or slowing the impairment. Elderly patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment underwent a randomized-control trial of mindful awareness practice. Neuropsychological assessments, inflammatory markers, and gut microbiota profiles were tested. Here, we report that their cognitive impairment was improved and associated with changes in gut bacterial profile. A cognition-score-dependent-abundance was observed in <i>Ruminococcus</i> vs Recognition Trials (RT), Digit Span Backward (DSB), Semantic Fluency Span (SFS) and Memory Domain (MD); <i>Coprococcus</i> vs DSB, Color Trails Test 2 (CTT2) and Block Design (BD); <i>Parabacteroides</i> vs DSB and SFS; <i>Fusobacterium</i> vs DSB and CTT2; <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> vs BD and SFS; <i>Ruminococcaceae</i> vs DSB; <i>Phascolarctobacterium</i> vs MD. The study showed for the first-time, alteration in the cognitive capacity leading to the corresponding changes in microbiota profiles.

33287442,The Gut Microbiota: A Potential Gateway to Improved Health Outcomes in Breast Cancer Treatment and Survivorship.,"Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women worldwide. The disease and its treatments exert profound effects on an individual's physical and mental health. There are many factors that impact an individual's risk of developing breast cancer, their response to treatments, and their risk of recurrence. The community of microorganisms inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract, the gut microbiota, affects human health through metabolic, neural, and endocrine signaling, and immune activity. It is through these mechanisms that the gut microbiota appears to influence breast cancer risk, response to treatment, and recurrence. A disrupted gut microbiota or state of 'dysbiosis' can contribute to a biological environment associated with higher risk for cancer development as well as contribute to negative treatment side-effects. Many cancer treatments have been shown to shift the gut microbiota toward dysbiosis; however, the microbiota can also be positively manipulated through diet, prebiotic and probiotic supplementation, and exercise. The objective of this review is to provide an overview of the current understanding of the relationship between the gut microbiota and breast cancer and to highlight potential strategies for modulation of the gut microbiota that could lead to improved clinical outcomes and overall health in this population.",International journal of molecular sciences,2020,Kara Sampsell; Desirée Hao; Raylene A Reimer
33287416,Bacterial Metabolites of Human Gut Microbiota Correlating with Depression.,"Depression is a global threat to mental health that affects around 264 million people worldwide. Despite the considerable evolution in our understanding of the pathophysiology of depression, no reliable biomarkers that have contributed to objective diagnoses and clinical therapy currently exist. The discovery of the microbiota-gut-brain axis induced scientists to study the role of gut microbiota (GM) in the pathogenesis of depression. Over the last decade, many of studies were conducted in this field. The productions of metabolites and compounds with neuroactive and immunomodulatory properties among mechanisms such as the mediating effects of the GM on the brain, have been identified. This comprehensive review was focused on low molecular weight compounds implicated in depression as potential products of the GM. The other possible mechanisms of GM involvement in depression were presented, as well as changes in the composition of the microbiota of patients with depression. In conclusion, the therapeutic potential of functional foods and psychobiotics in relieving depression were considered. The described biomarkers associated with GM could potentially enhance the diagnostic criteria for depressive disorders in clinical practice and represent a potential future diagnostic tool based on metagenomic technologies for assessing the development of depressive disorders.",International journal of molecular sciences,2020,Olga V Averina; Yana A Zorkina; Roman A Yunes; Alexey S Kovtun; Valeriya M Ushakova; Anna Y Morozova; George P Kostyuk; Valery N Danilenko; Vladimir P Chekhonin
33389842,The emerging role of mood disorders in inflammatory bowel diseases.,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic, devastating conditions of the gastrointestinal tract characterized by a complex pathogenesis, increasing worldwide prevalence, a wide spectrum of extraintestinal manifestations, and a reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Furthermore, mood disorders, specifically anxiety and depression, are more prevalent among IBD patients compared to the general population. The connection between mental disorders and IBD is compound, bidirectional and still not fully understood. The IBD may impact psychological health, whereas anxiety and depression are associated with a more aggressive course of IBD. The inflammation process, gut microbiota alterations and drug side effects are factors that influence the mental state of patients with IBD. Importantly, despite the high prevalence of depression and anxiety in IBD, many of the current guidelines do not include clear recommendation for assessment of mental problems in patients and further management. Therefore, monitoring for mood disorders should become a part of the multi-disciplinary and holistic approach to patients with IBD. This review is based on current literature searched in PubMed, mainly considering publications from the last 10 years.",Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical University,2020,Paweł Kuźnicki; Radosław Kempiński; Katarzyna Neubauer
33181474,Gut microbiota composition in children with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome: a pilot study.,"Obstructive Sleep Apnoea syndrome (OSAS) is considered a systemic inflammatory disease and is characterized by intermittent hypoxia that can damage the integrity of intestinal barrier and alter gut microbiota composition in adults and animal models. To date there is only one study on snoring children and microbiota but no studies are present on paediatric OSAS related dysbiosis.To evaluate gut microbiota composition in OSAS children in respect to healthy subjects and investigate the role of sleep parameters in changing gut microbiome.Sixteen children divided in OSAS and healthy groups. Stool samples were collected from both the two groups to assess gut microbiota composition using 16S rRNA sequencing and a nocturnal pulsossimetry and polysomnography were performed in OSAS children.OSAS children showed a decreased microbial diversity in respect to healthy subjects in terms of number of observed species and Chao1 index (p = 0,01). Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was directly correlated to Sleep Clinical Record (p = 0,03). The abundance of several inflammation-related strains (Proteobacteria, Clostridiaceae, Oscillospiraceae, Klebsiella) were found significantly modified in relation to sleep parameters. Bacteria implied in the gut barrier integrity (Desulfovibrionaceae, Bacteroides fragilis and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii) were found significantly different in the two study groups and correlated with sleep parameters.OSAS children showed a lower microbiota diversity in respect to heathy subjects and an increase of inflammation and gut barrier disruptors-related strains probably induced by intermittent hypoxia. Further studies should be conducted to understand the role of gut microbiota in OSAS physiopathology and comorbidities in children.",Sleep medicine,2020,Francesco Valentini; Melania Evangelisti; Marta Arpinelli; Giovanni Di Nardo; Marina Borro; Maurizio Simmaco; Maria Pia Villa
33087994,Human Gut Microbiome Response to Short-Term <i>Bifidobacterium</i>-Based Probiotic Treatment.,"Gut microbiota is believed to play a crucial role in modulating obesity in humans, and probiotics affecting gut microbiota can alleviate some of the obesity-related health complications. The study was aimed to investigate changes in the composition of the gut microbiome in obese humans due to short-term (2 weeks) treatment of obese patients with a probiotic preparation containing <i>Bifidobacterium longum</i>. Faecal microbiome diversity was studied using the 16S amplicon sequencing by Illumina MiSeq. Bioinformatic analysis showed distribution across 14 phyla (with <i>Firmicutes</i> and <i>Bacteroidetes</i> dominating), 21 class, 125 genera and 973 OTUs. The probiotic treatment decreased relative abundance of <i>Bacteroidetes</i> (<i>Prevotellaceae</i> and <i>Bacteroidaceae</i>), while increasing that of <i>Actinobacteria</i> (<i>Bifidobacteriaceae</i> and <i>Coriobacteriaceae</i>), and <i>Firmicutes</i> (<i>Negativicutes</i>: <i>Veillonellaceae</i> and <i>Clostridia</i>: <i>Peptostreptococcaceae</i>). The probiotic treatment decreased total blood sugar and increased patients' assessment of their physical and mental health. Thus even the short-term <i>Bifidobacterium</i>-based probiotic treatment brought significant compositional changes in the 16S rRNA gene diversity in faecal bacterial assemblages by increasing beneficial and decreasing pathogenic or opportunistic bacteria; the related shifts in life quality assessment necessitate further research into the causal relationships involved.",Indian journal of microbiology,2020,Natalia Naumova; Tatiana Alikina; Alexey Tupikin; Anna Kalmykova; Galina Soldatova; Valentin Vlassov; Marsel Kabilov
33087991,Human Gut Microbiota and Mental Health: Advancements and Challenges in Microbe-Based Therapeutic Interventions.,"Gut microbes play prime role in human health and have shown to exert their influence on various physiological responses including neurological functions. Growing evidences in recent years have indicated a key role of gut microbiota in contributing to mental health. The connection between gut and brain is modulated by microbes via neural, neuroendocrinal and metabolic pathways that are mediated through various neurotransmitters and their precursors, hormones, cytokines and bioactive metabolites. Impaired functioning of this connection can lead to manifestation of mental disorders. Around 1 billion of the world population is reported to suffer from emotional, psychological and neurological imbalances, substance use disorders and cognitive, psychosocial and intellectual disabilities. Thus, it becomes imperative to understand the role of gut microbes in mental disorders. Since variations occur in the conditions associated with different mental disorders and some of them have overlapping symptoms, it becomes important to have a holistic understanding of gut dysbiosis in these disorders. In this review, we consolidate the recent data on alterations in the gut microbes and its consequences in various neurological, psychological and neurodegenerative disorders. Further, considering these evidences, several studies have been undertaken to specifically target the gut microbiota through different therapeutic interventions including administration of live microbes (psychobiotics) to treat mental health disorders and/or their symptoms. We review these studies and propose that an integrative and personalized approach, where combinations of microbe-based therapeutic interventions to modulate gut microbes and in-use psychological treatment practices can be integrated and based on patient's gut microbiome can be potentially adopted for effective treatment of the mental disorders.",Indian journal of microbiology,2020,Helianthous Verma; Sonika Phian; Priya Lakra; Jasleen Kaur; Sanjukta Subudhi; Rup Lal; Charu Dogra Rawat
33067915,Interaction between Maternal Immune Activation and Antibiotic Use during Pregnancy and Child Risk of Autism Spectrum Disorder.,"Prenatal exposure to maternal immune activation (MIA) has been implicated as a risk factor for the development of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), though the conditions under which this elevated risk occurs are unclear. Animal literature demonstrates that antibiotic use, which affects the composition of the maternal gut microbiota, modifies the effect of MIA on neurodevelopmental outcomes in the offspring. The aim of this study was to assess whether antibiotic use during pregnancy modifies the association between MIA and subsequent risk of ASD, in a prospective birth cohort with 116 ASD cases and 860 typically developing (TD) child controls. There was no evidence of interaction between fever or genitourinary infection and antibiotic use on the odds of ASD in unadjusted or adjusted analyzes. However, we found evidence of an interaction between flu, specifically in second trimester, and antibiotic use at any point during pregnancy on the odds of ASD in the child. Among women who received an antibiotic during pregnancy, flu in trimester two was not associated with ASD (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.99 [0.43-2.28]). Among women who were not exposed to an antibiotic at any point during pregnancy, flu in second trimester was significantly associated with increased odds of ASD (aOR = 4.05 [1.14-14.38], P = .03), after adjustment for child sex, child birth year, maternal age, gestational age, C-section delivery, and low birthweight. These findings should be treated as hypothesis-generating and suggest that antibiotic use may modify the influence that MIA has on autism risk in the child. LAY SUMMARY: We looked at whether the association between activation of the immune system during pregnancy and risk of the child developing autism spectrum disorder (ASD) differed among women who did or did not take an antibiotic at any point during pregnancy. We examined 116 children with ASD and 860 without ASD and found that flu in second trimester was associated with increased ASD, but only among women who did not take an antibiotic during pregnancy. No other immune activation exposures seemed to interact with antibiotic use.",Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research,2020,Calliope Holingue; Martha Brucato; Christine Ladd-Acosta; Xiumei Hong; Heather Volk; Noel T Mueller; Xiaobin Wang; M Daniele Fallin
33035575,Psychedelics as a novel approach to treating autoimmune conditions.,"With a rise in the incidence of autoimmune diseases (AiD), health care providers continue to seek out more efficacious treatment approaches for the AiD patient population. Classic serotonergic psychedelics have recently been gaining public and professional interest as novel interventions to a number of mental health afflictions. Psychedelics have also been shown to be able to modulate immune functions, however, while there has been great interest to researching into their psychotherapeutic applications, there has so far been very little exploration into the potential to treat inflammatory and immune-related diseases with these compounds. A handful of studies from a variety of fields suggest that psychedelics do indeed have effects in the body that may attenuate the outcome of AiD. This literature review explores existing evidence that psychedelic compounds may offer a potential novel application in the treatment of pathologies related to autoimmunity. We propose that psychedelics hold the potential to attenuate or even resolve autoimmunity by targeting psychosomatic origins, maladaptive chronic stress responses, inflammatory pathways, immune modulation and enteric microbiome populations.",Immunology letters,2020,Caitlin Thompson; Attila Szabo
32772900,Gut microbes in neurocognitive and mental health disorders.,"As individuals age, the prevalence of neurocognitive and mental health disorders increases. Current biomedical treatments do not completely address the management of these conditions. Despite new pharmacological therapy the challenges of managing these diseases remain.There is increasing evidence that the Gut Microbiome (GM) and microbial dysbiosis contribute to some of the more prevalent mental health and neurocognitive disorders, such as depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), schizophrenia, bipolar disorder (BP), and dementia as well as the behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. <b>Methodology:</b> Scoping review about the effect of gut microbiota on neurocognitive and mental health disorders.This scoping review found there is an evolving evidence of the involvement of the gut microbiota in the pathophysiology of neurocognitive and mental health disorders. This manuscript also discusses how the psychotropics used to treat these conditions may have an antimicrobial effect on GM, and the potential for new strategies of management with probiotics and faecal transplantation.This understanding can open up the need for a gut related approach in these disorders as well as unlock the door for the role of gut related microbiota management. KEY MESSAGES Challenges of managing mental health conditions remain in spite of new pharmacological therapy. Gut dysbiosis is seen in various mental health conditions.

33244049,Emotional well-being and gut microbiome profiles by enterotype.,"With increasing attention being paid to improving emotional well-being, recent evidence points to gut microbiota as a key player in regulating mental and physical health via bidirectional communication between the brain and gut. Here, we examine the association between emotional well-being and gut microbiome profiles (i.e., gut microbiome composition, diversity, and the moderating role of the enterotypes) among healthy Korean adults (n = 83, mean age = 48.9, SD = 13.2). The research was performed using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing to obtain gut microbiome profiles, as well as a self-report survey that included the Positive Affect Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). The cluster-based analysis identified two enterotypes dominated by the genera Bacteroides (n = 49) and Prevotella (n = 34). Generalized linear regression analysis reveals significant associations between positive emotion and gut microbiome diversity (Shannon Index) among participants in the Prevotella dominant group, whereas no such relationship emerged among participants in the Bacteroides group. Moreover, a novel genus from the family Lachnospiraceae is associated with emotional well-being scores, both positive and negative. Together, the current findings highlight the enterotype-specific links between the gut microbiota community and emotion in healthy adults and suggest the possible roles of the gut microbiome in promoting mental health.",Scientific reports,2020,Sung-Ha Lee; Seok-Hwan Yoon; Yeonjae Jung; Namil Kim; Uigi Min; Jongsik Chun; Incheol Choi
33212907,PROFAST: A Randomized Trial Assessing the Effects of Intermittent Fasting and <i>Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus</i> Probiotic among People with Prediabetes.,"Both intermittent fasting and specific probiotics have shown promise in improving glucose tolerance with a potential for synergistic effects through alterations to gut microbiota. In this randomized, double-blinded, two-arm feasibility study, we investigated whether intermittent fasting, supplemented with <i>Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus</i> HN001 probiotic, reduces HbA1c in individuals with prediabetes. All participants with HbA1c 40-50 mmol/mol commenced intermittent fasting (2 days per week of calorie restriction to 600-650 kcal/day) and were randomized 1:1 to either daily probiotic (<i>Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus</i> HN001) or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was a change in HbA1c. Secondary outcomes included changes in anthropometry, body composition, glucoregulatory markers, lipids, hunger hormones, liver enzymes, inflammatory markers, gut hormones, calorie and macronutrient intake, quality of life, hunger, mood and eating behavior. Of 33 participants who commenced the trial, 26 participants (mean age 52 years, body mass index (BMI) 34.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) completed the intervention (<i>n</i> = 11 placebo, <i>n</i> = 15 probiotic). HbA1c decreased from 43 ± 2.7 mmol/mol to 41 ± 2.3 mmol/mol, <i>p</i> < 0.001, with average of 5% weight loss. No significant between-group differences were seen in primary or secondary outcomes except for social functioning (<i>p</i> = 0.050) and mental health (<i>p</i> = 0.007) scores as improvements were seen in the probiotic group, but not in the placebo group. This study shows additional psychological benefits of probiotic supplementation during intermittent fasting to achieve weight loss and glycemic improvement in prediabetes.",Nutrients,2020,Audrey Tay; Hannah Pringle; Elise Penning; Lindsay D Plank; Rinki Murphy
33171595,PROVIT: Supplementary Probiotic Treatment and Vitamin B7 in Depression-A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Gut microbiota are suspected to affect brain functions and behavior as well as lowering inflammation status. Therefore, an effect on depression has already been suggested by recent research. The aim of this randomized double-blind controlled trial was to evaluate the effect of probiotic treatment in depressed individuals. Within inpatient care, 82 currently depressed individuals were randomly assigned to either receive a multistrain probiotic plus biotin treatment or biotin plus placebo for 28 days. Clinical symptoms as well as gut microbiome were analyzed at the begin of the study, after one and after four weeks. After 16S rRNA analysis, microbiome samples were bioinformatically explored using QIIME, SPSS, R and Piphillin. Both groups improved significantly regarding psychiatric symptoms. <i>Ruminococcus gauvreauii</i> and <i>Coprococcus 3</i> were more abundant and β-diversity was higher in the probiotics group after 28 days. KEGG-analysis showed elevated inflammation-regulatory and metabolic pathways in the intervention group. The elevated abundance of potentially beneficial bacteria after probiotic treatment allows speculations on the functionality of probiotic treatment in depressed individuals. Furthermore, the finding of upregulated vitamin B6 and B7 synthesis underlines the connection between the quality of diet, gut microbiota and mental health through the regulation of metabolic functions, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties. Concluding, four-week probiotic plus biotin supplementation, in inpatient individuals with a major depressive disorder diagnosis, showed an overall beneficial effect of clinical treatment. However, probiotic intervention compared to placebo only differed in microbial diversity profile, not in clinical outcome measures.",Nutrients,2020,Eva Z Reininghaus; Martina Platzer; Alexandra Kohlhammer-Dohr; Carlo Hamm; Sabrina Mörkl; Susanne A Bengesser; Frederike T Fellendorf; Theressa Lahousen-Luxenberger; Birgitta Leitner-Afschar; Helmut Schöggl; Daniela Amberger-Otti; Walter Wurm; Robert Queissner; Armin Birner; Valerie S Falzberger; Annamaria Painold; Werner Fitz; Jolana Wagner-Skacel; Martina Brunnmayr; Alexandra Rieger; Alexander Maget; Renate Unterweger; Karin Schwalsberger; Bernd Reininghaus; Melanie Lenger; Thomaz F S Bastiaanssen; Nina Dalkner
33177907,Gut Microbiota Changes and Their Relationship with Inflammation in Patients with Acute and Chronic Insomnia.,"The major purpose of this study was to detect the changes in gut microbiota composition and inflammatory cytokines production associated with acute and chronic insomnia. This study also evaluated the relationship between gut microbiota changes and increased inflammatory cytokines in insomnia patients.Outpatients with acute and chronic insomnia (aged 26-55 years; n=20 and 38, respectively) and age/gender-matched healthy controls (n=38) were recruited from a southern China region. Participants' gut microbiome, plasma cytokines, and self-reported sleep quality and psychopathological symptoms were measured.The gut microbiomes of insomnia patients compared with healthy controls were characterized by lower microbial richness and diversity, depletion of anaerobes, and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria, and an expansion of potential pathobionts. <i>Lachnospira</i> and <i>Bacteroides</i> were signature bacteria for distinguishing acute insomnia patients from healthy controls, while <i>Faecalibacterium</i> and <i>Blautia</i> were signature bacteria for distinguishing chronic insomnia patients from healthy controls. Acute/chronic insomnia-related signature bacteria also showed correlations with these patients' self-reported sleep quality and plasma IL-1β.These ﬁndings suggest that insomnia symptomology, gut microbiota, and inflammation may be interrelated in complex ways. Gut microbiota may serve as an important indicator for auxiliary diagnosis of insomnia and provide possible new therapeutic targets in the ﬁeld of sleep disorders.",Nature and science of sleep,2020,Yuanyuan Li; Bin Zhang; Ya Zhou; Daoming Wang; Xianchen Liu; Lin Li; Tong Wang; Yuechu Zhang; Min Jiang; Huilan Tang; Lawrence V Amsel; Fang Fan; Christina W Hoven
33139656,Gut Biofactory-Neurocompetent Metabolites within the Gastrointestinal Tract. A Scoping Review.,"The gut microbiota have gained much scientific attention recently. Apart from unravelling the taxonomic data, we should understand how the altered microbiota structure corresponds to functions of this complex ecosystem. The metabolites of intestinal microorganisms, especially bacteria, exert pleiotropic effects on the human organism and contribute to the host systemic balance. These molecules play key roles in regulating immune and metabolic processes. A subset of them affect the gut brain axis signaling and balance the mental wellbeing. Neurotransmitters, short chain fatty acids, tryptophan catabolites, bile acids and phosphatidylcholine, choline, serotonin, and <i>L</i>-carnitine metabolites possess high neuroactive potential. A scoping literature search in PubMed/Embase was conducted up until 20 June 2020, using three major search terms ""microbiota metabolites"" AND ""gut brain axis"" AND ""mental health"".

32739746,Colonization with the commensal fungus Candida albicans perturbs the gut-brain axis through dysregulation of endocannabinoid signaling.,"Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent mental health disorder worldwide, with a lifetime prevalence of 5-7 % of the human population. Although the etiology of anxiety disorders is incompletely understood, one aspect of host health that affects anxiety disorders is the gut-brain axis. Adolescence is a key developmental window in which stress and anxiety disorders are a major health concern. We used adolescent female mice in a gastrointestinal (GI) colonization model to demonstrate that the commensal fungus Candida albicans affects host health via the gut-brain axis. In mice, bacterial members of the gut microbiota can influence the host gut-brain axis, affecting anxiety-like behavior and the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis which produces the stress hormone corticosterone (CORT). Here we showed that mice colonized with C. albicans demonstrated increased anxiety-like behavior and increased basal production of CORT as well as dysregulation of CORT production following acute stress. The HPA axis and anxiety-like behavior are negatively regulated by the endocannabinoid N-arachidonoylethanolamide (AEA). We demonstrated that C. albicans-colonized mice exhibited changes in the endocannabinoidome. Further, increasing AEA levels using the well-characterized fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitor URB597 was sufficient to reverse both neuroendocrine phenotypes in C. albicans-colonized mice. Thus, a commensal fungus that is a common colonizer of humans had widespread effects on the physiology of its host. To our knowledge, this is the first report of microbial manipulation of the endocannabinoid (eCB) system that resulted in neuroendocrine changes contributing to anxiety-like behavior.",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2020,Laura Markey; Andrew Hooper; Laverne C Melon; Samantha Baglot; Matthew N Hill; Jamie Maguire; Carol A Kumamoto
32032668,Maternal Obesity as a Risk Factor for Brain Development and Mental Health in the Offspring.,"Maternal obesity plays a key role in the health trajectory of the offspring. Although research on this topic has largely focused on the potential of this condition to increase the risk for child obesity, it is becoming more and more evident that it can also significantly impact cognitive function and mental health. The mechanisms underlying these effects are starting to be elucidated and point to the placenta as a critical organ that may mediate changes in the response to stress, immune function and oxidative stress. Long-term effects of maternal obesity may rely upon epigenetic changes in selected genes that are involved in metabolic and trophic regulations of the brain. More recent evidence also indicates the gut microbiota as a potential mediator of these effects. Overall, understanding cause-effect relationships can allow the development of preventive measures that could rely upon dietary changes in the mother and the offspring. Addressing diets appears more feasible than developing new pharmacological targets and has the potential to affect the multiple interconnected physiological pathways engaged by these complex regulations, allowing prevention of both metabolic and mental disorders.",Neuroscience,2020,Francesca Cirulli; Chiara Musillo; Alessandra Berry
33195226,Microbiome Profiling Reveals Gut Dysbiosis in the Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 5 Knockout Mouse Model of Schizophrenia.,"Schizophrenia (SZ) is a psychiatric disorder that constitutes one of the top 10 global causes of disability. More recently, a potential pathogenic role for the gut microbial community (microbiota) has been highlighted, with numerous studies describing dysregulated microbial profiles in SZ patients when compared to healthy controls. However, no animal model of SZ has previously recapitulated the gut dysbiosis observed clinically. Since the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu5) knockout mice provide a preclinical model of SZ with strong face and predictive validity, in the present study we performed gut microbiome profiling of mGlu5 knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice by 16S rRNA sequencing of bacterial genomic DNA from fecal samples, analyzing bacterial diversity and taxonomic composition, as well as gastrointestinal parameters as indicators of gut function. We found a significant genotype difference in microbial beta diversity. Analysis of composition of microbiomes (ANCOM) models were performed to evaluate microbiota compositions, which identified a decreased relative abundance of the <i>Erysipelotrichaceae</i> family and <i>Allobaculum</i> genus in this mouse model of SZ. We also identified a signature of bacteria discriminating between the genotypes (KO and WT), consisting of the Erysipelotrichales, Bacteroidales, and Clostridiales orders and macroscopic gut differences. We thus uncovered global differential community composition in the gut microbiota profile between mGlu5 KO and WT mice, outlining the first evidence for gut dysbiosis in a genetic animal model of SZ. Our findings suggest that this widely used preclinical model of SZ also has substantial utility for investigations of gut dysbiosis and associated signaling via the microbiota-gut-brain axis, as potential modulators of SZ pathogenesis. Our discovery opens up new avenues to explore gut dysbiosis and its proposed links to brain dysfunction in SZ, as well as novel therapeutic approaches to this devastating disorder.",Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,2020,Carolina Gubert; Geraldine Kong; Volkan Uzungil; Ariel M Zeleznikow-Johnston; Emma L Burrows; Thibault Renoir; Anthony J Hannan
33194817,Multiomics Study of Gut Bacteria and Host Metabolism in Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Depression Patients.,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and depression have high tendencies of comorbidity. In particular, diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) and depression exhibit similar fecal microbiota signatures, yet little is known about their pathogenic mechanism. Here, we propose that the differences in structure and composition of IBS-D and depression gut microbiota give rise to different downstream functions, which lead to distinct clinical phenotypes <i>via</i> host metabolism and further influence the interaction of brain-gut axis.We performed multiomics study, including fecal metagenome-wide sequencing and serum metabolomics profiling in 65 individuals with IBS-D (n=22), depression (n=15), comorbid patients (n=13), and healthy controls (n=15). We analyzed functional genes contributed by the primary genus and evaluated their correlations with clinical indices and host metabolites.Metagenomic analysis revealed 26 clusters of orthologous groups of protein (COG) categories consisting of a total of 4,631 functional genes. Trehalose and maltose hydrolase (COG1554) and fucose permease (COG0738) were the most relevant and enriched functional genes in the IBS-D patients; urease accessory proteins UreE (COG2371) was that in the depression patients. Context based genome annotation suggest that an alteration of <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Enterobacter cloacae</i> in IBS-D and depression respectively may be responsible for the enrichment described above. Correlation with host metabolites, such as maltotriose and isomaltose in carbohydrate metabolism and anandamide in neuroactive metabolism, drew further connections between these findings.These changes led us to propose a connection between genomic signatures and clinical differences observed in IBS-D and depression. Our findings provide further insights into the involvement of gut microbiota in diseases related to brain-gut disorder.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2020,Congmin Xu; Qiong Jia; Lu Zhang; Zhe Wang; Shiwei Zhu; Xiaoqi Wang; Yixuan Liu; Mo Li; Jingjing Zhang; Xiangqun Wang; Jindong Zhang; Qinghua Sun; Kun Wang; Huaiqiu Zhu; Liping Duan
33105830,Probiotics in Treatment of Viral Respiratory Infections and Neuroinflammatory Disorders.,"Inflammation is a biological response to the activation of the immune system by various infectious or non-infectious agents, which may lead to tissue damage and various diseases. Gut commensal bacteria maintain a symbiotic relationship with the host and display a critical function in the homeostasis of the host immune system. Disturbance to the gut microbiota leads to immune dysfunction both locally and at distant sites, which causes inflammatory conditions not only in the intestine but also in the other organs such as lungs and brain, and may induce a disease state. Probiotics are well known to reinforce immunity and counteract inflammation by restoring symbiosis within the gut microbiota. As a result, probiotics protect against various diseases, including respiratory infections and neuroinflammatory disorders. A growing body of research supports the beneficial role of probiotics in lung and mental health through modulating the gut-lung and gut-brain axes. In the current paper, we discuss the potential role of probiotics in the treatment of viral respiratory infections, including the COVID-19 disease, as major public health crisis in 2020, and influenza virus infection, as well as treatment of neurological disorders like multiple sclerosis and other mental illnesses.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2020,Roghayeh Shahbazi; Hamed Yasavoli-Sharahi; Nawal Alsadi; Nafissa Ismail; Chantal Matar
33067279,Effects of sulforaphane on cognitive function in patients with frontal brain damage: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.,"Many patients with frontal brain damage show serious cognitive function deficits, which hamper their quality of life and result in poor clinical outcomes. Preclinical research has shown that sulforaphane can significantly improve spatial localisation and working memory impairment after brain injury. The primary aim of this double-blind randomised controlled clinical trial is to assess the efficacy of sulforaphane for improving cognitive function in patients with frontal brain damage.Ninety eligible patients will be randomly allocated to an active treatment or a placebo group in a 2:1 ratio. Participants will undergo a series of cognitive and neuropsychiatric tests at baseline (week 0) and after 12 weeks to determine the effect of sulforaphane on cognition. Magnetic resonance spectrum of the brain will be studied using the 3T MRIs of the brain to detect brain metabolites markers, including N-acetyl aspartate, glutamate (Glu), glutathione (GSH) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Blood brain-derived neurotrophic factor, Glu, GSH and GABA levels and gut microbiota will also be assessed over this period. This study will also evaluate long-term outcomes of brain trauma, brain tumours and cerebrovascular disease via exploratory analyses. The primary outcome will be the difference in scores of a battery of cognitive tests after 12 weeks of sulforaphane treatment. The secondary outcomes will be changes in the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, the changes in T1-weighted MRI and resting-state functional MRI findings, and changes in brain and blood metabolic markers and gut microbiota at weeks 0 and 12. We expect that sulforaphane will yield favourable results in treating memory and learning deficits for patients with frontal brain damage. Cognitive functional treatment may also improve brain trauma, brain tumours and cerebrovascular outcomes.The study protocol has been approved by the Medical Ethics committee of the Xiangya Hospital of Central South University (No. 2017121019). The results will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and at international conferences.This trial was registered on Clinicaltrials.gov on 31 January 2020 (NCT04252261).

33066107,Effects of <i>Bifidobacterium animalis</i> Subsp. <i>lactis</i> (BPL1) Supplementation in Children and Adolescents with Prader-Willi Syndrome: A Randomized Crossover Trial.,"Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a wide range of clinical manifestations, including obesity, hyperphagia, and behavioral problems. <i>Bifidobacterium animalis</i> subsp. <i>lactis</i> strain BPL1 has been shown to improve central adiposity in adults with simple obesity. To evaluate BPL1's effects in children with PWS, we performed a randomized crossover trial among 39 patients (mean age 10.4 years). Participants were randomized to placebo-BPL1 (<i>n</i> = 19) or BPL1-placebo (<i>n</i> = 20) sequences and underwent a 12-week period with placebo/BPL1 treatments, a 12-week washout period, and a 12-week period with the crossover treatment. Thirty-five subjects completed the study. The main outcome was changes in adiposity, measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Secondary outcomes included lipid and glucose metabolism, hyperphagia, and mental health symptoms. Generalized linear modeling was applied to assess differences between treatments. While BPL1 did not modify total fat mass compared to placebo, BPL1 decreased abdominal adiposity in a subgroup of patients older than 4.5 years (<i>n</i> = 28). BPL1 improved fasting insulin concentration and insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, we observed modest improvements in some mental health symptoms. A follow-up trial with a longer treatment period is warranted to determine whether BPL1 supplementation can provide a long-term therapeutic approach for children with PWS (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03548480).",Nutrients,2020,Montse Amat-Bou; Sonika Garcia-Ribera; Eric Climent; Irene Piquer-Garcia; Raquel Corripio; David Sanchez-Infantes; Laia Villalta; Maria Elias; Josep C Jiménez-Chillarón; Empar Chenoll; Daniel Ramón; Lourdes Ibañez; Marta Ramon-Krauel; Carles Lerin
32989186,Effects of a Psychobiotic Supplement on Serum Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor Levels in Depressive Patients: A <i>Post Hoc</i> Analysis of a Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Psychobiotics are probiotics or prebiotics that, upon ingestion in adequate amounts, yield positive influence on mental health via microbiota-gut-brain axis regulation to modulate the circulating cytokines, chemokines, neurotransmitters, or neurotrophins levels. We have recently shown that a psychobiotic combination (<i>Lactobacillus helveticus</i> R0052 and <i>Bifidobacterium longum</i> R0175; CEREBIOME) significantly improved depression symptoms in patients with depression. Recent animal data suggest the influence of the gut microbiota on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which was shown to correlate with antidepressant response in depressive patients. Therefore, we conducted this exploratory <i>post hoc</i> analysis of BDNF levels to clarify the mechanism of action of this psychobiotic in our cohort.Our study was a double-blind, randomized controlled trial of patients with low-to-moderate depression receiving either a probiotic combination, prebiotic or placebo. From the 110 patients randomized in the trial, 78 were included in this <i>post hoc</i> analysis (probiotic, n = 28; prebiotic and placebo, n = 25). We compared serum BDNF levels from participants at baseline and endpoint, and assessed the Pearson correlation between depression severity and BDNF levels for each intervention.We found that post-intervention BDNF levels were significantly different between groups (<i>P</i> < 0.001). Furthermore, BDNF levels increased significantly in the probiotic group compared to both the prebiotic (<i>P</i> < 0.001) and placebo groups (<i>P</i> = 0.021), which inversely correlated with depression severity compared to placebo (ANOVA/ANCOVA, <i>P</i> = 0.012; Pearson, <i>r</i> = -0.79, <i>P</i> < 0.001). In the prebiotic group, BDNF levels reduced but not significantly compared with placebo group (<i>P</i> > 0.05).Eight-week supplementation with B. longum and L. helveticus in depressive patients improved depression symptoms, possibly by increasing BDNF levels.",Journal of neurogastroenterology and motility,2020,Nazanin Heidarzadeh-Rad; Hülya Gökmen-Özel; Asma Kazemi; Negin Almasi; Kurosh Djafarian
32918633,Early Life Stress and the Development of the Infant Gut Microbiota: Implications for Mental Health and Neurocognitive Development.,"We review the state of the literature examining associations between early life stress (ELS), gut microbiota, and neurocognitive development and mental health in animals and humans. We identify gaps in current models and areas for future research.ELS is associated with changes in gut microbiota, which correspond to changes in affective and cognitive functioning in both animals and humans. Some of these ELS-induced psychological changes can be remedied by supplementation with probiotics in early life, suggesting a potential area for intervention for ELS-exposed children. Prenatal stress exposure is rarely studied in humans in relation to gut microbiota, but animal work has suggested important associations between prenatal stress and fetal programming that should be tested in humans. The gut microbiota plays an important role in the association between ELS, neurocognitive development, and mental health. More work is needed to fully understand these associations in humans.",Current psychiatry reports,2020,Sarah C Vogel; Natalie H Brito; Bridget L Callaghan
32899236,"Alcohol Addiction, Gut Microbiota, and Alcoholism Treatment: A Review.","Alcohol addiction is a leading risk factor for personal death and disability. In 2016, alcohol use caused 2.2% of female deaths and 6.8% of male deaths, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were 2.3% in female and 8.9% in male. Individuals with alcohol use disorder are at high risk of anxiety, depression, impaired cognition performance, and illicit drug use and are comorbid with liver disease, such as alcoholic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis, which is a major cause of personal death and disability worldwide. Psychological interventions, such as cognitive behavior therapy and motivational interviewing, as well as medical treatments, such as disulfiram, naltrexone, acamprosate, and nalmefene, are used for the treatment of alcohol addiction in Europe and the United States. However, the effect of current interventions is limited, and the need for additional interventions is substantial. Alcohol use impairs the intestinal barrier and causes changes to the intestinal permeability as well as the gut microbiota composition. Emerging studies have tried to reveal the role of the gut-brain axis among individuals with alcohol use disorder with or without alcohol liver disease. Bacterial products penetrate the impaired intestinal barrier and cause central inflammation; changes to the gut microbiota impair enterohepatic circulation of bile acids; alcohol abuse causes shortage of vital nutrients such as thiamine. Several studies have suggested that probiotics, through either oral administration or fecal microbiota transplantation, increased intestinal levels of potentially beneficial bacteria such as bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, improving the levels of liver-associated enzymes in patients with mild alcoholic hepatitis, and demonstrating beneficial psychotropic effects on anxiety and depression. In addition to medications for alcohol addiction, gene editing therapy such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) may be another potential research target. Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), which are associated with ADH and ALDH genes, are major enzymes involved in alcohol metabolism, and gene editing approaches may have the potential to directly modify specific genes to treat alcoholism caused by genetic defects. Further research is needed to study the effect of the combined treatment for alcohol addiction.",International journal of molecular sciences,2020,Shao-Cheng Wang; Yuan-Chuan Chen; Shaw-Ji Chen; Chun-Hung Lee; Ching-Ming Cheng

We searched on Pubmed, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES and Sciencedirect articles with the keywords psychiatric disorders, epigenome, microbiome and family relationships.Some gene polymorphisms interact with negative environment and lead to psychiatric disorders. Negative environment is correlated with different epigenetic modifications in genes implicated in mental health. Gut microbiota diversity affect host epigenetic. Animal studies showed evidences for a transgenerational transmission of epigenetic characteristics.Our findings support the hypothesis that epigenetic mediate gene-environment interactions and psychiatric disorders. Several environmental characteristics such as traumatic life events, family adversity, psychological stress or internal environment such as gut microbiota diversity and diet showed an impact on epigenetic.

32485204,Probiotic treatment (Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum 35624™) affects stress responsivity in male rats after chronic corticosterone exposure.,"Mounting evidence suggests that gut microbiota do not only regulate intestinal function and health, but that they also play a role in mental health via the gut-brain axis. Previous research further suggests that probiotics may have beneficial health effects, but more research is needed to confirm these beneficial effects and better understand the underlying mechanisms and potential sex differences in the response to probiotics. Therefore, the current study investigates the effects of chronic administration of the commercially available probiotic Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum 35624™(B. 35624) to male and female rats under control or ""stressed"" conditions. For this, 24 male and 24 female Sprague-Dawley rats were either given daily corticosterone injections (40 mg/kg; to induce depressive-like behavior and a ""stressed"" condition) or oil injections (controls) together with oral administration of B.35624 or vehicle for 21 days (n = 5-7/group). Animals performed the Open Field Test (OFT) and Forced Swim Test (FST) and several blood samples were collected to investigate basal as well as stress-induced corticosterone levels. Rats were sacrificed on day 22 and their brains sliced and stained with doublecortin, a marker of immature neurons. Results showed that B.35624 was not able to rescue depressive-like behavior or induce changes in neurogenesis in males or females, but the probiotic impacted hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis functioning in male animals and tended to reduce anxiolytic behavior in the OFT. More research is needed to further elucidate the potential health effects of probiotics especially in regard to possible sex differences.",Behavioural brain research,2020,Gabriel S Haas; Wan Wang; Malak Saffar; Sean M Mooney-Leber; Susanne Brummelte

33005148,Sensitivity to Morphine Reward Associates With Gut Dysbiosis in Rats With Morphine-Induced Conditioned Place Preference.,"Gut microbiota has been found to establish a bidirectional relationship with the central nervous system. Variations of the gut microbiota has been implicated in various mental disorders, including opioid use disorders. Morphine exposure has been repeatedly found to disrupt the gut microbiota, but association between the gut microbiota and the sensitivity to morphine reward remains unknown. In this study the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm was used for morphine-treated rats and saline-treated rats. After the CPP procedure, the morphine-treated rats were divided equally into the low and high CPP (L- and H-CPP) groups according to the CPP scores. We adopted 16S rRNA sequencing for the fecal bacterial communities at baseline and post-conditioning. By comparing the morphine-treated group with saline-treated group, we found alterations of microbial composition in the morphine-treated group, but no significant differences in alpha diversity. The L-CPP group and H-CPP group differed in microbial composition both before and after morphine treatment. The relative abundance of certain taxa was correlated to the CPP scores, such as <i>Alloprevotella</i> and <i>Romboutsia</i>. This study provides direct evidence that morphine exposure alters the composition of the gut microbiota in rats and that microbial alterations are correlated to the sensitivity to morphine reward. These findings may help develop novel therapeutic and preventive strategies for opioid use disorder.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2020,Jingyuan Zhang; Jun Yang; Cheng Yang; Ti Chen; Ziwei Wang; Junyi Li; Fanglin Qin; Qijian Deng; Xiaojie Zhang
32819434,The gut microbiota regulates autism-like behavior by mediating vitamin B<sub>6</sub> homeostasis in EphB6-deficient mice.,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder, and the effective pharmacological treatments for the core autistic symptoms are currently limited. Increasing evidence, particularly that from clinical studies on ASD patients, suggests a functional link between the gut microbiota and the development of ASD. However, the mechanisms linking the gut microbiota with brain dysfunctions (gut-brain axis) in ASD have not yet been full elucidated. Due to its genetic mutations and downregulated expression in patients with ASD, EPHB6, which also plays important roles in gut homeostasis, is generally considered a candidate gene for ASD. Nonetheless, the role and mechanism of EPHB6 in regulating the gut microbiota and the development of ASD are unclear.Here, we found that the deletion of EphB6 induced autism-like behavior and disturbed the gut microbiota in mice. More importantly, transplantation of the fecal microbiota from EphB6-deficient mice resulted in autism-like behavior in antibiotic-treated C57BL/6J mice, and transplantation of the fecal microbiota from wild-type mice ameliorated the autism-like behavior in EphB6-deficient mice. At the metabolic level, the disturbed gut microbiota in EphB6-deficient mice led to vitamin B<sub>6</sub> and dopamine defects. At the cellular level, the excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance in the medial prefrontal cortex was regulated by gut microbiota-mediated vitamin B<sub>6</sub> in EphB6-deficient mice.Our study uncovers a key role for the gut microbiota in the regulation of autism-like social behavior by vitamin B<sub>6</sub>, dopamine, and the E/I balance in EphB6-deficient mice, and these findings suggest new strategies for understanding and treating ASD.

32799901,Ingestion of Lactobacillus intestinalis and Lactobacillus reuteri causes depression- and anhedonia-like phenotypes in antibiotic-treated mice via the vagus nerve.,"The brain-gut-microbiota axis plays a role in the pathogenesis of stress-related disorders such as depression. In this study, we examined the effects of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in mice with antibiotic-treated microbiota depletion.The fecal microbiota was obtained from mice subjected to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) and control (no CSDS) mice. FMT from these two groups was performed to antibiotic-treated mice. 16S rRNA analysis was performed to examine the composition of gut microbiota. Furthermore, the effects of subdiaphragmatic vagotomy in depression-like phenotypes after ingestion of microbes were examined.The ingestion of fecal microbiota from CSDS-susceptible mice resulted in an anhedonia-like phenotype, higher plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), and decreased expression of synaptic proteins in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in antibiotic-treated mice but not in water-treated mice. 16S rRNA analysis suggested that two microbes (Lactobacillus intestinalis and Lactobacillus reuteri) may be responsible for the anhedonia-like phenotype in antibiotic-treated mice after FMT. Ingestion of these two microbes for 14 days led to depression- and anhedonia-like phenotypes, higher plasma IL-6 levels, and decreased expression of synaptic proteins in the PFC of antibiotic-treated mice. Interestingly, subdiaphragmatic vagotomy significantly blocked the development of behavioral abnormalities, elevation of plasma IL-6 levels, and downregulation of synaptic proteins in the PFC after ingestion of these two microbes.These findings suggest that microbiota depletion using an antibiotic cocktail is essential for the development of FMT-induced behavioral changes and that the vagus nerve plays a key role in behavioral abnormalities in antibiotic-treated mice after the ingestion of L. intestinalis and L. reuteri. Therefore, it is likely that the brain-gut-microbiota axis participates in the pathogenesis of depression via the vagus nerve.",Journal of neuroinflammation,2020,Siming Wang; Tamaki Ishima; Jiancheng Zhang; Youge Qu; Lijia Chang; Yaoyu Pu; Yuko Fujita; Yunfei Tan; Xingming Wang; Kenji Hashimoto
32816830,"Does Fibre-fix provided to people with irritable bowel syndrome who are consuming a low FODMAP diet improve their gut health, gut microbiome, sleep and mental health? A double-blinded, randomised controlled trial.","A diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) is an effective way to reduce gut symptoms in people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This diet reduces the intake of fermentable fibres, leading to changes of the gut microbiota and insufficient fermentation in the large bowel, resulting in reduced production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as butyrate, which has unfavourable implications for gut health, sleep and mental health. This study will examine the effect of Fibre-fix, a supplement containing a mix of dietary fibres, on the human gut microbiome composition, fermentative capacity, sleep, quality of life (QOL) and mental health of people with IBS who consume a low FODMAP diet (LFD).A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, study design is proposed to examine whether Fibre-fix added to an existing LFD may help modulate gastrointestinal function, improve markers of sleep, mental health and promote QOL in patients with IBS. Participants will provide stool and blood samples, daily bowel symptoms diaries and 3-day diet records. Additionally, they will complete validated questionnaires relating to FODMAP intake, sleep, mental health and QOL before and after a 3-week intervention. Gut health will be assessed via faecal microbiome composition, faecal pH and SCFA levels. Alteration of sleep will be recorded using an actigraphy device worn by all participants over the whole study. Multivariate analysis will be used to examine the gut microbiome and repeated measures Analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used for dependent variables from questionnaires related to bowel symptoms, stool type, sleep, mental health and QOL to assess the differences between intervention and control groups after adjustment for confounding variables.Ethics approval was obtained from the Human Research Ethics Committee of Edith Cowan University (2019-00619-YAN). Results will be disseminated in peer-review journal publications, and conference presentations. Participants will be provided with a summary of findings once the study is completed. If Fibre-fix is shown to result in favourable changes in gut microbial composition, SCFA production, sleep and mental well-being without exacerbating symptoms, this will provide additional dietary management options for those with IBS following an LFD.ACTRN12620000032954.",BMJ open gastroenterology,2020,Ran Yan; Mandy Murphy; Angela Genoni; Evania Marlow; Ian C Dunican; Johnny Lo; Lesley Andrew; Amanda Devine; Claus T Christophersen
32459708,The role of the gut microbiota in the pathophysiology of mental and neurological disorders.,"In recent decades, the concept of the gut microbiota as a potential novel therapeutic strategy for mental health has emerged. The tiny microbes inhabiting our gut communicate through a bidirectional communication signaling with the brain that influences gut physiology, brain function and behavior. Accumulating evidence suggests that perturbation of the gut microbiota contributes to the pathophysiology of mental illnesses including autism, depression and anxiety as well as neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. This review will highlight recent findings in both human and animal studies indicating how changes in the gut microbiota can impact the pathophysiology of such diseases. The current work will also provide an understanding of the efficacy of microbiota-targeted therapies on psychiatric disorders.",Psychiatric genetics,2020,Matteo M Pusceddu; Josep M Del Bas
33005892,"Gut dysbiosis in Huntington's disease: associations among gut microbiota, cognitive performance and clinical outcomes.","Huntington's disease is characterized by a triad of motor, cognitive and psychiatric impairments, as well as unintended weight loss. Although much of the research has focused on cognitive, motor and psychiatric symptoms, the extent of peripheral pathology and the relationship between these factors, and the core symptoms of Huntington's disease, are relatively unknown. Gut microbiota are key modulators of communication between the brain and gut, and alterations in microbiota composition (dysbiosis) can negatively affect cognition, behaviour and affective function, and may be implicated in disease progression. Furthermore, gut dysbiosis was recently reported in Huntington's disease transgenic mice. Our main objective was to characterize the gut microbiome in people with Huntington's disease and determine whether the composition of gut microbiota are significantly related to clinical indicators of disease progression. We compared 42 Huntington's disease gene expansion carriers, including 19 people who were diagnosed with Huntington's disease (Total Functional Capacity > 6) and 23 in the premanifest stage, with 36 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Participants were characterized clinically using a battery of cognitive tests and using results from 16S V3 to V4 rRNA sequencing of faecal samples to characterize the gut microbiome. For gut microbiome measures, we found significant differences in the microbial communities (beta diversity) based on unweighted UniFrac distance (<i>P </i>=<i> </i>0.001), as well as significantly lower alpha diversity (species richness and evenness) between our combined Huntington's disease gene expansion carrier group and healthy controls (<i>P </i>=<i> </i>0.001). We also found major shifts in the microbial community structure at Phylum and Family levels, and identified functional pathways and enzymes affected in our Huntington's disease gene expansion carrier group. Within the Huntington's disease gene expansion carrier group, we also discovered associations among gut bacteria, cognitive performance and clinical outcomes. Overall, our findings suggest an altered gut microbiome in Huntington's disease gene expansion carriers. These results highlight the importance of gut biomarkers and raise interesting questions regarding the role of the gut in Huntington's disease, and whether it may be a potential target for future therapeutic intervention.",Brain communications,2020,Cory I Wasser; Emily-Clare Mercieca; Geraldine Kong; Anthony J Hannan; Sonja J McKeown; Yifat Glikmann-Johnston; Julie C Stout
32389857,Targeting the microbiota in pharmacology of psychiatric disorders.,"There is increasing interest in the role of the gut microbiota in health and disease. In particular, gut microbiota influences the Central Nervous System (CNS) development and homeostasis through neural pathways or routes involving the immune and circulatory systems. The CNS, in turn, shapes the intestinal flora through endocrine or stress-mediated responses. These overall bidirectional interactions, known as gut microbiota-brain axis, profoundly affect some brain functions, such as neurogenesis and the production of neurotransmitters, up to influence behavioral aspects of healthy subjects. Consequently, a dysfunction within this axis, as observed in case of dysbiosis, can have an impact on the behavior of a given individual (e.g. anxiety and depression) or on the development of pathologies affecting the CNS, such as autism spectrum disorders and neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease). It should be considered that the whole microbiota has a significant role not only on aspects concerning human physiology, such as harvesting of nutrients and energy from the ingested food or production of a wide range of bioactive compounds, but also has positive effects on the gastrointestinal barrier function and actively contributes to the pharmacokinetics of several compounds including neuropsychiatric drugs. Indeed, the microbiota is able to affect drug absorption and metabolism up to have an impact on drug activity and/or toxicity. On the other hand, drugs are able to shape the human gut microbiota itself, where these changes may contribute to their pharmacologic profile. Therefore, the emerging picture on the complex drug-microbiota bidirectional interplay will have considerable implications in the future not only in terms of clinical practice but also, upstream, on drug development.",Pharmacological research,2020,Alessia Pascale; Nicoletta Marchesi; Stefano Govoni; Annalisa Barbieri
32379622,Betaine supplementation is associated with the resilience in mice after chronic social defeat stress: a role of brain-gut-microbiota axis.,"The brain-gut-microbiota axis plays a role in the pathogenesis of stress-related psychiatric disorders; however, its role in the resilience versus susceptibility after stress remains unclear. Dietary nutrient betaine is suggested to affect the gut microbiome. Here, we examined whether betaine supplementation can affect anhedonia-like phenotype in mice subjected to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS).CSDS was performed during betaine supplementation. Sucrose preference test and 16S rRNA analysis of fecal samples were performed.CSDS did not produce an anhedonia-like phenotype in the betaine-treated mice, but did induce an anhedonia-like phenotype in water-treated mice. Furthermore, CSDS treatment did not alter the plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) of betaine-treated mice whereas CSDS caused higher plasma levels of IL-6 in water-treated mice. Betaine supplementation ameliorated the abnormal diversity and composition of the microbiota in the host gut after CSDS. At the genus level, CSDS caused marked increases in the several bacteria of water-treated mice, but not betaine-treated mice. CSDS increased levels of short-chain fatty acids (i.e., succinic acid and acetic acid) in feces from water-treated mice, but not betaine-treated mice. Interestingly, there are positive correlations between short-chain fatty acids (i.e., succinic acid, acetic acid, butyric acid) and several bacteria among the groups.Specific microbiome were not determined.These findings suggest that betaine supplementation contributed to resilience to anhedonia in mice subjected to CSDS through anti-inflammation action. Therefore, it is likely that betaine could be a prophylactic nutrient to prevent stress-related psychiatric disorders.",Journal of affective disorders,2020,Youge Qu; Kai Zhang; Yaoyu Pu; Lijia Chang; Siming Wang; Yunfei Tan; Xingming Wang; Jiancheng Zhang; Tetsuo Ohnishi; Takeo Yoshikawa; Kenji Hashimoto
32224141,Molecular mechanisms of the rapid-acting and long-lasting antidepressant actions of (R)-ketamine.,"Ketamine, an anesthetic developed in the early 1960s, is also a popular abused drug among young people at dance parties and raves and among spiritual seekers, because it produces schizophrenia-like symptoms and dissociation (i.e., out-of-body experience). Regarding mood disorders, ketamine exerts robust antidepressant actions in treatment-resistant patients with depression. Ketamine is a racemic mixture comprising equal parts of (R)-ketamine (or arketamine) and (S)-ketamine (or esketamine). The United States (US) Food and Drug Administration approved the J&J (S)-ketamine nasal spray for treatment-resistant depression on March 5, 2019; the spray was then approved in Europe (December 19, 2019). Although (R)-ketamine has lower affinity for the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) vs. (S)-ketamine, (R)-ketamine has greater potency and longer-lasting antidepressant-like actions in animal models of depression. Importantly, (R)-ketamine has less detrimental side effects than does (R,S)-ketamine or (S)-ketamine in rodents, monkeys, and humans. A role for the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) receptor in the antidepressant effects of ketamine and its two enantiomers has been suggested. A recent RNA-sequencing analysis suggested that the transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) plays a role in the antidepressant effects of (R)-ketamine. A recent pilot study demonstrated that (R)-ketamine had rapid-acting and sustained antidepressant effects in treatment-resistant patients with depression. In this article, the author reviews the mechanisms of the antidepressant actions of the enantiomers of ketamine and its metabolites, (S)-norketamine and (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine (HNK) and discusses the role of the brain-gut-microbiota axis and brain-spleen axis in stress-related psychiatric disorders, such as depression.",Biochemical pharmacology,2020,Kenji Hashimoto
32149335,The Role of the Gut Microbiota in Dietary Interventions for Depression and Anxiety.,"There is emerging evidence that an unhealthy dietary pattern may increase the risk of developing depression or anxiety, whereas a healthy dietary pattern may decrease it. This nascent research suggests that dietary interventions could help prevent, or be an alternative or adjunct therapy for, depression and anxiety. The relation, however, is complex, affected by many confounding variables, and is also likely to be bidirectional, with dietary choices being affected by stress and depression. This complexity is reflected in the data, with sometimes conflicting results among studies. As the research evolves, all characteristics of the relation need to be considered to ensure that we obtain a full understanding, which can potentially be translated into clinical practice. A parallel and fast-growing body of research shows that the gut microbiota is linked with the brain in a bidirectional relation, commonly termed the microbiome-gut-brain axis. Preclinical evidence suggests that this axis plays a key role in the regulation of brain function and behavior. In this review we discuss possible reasons for the conflicting results in diet-mood research, and present examples of areas of the diet-mood relation in which the gut microbiota is likely to be involved, potentially explaining some of the conflicting results from diet and depression studies. We argue that because diet is one of the most significant factors that affects human gut microbiota structure and function, nutritional intervention studies need to consider the gut microbiota as an essential piece of the puzzle.","Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2020,Tracey L K Bear; Julie E Dalziel; Jane Coad; Nicole C Roy; Christine A Butts; Pramod K Gopal

The aims of this study were to evaluate whether a community-based cooking program instigated a change to participants' skills, attitudes, knowledge, enjoyment and satisfaction of cooking and cooking confidence (self-efficacy).The pseudo-random, pre-post study design consisted of an intervention and a control group. Participant recruitment and group allocation was based on their program start dates. Intervention participants were surveyed three times (baseline, 7 weeks and 6 months) and the control group were surveyed at baseline and 5 weeks. All participants were registered via an online website and were 18 years or over. Upon consent, participants were offered four levels of commitment, defined by different assessments. The minimum participation level included an online survey and levels 2, 3 and 4 involved attendance at a clinic with increasing functional, anthropometric and biomarker measurements. Primary endpoints were participants' cooking confidence as a proxy for self-efficacy. Secondary endpoints were dietary intake, physical activity levels, body composition, anthropometry, blood, urine and faecal biomarkers of systemic, physical and mental health.The community cooking program provided participants with information and advice on food sourcing, preparation and nutrition to improve home cooking skills. The study was designed to explore whether food literacy programs are efficacious in improving participant physical health and well-being in order to combat the rise in obesity and diet-related disease. It will support future use of public health cooking program initiatives aimed at improving food literacy, self-efficacy and physical and mental health.

A consequence of this major neuronal reorganizing and remodeling is a heightened level of vulnerability to stressors and immune challenges. The gut microbiota is a fundamental modulator of stress and immune responses and has been found to play a role in mental health conditions and neurodegenerative disorders. Environmental insults (stress, infection, neuroinflammation, and use of antibiotics) during adolescence can result in dysbiosis subsidizing the development of brain disorders later in life. Also, pubertal neuroinflammatory insults can alter neurodevelopment, impact brain functioning in an enduring manner, and contribute to neurological disorders related to brain aging, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and depression. Exposure to probiotics during puberty can mitigate inflammation, reverse dysbiosis, and decrease vulnerabilities to brain disorders later in life. The goal of this review is to reveal the consequences of pubertal exposure to stress and immune challenges on the gut microbiota, immune reactivity within the brain, and the risk or resilience to stress-induced mental illnesses and neurodegenerative disorders. We propose that the consumption of probiotics during adolescence contribute to the prevention of brain pathologies in adulthood.","The journals of gerontology.

32518376,A key role of the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve in the depression-like phenotype and abnormal composition of gut microbiota in mice after lipopolysaccharide administration.,"The vagus nerve plays a role in the cross talk between the brain and gut microbiota, which could be involved in depression. The subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve serves as a major modulatory pathway between the brain and gut microbiota. Here, we investigated the effects of subdiaphragmatic vagotomy (SDV) on the depression-like phenotype and the abnormal composition of gut microbiota in mice after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration. LPS caused a depression-like phenotype, inflammation, increase in spleen weight, and downregulation of synaptic proteins in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in the sham-operated mice. In contrast, LPS did not produce a depression-like phenotype and downregulated synaptic proteins in the mPFC after SDV. The spleen weight and plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the SDV + LPS group were lower than those of the sham + LPS group. Interestingly, there were positive correlations between the plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and spleen weight, suggesting a relationship between inflammatory events and spleen weight. Furthermore, LPS led to significant alterations in gut microbiota diversity in sham-operated mice, but not SDV-operated mice. In an unweighted UniFrac PCoA, the dots representing the sham + LPS group were located far away from the dots representing the other three groups. Our results suggest that LPS produces a depression-like phenotype, increases spleen weight, triggers inflammation, downregulates synaptic proteins in the mPFC, and leads to abnormal composition of gut microbiota via the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve. It is likely that the vagus nerve plays a crucial role in the brain-gut-microbiota axis.",Translational psychiatry,2020,Jiancheng Zhang; Li Ma; Lijia Chang; Yaoyu Pu; Youge Qu; Kenji Hashimoto
32506238,Gut Microbiome Dysbiosis and Depression: a Comprehensive Review.,"The human gut microbiome is involved in a bi-directional communication pathway with the central nervous system (CNS), termed the microbiota-gut-brain axis. The microbiota-gut-brain axis is believed to mediate or modulate various central processes through the vagus nerve. The microbiota-gut-brain axis is involved with the production of microbial metabolites and immune mediators which trigger changes in neurotransmission, neuroinflammation, and behavior. Little is understood about the utilization of microbiome manipulation to treat disease.Though studies exploring the role of the microbiome in various disease processes have shown promise, mechanisms remain unclear and evidence-based treatments for most illnesses have not yet been developed. The animal studies reviewed in the present investigation include an array of basic science studies that clarify mechanisms by which the microbiome may affect mental health. More evidence is needed, particularly as it relates to translating this work to humans. The studies presented in this review demonstrate encouraging results in the treatment of depression. Limitations include small sample sizes and heterogeneous methodology. The exact mechanism by which the gut microbiota causes or alters neuropsychiatric disease states is not fully understood.

32495743,"The Safety, Efficacy, and Tolerability of Microbial Ecosystem Therapeutic-2 in People With Major Depression and/or Generalized Anxiety Disorder: Protocol for a Phase 1, Open-Label Study.","The bidirectional signaling between the gut microbiota and the brain, known as the gut-brain axis, is being heavily explored in current neuropsychiatric research. Analyses of the human gut microbiota have shown considerable individual variability in bacterial content, which is hypothesized to influence brain function, and potentially mood and anxiety symptoms, through gut-brain axis communication. Preclinical and clinical research examining these effects suggests that fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) may aid in improving the severity of depression and anxiety symptoms by recolonizing the gastrointestinal (GI) tract with healthy bacteria. The microbial ecosystem therapeutic (ie, microbial ecosystem therapeutic-2 [MET-2]) used in this study is an alternative treatment to FMT, which comprises 40 different strains of gut bacteria from a healthy donor.The primary objective of this study is to assess subjective changes in mood and anxiety symptoms before, during, and after administration of MET-2. The secondary objectives of this study are to assess the changes in metabolic functioning and the level of repopulation of healthy gut bacteria, the safety and tolerability of MET-2, and the effects of early stress on biomarkers of depression/anxiety and the response to treatment.Adults experiencing depressive or anxiety symptoms will be recruited from the Kingston area. These participants will orally consume an encapsulated MET-2 once daily-containing 40 strains of purified and laboratory-grown bacteria from a single healthy donor-for 8 weeks, followed by a 2-week treatment-free follow-up period. Participants will undergo a series of clinical assessments measuring mood, anxiety, and GI symptoms using validated clinical scales and questionnaires. Molecular data will be collected from blood and fecal samples to assess metabolic changes, neurotransmitter levels, inflammatory markers, and the level of engraftment of the fecal samples that may predict outcomes in depression or anxiety.Given the association between the gut bacteria and the risk factors of depression, we expect to observe an improvement in the severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms following treatment, and we expect that this improvement is mediated by the recolonization of the GI tract with healthy bacteria. The recruitment for this study has been completed, and the data obtained are currently being analyzed.This is the first time MET-2 is being tested in psychiatric indications, specifically depression and anxiety. As such, this may be the first study to show the potential effects of microbial therapy in alleviating psychiatric symptoms as well as its safety and tolerability.DERR1-10.2196/17223.",JMIR research protocols,2020,Arthi Chinna Meyyappan; Roumen Milev

Most of this research is conducted on animals why we in this review summarize and comment upon recent studies evaluating the gut microbiome in mental health in humans. Further support for the relevance of the bidirectional gut microbiota-brain communication in mood disorders has been presented, such as the effect of probiotics on brain connectivity and mental health outcomes and pregnancy related stress on gut microbiota in the newborn child. However, the heterogeneity between studies precludes conclusions regarding differences in microbiota composition in mental disease and health and many of the studies are limited by a cross-sectional design, small sample sizes and multiple comparisons. Thus, well-designed longitudinal studies with larger sample size, accounting for confounders are needed.",Current opinion in neurobiology,2020,Ellionore Järbrink-Sehgal; Anna Andreasson
31769847,Probiotics and prebiotics: focus on psychiatric disorders - a systematic review.,"The gut-brain axis and microbial dysbiosis may play a role in psychiatric diseases. In this view, the gut microbiota has been considered a potential therapeutic target using probiotics and prebiotics.This systematic review aims to find the existing clinical evidence that may justify the use of probiotics or prebiotics in psychiatric patients.PRISMA guidelines were followed for a systematic literature review of randomized controlled trials that assessed the effect of prebiotics or probiotics in patients diagnosed with a classified psychiatric disorder.From a total of 212 studies screened, 11 were included in the final systematic review. Quality assessment of the included trials was assessed by the Jadad scale.Probiotics seem to offer some benefit in major depressive disorder and Alzheimer's disease. One study showed that probiotics reduced rehospitalization in patients with acute mania. In autism spectrum disorders, the results were controversial; however a single study found that early administration of probiotics showed a preventive role. No benefits were found for patients with schizophrenia. In most studies, no major adverse effects were reported.Although recent findings in specific psychiatric disorders are encouraging, the use of prebiotics and probiotics in clinical practice stills lacks sufficiently robust evidence.",Nutrition reviews,2020,Renata S D Barbosa; Maria A Vieira-Coelho
32398374,Maternal glyphosate exposure causes autism-like behaviors in offspring through increased expression of soluble epoxide hydrolase.,"Epidemiological studies suggest that exposure to herbicides during pregnancy might increase risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in offspring. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the risk of ASD by herbicides such as glyphosate remain unclear. Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) in the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids is shown to play a key role in the development of ASD in offspring after maternal immune activation. Here, we found ASD-like behavioral abnormalities in juvenile offspring after maternal exposure to high levels of formulated glyphosate. Furthermore, we found higher levels of sEH in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus, and striatum of juvenile offspring, and oxylipin analysis showed decreased levels of epoxy-fatty acids such as 8 (9)-EpETrE in the blood, PFC, hippocampus, and striatum of juvenile offspring after maternal glyphosate exposure, supporting increased activity of sEH in the offspring. Moreover, we found abnormal composition of gut microbiota and short-chain fatty acids in fecal samples of juvenile offspring after maternal glyphosate exposure. Interestingly, oral administration of TPPU (an sEH inhibitor) to pregnant mothers from E5 to P21 prevented ASD-like behaviors such as social interaction deficits and increased grooming time in the juvenile offspring after maternal glyphosate exposure. These findings suggest that maternal exposure to high levels of glyphosate causes ASD-like behavioral abnormalities and abnormal composition of gut microbiota in juvenile offspring, and that increased activity of sEH might play a role in ASD-like behaviors in offspring after maternal glyphosate exposure. Therefore, sEH may represent a target for ASD in offspring after maternal stress from occupational exposure to contaminants.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2020,Yaoyu Pu; Jun Yang; Lijia Chang; Youge Qu; Siming Wang; Kai Zhang; Zhongwei Xiong; Jiancheng Zhang; Yunfei Tan; Xingming Wang; Yuko Fujita; Tamaki Ishima; Debin Wang; Sung Hee Hwang; Bruce D Hammock; Kenji Hashimoto
32438623,Recipe for a Healthy Gut: Intake of Unpasteurised Milk Is Associated with Increased <i>Lactobacillus</i> Abundance in the Human Gut Microbiome.,"The gut microbiota plays a role in gut-brain communication and can influence psychological functioning. Diet is one of the major determinants of gut microbiota composition. The impact of unpasteurised dairy products on the microbiota is unknown. In this observational study, we investigated the effect of a dietary change involving intake of unpasteurised dairy on gut microbiome composition and psychological status in participants undertaking a residential 12-week cookery course on an organic farm.Twenty-four participants completed the study. The majority of food consumed during their stay originated from the organic farm itself and included unpasteurised milk and dairy products. At the beginning and end of the course, participants provided faecal samples and completed self-report questionnaires on a variety of parameters including mood, anxiety and sleep. Nutrient intake was monitored with a food frequency questionnaire. Gut microbiota analysis was performed with 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Additionally, faecal short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were measured.Relative abundance of the genus <i>Lactobacillus</i> increased significantly between pre- and post-course time points. This increase was associated with participants intake of unpasteurised milk and dairy products. An increase in the faecal SCFA, valerate, was observed along with an increase in the functional richness of the microbiome profile, as determined by measuring the predictive neuroactive potential using a gut-brain module approach.While concerns in relation to safety need to be considered, intake of unpasteurised milk and dairy products appear to be associated with the growth of the probiotic bacterial genus, <i>Lactobacillus</i>, in the human gut. More research is needed on the effect of dietary changes on gut microbiome composition, in particular in relation to the promotion of bacterial genera, such as <i>Lactobacillus</i>, which are recognised as being beneficial for a range of physical and mental health outcomes.",Nutrients,2020,Mary I Butler; Thomaz F S Bastiaanssen; Caitriona Long-Smith; Kirsten Berding; Sabrina Morkl; Anne-Marie Cusack; Conall Strain; Kizkitza Busca; Penny Porteous-Allen; Marcus J Claesson; Catherine Stanton; John F Cryan; Darina Allen; Timothy G Dinan
34589852,Nutritional psychiatry in the treatment of psychotic disorders: Current hypotheses and research challenges.,"Current treatment for schizophrenia-spectrum disorders focusses primarily on psychotropic medication to treat symptoms, though their efficacy varies between patients and psychotropic medication is often accompanied by severe side effects. Nutritional interventions to prevent and treat mental illness have received considerable attention over recent years. However, evidence for nutritional interventions in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders remains limited in quantity and quality. Pathways currently in focus include: i) nutritional deficits and impairments in glucose metabolism, ii) inflammation and immune dysregulation (also known from the mild encephalitis hypothesis), and iii) altered gut microbiota. All of which appear to be interconnected. Key limiting factors for advancing research in this field are research challenges associated with assessing and interpreting inflammatory profiles, microbiota and subjective nutritional assessments, which is further complicated by illness characteristics. This review describes the state of evidence for key hypotheses, including underlying mechanisms, implicated in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, the challenges in nutritional psychiatry research and the current state of nutrition interventions in mental healthcare.","Brain, behavior, & immunity - health",2020,Scott Teasdale; Sabrina Mörkl; Annabel Sandra Müller-Stierlin
31750916,Dietary fiber and its associations with depression and inflammation.,"Dietary fiber is a crucial component of a healthy diet, with benefits that can be attributed to processes in the gut microbiota and the resulting by-products. Observational studies support associations between dietary fiber intake and depression and inflammation, but the potential mechanisms are poorly understood. This review examines evidence of the effects of dietary fiber on depression and inflammation and considers plausible mechanisms linking dietary fiber and depression, including microbiota-driven modification of gene expression and increased production of neurotransmitters. Additionally, inflammation may mediate the relationship between dietary fiber intake and depression. A high-fiber diet potentially lowers inflammation by modifying both the pH and the permeability of the gut. The resultant reduction in inflammatory compounds may alter neurotransmitter concentrations to reduce symptoms of depression. Further research into the link between dietary fiber intake and inflammation and depression is essential, as findings could potentially provide guidance for improvement in or prevention of inflammatory and depressive disorders.",Nutrition reviews,2020,Olivia G Swann; Michelle Kilpatrick; Monique Breslin; Wendy H Oddy

32056910,Feeling down? A systematic review of the gut microbiota in anxiety/depression and irritable bowel syndrome.,"Background Anxiety/depression and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are highly prevalent and burdensome conditions, whose co-occurrence is estimated between 44 and 84%. Shared gut microbiota alterations have been identified in these separate disorders relative to controls; however, studies have not adequately considered their comorbidity. This review set out to identify case-control studies comparing the gut microbiota in anxiety/depression, IBS, and both conditions comorbidly relative to each other and to controls, as well as gut microbiota investigations including measures of both IBS and anxiety/depression. Methods Four databases were systematically searched using comprehensive search terms (OVID Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and PubMed), following PRISMA guidelines. Results Systematic review identified 17 studies (10 human, 7 animal). Most studies investigated the gut microbiota and anxiety/depression symptoms in IBS cohorts. Participants with IBS and high anxiety/depression symptoms had lower alpha diversity compared to controls and IBS-only cohorts. Machine learning and beta diversity distinguished between IBS participants with and without anxiety/depression by their gut microbiota. Comorbid IBS and anxiety/depression also had higher abundance of Proteobacteria, Prevotella/Prevotellaceae, Bacteroides and lower Lachnospiraceae relative to controls. Limitations A large number of gut microbiota estimation methods and statistical techniques were utilized; therefore, meta-analysis was not possible. Conclusions Well-designed case-control and longitudinal studies are required to disentangle whether the gut microbiota is predicted as a continuum of gastrointestinal and anxiety/depression symptom severity, or whether reported dysbiosis is unique to IBS and anxiety/depression comorbidity. These findings may inform the development of targeted treatment through the gut microbiota for individuals with both anxiety/depression and IBS.",Journal of affective disorders,2020,Carra A Simpson; Andre Mu; Nick Haslam; Orli S Schwartz; Julian G Simmons
32056905,Reduced anti-inflammatory gut microbiota are associated with depression and anhedonia.,"Characterise gut microbiota distributions of participants with co-occurring depression and anxiety, in those with only depression or with anxiety, and determine if gut bacteria differentially correlates with distinct clinical presentations.Participants (10 healthy controls [mean age: 33, 60% female] and 60 psychiatric subjects; major depressive disorder (comorbid with anxiety), n = 38 [mean age: 39.2, 82% female], anxiety only, n = 8 [mean age: 40.0, 100% female], depression only without anxiety, n = 14 [mean age: 41.9, 79% female]) were characterized by psychiatric assessments. Quantitative PCR and 16S rRNA sequencing were used to characterize the gut microbiota in stool samples.Altered microbiota correlated with pre-defined clinical presentation, with Bacteroides (p = 0.011) and the Clostridium leptum subgroup (p = 0.023) significantly different between clinical categories. Cluster analysis of the total sample using weighted UniFrac β-diversity of the gut microbiota identified two different clusters defined by differences in bacterial distribution. Cluster 2 had higher Bacteroides (p = 0.006), and much reduced presence of Clostridales (p<0.001) compared to Cluster 1. Bifidobacterium (p = 0.0173) was also reduced in Cluster 2 compared to Cluster 1. When evaluated for clinical charateristics, anhedonia scores in Cluster 2 were higher than in Cluster 1.The sample is smaller and predominately female.Reduced or absent Clostridia was consistently seen in those with depression, independent of the presence of anxiety. Conversely, reduced Bacteroides may be more associated with the presence of anxiety, independent of the presence of depression. These differences suggest that gut microbiota distribution could help clarify the underlying pathology of comorbid clinical presentation.",Journal of affective disorders,2020,Brittany L Mason; Qiwei Li; Abu Minhajuddin; Andrew H Czysz; Laura A Coughlin; Sarah K Hussain; Andrew Y Koh; Madhukar H Trivedi
31931033,Heat-killed Enterococcus fecalis (EC-12) supplement alters the expression of neurotransmitter receptor genes in the prefrontal cortex and alleviates anxiety-like behavior in mice.,"Gut microbiota plays a crucial role in the maintenance of mental health and influences mental disorders such as depression and anxiety. Several studies have reported the beneficial affects of probiotics in mental health. Heat-killed Enterococcus faecalis strain EC-12 (EC-12), a lactic acid bacterium induces activation of the immune system. However, little is known about the effect of EC-12 on mental health. In the present study, the anti-anxiety effect of EC-12 was elucidated in vivo. Male mice fed on diet supplemented with EC-12 showed decreased anxiety-like behavior in open-field and elevated plus-mazetest. In addition, EC-12 supplementation exhibited an anti-depressive trend in mice subjected to forced swim test. The expression of neurotransmitter receptor genes: Adrb3 and Avpr1a were significantly enhanced in EC-12 supplemented mice compared to that of the control mice. In mice, analyses of gut microbiota composition by next generation sequencing revealed significant increase in Butyricicoccus and Enterococcus with EC-12 supplementation. Significant difference was not detected in the expression of neurotransmitter receptor genes in the prefrontal cortex with the administration of sodium butyrate compared to that of the control group. The mechanism associated with EC-12 mediated reduced anxiety-like behavior and altered gene expression in the brain needs to be further elucidated. Taken together, the present study is the first to report the possibility of exploiting the anti-anxiety effect of heat-killed EC-12 as a novel probiotic to promote mental health.",Neuroscience letters,2020,Jun Kambe; Sovijit Watcharin; Yuko Makioka-Itaya; Ryo Inoue; Gen Watanabe; Hirohito Yamaguchi; Kentaro Nagaoka
32046750,"Treating impulsivity with probiotics in adults (PROBIA): study protocol of a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.","Impulsivity and compulsivity are related to emotional and social maladjustment and often underlie psychiatric disorders. Recently, alterations in microbiota composition have been shown to have implications for brain development and social behavior via the microbiota-gut-brain axis. However, the exact mechanisms are not fully identified. Recent evidence suggests the modulatory effect of synbiotics on gut microbiota and the contribution of these agents in ameliorating symptoms of many psychiatric diseases. To date, no randomized controlled trial has been performed to establish the feasibility and efficacy of this intervention targeting the reduction of impulsivity and compulsivity. We hypothesize that supplementation with synbiotics may be an effective treatment in adults with high levels of impulsivity and/or compulsivity.This is a prospective, multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial with two arms: treatment with a synbiotic formula versus placebo treatment. The primary outcome is the response rate at the end of the placebo-controlled phase (response defined as a Clinical Global Impression-Improvement Scale score of 1 or 2 = very much improved or much improved, plus a reduction in the Affective Reactivity Index total score of at least 30% compared with baseline). A total of 180 participants with highly impulsive behavior and a diagnosis of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and/or borderline personality disorder, aged 18-65 years old, will be screened at three study centers. Secondary outcome measures, including changes in general psychopathology, ADHD symptoms, neurocognitive function, somatic parameters, physical activity, nutritional intake, and health-related quality of life, will be explored at assessments before, during, and at the end of the intervention. The effect of the intervention on genetics, microbiota, and several blood biomarkers will also be assessed. Gastrointestinal symptoms and somatic complaints will additionally be explored at 1-week follow-up.This is the first randomized controlled trial to determine the effects of supplementation with synbiotics on reducing impulsive and compulsive behavior. This clinical trial can contribute to explaining the mechanisms involved in the crosstalk between the intestinal microbiome and the brain. If effects can be established by reducing impulsive and compulsive behavior, new cost-effective treatments might become available to these patients.ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03495375.

32062351,Gut microbiota composition during infancy and subsequent behavioural outcomes.,"Despite intense interest in the relationship between gut microbiota and brain development, longitudinal data from human studies are lacking. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the composition of gut microbiota during infancy and subsequent behavioural outcomes.A subcohort of 201 children with behavioural outcome measures was identified within a longitudinal, Australian birth-cohort study. The faecal microbiota were analysed at 1, 6, and 12 months of age. Behavioural outcomes were measured at 2 years of age.In an unselected birth cohort, we found a clear association between decreased normalised abundance of Prevotella in faecal samples collected at 12 months of age and increased behavioural problems at 2 years, in particular Internalizing Problem scores. This association appeared independent of multiple potentially confounding variables, including maternal mental health. Recent exposure to antibiotics was the best predictor of decreased Prevotella.Our findings demonstrate a strong association between the composition of the gut microbiota in infancy and subsequent behavioural outcomes; and support the importance of responsible use of antibiotics during early life.This study was funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia (1082307, 1147980, 1129813), The Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Barwon Health, Deakin University, Perpetual Trustees, and The Shepherd Foundation.

34480631,Microglial depletion and abnormalities in gut microbiota composition and short-chain fatty acids in mice after repeated administration of colony stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibitor PLX5622.,"PLX5622, a brain-penetrant highly specific inhibitor of the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), is used to eliminate microglia in the brain. Considering the role of microglia and gut microbiota in the brain homeostasis, this study was undertaken to investigate whether repeated intragastric administration of PLX5622 (65 mg/kg/day for consecutive 7 days) could affect the composition of gut microbiota and the concentration of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in fresh feces of adult mice. Repeated administration of PLX5622 caused significant reductions of the expression of genes and proteins for microglial markers in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus compared to control mice although the elimination of brain's microglia was partial. There was a significant alteration in the β-diversity of intestine microbiota in the PLX5622-treated group. Linear discriminant analysis effect size identified eight significant enriched bacteria as microbial markers for PLX5622-treated group. Repeated administration of PLX5622 affected the relative abundance of several bacteria at the genus and species levels. Furthermore, repeated administration of PLX5622 caused a significant change in lactic acid compared to control group. Interestingly, we found significant correlations between microglial markers in the brain and the relative abundance of several bacteria, suggesting microbiome-microglia crosstalk through the brain-gut axis. These data demonstrate that repeated administration of PLX5622 leads to an abnormal composition of the gut microbiota and lactic acid in adult mice. Therefore, abnormalities in the composition of gut microbiota after repeated treatment of PLX5622 should be considered for behavioral and biological functions in animals treated with CSF1R inhibitors.",European archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience,2022,Yong Yang; Tamaki Ishima; Xiayun Wan; Yan Wei; Lijia Chang; Jiancheng Zhang; Youge Qu; Kenji Hashimoto
35185631,The Gut-Brain-Immune Axis in Autism Spectrum Disorders: A State-of-Art Report.,"The interest elicited by the large microbial population colonizing the human gut has ancient origins and has gone through a long evolution during history. However, it is only in the last decades that the introduction of high-throughput technologies has allowed to broaden this research field and to disentangle the numerous implications that gut microbiota has in health and disease. This comprehensive ecosystem, constituted mainly by bacteria but also by fungi, parasites, and viruses, is proven to be involved in several physiological and pathological processes that transcend the intestinal homeostasis and are deeply intertwined with apparently unrelated body systems, such as the immune and the nervous ones. In this regard, a novel speculation is the relationship between the intestinal microbial flora and the pathogenesis of some neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders, including the clinical entities defined under the umbrella term of autism spectrum disorders. The bidirectional interplay has led researchers to coin the term gut-brain-immune system axis, subverting the theory of the brain as an immune-privileged site and underscoring the importance of this reciprocal influence already from fetal life and especially during the pre- and post-natal neurodevelopmental process. This revolutionary theory has also unveiled the possibility to modify the gut microbiota as a way to treat and even to prevent different kinds of pathologies. In this sense, some attempts have been made, ranging from probiotic administration to fecal microbiota transplantation, with promising results that need further elaboration. This state-of-art report will describe the main aspects regarding the human gut microbiome and its specific role in the pathogenesis of autism and its related disorders, with a final discussion on the therapeutic and preventive strategies aiming at creating a healthy intestinal microbial environment, as well as their safety and ethical implications.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2021,Chiara Puricelli; Roberta Rolla; Luca Gigliotti; Elena Boggio; Eleonora Beltrami; Umberto Dianzani; Roberto Keller

This review aims to provide an outline of the link between the microbiota and brain function focusing on preclinical and clinical evidence of the potential application of psychobiotics in the context of the cognitive process and performance. The occurrence of metabolic precursors of neurotransmitters in foods that can be converted by the gut microbiota and play a role in the gut-brain axis is discussed.

35153869,"The Role of the Oral Microbiota Related to Periodontal Diseases in Anxiety, Mood and Trauma- and Stress-Related Disorders.","The prevalence of anxiety, mood and trauma- and stress-related disorders are on the rise; however, efforts to develop new and effective treatment strategies have had limited success. To identify novel therapeutic targets, a comprehensive understanding of the disease etiology is needed, especially in the context of the holobiont, i.e., the superorganism consisting of a human and its microbiotas. Much emphasis has been placed on the role of the gut microbiota in the development, exacerbation, and persistence of psychiatric disorders; however, data for the oral microbiota are limited. The oral cavity houses the second most diverse microbial community in the body, with over 700 bacterial species that colonize the soft and hard tissues. Periodontal diseases encompass a group of infectious and inflammatory diseases that affect the periodontium. Among them, periodontitis is defined as a chronic, multi-bacterial infection that elicits low-grade systemic inflammation <i>via</i> the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as local invasion and long-distance translocation of periodontal pathogens. Periodontitis can also induce or exacerbate other chronic systemic inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis and diabetes and can lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Recently, periodontal pathogens have been implicated in the etiology and pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders (such as depression and schizophrenia), especially as dysregulation of the immune system also plays an integral role in the etiology and pathophysiology of these disorders. This review will discuss the role of the oral microbiota associated with periodontal diseases in anxiety, mood and trauma- and stress-related disorders. Epidemiological data of periodontal diseases in individuals with these disorders will be presented, followed by a discussion of the microbiological and immunological links between the oral microbiota and the central nervous system. Pre-clinical and clinical findings on the oral microbiota related to periodontal diseases in anxiety, mood and trauma- and stress-related phenotypes will be reviewed, followed by a discussion on the bi-directionality of the oral-brain axis. Lastly, we will focus on the oral microbiota associated with periodontal diseases as a target for future therapeutic interventions to alleviate symptoms of these debilitating psychiatric disorders.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2021,María Martínez; Teodor T Postolache; Borja García-Bueno; Juan C Leza; Elena Figuero; Christopher A Lowry; Stefanie Malan-Müller

Gut microbiota's role in anxiety and depression is well studied. The importance of the ""gut-brain"" axis has been implicated in overall mental health. It is known that diet, environmental factors and genetics play an important role in shaping gut microbiota. Trials may be initiated to study if personalized diet and supplementation based on individual's gut microbiome profile may improve the general mental well-being of people prone to anxiety during this pandemic. Also, COVID-19 patients may be provided personalized nutritional therapy based on their gut microbiota profile to see if PTSD and anxiety symptoms can be alleviated.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2021,Debojyoti Dhar
35024387,Altered stress responses in adults born by Caesarean section.,"Birth by Caesarean-section (C-section), which increases the risk for metabolic and immune disorders, disrupts the normal initial microbial colonisation of the gut, in addition to preventing early priming of the stress and immune-systems.. Animal studies have shown there are enduring psychological processes in C-section born mice. However, the long-term impact of microbiota-gut-brain axis disruptions due to birth by C-section on psychological processes in humans is unknown. Forty age matched healthy young male university students born vaginally and 36 C-section delivered male students were recruited. Participants underwent an acute stressor, the Trier social stress test (TSST), during a term-time study visit. A subset of participants also completed a study visit during the university exam period, representing a naturalistic stressor. Participants completed a battery of cognitive tests and self-report measures assessing mood, anxiety, and perceived stress. Saliva, blood, and stool samples were collected for analysis of cortisol, peripheral immune profile, and the gut microbiota. Young adults born by C-section exhibit increased psychological vulnerability to acute stress and a prolonged period of exam-related stress. They did not exhibit an altered salivary cortisol awakening response to the TSST, but their measures of positive affect were significantly lower than controls throughout the procedure. Both C-section and vaginally-delivered participants performed equally well on cognitive assessments. Most of the initial effects of delivery mode on the gut microbiome did not persist into adulthood as the gut microbiota profile showed modest changes in composition in adult vaginally-delivered and C-sectioned delivered subjects. From an immune perspective, concentrations of IL-1β and 1L-10 were higher in C-section participants. These data confirm that there is a potential enduring effect of delivery mode on the psychological responses to acute stress during early adulthood. The mental health implications of these observations require further study regarding policies on C-section use.",Neurobiology of stress,2022,Timothy G Dinan; Paul J Kennedy; Livia H Morais; Amy Murphy; Caitriona M Long-Smith; Gerard M Moloney; Thomaz F S Bastiaanssen; Andrew P Allen; Aoife Collery; David Mullins; Anne-Marie Cusack; Kirsten Berding; Paul W O'Toole; Gerard Clarke; Catherine Stanton; John F Cryan
34357554,Immune-microbiome interplay and its implications in neurodegenerative disorders.,"The neurodegeneration and its related CNS pathologies need an urgent toolbox to minimize the global mental health burden. The neuroimmune system critically regulates the brain maturation and survival of neurons across the nervous system. The chronic manipulated immunological drive can accelerate the neuronal pathology hence promoting the burden of neurodegenerative disorders. The gut is home for trillions of microorganisms having a mutual relationship with the host system. The gut-brain axis is a unique biochemical pathway through which the gut residing microbes connects with the brain cells and regulates various physiological and pathological cascades. The gut microbiota and CNS communicate using a common language that synchronizes the tuning of immune cells. The intestinal gut microbial community has a profound role in the maturation of the immune system as well as the development of the nervous system. We have critically summarised the clinical and preclinical reports from the past a decade emphasising that the significant changes in gut microbiota can enhance the host susceptibility towards neurodegenerative disorders. In this review, we have discussed how the gut microbiota-mediated immune response inclines the host physiology towards neurodegeneration and indicated the gut microbiota as a potential future candidate for the management of neurodegenerative disorders.",Metabolic brain disease,2022,Ankit Uniyal; Vineeta Tiwari; Mousmi Rani; Vinod Tiwari
33963284,Molecular mechanisms underlying the antidepressant actions of arketamine: beyond the NMDA receptor.,"The discovery of robust antidepressant actions exerted by the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist (R,S)-ketamine has been a crucial breakthrough in mood disorder research. (R,S)-ketamine is a racemic mixture of equal amounts of (R)-ketamine (arketamine) and (S)-ketamine (esketamine). In 2019, an esketamine nasal spray from Johnson & Johnson was approved in the United States of America and Europe for treatment-resistant depression. However, an increasing number of preclinical studies show that arketamine has greater potency and longer-lasting antidepressant-like effects than esketamine in rodents, despite the lower binding affinity of arketamine for the NMDAR. In clinical trials, non-ketamine NMDAR-related compounds did not exhibit ketamine-like robust antidepressant actions in patients with depression, despite these compounds showing antidepressant-like effects in rodents. Thus, the rodent data do not necessarily translate to humans due to the complexity of human psychiatric disorders. Collectively, the available studies indicate that it is unlikely that NMDAR plays a major role in the antidepressant action of (R,S)-ketamine and its enantiomers, although the precise molecular mechanisms underlying antidepressant actions of (R,S)-ketamine and its enantiomers remain unclear. In this paper, we review recent findings on the molecular mechanisms underlying the antidepressant actions of (R,S)-ketamine and its potent enantiomer arketamine. Furthermore, we discuss the possible role of the brain-gut-microbiota axis and brain-spleen axis in stress-related psychiatric disorders and in the antidepressant-like action of arketamine. Finally, we discuss the potential of arketamine as a treatment for cognitive impairment in psychiatric disorders, Parkinson's disease, osteoporosis, inflammatory bowel diseases, and stroke.",Molecular psychiatry,2022,Yan Wei; Lijia Chang; Kenji Hashimoto
34946184,Gut Bacteria and Neuropsychiatric Disorders.,"Bacteria in the gut microbiome plays an intrinsic part in immune activation, intestinal permeability, enteric reflex, and entero-endocrine signaling. Apart from physiological and structural changes brought about by gut bacteria on entero-epithelial cells and mucus layers, a vast number of signals generated in the gastro-intestinal tract (GIT) reaches the brain via the vagus nerve. Research on the gut-brain axis (GBA) has mostly been devoted to digestive functions and satiety. Less papers have been published on the role gut microbiota play in mood, cognitive behavior and neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism, depression and schizophrenia. Whether we will be able to fully decipher the connection between gut microbiota and mental health is debatable, especially since the gut microbiome is diverse, everchanging and highly responsive to external stimuli. Nevertheless, the more we discover about the gut microbiome and the more we learn about the GBA, the greater the chance of developing novel therapeutics, probiotics and psychobiotics to treat gastro-intestinal disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but also improve cognitive functions and prevent or treat mental disorders. In this review we focus on the influence gut bacteria and their metabolites have on neuropsychiatric disorders.",Microorganisms,2021,Leon M T Dicks; Diron Hurn; Demi Hermanus
34970638,CUMS and dexamethasone induce depression-like phenotypes in mice by differentially altering gut microbiota and triggering macroglia activation.,"Although the link between gut microbiota and depression has been suggested, changes of gut microbiota vary largely among individuals with depression.Explore the heterogeneity of microbiota-gut-brain axis and new pathogenic characteristics in murine models of depression.Adolescent female mice were randomly divided into control (CON) group (n=10), chronic unexpected mild stress (CUMS) group (n=15) and dexamethasone (DEX) group (n=15). Mice in the DEX group were gavaged twice a day with 0.2 mg/kg of DEX for 5 weeks, whereas CON mice were given the same amount of solvent. Mice in the CUMS group were exposed to stressors. After behavioural evaluations, all mice were sacrificed for harvesting tissues and blood samples. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was conducted for measuring levels of corticosterone (CORT) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in sera, whereas levels of protein expression in colon and hippocampal tissues were examined by western blot. Faecal microbial communities were analysed by sequencing 16S rDNAs.Mice in CUMS and DEX groups exhibited severe depression-like behaviours. Compared with CON mice, CUMS-exposed mice showed a significant increase in both α and β diversity. Prevotellaceae and Desulfovibrio were enriched, whereas Bacilli were decreased in the faeces of mice in the CUMS group. DEX-treated mice had a decrease in the abundance of <i>Clostridium XVIII</i>. Levels of occludin in colon tissue of DEX-treated mice were reduced. Relative to mice in the CON and CUMS groups, DEX-treated mice contained higher serum levels of CORT and IL-1β. Compared with CON mice, mice in the DEX and CUMS groups had higher levels of IL-1β in sera and lower levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), Nestin, Synapsin-1 and P2Y12 receptor in the hippocampus.Changes of gut microbiota diversity, intestinal integrity and neuroinflammation in the brain contribute to CUMS-induced depression, whereas pathobionts and excessive immunosuppression with damaged neuronal synapses is a basis of the DEX-induced depression.",General psychiatry,2021,Jing Wu; Jinhang Li; Chhetri Gaurav; Usman Muhammad; Yantian Chen; Xueyi Li; Jinghong Chen; Zejian Wang
34895297,The Moo'D Study: protocol for a randomised controlled trial of A2 beta-casein only versus conventional dairy products in women with low mood.,"Beta-casein is a major protein in cow's milk, of which A1 and A2 are the most frequent variants. Recent evidence implicates A1 beta-casein consumption in mechanisms that are of potential importance to mental health, yet its possible effects on psychological endpoints remains unknown. The primary aim of the study is to evaluate the comparative effects of consumption of dairy products containing A2 beta-casein versus conventional dairy (i.e. containing both A1 and A2 beta-casein) on symptoms of psychological distress in women with low mood.'The Moo'D Study' is a 16-week, superiority, 1:1 parallel group, triple-blinded, randomised controlled trial. Ninety women with low mood (Patient Health Questionnaire score ≥ 5) will be randomised to consume either A2 beta-casein only or conventional dairy products. The primary outcome, symptoms of psychological distress, will be measured by the 21-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale. Secondary outcomes will include symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress, severity of low mood, cognition, gut microbiota composition, gut symptomatology, markers of immune function, gut inflammation, systemic metabolites, endothelial integrity and oxidative stress, body composition, perceived wellbeing, sleep, quality of life, resource use and cost-effectiveness.This study will advance our understanding of the possible impact of milk proteins on psychological distress in women as well as elucidate mechanisms underpinning any association. Given dairy products form a substantial component of traditional and Western diets, the implications of these findings are likely to be of clinical and public health importance.The trial protocol has been prospectively registered with the Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN12618002023235 .

34988495,Characterization of the gut microbiota among Veterans with unique military-related exposures and high prevalence of chronic health conditions: A United States-Veteran Microbiome Project (US-VMP) study.,"The gut microbiome is impacted by environmental exposures and has been implicated in many physical and mental health conditions, including anxiety disorders, affective disorders, and trauma- and stressor-related disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). United States (US) military Veterans are a unique population in that their military-related exposures can have consequences for both physical and mental health, but the gut microbiome of this population has been understudied. In this publication, we describe exposures, health conditions, and medication use of Veterans in the US Veteran Microbiome Project (US-VMP) and examine the associations between these characteristics and the gut microbiota. This cohort included 331 US Veterans seeking healthcare with the Veterans Health Administration who were 83% male with an average (±SD) age of 47.6 ​± ​13.4 years. The cohort displayed a high prevalence of PTSD (49.8%) and history of traumatic brain injuries (76.1%), and high current use of prescription medications (74.9%) to treat various acute and chronic conditions. We observed significant associations between the gut microbiota composition and gastroenteritis, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), bipolar disorders, symptoms of severe depression based on the Beck Depression Inventory, stimulant and opioid use disorders, beta-blockers, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor antidepressants, diabetes medications, and proton pump inhibitors. Many of the Veteran characteristics examined were associated with altered relative abundances of specific taxa. We found that PVD and cardiovascular disease were associated with lower microbiota diversity in the gut (i.e., α-diversity), while supplemental vitamin use was associated with higher α-diversity. Our study contributes novel insights as to whether the unique exposures of Veterans in this cohort correlate with gut microbiota characteristics and, in line with previous findings with other population-level studies of the microbiome, confirms associations between numerous health conditions and medications with the gut microbiome.","Brain, behavior, & immunity - health",2021,Maggie A Stanislawski; Christopher E Stamper; Kelly A Stearns-Yoder; Andrew J Hoisington; Diana P Brostow; Jeri E Forster; Teodor T Postolache; Christopher A Lowry; Lisa A Brenner
34560239,Regulation of neurotoxicity in the striatum and colon of MPTP-induced Parkinson's disease mice by gut microbiome.,"Increasing evidence suggests the role of gut-microbiota-brain axis in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). The objective of this study was to examine whether repeated administration of MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) can influence the neurotoxicity in the striatum and colon, and the composition of gut microbiota and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in feces of adult mice. MPTP caused the reduction of dopamine transporter (DAT) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the striatum, and increases in phosphorylated α-synuclein (p-α-Syn) in the striatum and colon. There was a negative correlation between the expression of TH in the striatum and the expression of p-α-Syn in the colon, suggesting a role of gut-brain communication. MPTP caused abnormalities in the α- and β-diversity of gut microbiota in the mice. Furthermore, the relative abundance of the genus Faecalicatena in the MPTP-treated group was significantly lower than that of control group. Interestingly, there was a positive correlation between the genus Faecalicatena and the expression of TH in the striatum. Moreover, MPTP did not alter the levels of SCFAs in feces samples. However, there was a positive correlation between the relative abundance of the genus Faecalicatena and propionic acid. The data suggest that MPTP-induced increases in colonic p-α-Syn expression might be associated with dopaminergic neurotoxicity in the striatum via gut-microbiota-brain axis.",Brain research bulletin,2021,Jiajing Shan; Youge Qu; Siming Wang; Yan Wei; Lijia Chang; Li Ma; Kenji Hashimoto
34588398,Metformin acts on the gut-brain axis to ameliorate antipsychotic-induced metabolic dysfunction.,"Antipsychotic-induced metabolic dysfunction (AIMD) is an intractable clinical challenge worldwide. The situation is becoming more critical as second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), to a great extent, have replaced the role of first-generation antipsychotics in managing major psychiatric disorders. Although the exact mechanisms for developing AIMD is intricate, emerging evidence has indicated the involvement of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in AIMD. SGAs treatment may change the diversity and compositions of intestinal flora (e.g., decreased abundance of Bacteroidetes and Akkermansia muciniphila, and increased Firmicutes). Short-chain fatty acids and other metabolites derived from gut microbiota, on the one hand, can regulate the activity of intestinal endocrine cells and their secretion of satiety hormones (e.g., glucagon-like peptide 1, peptide YY, cholecystokinin and ghrelin); on the other hand, can activate the vagus nerve or transport into the brain to exert a central modulation of foraging behaviors via binding to neuropeptide receptors. Interestingly, metformin, a classical antidiabetic agent, is capable of alleviating AIMD possibly by regulating the microbiota-gut-brain axis. That is, metformin can not only partially reverse the alterations of gut microbial communities due to SGAs treatment, but also play a positive role in rectifying the disturbances of peripheral and central satiety-related neuropeptides. Current evidence has indicated a promising role for metformin on ameliorating AMID, but further verifications in well-designed clinical trials are still warranted.",Bioscience trends,2021,Xiaorong Wang; Huimin Huang; Yiyi Zhu; Shaoli Li; Peifen Zhang; Jiajun Jiang; Caixi Xi; Lingling Wu; Xingle Gao; Yaoyang Fu; Danhua Zhang; Yiqing Chen; Shaohua Hu; Jianbo Lai
34869080,Altered Fecal Microbiota Correlated With Systemic Inflammation in Male Subjects With Methamphetamine Use Disorder.,"Methamphetamine use disorder (MUD) is a major public health problem worldwide with limited effective treatment options. Previous studies have reported methamphetamine-associated alterations in gut microbiota. A potential role of gut microbiota in regulating methamphetamine-induced brain dysfunction through interactions with the host immune system has been proposed, but evidence for this hypothesis is limited. The present study aimed to investigate the alterations in the fecal microbiota and explore its relationship with systemic inflammation in MUD. Fecal samples were obtained from 26 male subjects with MUD and 17 sex- and age- matched healthy controls. Fecal microbial profiles were analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing. Plasma inflammatory markers were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Associations between fecal microbiota, systemic inflammatory markers and clinical characteristics were examined by Spearman partial correlation analysis while controlling for possible confounders. Compared with healthy controls, individuals with MUD showed no difference in fecal microbial diversity, but exhibited differences in the relative abundance of several microbial taxa. At the genus level, a higher abundance of <i>Collinsella</i>, <i>Odoribacter</i> and <i>Megasphaera</i> and lower levels of <i>Faecalibacterium</i>, <i>Blautia</i>, <i>Dorea</i> and <i>Streptococcus</i> were detected in subjects with MUD. More importantly, altered fecal microbiota was found to be correlated with plasma levels of CRP, IL-2, IL-6 and IL-10. The order <i>Lactobacillales</i>, exhibiting lower abundance in participants with MUD, was positively related to the duration of methamphetamine abstinence and the plasma level of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. This study is the first to provide evidence for a link between altered fecal microbiota and systemic inflammation in MUD. Further elucidation of interactions between gut microbiota and the host immune system may be beneficial for the development of novel therapeutic approaches for MUD.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2021,Di Deng; Hang Su; Yuehong Song; Tianzhen Chen; Qianqian Sun; Haifeng Jiang; Min Zhao
34830610,Targeting the Gut Microbiome in Prader-Willi Syndrome.,"Overwhelming evidence demonstrates an important role of the gut microbiome in the development of a wide range of diseases, including obesity, metabolic disorders, and mental health symptoms. Indeed, interventions targeting the gut microbiome are being actively investigated as a therapeutic strategy to tackle these diseases. Given that obesity and mental health symptoms are both hallmarks of Prader-Willi syndrome, targeting the gut microbiome may be a promising therapeutical strategy. Only a few studies have investigated the gut microbiome in the context of Prader-Willi syndrome and assessed the efficacy of probiotic supplementation as a therapeutic strategy for this disease. Here, we review the knowledge obtained to this date regarding the gut microbiome in individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome. The limited evidence available indicate that probiotic supplementation improves some metabolic and mental health aspects, however further studies are warranted to determine whether targeting the gut microbiome may constitute a safe and efficient strategy to treat individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome.",Journal of clinical medicine,2021,Marta Ramon-Krauel; Montse Amat-Bou; Mercedes Serrano; Antonio F Martinez-Monseny; Carles Lerin
34830242,Assessment of the Effects of Dietary Vitamin D Levels on Olanzapine-Induced Metabolic Side Effects: Focus on the Endocannabinoidome-Gut Microbiome Axis.,"Vitamin D deficiency is associated with poor mental health and dysmetabolism. Several metabolic abnormalities are associated with psychotic diseases, which can be compounded by atypical antipsychotics that induce weight gain and insulin resistance. These side-effects may be affected by vitamin D levels. The gut microbiota and endocannabinoidome (eCBome) are significant regulators of both metabolism and mental health, but their role in the development of atypical antipsychotic drug metabolic side-effects and their interaction with vitamin D status is unknown. We studied the effects of different combinations of vitamin D levels and atypical antipsychotic drug (olanzapine) exposure on whole-body metabolism and the eCBome-gut microbiota axis in female C57BL/6J mice under a high fat/high sucrose (HFHS) diet in an attempt to identify a link between the latter and the different metabolic outputs induced by the treatments. Olanzapine exerted a protective effect against diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance, largely independent of dietary vitamin D status. These changes were concomitant with olanzapine-mediated decreases in <i>Trpv1</i> expression and increases in the levels of its agonists, including various <i>N</i>-acylethanolamines and 2-monoacylglycerols, which are consistent with the observed improvement in adiposity and metabolic status. Furthermore, while global gut bacteria community architecture was not altered by olanzapine, we identified changes in the relative abundances of various commensal bacterial families. Taken together, changes of eCBome and gut microbiota families under our experimental conditions might contribute to olanzapine and vitamin D-mediated inhibition of weight gain in mice on a HFHS diet.",International journal of molecular sciences,2021,Armita Abolghasemi; Claudia Manca; Fabio A Iannotti; Melissa Shen; Nadine Leblanc; Sébastien Lacroix; Cyril Martin; Nicolas Flamand; Vincenzo Di Marzo; Cristoforo Silvestri
34758889,A fiber-deprived diet causes cognitive impairment and hippocampal microglia-mediated synaptic loss through the gut microbiota and metabolites.,"Cognitive impairment, an increasing mental health issue, is a core feature of the aging brain and neurodegenerative diseases. Industrialized nations especially, have experienced a marked decrease in dietary fiber intake, but the potential mechanism linking low fiber intake and cognitive impairment is poorly understood. Emerging research reported that the diversity of gut microbiota in Western populations is significantly reduced. However, it is unknown whether a fiber-deficient diet (which alters gut microbiota) could impair cognition and brain functional elements through the gut-brain axis.In this study, a mouse model of long-term (15 weeks) dietary fiber deficiency (FD) was used to mimic a sustained low fiber intake in humans. We found that FD mice showed impaired cognition, including deficits in object location memory, temporal order memory, and the ability to perform daily living activities. The hippocampal synaptic ultrastructure was damaged in FD mice, characterized by widened synaptic clefts and thinned postsynaptic densities. A hippocampal proteomic analysis further identified a deficit of CaMKIId and its associated synaptic proteins (including GAP43 and SV2C) in the FD mice, along with neuroinflammation and microglial engulfment of synapses. The FD mice also exhibited gut microbiota dysbiosis (decreased Bacteroidetes and increased Proteobacteria), which was significantly associated with the cognitive deficits. Of note, a rapid differentiating microbiota change was observed in the mice with a short-term FD diet (7 days) before cognitive impairment, highlighting a possible causal impact of the gut microbiota profile on cognitive outcomes. Moreover, the FD diet compromised the intestinal barrier and reduced short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production. We exploit these findings for SCFA receptor knockout mice and oral SCFA supplementation that verified SCFA playing a critical role linking the altered gut microbiota and cognitive impairment.This study, for the first time, reports that a fiber-deprived diet leads to cognitive impairment through altering the gut microbiota-hippocampal axis, which is pathologically distinct from normal brain aging. These findings alert the adverse impact of dietary fiber deficiency on brain function, and highlight an increase in fiber intake as a nutritional strategy to reduce the risk of developing diet-associated cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases.

34835436,The Potential Utility of Prebiotics to Modulate Alzheimer's Disease: A Review of the Evidence.,"The gut microbiome has recently emerged as a critical modulator of brain function, with the so-called gut-brain axis having multiple links with a variety of neurodegenerative and mental health conditions, including Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Various approaches for modulating the gut microbiome toward compositional and functional states that are consistent with improved cognitive health outcomes have been documented, including probiotics and prebiotics. While probiotics are live microorganisms that directly confer beneficial health effects, prebiotics are oligosaccharide and polysaccharide structures that can beneficially modulate the gut microbiome by enhancing the growth, survival, and/or function of gut microbes that in turn have beneficial effects on the human host. In this review, we discuss evidence showing the potential link between gut microbiome composition and AD onset or development, provide an overview of prebiotic types and their roles in altering gut microbial composition, discuss the effectiveness of prebiotics in regulating gut microbiome composition and microbially derived metabolites, and discuss the current evidence linking prebiotics with health outcomes related to AD in both animal models and human trials. Though there is a paucity of human clinical trials demonstrating the effectiveness of prebiotics in altering gut microbiome-mediated health outcomes in AD, current evidence highlights the potential of various prebiotic approaches for beneficially altering the gut microbiota or gut physiology by promoting the production of butyrate, indoles, and secondary bile acid profiles that further regulate gut immunity and mucosal homeostasis, which are associated with beneficial effects on the central immune system and brain functionality.",Microorganisms,2021,Jea Woo Kang; Angela M Zivkovic
34617139,A next-generation probiotic: Akkermansia muciniphila ameliorates chronic stress-induced depressive-like behavior in mice by regulating gut microbiota and metabolites.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a neurasthenic disease, which is the second-largest burden of disease globally. Increasing studies have revealed that depression is associated with abnormalities in gut microbiota and metabolites. Several species of bacteria have been classified as psychobiotics, which confer mental health benefits through interactions with commensal gut microbiota. Therefore, it is essential to identify new psychobiotics and elucidate their mechanisms in the treatment of depression. This study aims to evaluate the antidepressant effect of Akkermansia muciniphila (AKK) in a mouse model of depression induced by chronic restraint stress (CRS). C57BL/6 male mice were divided into three groups: mice subjected to CRS, mice not subjected to CRS, and mice treated with AKK for 3 weeks. Behavioral tests were performed, and hormone, neurotransmitter, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels were measured. Cecal microbiota was analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and serum metabolites were detected using untargeted metabolomics. In addition, correlations between altered gut microbiota and metabolites with significant variations in serum associated with AKK ameliorating depression were analyzed using Pearson's correlation coefficient. The results revealed that AKK significantly ameliorated depressive-like behavior and restored abnormal variations in depression-related molecular (corticosterone, dopamine, and BDNF). Moreover, AKK altered chronic stress-induced gut microbial abnormalities. Untargeted metabolomics analysis revealed 23 potential biomarkers in serum that could be associated with the mechanisms underlying CRS-induced depression and the therapeutic effects of AKK. Pearson's correlation coefficient analysis revealed that AKK predominantly upregulated β-alanyl-3-methyl-L-histidine and edaravone to relieve depression. Furthermore, β-alanyl-3-methyl-L-histidine and edaravone exhibited the antidepressant phenotype in mice subjected to CRS. In conclusion, the study demonstrated that AKK ameliorates chronic stress-induced depressive symptoms in mice by regulating gut microbiota and metabolites. KEY POINTS: • AKK reduces depressive-like behaviors induced by chronic stress. • AKK regulates the gut microbial structure and metabolomics of serum under the chronic stress. • Antidepressant effect of AKK correlates with the increase of β-alanyl-3-methyl-l-histidine and edaravone.",Applied microbiology and biotechnology,2021,Yang Ding; Fan Bu; Tuo Chen; Guoping Shi; Xiaomin Yuan; Zeyu Feng; Zhenglan Duan; Rong Wang; Sumin Zhang; Qiong Wang; Jinyong Zhou; Yugen Chen
34474339,Lycium barbarum polysaccharide attenuates emotional injury of offspring elicited by prenatal chronic stress in rats via regulation of gut microbiota.,"Stress during pregnancy is not only detrimental to a woman's own physical and mental health, but can also cause changes in the intrauterine environment and even have an impact on later growth and development, this study was designed to understand the changes of gut microbiota in the maternal and offspring caused by prenatal chronic stress, and to explore the regulatory effect of LBP on gut microbiota, and then to improve the emotional damage caused by prenatal chronic stress in the offspring. A rat model of prenatal chronic stress was made and used LBP to intervene by gavage. Fresh feces of offspring were collected, the concentration of microbial metabolites were tested by ELISA. Illumina MiSeqPE300 sequencing technology was used to determine the sequence of 16S rRNA V3-V4 of microorganisms. On the PND 42, the emotional function of offspring were tested by open-field test (OFT), sucrose preference test (SPT) and tail of suspend test (TST). Results indicated that stress factors increased the plasma corticosterone level of rats during pregnancy and they appeared depressive behaviors. The body weight of offspring during prenatal chronic stress was lower than the control group, and the plasma corticosterone level was increased. Prenatal chronic stress had a significant impact on emotional performance of the offspring on OFT, SPT and TST. Alpha diversity of gut microbiota and microbiota composition in offspring of prenatal chronic stress was attenuated and some relationships existed between these parameters. LBP treatment reduced offspring's plasma corticosterone level and improved their body weight, changed the emotional function, increased the diversity of gut microbiota. Collectively, these findings disclose that prenatal chronic stress not only causes emotional injury on the offspring, but also changes the gut microbiota of the mother and offspring; LBP may regulate the intestinal flora of the mother, then reducing the influence of stress factors on the emotional injury of offspring.",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2021,Feng Zhao; Suzhen Guan; Youjuan Fu; Kai Wang; Zhihong Liu; Tzi Bun Ng
34002020,Endocannabinoid system mediates the association between gut-microbial diversity and anhedonia/amotivation in a general population cohort.,"Anhedonia and amotivation are debilitating symptoms and represent unmet therapeutic needs in a range of clinical conditions. The gut-microbiome-endocannabinoid axis might represent a potential modifiable target for interventions. Based on results obtained from animal models, we tested the hypothesis that the endocannabinoid system mediates the association between gut-microbiome diversity and anhedonia/amotivation in a general population cohort. We used longitudinal data collected from 786 volunteer twins recruited as part the TwinsUK register. Our hypothesis was tested with a multilevel mediation model using family structure as random intercept. The model was set using alpha diversity (within-individual gut-microbial diversity) as predictor, serum and faecal levels of the endocannabinoid palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) as mediator, and anhedonia/amotivation as outcome. PEA is considered the endogenous equivalent of cannabidiol, with increased serum levels believed to have anti-depressive effects, while increased stool PEA levels, reflecting increased excretion, are believed to have opposite, detrimental, effects on mental health. We therefore expected that either reduced serum PEA or increased stool PEA would mediate the association between microbial diversity and anhedonia amotivation. Analyses were adjusted for obesity, diet, antidepressant use, sociodemographic and technical covariates. Data were imputed using multiple imputation by chained equations. Mean age was 65.2 ± 7.6; 93% of the sample were females. We found a direct, significant, association between alpha diversity and anhedonia/amotivation (β = -0.37; 95%CI: -0.71 to -0.03; P = 0.03). Faecal, but not serum, levels of the endocannabinoid palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) mediated this association: the indirect effect was significant (β = -0.13; 95%CI: -0.24 to -0.01; P = 0.03), as was the total effect (β = -0.38; 95%CI: -0.72 to -0.04; P = 0.03), whereas the direct effect of alpha diversity on anhedonia/amotivation was attenuated fully (β = -0.25; 95%CI: -0.60 to 0.09; P = 0.16). Our results suggest that gut-microbial diversity might contribute to anhedonia/amotivation via the endocannabinoid system. These findings shed light on the biological underpinnings of anhedonia/amotivation and suggest the gut microbiota-endocannabinoid axis as a promising therapeutic target in an area of unmet clinical need.",Molecular psychiatry,2021,Amedeo Minichino; Matthew A Jackson; Marta Francesconi; Claire J Steves; Cristina Menni; Philip W J Burnet; Belinda R Lennox
33963281,Gut microbiota modulates the inflammatory response and cognitive impairment induced by sleep deprivation.,"Sleep deprivation (SD) is increasingly common in modern society, which can lead to the dysregulation of inflammatory responses and cognitive impairment, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Emerging evidence suggests that gut microbiota plays a critical role in the pathogenesis and development of inflammatory and psychiatric diseases, possibly via gut microbiota-brain interactions and neuroinflammation. The present study investigated the impact of SD on gut microbiota composition and explored whether alterations of the gut microbiota play a causal role in chronic inflammatory states and cognitive impairment that are induced by SD. We found that SD-induced gut dysbiosis, inflammatory responses, and cognitive impairment in humans. Moreover, the absence of the gut microbiota suppressed inflammatory response and cognitive impairment induced by SD in germ-free (GF) mice. Transplantation of the ""SD microbiota"" into GF mice activated the Toll-like receptor 4/nuclear factor-κB signaling pathway and impaired cognitive function in the recipient mice. Mice that harbored ""SD microbiota"" also exhibited increases in neuroinflammation and microglial activity in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex. These findings indicate that gut dysbiosis contributes to both peripheral and central inflammatory processes and cognitive deficits that are induced by SD, which may open avenues for potential interventions that can relieve the detrimental consequences of sleep loss.",Molecular psychiatry,2021,Zhong Wang; Wen-Hao Chen; Su-Xia Li; Zhong-Ming He; Wei-Li Zhu; Yan-Bin Ji; Zhe Wang; Xi-Mei Zhu; Kai Yuan; Yan-Ping Bao; Le Shi; Shi-Qiu Meng; Yan-Xue Xue; Wen Xie; Jie Shi; Wei Yan; Hong Wei; Lin Lu; Ying Han
34776854,Changes in the Gut Microbiome and Predicted Functional Metabolic Effects in an Australian Parkinson's Disease Cohort.,"<b>Background:</b> There has been increasing recognition of the importance of the gut microbiome in Parkinson's disease (PD), but the influence of geographic location has received little attention. The present study characterized the gut microbiota and associated changes in host metabolic pathways in an Australian cohort of people with PD (PwP). <b>Methods:</b> The study involved recruitment and assessment of 87 PwP from multiple Movement Disorders Clinics in Australia and 47 healthy controls. Illumina sequencing of the V3 and V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene was used to distinguish inter-cohort differences in gut microbiota; KEGG analysis was subsequently performed to predict functional changes in host metabolic pathways. <b>Results:</b> The current findings identified significant differences in relative abundance and diversity of microbial operational taxonomic units (OTUs), and specific bacterial taxa between PwP and control groups. Alpha diversity was significantly reduced in PwP when compared to controls. Differences were found in two phyla (Synergistetes and Proteobacteria; both increased in PwP), and five genera (C<i>olidextribacter, Intestinibacter, Kineothrix, Agathobaculum</i>, and <i>Roseburia</i>; all decreased in PwP). Within the PD cohort, there was no association identified between microbial composition and gender, constipation or use of gastrointestinal medication. Furthermore, KEGG analysis identified 15 upregulated and 11 downregulated metabolic pathways which were predicted to be significantly altered in PwP. <b>Conclusion:</b> This study provides the first comprehensive characterization of the gut microbiome and predicted functional metabolic effects in a southern hemisphere PD population, further exploring the possible mechanisms whereby the gut microbiota may exert their influence on this disease, and providing evidence for the incorporation of such data in future individualized therapeutic strategies.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2021,Jade E Kenna; Eng Guan Chua; Megan Bakeberg; Alfred Tay; Sarah McGregor; Anastazja Gorecki; Malcolm Horne; Barry Marshall; Frank L Mastaglia; Ryan S Anderton
34690981,"The Microbiome-Gut-Brain Axis, a Potential Therapeutic Target for Substance-Related Disorders.","Substance addiction is a complex worldwide public health problem. It endangers both personal life and social stability, causing great loss on economy. Substance-related disorder is considered to be a complicated chronic brain disorder. It resulted from interactions among pharmacological properties of addictive substances, individual susceptibility, and social-environmental factors. Unfortunately, there is still no ideal treatment for this disorder. Recent lines of evidence suggest that gut microbiome may play an important role in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders, including substance-related disorders. This review summarizes the research on the relationship between gut microbiome and substance-related disorders, including different types of substance, different individual susceptibility, and the occurrence and development of substance-induced mental disorders.

In this short review, an overview of inflammatory and gut microbiota status in human depression and in rodent models of the illness are provided. Next, potential inflammatory pathways mediating the communications between the gut and the brain under stressful conditions are described.

34311029,Fatty acids and beyond: Age and Alzheimer's disease related changes in lipids reveal the neuro-nutraceutical potential of lipids in cognition.,"Lipids are essential in maintaining brain function, and lipid profiles have been reported to be altered in aged and Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains as compared to healthy mature brains. Both age and AD share common metabolic hallmarks such as increased oxidative stress and perturbed metabolic function, and age remains the most strongly correlated risk factor for AD, a neurodegenerative disease. A major accompanying pathological symptom of these conditions is cognitive impairment, which is linked with changes in lipid metabolism. Thus, nutraceuticals that affect brain lipid metabolism or lipid levels as a whole have the potential to ameliorate cognitive decline. Lipid analyses and lipidomic studies reveal changes in specific lipid types with aging and AD, which can identify potential lipid-based nutraceuticals to restore the brain to a healthy lipid phenotype. The brain lipid profile can be influenced directly with dietary administration of lipids themselves, although because of synergistic effects of nutrients it may be more useful to consider a multi-component diet rather than single nutrient supplementation. Gut microbiota also serve as a source of beneficial lipids, and the value of treatments that manipulate the composition of gut microbiome should not be ignored. Lastly, instead of direct supplementation, compounds that affect pathways involved with lipid metabolism should also be considered as a way of manipulating lipid levels to improve cognition. In this review, we briefly discuss the role of lipids in the brain, the changing lipid profile in AD, current research on lipid-based nutraceuticals and their therapeutic potential to combat cognitive impairment.",Neurochemistry international,2021,Kei-Lin Murata Ooi; Kristina Vacy; Wah Chin Boon
34870091,Compositional and functional alterations in the oral and gut microbiota in patients with psychosis or schizophrenia: A systematic review.,"<b>Background:</b> Gut and oral microbiota are intrinsically linked to human health. Recent studies suggest a direct link with mental health through bidirectional gut-brain pathways. Emerging evidence suggests that the composition and/or function of intestinal microbiome differs in those with psychosis and schizophrenia as compared with controls. There is relatively little research on the predicted or actual functional alterations associated with the composition of oral and gut microbiota in patients with psychosis. We will perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify, evaluate and if possible, combine the published literature on compositional alterations in the oral and gut microbiota in patients with psychosis or schizophrenia compared with healthy controls. We also aim to explore the potential functional impact of any compositional changes. <b>Methods:</b> Original studies involving humans and animals using a case-control, cohort or cross-sectional design will be included. The electronic databases PsycINFO, EMBASE, Web of Science, PubMed/MEDLINE and Cochrane will be systematically searched. Quantitative analyses will be performed using random-effects meta-analyses to calculate mean difference with 95% confidence intervals. <b>Discussion:</b> Changes in microbiota composition in psychosis and schizophrenia have been correlated with alternations in brain structure and function, altered immunity, altered metabolic pathways and symptom severity. Changes have also been identified as potential biomarkers for psychosis that might aid in diagnosis. Understanding how predicted or actual functional alterations in microbial genes or metabolic pathways influence symptomatic expression and downstream clinical outcomes may contribute to the development of microbiome targeted interventions for psychosis. <b>Registration:</b> The study is prospectively registered in PROSPERO, the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42021260208).",HRB open research,2021,Nuala Murray; Sukainah Al Khalaf; David Kaulmann; Edgar Lonergan; John F Cryan; Gerard Clarke; Ali Khashan; Karen O'Connor
34650506,The Relationship Between the Gut Microbiome-Immune System-Brain Axis and Major Depressive Disorder.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prominent cause of disability worldwide. Current antidepressant drugs produce full remission in only about one-third of MDD patients and there are no biomarkers to guide physicians in selecting the best treatment for individuals. There is an urgency to learn more about the etiology of MDD and to identify new targets that will lead to improved therapy and hopefully aid in predicting and preventing MDD. There has been extensive interest in the roles of the immune system and the gut microbiome in MDD and in how these systems interact. Gut microbes can contribute to the nature of immune responses, and a chronic inflammatory state may lead to increased responsiveness to stress and to development of MDD. The gut microbiome-immune system-brain axis is bidirectional, is sensitive to stress and is important in development of stress-related disorders such as MDD. Communication between the gut and brain involves the enteric nervous system (ENS), the autonomic nervous system (ANS), neuroendocrine signaling systems and the immune system, and all of these can interact with the gut microbiota. Preclinical studies and preliminary clinical investigations have reported improved mood with administration of probiotics and prebiotics, but large, carefully controlled clinical trials are now necessary to evaluate their effectiveness in treating MDD. The roles that several gut microbe-derived molecules such as neurotransmitters, short chain fatty acids and tryptophan play in MDD are reviewed briefly. Challenges and potential future directions associated with studying this important axis as it relates to MDD are discussed.",Frontiers in neurology,2021,Jane A Foster; Glen B Baker; Serdar M Dursun
34280457,Stress gets into the belly: Early life stress and the gut microbiome.,"Research has established that stress ""gets under the skin,"" impacting neuroendocrine and neuroimmune pathways to influence risk for physical and mental health outcomes. These effects can be particularly significant for early life stress (ELS), or adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). In this review, we explore whether stress gets ""into the belly,"" that is, whether psychosocial stress affects the gut microbiome. We review animal and human research utilizing a variety of stress paradigms (acute laboratory stressors, chronic stress, stressful life events, perceived stress, ELS, in utero stress) and their impacts on the gut microbiota, with a particular focus on ELS. We also review data on dietary interventions to moderate impact of stress on the gut microbiome. Our review suggests strong evidence that acute laboratory stress, chronic stress, and ELS affect the gut microbiota in rodents, and growing evidence that perceived stress and ELS may impact the gut microbiota in humans. Emerging data also suggests, particularly in rodents, that dietary interventions such as omega-3 fatty acids and pre- and pro-biotics may buffer against the effects of stress on the gut microbiome, but more research is needed. In sum, growing evidence suggests that stress impacts not only the neuroendocrine and neuroimmune axes, but also the microbiota-gut-brain-axis, providing a pathway by which stress may get ""into the belly"" to influence health risk.",Behavioural brain research,2021,Liisa Hantsoo; Babette S Zemel
34550085,"The Safety and Efficacy of Microbial Ecosystem Therapeutic-2 in People With Major Depression: Protocol for a Phase 2, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study.","The gut-brain axis is a bidirectional signaling pathway between the gastrointestinal tract and the brain; it is being studied because of its potential influence in mediating mood, anxiety, and other neuropsychiatric symptoms. Previous research examining the effects of gut microbiota on neuropsychiatric disorders suggests that gut repopulation treatments such as probiotics, microbe therapy, and fecal microbiota transplantation show promising results in treating symptoms of anxiety and depression. This study explores the use of an alternative gut repopulation treatment to fecal microbiota transplantation, known as Microbial Ecosystem Therapeutic (MET)-2, as an intervention against symptoms of depression. MET-2 is a daily, orally administered capsule containing 40 bacterial strains purified from a single healthy donor.The primary aim of this study is to assess changes in mood in people with major depression that occur pre-, post-, and during the administration of MET-2. The secondary aims are to assess changes in anxiety symptoms, blood biomarker concentrations, and the level of repopulation of healthy gut bacteria as a response to treatment.In this study, we will recruit 60 adults aged between 18 and 45 years old with major depression and randomly assign them to treatment or placebo groups. Patients in the treatment group will receive MET-2 once a day for 6 weeks, whereas patients in the placebo group will receive a matching placebo for 6 weeks. Participants will complete biweekly visits during the treatment period and a follow-up visit at 2 weeks post treatment. As a primary outcome measure, participants' mood will be assessed using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale. Secondary outcome measures include changes in mood, anxiety, early stress, gastrointestinal symptoms, and tolerability of MET-2 treatment using a series of clinical scales and changes in blood markers, particularly immunoglobulins (Igs; IgA, IgG, and IgM) and inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor-α, transforming growth factor-β, interleukin-6, and interleukin-10). Changes in the relative abundance, diversity, and level of engraftment in fecal samples will be assessed using 16S rRNA sequencing. All data will be integrated to identify biomarkers that could indicate disease state or predict improvement in depressive symptoms in response to MET-2 treatment.Given the association between the gut microbiome and depression, we hypothesized that participants receiving MET-2 would experience greater improvement in depressive symptoms than those receiving placebo owing to the recolonization of the gut microbiome with healthy bacteria modulating the gut-brain axis connection.This study is the first of its kind to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a microbial therapy such as MET-2 in comparison with placebo for major depressive disorder. We hope that this study will also reveal the potential capabilities of microbial therapies to treat other psychiatric illnesses and mood disorders.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04602715; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04602715.DERR1-10.2196/31439.",JMIR research protocols,2021,Arthi Chinna Meyyappan; Cassandra Sgarbossa; Gustavo Vazquez; David J Bond; Daniel J Müller; Roumen Milev
34338703,Co-supplementation of camelina oil and a prebiotic is more effective for in improving cardiometabolic risk factors and mental health in patients with NAFLD: a randomized clinical trial.,"This trial evaluated the effects of co-supplementing <i>Camelina sativa</i> oil (CSO) and a prebiotic as modulators of the gut microbiota on cardiometabolic risk factors and mental health in NAFLD patients. In all, 44 subjects with NAFLD were allocated to either an intervention (20 g d<sup>-1</sup> CSO + resistant dextrin) or a placebo (20 g d<sup>-1</sup> CSO + maltodextrin) group and received a calorie-restricted diet (-500 kcal d<sup>-1</sup>) for 12 weeks. Fasting plasma levels of gucose, insulin, hs-CRP, endotoxin, antioxidant enzyme activity, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), malondialdehyde (MDA), 8-iso-prostaglandin F2α, and uric acid were measured at the baseline and post-intervention. The depression, anxiety and stress scale (DASS) and the general health questionnaire (GHQ) were used to assess mental health. Co-supplementing CSO and resistant dextrin significantly decreased the level of insulin concentration (-0.84 μU ml<sup>-1</sup>, <i>p</i> = 0.011), HOMA-IR (-0.27, <i>p</i> = 0.021), hs-CRP (-1.25 pg ml<sup>-1</sup>, <i>p</i> = 0.023), endotoxin (-3.70 EU mL<sup>-1</sup>, <i>p</i> = 0.001), cortisol (-2.43, <i>p</i> = 0.033), GHQ (-5.03, <i>p</i> = 0.035), DASS (-9.01, <i>p</i> = 0.024), and MDA (-0.54 nmol mL<sup>-1</sup>, <i>p</i> = 0.021) and increased the levels of TAC (0.16 mmol L<sup>-1</sup>, <i>p</i> = 0.032) and superoxide dismutase (106.32 U g<sup>-1</sup> Hb, <i>p</i> = 0.45) in the intervention group compared with the placebo group.

34603341,Consumption of Butylated Starch Alleviates the Chronic Restraint Stress-Induced Neurobehavioral and Gut Barrier Deficits Through Reshaping the Gut Microbiota.,"The beneficial effect of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) on host health has been well recognized based on the booming knowledge from gut microbiome research. The role of SCFA in influencing psychological function is highlighted in recent years but has not been fully elucidated. In this study, the SCFA-acylated starches were used to accomplish a sizeable intestine-targeted release of the SCFAs, and the neurobehavioral, immunological, and microbial effects were further investigated. Acetylated-, butylated-, and isobutylated-starch could attenuate the depression-like behaviors and excessive corticosterone production in chronically stressed mice. Butylated- starch significantly reduced the colonic permeability <i>via</i> increasing the tight junction proteins (including ZO-1, Claudin, and Occludin) gene expression and reduced the level of the inflammatory cytokines (including IL-1β and IL-6). The butylated starch's neurological and immunological benefits may be derived from the gut microbiome modifications, including normalizing the abundance of certain beneficial microbes (<i>Odoribacter</i> and <i>Oscillibacter</i>) and metabolomic pathways (<i>Tryptophan synthesis</i> and <i>Inositol degradation</i>). The present findings further validate the brain-beneficial effect of butyrate and offer novel guidance for developing novel food or dietary supplements for improving mental health.",Frontiers in immunology,2021,Peijun Tian; Huiyue Zhu; Xin Qian; Ying Chen; Zheng Wang; Jianxin Zhao; Hao Zhang; Gang Wang; Wei Chen
34589003,Gut Microbiome: A Potential Indicator for Differential Diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder and General Anxiety Disorder.,"<b>Background:</b> Major depressive disorder (MDD) and general anxiety disorder (GAD) share many common features, leading to numerous challenges in their differential diagnosis. Given the importance of the microbiota-gut-brain axis, we investigated the differences in gut microbiota between representative cases of these two diseases and sought to develop a microbiome-based approach for their differential diagnosis. <b>Methods:</b> We enrolled 23 patients with MDD, 21 with GAD, and 10 healthy subjects (healthy crowd, HC) in the present study. We used 16S rRNA gene-sequencing analysis to determine the microbial compositions of the gut microbiome based on Illumina Miseq and according to the standard protocol. <b>Results:</b> GAD showed a significant difference in microbiota richness and diversity as compared with HC. Additionally, Otu24167, Otu19140, and Otu19751 were significantly decreased in MDD relative to HC, and Otu2581 and Otu10585 were significantly increased in GAD relative to MDD. At the genus level, the abundances of <i>Sutterella</i> and <i>Fusicatenibacter</i> were significantly lower in MDD relative to HC, and the abundances of <i>Fusicatenibacter</i> and <i>Christensenellaceae</i>_R7_group were significantly lower in GAD than in HC. The abundance of <i>Sutterella</i> was significantly higher whereas that of <i>Faecalibacterium</i> was significantly lower in GAD relative to MDD. Moreover, we observed that <i>Christensenellaceae</i>_R7_group negatively correlated with the factor score (Limited to Hopelessness) and total score of HAMD-24 (<i>p</i> < 0.05), whereas <i>Fusicatenibacter</i> negatively correlated with FT4 (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Furthermore, the GAD group showed significant differences at the genus level for <i>Faecalibacterium</i>, which negatively correlated with PTC (<i>p</i> < 0.05). <b>Conclusions:</b> This study elucidated a unique gut-microbiome signature associated with MDD and GAD that could facilitate differential diagnosis and targeted therapy.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2021,Zaiquan Dong; Xiaoling Shen; Yanni Hao; Jin Li; Haoran Li; Haizheng Xu; Li Yin; Weihong Kuang
34518605,Altered fecal microbiota composition in individuals who abuse methamphetamine.,"As a severe public health problem, methamphetamine (METH) abuse places a heavy burden on families and society. A growing amount of evidence has indicated communication between gut microbiota and the CNS in drug addiction, with associations to neural, endocrine and immune pathways. Thus, we searched for alterations in the gut microbiota and their potential effects in METH users through 16S rRNA gene sequencing. A decreased Shannon index indicated lower bacterial diversity in the METH users than in the age-matched control group. The gut microbial community composition in the METH users was also altered, including reductions in Deltaproteobacteria and Bacteroidaceae abundances and increases in Sphingomonadales, Xanthomonadales, Romboutsia and Lachnospiraceae abundances. Moreover, the Fusobacteria abundance was correlated with the duration of METH use. Enterobacteriaceae, Ruminococcaceae, Bacteroides, and Faecalibacterium had statistically significant correlations with items related to the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia and to general psychopathology in the METH users, and all have previously been reported to be altered in individuals with psychotic syndromes, especially depression. Abstraction, one of the items of the cognitive assessment, was positively related to Blautia. These findings revealed alterations in the gut microbiota of METH users, and these alterations may play a role in psychotic syndrome and cognitive impairment. Although the mechanisms behind the links between these disorders and METH abuse are unknown, the relationships may indicate similarities in the pathogenesis of psychosis induced by METH abuse and other causes, providing a new paradigm for addiction and METH use disorder treatment.",Scientific reports,2021,Yongde Yang; Xuan Yu; Xuebing Liu; Guangya Liu; Kuan Zeng; Gang Wang
34576833,Specific Changes in the Mammalian Gut Microbiome as a Biomarker for Oxytocin-Induced Behavioral Changes.,"Prolonged exposure to psychiatric pharmacological agents is often associated with marked gastrointestinal phenomena, including changes in food intake, bowel motility, gastric emptying, and transit time. Those changes are reflected in the gut microbiota composition of the patient and can, therefore, be objectively measured. This is in contrast to the standard psychiatric evaluation of patients, which includes symptoms that are subjectively assessed (i.e., mood, anxiety level, perception, thought disorders, etc.). The association between a drug's effect on the microbiota and psychiatric symptoms may allow for quantifiable surrogate markers of treatment effectiveness. Changes in the levels of specific drug-sensitive bacterial species can, thus, potentially serve as biomarkers for the intake and effectiveness of psychiatric drugs. Here, we show substantial microbiota changes that were associated with oxytocin administration and the decreased anxiety/depression-like behaviors it conferred in a rat model of corticosterone-induced stress. Compared with oxytocin, citalopram produced more minor effects on the rats' microbiota. Alterations in the gut microbiota may, therefore, reflect the consumption and effectiveness of some psychiatric drugs.",Microorganisms,2021,Itzhak Dangoor; Dušanka Stanić; Leah Reshef; Vesna Pešić; Uri Gophna
34488774,Transcriptomics reveal different metabolic strategies for acid resistance and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) production in select Levilactobacillus brevis strains.,"Of the many neurotransmitters in humans, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) shows potential for improving several mental health indications such as stress and anxiety. The microbiota-gut-brain axis is an important pathway for GABAergic effects, as microbially-secreted GABA within the gut can affect host mental health outcomes. Understanding the molecular characteristics of GABA production by microbes within the gut can offer insight to novel therapies for mental health.Three strains of Levilactobacillus brevis with syntenous glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) operons were evaluated for overall growth, glutamate utilization, and GABA production in typical synthetic growth media supplemented with monosodium glutamate (MSG). Levilactobacillus brevis Lbr-6108™ (Lbr-6108), formerly known as L. brevis DPC 6108, and Levilactobacillus brevis Lbr-35 ™ (Lbr-35) had similar growth profiles but differed significantly in GABA secretion and acid resistance. Lbr-6108 produced GABA early within the growth phase and produced significantly more GABA than Lbr-35 and the type strain Levilactobacillus brevis ATCC 14869 after the stationary phase. The global gene expression during GABA production at several timepoints was determined by RNA sequencing. The GAD operon, responsible for GABA production and secretion, activated in Lbr-6108 after only 6 h of fermentation and continued throughout the stationary phase. Furthermore, Lbr-6108 activated many different acid resistance mechanisms concurrently, which contribute to acid tolerance and energy production. In contrast, Lbr-35, which has a genetically similar GAD operon, including two copies of the GAD gene, showed no upregulation of the GAD operon, even when cultured with MSG.This study is the first to evaluate whole transcriptome changes in Levilactobacillus brevis during GABA production in different growth phases. The concurrent expression of multiple acid-resistance mechanisms reveals niche-specific metabolic functionality between common human commensals and highlights the complex regulation of GABA metabolism in this important microbial species. Furthermore, the increased and rapid GABA production of Lbr-6108 highlights the strain's potential as a therapeutic and the overall value of screening microbes for effector molecule output.",Microbial cell factories,2021,Sagarika Banerjee; Matthew Poore; Svetlana Gerdes; Derek Nedveck; Lene Lauridsen; Heidi Thomsen Kristensen; Henrik Max Jensen; Phillip M Byrd; Arthur C Ouwehand; Elaine Patterson; Wesley Morovic
34691318,Microbial Therapeutics in Neurocognitive and Psychiatric Disorders.,"Microbial therapeutics, which include gut biotics and fecal transplantation, are interventions designed to improve the gut microbiome. Gut biotics can be considered as the administration of direct microbial populations. The delivery of this can be done through live microbial flora, certain food like fiber, microbial products (metabolites and elements) obtained through the fermentation of food products, or as genetically engineered substances, that may have therapeutic benefit on different health disorders. Dietary intervention and pharmacological supplements with gut biotics aim at correcting disruption of the gut microbiota by repopulating with beneficial microorganism leading to decrease in gut permeability, inflammation, and alteration in metabolic activities, through a variety of mechanisms of action. Our understanding of the pharmacokinetics of microbial therapeutics has improved with <i>in vitro</i> models, sampling techniques in the gut, and tools for the reliable identification of gut biotics. Evidence from human studies points out that prebiotics, probiotics and synbiotics have the potential for treating and preventing mental health disorders, whereas with paraprobiotics, proteobiotics and postbiotics, the research is limited at this point. Some animal studies point out that gut biotics can be used with conventional treatments for a synergistic effect on mental health disorders. If future research shows that there is a possibility of synergistic effect of psychotropic medications with gut biotics, then a gut biotic or nutritional prescription can be given along with psychotropics. Even though the overall safety of gut biotics seems to be good, caution is needed to watch for any known and unknown side effects as well as the need for risk benefit analysis with certain vulnerable populations. Future research is needed before wide spread use of natural and genetically engineered gut biotics. Regulatory framework for gut biotics needs to be optimized. Holistic understanding of gut dysbiosis, along with life style factors, by health care providers is necessary for the better management of these conditions. In conclusion, microbial therapeutics are a new psychotherapeutic approach which offer some hope in certain conditions like dementia and depression. Future of microbial therapeutics will be driven by well-done randomized controlled trials and longitudinal research, as well as by replication studies in human subjects.",Journal of clinical medicine research,2021,Kannayiram Alagiakrishnan; Tyler Halverson

The inflammatory z-score increased after the baked chow diet. Gut microbial composition differed significantly between groups, with enriched Dubosiella spp. dominating these alterations.A high AGE-diet led to an increase of AGEs in plasma, kidney, and liver and to more inflammation and modification of the gut microbiota.

34147969,Ingestion of Faecalibaculum rodentium causes depression-like phenotypes in resilient Ephx2 knock-out mice: A role of brain-gut-microbiota axis via the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve.,"The brain-gut-microbiota axis plays a crucial role in the bidirectional interactions between the brain and the gut. Soluble epoxide hydrolase (coded by the Ephx2 gene) plays an important role in inflammation, which has been implicated in stress-related depression. Ephx2 knock-out (KO) mice exposed to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) did not show depression-like behaviors, indicating stress resilience. Here we examined whether the brain-gut-microbiota axis influences the resilience in Ephx2 KO mice.Effects of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from CSDS-susceptible (or control) mice in wild-type (WT) mice and Ephx2 KO mice treated with an antibiotic cocktail (ABX) were investigated. Behavioral, biochemical tests and 16S ribosome RNA analysis were performed.FMT from CSDS-susceptible mice produced anhedonia-like behavior in ABX-treated WT and Ephx2 KO mice. The 16S ribosome RNA analysis showed that Faecalibaculum rodentium (F. rodentium) may be responsible for the observed anhedonia-like behavior following FMT from CSDS-susceptible mice. Ingestion of F. rodentium for 14 days produced depression- and anhedonia-like behaviors, higher blood levels of interleukin-6, and reduced expression of synaptic proteins in the prefrontal cortex of ABX-treated Ephx2 KO mice. Furthermore, subdiaphragmatic vagotomy blocked the development of these behavioral abnormalities after ingestion of F. rodentium.Detailed mechanisms are unclear.These findings suggest that F. rodentium might contribute to the conversion of resilient Ephx2 KO mice into KO mice with depression-like phenotypes.

33713734,Affective disorders impact prevalence of Flavonifractor and abundance of Christensenellaceae in gut microbiota.,"Background Affective disorders (AD) have been associated with a higher prevalence of the gut Flavonifractor genus and a lower abundance of the gut Christensenellaceae family. Objective and methods By pooling two independent study samples of patients with AD (n = 176), their unaffected first-degree relatives (n = 70) and healthy controls (n = 101) we aimed to replicate and extend our prior findings of differential Flavonifractor prevalence and Christensenellaceae abundance when comparing patients with AD and healthy controls. The gut microbiota was profiled using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Results The pattern of higher prevalence of Flavonifractor and lower Centered Log-Ratio (CLR) abundance of Christensenellaceae was associated with AD. In generalized linear models the CLR abundance of Christensenellaceae was lower in patients with AD (p = 0.024), and in smokers (p = 1.9*10<sup>-4</sup>), and inversely associated with increasing waist circumference (p = 0.031). The prevalence of Flavonifractor was higher in patients with AD (p = 0.033) and in smokers (p = 0.036). No impact of psychotropic medication was found. The CLR abundance of Christensenellaceae (p = 0.041), but not the prevalence of Flavonifractor (p = 0.20) could distinguish non-smoking patients with AD from non-smoking healthy controls, whereas no such associations were found in smokers. Unaffected relatives neither differed from patients with AD nor from healthy controls. Conclusion Compared with findings in healthy controls, AD was associated with a significantly lower CLR abundance of the health-linked Christensenellaceae and a significantly higher prevalence of Flavonifractor; findings that are associated with enhanced oxidative stress and systemic low-grade inflammation. If our observations are validated in future independent studies, they support the notion that parts of aberrant gut microbiota are shared by AD and states of dysmetabolism.",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,2021,Klara Coello; Tue Haldor Hansen; Nikolaj Sørensen; Ninja Meinhard Ottesen; Kamilla Woznica Miskowiak; Oluf Pedersen; Lars Vedel Kessing; Maj Vinberg
34489756,The LIFEwithIBD Intervention: Study Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial of a Face-to-Face Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and Compassion-Based Intervention Tailored to People With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"<b>Background:</b> There is ample evidence of the high mental health burden caused by Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Several constructs such as experiential avoidance, cognitive fusion, shame, and self-criticism have recently emerged as potential intervention targets to improve mental health in IBD. Psychotherapeutic models such as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and compassion-based interventions are known to target these constructs. In this protocol, we aim to describe a two-arm Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) testing the efficacy of an ACT and compassion-focused intervention named Living with Intention, Fullness, and Engagement with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (LIFEwithIBD) intervention + Treatment As Usual (TAU) vs. TAU in improving psychological distress, quality of life, work and social functioning, IBD symptom perception, illness-related shame, psychological flexibility, self-compassion, disease activity, inflammation biomarkers, and gut microbiota diversity. <b>Methods:</b> This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT03840707, date assigned 13/02/2019). The LIFEwithIBD intervention is an adaptation to the IBD population of the Mind programme for people with cancer, an acceptance, mindfulness, and compassion-based intervention designed to be delivered in a group format. The LIFEwithIBD intervention's structure and topics are presented in this protocol. Participants were recruited at the Gastroenterology Service of the Coimbra University Hospital between June and September 2019. Of the 355 patients screened, 61 participants were selected, randomly assigned to one of two conditions [experimental group (LIFEwithIBD + TAU) or control group (TAU)] and completed the baseline assessment. Outcome measurement took place at baseline, post-intervention, 3- and 12-month follow-ups. <b>Discussion:</b> Results from this RCT will support future studies testing the LIFEwithIBD intervention or other acceptance and/or compassion-based interventions for IBD.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2021,Inês A Trindade; Joana Pereira; Ana Galhardo; Nuno B Ferreira; Paola Lucena-Santos; Sérgio A Carvalho; Sara Oliveira; David Skvarc; Bárbara S Rocha; Francisco Portela; Cláudia Ferreira
34413106,Protocol for the National Nurse Health Study (NNHS): a web-based ambispective cohort study.,"The physical and mental health of nurses may significantly impact the entire medical care group and directly affect the quality of medical services. Due to the intense emotional involvement and often problematic working conditions that characterise their profession, nurses appear to be especially susceptible to a complex set of stressors with repercussions to their health. Several landmark studies of nurses have provided an abundance of evidence on risk factors that influence the health status of nurses. However, few studies have investigated the health status of nurses who work in high-intensity work environments in China. The National Nurse Health Study (NNHS) objective is to build an ambispective cohort to gather web-based information on early-life events, daily habits, occupational and environmental risk factors, and health outcomes of a specific subset of healthcare professionals of Chinese nurses.NNHS, which was developed at a tertiary hospital in Beijing, China, is a research initiative that enrolls registered nurses working at Peking University Third Hospital. A web-based self-administered system was designed to collect health-related data and link them with previous physical examination data. During the study period, participants with signed informed consent will be invited to annually repeat a similar procedure.The NNHS research protocol was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee and provides promising data that contribute to the understanding of pathophysiological links between early-life events, body composition, gut microbiota, and inflammatory and metabolic risk profiles. Moreover, the combination of a user-friendly tool with the innovative purposes of the NNHS offers a remarkable resource to test hypotheses about mechanisms of diseases, including work stress, and further plan preventive programmes in public health.The study was registered on Clinicaltrials.gov (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04572347) and the China Cohort Consortium (http://chinacohort.bjmu.edu.cn/project/102/).",BMJ open,2021,Lin Zhuo; Heli Zhang; Rongmei Geng; Panfeng Wang; Lin Zeng; Ying Che; Peng Wang; Pengfei Li; Tao Huang; Baohua Li; Siyan Zhan
34329424,Probiotics-targeting new milestones from gut health to mental health.,"Conventional probiotic food research was primarily focused on their benefits for gut health. Recently with the confirmation that the gut microbiota has a bidirectional connection with the brain, it is being proposed that modification of the microbiota can possibly extirpate neurological diseases. Development of probiotic foods and formulations for neural health benefits has garnered interest, with a renewed focus. In this context, this review discusses the evidences collected on the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of probiotics, especially during the time span of 2015-till now. Although, more clinical trials are necessary to elucidate the exact mechanism of probiotic mode of action but several of the established probiotic strains have been investigated and it appears that few of them have demonstrated their potential as 'psychobiotics'. The formulation of new psychobiotic-based therapeutics is in the spotlight. It is expected that in near future, biological effect of probiotics on neurological conditions will open up an entirely new avenue for personalized medication and healthcare in mental health, and they can be tailored according to the gut-microbiota of specific individuals.",FEMS microbiology letters,2021,Gargi Dey; Sohom Mookherjee
34485176,Altered Fecal Microbiota Composition in Older Adults With Frailty.,"Frailty is a common geriatric syndrome that is diagnosed and staged based mainly on symptoms. We aimed to evaluate frailty-related alterations of the intestinal permeability and profile fecal microbiota of healthy and frail older adults to identify microbial biomarkers of this syndrome.We collected serum and fecal samples from 94 community-dwelling older adults, along with anthropometric, medical, mental health, and lifestyle data. Serum inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and HGMB1 and the intestinal permeability biomarker zonulin were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing method was performed to determine the fecal composition of fecal microbiota. We analyzed the diversity and composition differences of the gut microbiota in the two groups and assessed the relationship between the changes in microbiota structure and clinical biomarkers.Older adults with frailty showed higher concentrations of IL-6, HGMB1, and zonulin. Although there were no statistically significant differences in the diversity index and evenness indices or species richness of fecal microbiota between the two groups, we found significant microbiota structure differences. Compared with the control group, fecal samples from the frail group had higher levels of <i>Akkermansia</i>, <i>Parabacteroides</i>, and <i>Klebsiella</i> and lower levels of the commensal genera <i>Faecalibacterium</i>, <i>Prevotella</i>, <i>Roseburia</i>, <i>Megamonas</i>, and <i>Blautia.</i> Spearman's correlation analysis showed that the intergenus interactions were more common in healthy controls than older adults with frailty. <i>Escherichia</i>/<i>Shigella</i>, <i>Pyramidobacter</i>, <i>Alistipes</i>, and <i>Akkermansia</i> were positively correlated with IL-6, while <i>Faecalibacterium</i>, <i>Prevotella</i>, and <i>Roseburia</i> were negatively correlated with IL-6. <i>Alistipes</i> were found to be positively correlated with HGMB1. <i>Akkermansia</i> and <i>Alistipes</i> were linked to the increased serum level of inflammatory factors and intestinal permeability.Frailty is associated with differences in the composition of fecal microbiota. These findings might aid in the development of probiotics or microbial-based therapies for frailty.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2021,YuShuang Xu; YiHua Wang; HeWei Li; Yong Dai; Di Chen; MengMeng Wang; Xin Jiang; ZaoZao Huang; HongLu Yu; JuanJuan Huang; ZhiFan Xiong
34437440,Association of Polygenic Risk Score and Bacterial Toxins at Screening Colonoscopy with Colorectal Cancer Progression: A Multicenter Case-Control Study.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide, and its incidence is correlated with infections, chronic inflammation, diet, and genetic factors. An emerging aspect is that microbial dysbiosis and chronic infections triggered by certain bacteria can be risk factors for tumor progression. Recent data suggest that certain bacterial toxins implicated in DNA attack or in proliferation, replication, and death can be risk factors for insurgence and progression of CRC. In this study, we recruited more than 300 biopsy specimens from people undergoing colonoscopy, and we analyzed to determine whether a correlation exists between the presence of bacterial genes coding for toxins possibly involved in CRC onset and progression and the different stages of CRC. We also analyzed to determine whether CRC-predisposing genetic factors could contribute to bacterial toxins response. Our results showed that CIF toxin is associated with polyps or adenomas, whereas pks+ seems to be a predisposing factor for CRC. Toxins from <i>Escherichia coli</i> as a whole have a higher incidence rate in adenocarcinoma patients compared to controls, whereas <i>Bacteroides fragilis</i> toxin does not seem to be associated with pre-cancerous nor with cancerous lesions. These results have been obtained irrespectively of the presence of CRC-risk loci.",Toxins,2021,Alfonso Piciocchi; Elena Angela Pia Germinario; Koldo Garcia Etxebarria; Silvia Rossi; Lupe Sanchez-Mete; Barbara Porowska; Vittoria Stigliano; Paolo Trentino; Andrea Oddi; Fabio Accarpio; Gian Luca Grazi; Giovanni Bruno; Massimo Bonucci; Massimo Giambenedetti; Patrizia Spigaglia; Fabrizio Barbanti; Slawomir Owczarek; Ida Luzzi; Elisabetta Delibato; Zaira Maroccia; Lorenza Nisticò; Carla Fiorentini; Mauro D'Amato; Roberta De Angelis; Alessia Fabbri
34440563,Targeting Metabolic Dysfunction for the Treatment of Mood Disorders: Review of the Evidence.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD) are often chronic with many patients not responding to available treatments. As these mood disorders are frequently associated with metabolic dysfunction, there has been increased interest in novel treatments that would target metabolic pathways. The objectives of this scoping review were to synthesize evidence on the impact on mood symptoms of lipid lowering agents and anti-diabetics drugs, while also reviewing current knowledge on the association between mood disorders and dyslipidemia or hyperglycemia. We propose that metabolic dysfunction is prevalent in both MDD and BD and it may contribute to the development of these disorders through a variety of pathophysiological processes including inflammation, brain structural changes, hormonal alterations, neurotransmitter disruptions, alteration on brain cholesterol, central insulin resistance, and changes in gut microbiota. Current evidence is conflicting on the use of statins, polyunsaturated fatty acids, thiazolidinediones, glucagon-like peptide agonists, metformin, or insulin for the treatment of MDD and BD. Given the paucity of high-quality randomized controlled trials, additional studies are needed before any of these medications can be repurposed in routine clinical practice. Future trials need to enrich patient recruitment, include evaluations of mechanism of action, and explore differential effects on specific symptom domains such as anhedonia, suicidality, and cognition.","Life (Basel, Switzerland)",2021,Brett D M Jones; Salman Farooqui; Stefan Kloiber; Muhammad Omair Husain; Benoit H Mulsant; Muhammad Ishrat Husain
34376593,[Intestinal Flora and Mental Disorders: A Focus on Mood Disorders and Autism Spectrum Disorder].,"The intestinal flora plays a key role in the stress response and barrier function of the gut, both of which are closely associated with the pathophysiology of mental health conditions, such as mood disorders and autistic spectrum disorder through the phenomenon of brain-gut interaction. Despite increasing accumulation of empirical data regarding the contribution of the gut microbiota to these disorders, studies have reported inconsistent results. Notably, short chain fatty acid-producing bacteria and those implicated in the pathophysiology of metabolic diseases appear to be associated with the psychiatric conditions. Clinical trials have shown some evidence to suggest the beneficial effects of probiotics in depressive and neurodevelopmental disorders. Limited studies have discussed this subject; however, the role of the intestinal flora in the pathophysiology and treatment of mental disorders appears to be a promising field of research.",Brain and nerve = Shinkei kenkyu no shinpo,2021,Hiroshi Kunugi
34004259,Abnormalities in the composition of the gut microbiota in mice after repeated administration of DREADD ligands.,"Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) are known as genetically modified G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which can be activated by synthetic ligands such as clozapine N-oxide (CNO) and DREADD agonist 21 (compound 21: C21). The brain-gut-microbiota axis has a crucial role in bidirectional interactions between the brain and the gastrointestinal microbiota. In this study, we investigated whether repeated administration of CNO or C21 could influence the gut microbiota and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in feces of adult mice. Repeated administration of CNO or C21 as drinking water did not alter the α- and β-diversity of gut microbiota in mice compared with control mice. However, we found significant changes in relative abundance for several bacteria in the CNO (or C21) group at the taxonomic level compared to the control group. The linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) algorithm distinguished the family Prevotellaceae, the genus Anaerocolumna, the genus Prevotella, and the genus Frisingicoccus, these four specific microbial markers for the CNO group relative to the control group. In addition, the LEfSe algorithm identified the family Clostridiaceae, the genus Faecalicatena and the genus Marinisporobacter, these three bacteria of different taxonomic as potential microbial markers for the C21 group relative to the control group. In contrast, repeated administration of CNO (or C21) did not alter SCFAs in feces samples of adult mice. The data suggest that repeated administration of CNO or C21 contributes to an unusual organization of the gut microbiota in adult mice. Therefore, abnormalities in the composition of gut microbiota by repeated dosing of DREADD ligands should be taken into consideration for behavioral and biological functions in rodents treated with DREADD ligands.",Brain research bulletin,2021,Wei Guo; Xiayun Wan; Li Ma; Jiancheng Zhang; Kenji Hashimoto

We aimed to verify the efficacy and safety of probiotic NVP-1704, a mixture of <i>Lactobacillus reuteri</i> NK33 and <i>Bifidobacterium adolescentis</i> NK98, in improving stress, depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances, along with the measurement of some blood biomarkers. A total of 156 healthy adults with subclinical symptoms of depression, anxiety, and insomnia were retrospectively registered and randomly assigned to receive either NVP-1704 (<i>n</i> = 78) or a placebo (<i>n</i> = 78) for eight weeks. Participants completed the Stress Response Inventory, Beck's Depression and Anxiety Inventory, Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index, and Insomnia Severity Index at baseline, at four and eight weeks of treatment. Pre- and post-treatment blood tests for biomarkers were conducted. After intervention, gut microbiota composition was quantified by pyrosequencing the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. The NVP-1704 group had a more significant reduction in depressive symptoms at four and eight weeks of treatment, and anxiety symptoms at four weeks compared to the placebo group. Those receiving NVP-1704 also experienced an improvement in sleep quality. NVP-1704 treatment led to a decrease in serum interleukin-6 levels. Furthermore, NVP-1704 increased <i>Bifidobacteriaceae</i> and <i>Lactobacillacea</i>, whereas it decreased <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> in the gut microbiota composition. Our findings suggest that probiotic NVP-1704 could be beneficial for mental health and sleep.",Nutrients,2021,Hyuk Joo Lee; Jung Kyung Hong; Jeon-Kyung Kim; Dong-Hyun Kim; Seok Won Jang; Seung-Won Han; In-Young Yoon
34393849,Association Between Abundance of <i>Haemophilus</i> in the Gut Microbiota and Negative Symptoms of Schizophrenia.,"Increasing evidence indicates an interaction between dysbiosis of the microbiota and the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. However, limited information is available on the specific microbial communities associated with symptoms of schizophrenia. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate gut microbiota dysbiosis and its relationship with psychopathologies in schizophrenia. We recruited 126 participants and divided them into three groups according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, criteria-acute group (patients with acute schizophrenia), remission group (patients with schizophrenia in remission), and control group (healthy controls). Psychotic symptoms were evaluated using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Microbiota compositions, diversity and community structure were evaluated using 16S rRNA sequencing. Pearson's correlation analysis was used to evaluate the association between bacterial taxa and psychotic symptoms. The beta-diversity of microbiota composition in the acute group was distinct from that in the remission and control groups (PC1 = 21.11% vs. PC2 = 12.86%, <i>P</i> = 0.021). Furthermore, Pearson's correlation analysis revealed that abundance of <i>Haemophilu</i>s was positively correlated with negative psychiatric symptoms (<i>r</i> = 0.303, <i>P</i> = 0.021), while abundance of <i>Coprococcus</i> was negatively correlated with negative psychiatric symptoms (<i>r</i> = -<i>0.285, P</i> = <i>0.025</i>). Moreover, abundance of <i>Haemophilus</i> was positively correlated with cognition (<i>r</i> = 0.428, <i>P</i> = 0.009), excitement (<i>r</i> = 0.266, <i>P</i> = 0.037), and depression (<i>r</i> = 0.295, <i>P</i> = 0.020). The study findings suggest that alterations in certain gut microbiota may interfere with psychological symptoms in schizophrenia. Our results provide evidence that may help in the development of therapeutic strategies using microbial-based targets.

33693453,Diet and the Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis: Sowing the Seeds of Good Mental Health.,"Over the past decade, the gut microbiota has emerged as a key component in regulating brain processes and behavior. Diet is one of the major factors involved in shaping the gut microbiota composition across the lifespan. However, whether and how diet can affect the brain via its effects on the microbiota is only now beginning to receive attention. Several mechanisms for gut-to-brain communication have been identified, including microbial metabolites, immune, neuronal, and metabolic pathways, some of which could be prone to dietary modulation. Animal studies investigating the potential of nutritional interventions on the microbiota-gut-brain axis have led to advancements in our understanding of the role of diet in this bidirectional communication. In this review, we summarize the current state of the literature triangulating diet, microbiota, and host behavior/brain processes and discuss potential underlying mechanisms. Additionally, determinants of the responsiveness to a dietary intervention and evidence for the microbiota as an underlying modulator of the effect of diet on brain health are outlined. In particular, we emphasize the understudied use of whole-dietary approaches in this endeavor and the need for greater evidence from clinical populations. While promising results are reported, additional data, specifically from clinical cohorts, are required to provide evidence-based recommendations for the development of microbiota-targeted, whole-dietary strategies to improve brain and mental health.","Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2021,Kirsten Berding; Klara Vlckova; Wolfgang Marx; Harriet Schellekens; Catherine Stanton; Gerard Clarke; Felice Jacka; Timothy G Dinan; John F Cryan
34290352,The change of gut microbiota in MDD patients under SSRIs treatment.,"The alterations in the gut microbiota have been reported to be correlated with the development of depression. The purpose of this study was to investigate the changes of intestinal microbiota in depressed patients after antidepressant treatment. We recruited 30 MDD patients (MDD group) and 30 healthy controls (control group). The MDD group received individualized treatment with escitalopram at a maximum dose of 20 mg/day. After depressive symptoms improved to a HAMD scale score > 50%, a fecal sample was collected again and used as the follow-up group. The differences of gut microbiota between patients and controls, the characteristics of gut microbiota under treatment and the potential differences in metabolic functions were thus investigated. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was significantly different within three groups, and the ratio of follow-up group was significantly lower than those of the other two groups. Alpha diversity was significantly higher in MDD group than those of the other groups, and the alpha diversity was not significantly different between control and follow-up groups. The beta diversity of some patients resembled participants in the control group. The metabolic function of gut microbiota after treatment was still different from that of the control group. This study suggests that the intestinal flora of depressed patients has a tendency to return to normal under escitalopram treatment.",Scientific reports,2021,Yang Shen; Xiao Yang; Gaofei Li; Jiayu Gao; Ying Liang

33497754,Gut microbiota alteration and modulation in psychiatric disorders: Current evidence on fecal microbiota transplantation.,"The micro-organisms residing within the gastrointestinal tract, namely gut microbiota, form a dynamic population proper of each individual, mostly composed by bacteria which co-evolved symbiotically with human species. The advances of culture-independent techniques allowed the understanding of the multiple functions of the gut microbiota in human physiology and disease, the latter often recognising a predisposing condition in an imbalanced intestinal microbial ecosystem (dysbiosis). A complex mutual interconnection between the central nervous system (CNS), the intestine and the gut microbiota, known as ""microbiota-gut-brain axis"", has been hypothesized to play a pivotal role in maintaining central and peripheral functions, as well as mental health. Thus, dysbiosis with specific microbiota imbalances seems to be strongly associated with the onset psychiatric disorders by altering neurodevelopment, enhancing neurodegeneration, affecting behaviour and mood. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) consists of transferring the fecal matter from a donor into the gastrointestinal tract of a recipient, and it is used to quickly modulate the gut microbiota. This review focuses on the uses of FMT in psychiatric disorders. FMT has been used to induce dysbiosis and to study the disease development, or to heal dysbiosis-related mental disorders. Overall, FMT of impaired microbiota resulted effective in enhancing psychiatric-like disturbances (mainly depression and anxiety) in recipient animals, plausibly by impairing immune system, inflammatory and metabolic pathways, neurochemical processes and neuro-transmission. On the other side, preclinical and clinical data suggest that reversing or mitigating dysbiosis seems a promising strategy to restore behavioural impairments or to obtain psychiatric symptom relief. However, current evidence is limited by the lack of procedural standardization, the paucity of human studies in the vastity of psychiatric conditions and the need of a microbiota-targeted donor-recipient matching.",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,2021,Carlo Romano Settanni; Gianluca Ianiro; Stefano Bibbò; Giovanni Cammarota; Antonio Gasbarrini
34238926,Gut microbiota signature in treatment-naïve attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.,"Compelling evidence supports alterations in gut microbial diversity, bacterial composition, and/or relative abundance of several bacterial taxa in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, findings for ADHD are inconsistent among studies, and specific gut microbiome signatures for the disorder remain unknown. Given that previous studies have mainly focused on the pediatric form of the disorder and involved small sample sizes, we conducted the largest study to date to compare the gastrointestinal microbiome composition in 100 medication-naïve adults with ADHD and 100 sex-matched healthy controls. We found evidence that ADHD subjects have differences in the relative abundance of several microbial taxa. At the family level, our data support a lower relative abundance of Gracilibacteraceae and higher levels of Selenomonadaceae and Veillonellaceae in adults with ADHD. In addition, the ADHD group showed higher levels of Dialister and Megamonas and lower abundance of Anaerotaenia and Gracilibacter at the genus level. All four selected genera explained 15% of the variance of ADHD, and this microbial signature achieved an overall sensitivity of 74% and a specificity of 71% for distinguishing between ADHD patients and healthy controls. We also tested whether the selected genera correlate with age, body mass index (BMI), or scores of the ADHD rating scale but found no evidence of correlation between genera relative abundance and any of the selected traits. These results are in line with recent studies supporting gut microbiome alterations in neurodevelopment disorders, but further studies are needed to elucidate the role of the gut microbiota on the ADHD across the lifespan and its contribution to the persistence of the disorder from childhood to adulthood.",Translational psychiatry,2021,Vanesa Richarte; Cristina Sánchez-Mora; Montserrat Corrales; Christian Fadeuilhe; Laura Vilar-Ribó; Lorena Arribas; Estela Garcia; Silvia Karina Rosales-Ortiz; Alejandro Arias-Vasquez; María Soler-Artigas; Marta Ribasés; Josep Antoni Ramos-Quiroga
34277527,Towards Tailored Gut Microbiome-Based and Dietary Interventions for Promoting the Development and Maintenance of a Healthy Brain.,"Mental health is determined by a complex interplay between the Neurological Exposome and the Human Genome. Multiple genetic and non-genetic (exposome) factors interact early in life, modulating the risk of developing the most common complex neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), with potential long-term consequences on health. To date, the understating of the precise etiology underpinning these neurological alterations, and their clinical management pose a challenge. The crucial role played by diet and gut microbiota in brain development and functioning would indicate that modulating the gut-brain axis may help protect against the onset and progression of mental-health disorders. Some nutritional deficiencies and gut microbiota alterations have been linked to NDDs, suggesting their potential pathogenic implications. In addition, certain dietary interventions have emerged as promising alternatives or adjuvant strategies for improving the management of particular NDDs, at least in particular subsets of subjects. The gut microbiota can be a key to mediating the effects of other exposome factors such as diet on mental health, and ongoing research in Psychiatry and Neuropediatrics is developing Precision Nutrition Models to classify subjects according to a diet response prediction based on specific individual features, including microbiome signatures. Here, we review current scientific evidence for the impact of early life environmental factors, including diet, on gut microbiota and neuro-development, emphasizing the potential long-term consequences on health; and also summarize the state of the art regarding the mechanisms underlying diet and gut microbiota influence on the brain-gut axis. Furthermore, we describe the evidence supporting the key role played by gut microbiota, diet and nutrition in neurodevelopment, as well as the effectiveness of certain dietary and microbiome-based interventions aimed at preventing or treating NDDs. Finally, we emphasize the need for further research to gain greater insight into the complex interplay between diet, gut microbiome and brain development.

34014031,Impaired blood-brain barrier in the microbiota-gut-brain axis: Potential role of bipolar susceptibility gene TRANK1.,"Bipolar disorder (BD) is a common psychiatric illness with high prevalence and disease burden. Accumulating susceptibility genes for BD have been identified in recent years. However, the exact functions of these genes remain largely unknown. Despite its high heritability, gene and environment interaction is commonly accepted as the major contributing factor to BD pathogenesis. Intestine microbiota is increasingly recognized as a critical environmental factor for human health and diseases via the microbiota-gut-brain axis. BD individuals showed altered diversity and compositions in the commensal microbiota. In addition to pro-inflammatory factors, such as interleukin-6 and tumour necrosis factor-α, type 1 interferon signalling pathway is also modulated by specific intestinal bacterial strains. Disruption of the microbiota-gut-brain axis contributes to peripheral and central nervous system inflammation, which accounts for the BD aetiology. Administration of type 1 interferon can induce the expression of TRANK1, which is associated with elevated circulating biomarkers of the impaired blood-brain barrier in BD patients. In this review, we focus on the influence of intestine microbiota on the expression of bipolar gene TRANK1 and propose that intestine microbiota-dependent type 1 interferon signalling is sufficient to induce the over-expression of TRANK1, consequently causing the compromise of BBB integrity and facilitating the entrance of inflammatory mediators into the brain. Activated neuroinflammation eventually contributes to the occurrence and development of BD. This review provides a new perspective on how gut microbiota participate in the pathogenesis of BD. Future studies are needed to validate these assumptions and develop new treatment targets for BD.",Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,2021,Jianbo Lai; Jiajun Jiang; Peifen Zhang; Caixi Xi; Lingling Wu; Xingle Gao; Yaoyang Fu; Danhua Zhang; Yiqing Chen; Huimin Huang; Yiyi Zhu; Shaohua Hu
33895287,Manipulations of the gut microbiome alter chemotherapy-induced inflammation and behavioral side effects in female mice.,"Chemotherapy treatment is associated with acute behavioral side effects (fatigue, anorexia) that significantly reduce patient quality of life and are dose-limiting, thereby increasing mortality (Kidwell et al., 2014). Disruptions to gut homeostasis (diarrhea, constipation, microbial dysbiosis) are also observed in patients receiving chemotherapy. In non-oncological patients, facets of mental health (fatigue, anxiety, depression) correlate with alterations in the gut microbiome, suggestive of a contribution of the gut in CNS disease etiology. The potential gut-to-brain pathway is poorly understood in patients receiving chemotherapy. Our prior studies have demonstrated a correlation between chemotherapy treatment, gut changes, peripheral and central inflammation, and behavioral symptoms in mice. Here we aimed to determine the extent to which chemotherapy-associated gut manipulations modulate the behavioral and biological consequences of chemotherapy. We measured sickness behaviors, peripheral and central inflammatory mediators, and anxiety in conventional or germ-free female mice: 1) cohabitating with mice of the opposite treatment group, 2) pre-treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, or 3) given an intra-gastric gavage of gut content from chemotherapy-treated mice. In cohabitation studies, presumed coprophagia promoted body mass recovery, however strong associations with inflammation and behavior were not observed. Reduction of gut microbial alpha diversity via antibiotics did not prevent chemotherapy-associated side effects, however the relative abundances of the genera Tyzzerella, Romboutsia, and Turicibacter correlated with circulating inflammatory (IL-1β) and behavioral outcomes (lethargy, anxiety-like behavior). A gut microbiota transplant from chemotherapy-treated mice decreased central locomotion in open field testing, increased circulating CXCL1, and increased hippocampal Il6 and Tnfa in germ-free mice compared to germ-free mice that received a transplant from vehicle-treated mice. Taken together, these data provide further evidence that the gut microbiota likely contributes to the development of chemotherapy-associated side effects. This work has significant implications in the future treatment of anxiety in patients, and warrants future studies using microbe-based treatment options.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2021,C V Grant; B R Loman; M T Bailey; L M Pyter

While sialylated human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) have been implicated in phenotypic programming, their selective role and underlying mechanisms remained elusive. Here, we investigated the long-term consequences of a selective lactational deprivation of a specific sialylated HMO in mice. We capitalized on a knock-out (KO) mouse model (B6.129-St6gal1<sup>tm2Jxm</sup>/J) lacking the gene responsible for the synthesis of sialyl(alpha2,6)lactose (6'SL), one of the two sources of sialic acid (Neu5Ac) to the lactating offspring. Neu5Ac is involved in the formation of brain structures sustaining cognition. To deprive lactating offspring of 6'SL, we cross-fostered newborn wild-type (WT) pups to KO dams, which provide 6'SL-deficient milk. To test whether lactational 6'SL deprivation affects cognitive capabilities in adulthood, we assessed attention, perseveration, and memory. To detail the associated endophenotypes, we investigated hippocampal electrophysiology, plasma metabolomics, and gut microbiota composition. To investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms, we assessed gene expression (at eye-opening and in adulthood) in two brain regions mediating executive functions and memory (hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, PFC). Compared to control mice, WT offspring deprived of 6'SL during lactation exhibited consistent alterations in all cognitive functions addressed, hippocampal electrophysiology, and in pathways regulating the serotonergic system (identified through gut microbiota and plasma metabolomics). These were associated with a site- (PFC) and time-specific (eye-opening) reduced expression of genes involved in central nervous system development. Our data suggest that 6'SL in maternal milk adjusts cognitive development through a short-term upregulation of genes modulating neuronal patterning in the PFC.",Molecular psychiatry,2021,Jonas Hauser; Edoardo Pisa; Alejandro Arias Vásquez; Flavio Tomasi; Alice Traversa; Valentina Chiodi; Francois-Pierre Martin; Norbert Sprenger; Oksana Lukjancenko; Alix Zollinger; Sylviane Metairon; Nora Schneider; Pascal Steiner; Alberto Martire; Viviana Caputo; Simone Macrì
34174901,Beyond the lesion site: minocycline augments inflammation and anxiety-like behavior following SCI in rats through action on the gut microbiota.,"Minocycline is a clinically available synthetic tetracycline derivative with anti-inflammatory and antibiotic properties. The majority of studies show that minocycline can reduce tissue damage and improve functional recovery following central nervous system injuries, mainly attributed to the drug's direct anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and neuroprotective properties. Surprisingly the consequences of minocycline's antibiotic (i.e., antibacterial) effects on the gut microbiota and systemic immune response after spinal cord injury have largely been ignored despite their links to changes in mental health and immune suppression.Here, we sought to determine minocycline's effect on spinal cord injury-induced changes in the microbiota-immune axis using a cervical contusion injury in female Lewis rats. We investigated a group that received minocycline following spinal cord injury (immediately after injury for 7 days), an untreated spinal cord injury group, an untreated uninjured group, and an uninjured group that received minocycline. Plasma levels of cytokines/chemokines and fecal microbiota composition (using 16s rRNA sequencing) were monitored for 4 weeks following spinal cord injury as measures of the microbiota-immune axis. Additionally, motor recovery and anxiety-like behavior were assessed throughout the study, and microglial activation was analyzed immediately rostral to, caudal to, and at the lesion epicenter.We found that minocycline had a profound acute effect on the microbiota diversity and composition, which was paralleled by the subsequent normalization of spinal cord injury-induced suppression of cytokines/chemokines. Importantly, gut dysbiosis following spinal cord injury has been linked to the development of anxiety-like behavior, which was also decreased by minocycline. Furthermore, although minocycline attenuated spinal cord injury-induced microglial activation, it did not affect the lesion size or promote measurable motor recovery.We show that minocycline's microbiota effects precede its long-term effects on systemic cytokines and chemokines following spinal cord injury. These results provide an exciting new target of minocycline as a therapeutic for central nervous system diseases and injuries.",Journal of neuroinflammation,2021,Emma K A Schmidt; Pamela J F Raposo; Abel Torres-Espin; Keith K Fenrich; Karim Fouad
34172092,Depletion of acetate-producing bacteria from the gut microbiota facilitates cognitive impairment through the gut-brain neural mechanism in diabetic mice.,"Modification of the gut microbiota has been reported to reduce the incidence of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D). We hypothesized that the gut microbiota shifts might also have an effect on cognitive functions in T1D. Herein we used a non-absorbable antibiotic vancomycin to modify the gut microbiota in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced T1D mice and studied the impact of microbial changes on cognitive performances in T1D mice and its potential gut-brain neural mechanism.We found that vancomycin exposure disrupted the gut microbiome, altered host metabolic phenotypes, and facilitated cognitive impairment in T1D mice. Long-term acetate deficiency due to depletion of acetate-producing bacteria resulted in the reduction of synaptophysin (SYP) in the hippocampus as well as learning and memory impairments. Exogenous acetate supplement or fecal microbiota transplant recovered hippocampal SYP level in vancomycin-treated T1D mice, and this effect was attenuated by vagal inhibition or vagotomy.Our results demonstrate the protective role of microbiota metabolite acetate in cognitive functions and suggest long-term acetate deficiency as a risk factor of cognitive decline.

34201752,"Dietary Fibre Intervention for Gut Microbiota, Sleep, and Mental Health in Adults with Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Scoping Review.","Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder affecting 4-5% of the global population. This disorder is associated with gut microbiota, diet, sleep, and mental health. This scoping review therefore aims to map existing research that has administrated fibre-related dietary intervention to IBS individuals and reported outcomes on at least two of the three following themes: gut microbiota, sleep, and mental health. Five digital databases were searched to identify and select papers as per the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Five articles were included in the assessment, where none reported on all three themes or the combination of gut microbiota and sleep. Two studies identified alterations in gut microbiota and mental health with fibre supplementation. The other three studies reported on mental health and sleep outcomes using subjective questionnaires. IBS-related research lacks system biology-type studies targeting gut microbiota, sleep, and mental health in patients undergoing diet intervention. Further IBS research is required to explore how human gut microbiota functions (such as short-chain fatty acids) in sleep and mental health, following the implementation of dietary pattern alteration or component supplementation. Additionally, the application of objective sleep assessments is required in order to detect sleep change with more accuracy and less bias.",Nutrients,2021,Ran Yan; Lesley Andrew; Evania Marlow; Kanita Kunaratnam; Amanda Devine; Ian C Dunican; Claus T Christophersen
34204057,Mediterranean Diet as an Antioxidant: The Impact on Metabolic Health and Overall Wellbeing.,"It has been established, worldwide, that non-communicable diseases such as obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular events account for a high percentage of morbidity and mortality in contemporary societies. Several modifiable risk factors, such as sedentary activities, sleep deprivation, smoking, and unhealthy dietary habits have contributed to this increase. Healthy nutrition in terms of adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MD), rich in fruits, legumes, vegetables, olive oil, herbs, spices, and high fiber intake may contribute to the decrease in this pandemic. The beneficial effects of the MD can be mainly attributed to its numerous components rich in anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Moreover, the MD may further contribute to the improvement of reproductive health, modify the risk for neurodegenerative diseases, and protect against depression and psychosocial maladjustment. There is also evidence highlighting the impact of healthy nutrition in female people on the composition of the gut microbiota and future metabolic and overall health of their offspring. It is therefore important to highlight the beneficial effects of the MD on metabolic, reproductive, and mental health, while shaping the overall health of future generations. The beneficial effects of MD can be further enhanced by increased physical activity in the context of a well-balanced healthy lifestyle.",Nutrients,2021,Katherina V Gantenbein; Christina Kanaka-Gantenbein
34098340,Maternal prenatal gut microbiota composition predicts child behaviour.,"Murine studies demonstrate that maternal prenatal gut microbiota influences brain development and behaviour of offspring. No human study has related maternal gut microbiota to behavioural outcomes during early life. This study aimed to evaluate relationships between the prenatal faecal microbiota, prenatal diet and childhood behaviour.A sub-cohort of 213 mothers and 215 children were selected from a longitudinal pre-birth cohort. Maternal prenatal exposure measures collected during the third trimester included the faecal microbiota (generated using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing), and dietary intake. The behavioural outcome used the Childhood Behaviour Checklist at age two. Models were adjusted for prenatal diet, smoking, perceived stress, maternal age and sample batch.We found evidence that the alpha diversity of the maternal faecal microbiota during the third trimester of pregnancy predicts child internalising behaviour at two years of age (-2·74, (-4·71, -0·78), p = 0·01 (Wald test), R<sup>2</sup>=0·07). Taxa from butyrate-producing families, Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae, were more abundant in mothers of children with normative behaviour. A healthy prenatal diet indirectly related to decreased child internalising behaviours via higher alpha diversity of maternal faecal microbiota.These findings support animal studies showing that the composition of maternal prenatal gut microbiota is related to offspring brain development and behaviour. Our findings highlight the need to evaluate potential impacts of the prenatal gut microbiota on early life brain development.This study was funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia (1082307, 1147980), Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Barwon Health and Deakin University.",EBioMedicine,2021,Samantha L Dawson; Martin O'Hely; Felice N Jacka; Anne-Louise Ponsonby; Christos Symeonides; Amy Loughman; Fiona Collier; Margarita Moreno-Betancur; Peter Sly; David Burgner; Mimi L K Tang; Richard Saffery; Sarath Ranganathan; Michael A Conlon; Leonard C Harrison; Susanne Brix; Karsten Kristiansen; Peter Vuillermin; 
34092293,"Studies on blood enrichment and anti-tumor effects of combined Danggui Buxue Decoction, Fe and rhEPO based on colon cancer-related anemia model and gut microbiota modulation.","Colon cancer-related anemia (CCRA) is mainly caused by systemic inflammation, intestinal bleeding, iron deficiency and chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression in colon cancer. However, the best therapeutic schedule and related mechanism on CCRA were still uncertain. Studies on blood enrichment and anti-tumor effects of combined Danggui Buxue Decoction (DBD), Fe and rhEPO based on CCRA and gut microbiota modulation were conducted in this paper. Here, CCRA model was successfully induced by subcutaneous inoculation of CT-26 and i.p. oxaliplatin, rhEPO + DBD high dosage + Fe (EDF) and rhEPO + DBD high dosage (ED) groups had the best blood enrichment effect. Attractively, EDF group also showed antitumor activity. The sequencing results of gut microbiota showed that compared to P group, the relative abundances of Lachnospiraceae and opportunistic pathogen (Odoribacter) in ED and EDF groups were decreased. Interestingly, EDF also decreased the relative abundances of cancer-related bacteria (Helicobacter, Lactococcus, Alloprevotella) and imbalance-inducing bacteria (Escherichia-Shigella and Parabacteroides) and increased the relative abundances of butyrate-producing bacteria (Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014), however, ED showed the opposite effects to EDF, this might be the reason of the smaller tumor volume in EDF group. Our findings proposed the best treatment combination of DBD, rhEPO and Fe in CCRA and provided theoretical basis and literature reference for CCRA-induced intestinal flora disorder and the regulatory mechanism of EDF.",Chinese journal of natural medicines,2021,Xu-Qin Shi; Zhen-Hua Zhu; Shi-Jun Yue; Yu-Ping Tang; Yan-Yan Chen; Zong-Jin Pu; Hui-Juan Tao; Gui-Sheng Zhou; Jin-Ao Duan
33742731,Fecal microbiota transplantation ameliorates gut microbiota imbalance and intestinal barrier damage in rats with stress-induced depressive-like behavior.,"The gut-microbiota-brain axis is the most important complex and bidirectional pathway between the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system. This study investigated the potential of microbe-induced gut-to-brain signaling to modulate the effect of stress on depressive-like behavior, intestinal barrier, and neuroinflammation. Result showed that fecal microbiota transplantation increased the consumption of sucrose solutions and decreased the immobility time in forced swimming test. This treatment also increased Firmicutes and decreased Bacteroidetes and Desulfobacterota at phylum levels; reduced the loss of villi and epithelial cells; suppressed the inflammatory cell infiltration in the ileum; increased the expression of ZO-1, occludin; protected the mucosal layer function; and suppressed the high levels of inflammasomes (NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, and IL-1β) in rat brain. In summary, fecal microbiota transplantation improves the depressive-like behavior, alters the gut microbiota imbalance, and alleviates the intestinal tract inflammation, intestinal mucosa disruption, and neuroinflammation in rats induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress.",The European journal of neuroscience,2021,Jingjing Rao; Ruining Xie; Li Lin; Jian Jiang; Lei Du; Xindie Zeng; Gongying Li; Chunmei Wang; Yi Qiao
33521857,Gut microbiota in antiviral strategy from bats to humans: a missing link in COVID-19.,"Bats are a potential natural reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 virus and other viruses detrimental to humans. Accumulated evidence has shown that, in their adaptation to a flight-based lifestyle, remodeling of the gut microbiota in bats may have contributed to immune tolerance to viruses. This evidence from bats provides profound insights into the potential influence of gut microbiota in COVID-19 disease in humans. Here, we highlight recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms by which the gut microbiota helps bats tolerate deadly viruses, and summarize the current clinical evidence on the influence of gut microbiota on the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and risk of COVID-19 leading to a fatal outcome. In addition, we discuss the implications of gut microbiota-targeted approaches for preventing infection and reducing disease severity in COVID-19 patients.",Science China.

33454868,Gut microbiota homeostasis restoration may become a novel therapy for breast cancer.,"Breast cancer is the most diagnosed cancer in women. It significantly impairs a patient's physical and mental health. Gut microbiota comprise the bacteria residing in a host's gastrointestinal tract. Through studies over the last decade, we now know that alterations in the composition of the gut microbiome are associated with protection against colonization by pathogens and other diseases, such as diabetes and cancer. This review focuses on how gut microbiota can affect breast cancer development through estrogen activity and discusses the types of bacteria that may be involved in the onset and the progression of breast cancer. We also describe potential therapies to curtail the risk of breast cancer by restoring gut microbiota homeostasis and reducing systemic estrogen levels. This review will further explore the relationship between intestinal microbes and breast cancer and propose a method to treat breast cancer by improving intestinal microbes. We aimed at discovering new methods to prevent or treat BC by changing intestinal microorganisms.",Investigational new drugs,2021,Zhi-Peng Feng; Hong-Yi Xin; Ze-Wei Zhang; Chen-Guang Liu; Zheng Yang; Hua You; Hong-Wu Xin
34050205,Abnormal﻿ composition of microbiota in the gut and skin of imiquimod-treated mice.,"Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease. Although the precise etiology of psoriasis remains unclear, gut-microbiota axis might play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Here we investigated whether the composition of microbiota in the intestine and skin is altered in the imiquimod (IMQ)-treated mouse model of psoriasis. Topical application of IMQ to back skin caused significant changes in the composition of microbiota in the intestine and skin of IMQ-treated mice compared to control mice. The LEfSe algorithm identified the species Staphylococcus lentus as potential skin microbial marker for IMQ group. Furthermore, there were correlations for several microbes between the intestine and skin, suggesting a role of skin-gut-microbiota in IMQ-treated mice. Levels of succinic acid and lactic acid in feces from IMQ-treated mice were significantly higher than control mice. Moreover, the predictive functional analysis of the microbiota in the intestine and skin showed that IMQ caused alterations in several KEGG pathways. In conclusion, the current data indicated that topical application with IMQ to skin alters the composition of the microbiota in the gut and skin of host. It is likely that skin-gut microbiota axis plays a role in pathogenesis of psoriasis.",Scientific reports,2021,Hiroyo Shinno-Hashimoto; Yaeko Hashimoto; Yan Wei; Lijia Chang; Yuko Fujita; Tamaki Ishima; Hiroyuki Matsue; Kenji Hashimoto
34074025,MAIT Cells and Microbiota in Multiple Sclerosis and Other Autoimmune Diseases.,"The functions of mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells in homeostatic conditions include the interaction with the microbiota and its products, the protection of body barriers, and the mounting of a tissue-repair response to injuries or infections. Dysfunction of MAIT cells and dysbiosis occur in common chronic diseases of inflammatory, metabolic, and tumor nature. This review is aimed at analyzing the changes of MAIT cells, as well as of the microbiota, in multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune disorders. Common features of dysbiosis in these conditions are the reduced richness of microbial species and the unbalance between pro-inflammatory and immune regulatory components of the gut microbiota. The literature concerning MAIT cells in these disorders is rather complex, and sometimes not consistent. In multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune conditions, several studies have been done, or are in progress, to find correlations between intestinal permeability, dysbiosis, MAIT cell responses, and clinical biomarkers in treated and treatment-naïve patients. The final aims are to explain what activates MAIT cells in diseases not primarily infective, which interactions with the microbiota are potentially pathogenic, and their dynamics related to disease course and disease-modifying treatments.",Microorganisms,2021,Rosella Mechelli; Silvia Romano; Carmela Romano; Emanuele Morena; Maria Chiara Buscarinu; Rachele Bigi; Gianmarco Bellucci; Roberta Reniè; Giulia Pellicciari; Marco Salvetti; Giovanni Ristori
33955443,Gut microbiota in mental health and depression: role of pre/pro/synbiotics in their modulation.,"The microbiome residing in the human gut performs a wide range of biological functions. Recently, it has been elucidated that a change in dietary habits is associated with alteration in the gut microflora which results in increased health risks and vulnerability towards various diseases. Falling in line with the same concept, depression has also been shown to increase its prevalence around the globe, especially in the western world. Various research studies have suggested that changes in the gut microbiome profile further result in decreased tolerance of stress. Although currently available medications help in relieving the symptoms of depressive disorders briefly, these drugs are not able to completely reverse the multifactorial pathology of depression. The discovery of the communication pathway between gut microbes and the brain, i.e. the Gut-Brain Axis, has led to new areas of research to find more effective and safer alternatives to current antidepressants. The use of probiotics and prebiotics has been suggested as being effective in various preclinical studies and clinical trials for depression. Therefore, in the present review, we address the new antidepressant mechanisms via gut microbe alterations and provide insight into how these can provide an alternative to antidepressant therapy without the side effects and risk of adverse drug reactions.",Food & function,2021,Hasnain N Methiwala; Bhupesh Vaidya; Vamsi Krishna Addanki; Mahendra Bishnoi; Shyam Sunder Sharma; Kanthi Kiran Kondepudi
34692176,"A Review of Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Model of Microbial, Immune and Neuropsychological Integration.","<b>Objective:</b> Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are complex chronic inflammatory disorders of the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract with uncertain etiology. IBDs comprise two idiopathic disorders: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). The aetiology, severity and progression of such disorders are still poorly understood but thought to be influenced by multiple factors (including genetic, environmental, immunological, physiological, psychological factors and gut microbiome) and their interactions. The overarching aim of this review is to evaluate the extent and nature of the interrelationship between these factors with the disease course. A broader conceptual and longitudinal framework of possible neuro-visceral integration, core microbiome analysis and immune modulation assessment may be useful in accurately documenting and characterizing the nature and temporal continuity of crosstalk between these factors and the role of their interaction (s) in IBD disease activity. Characterization of these interactions holds the promise of identifying novel diagnostic, interventions, and therapeutic strategies. <b>Material and Methods:</b> A search of published literature was conducted by exploring PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Medline Plus, CDSR library databases. Following search terms relating to key question were set for the search included: ""Inflammatory bowel diseases,"" ""gut microbiota,"" ""psychological distress and IBD,"" ""autonomic reactivity and IBD,"" ""immune modulation,"" ""chronic inflammation,"" ""gut inflammation,"" ""enteric nervous system,"" ""gut nervous system,"" ""Crohn's disease,"" ""Ulcerative colitis"", ""depression and IBD"", ""anxiety and IBD"", ""quality of life in IBD patients,"" ""relapse in IBDs,"" ""remission in IBDs,"" ""IBD disease activity,"" ""brain-gut-axis,"" ""microbial signature in IBD,"" ""validated questionnaires in IBD,"" ""IBD activity indices,"" ""IBD aetiology,"" ""IBDs and stress,"" ""epidemiology of IBDs"", ""autonomic nervous system and gut inflammation"", ""IBD and environment,"" ""genetics of IBDs,"" ""pathways of immune response in IBDs,"" ""sleep disturbances in IBD,"" ""hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA),"" ""sympatho-adrenal axis,"" ""CNS and its control of gut function"" ""mucosal immune response,"" ""commensal and pathogenic bacteria in the gut,"" ""innate and adaptive immunity."" Studies evaluating any possible associations between gut microbiome, psychological state, immune modulation, and autonomic function with IBDs were identified. Commonly cited published literatures with high quality research methodology/results and additional articles from bibliographies of recovered papers were examined and included where relevant. <b>Results:</b> Although there is a substantial literature identifying major contributing factors with IBD, there has been little attempt to integrate some factors over time and assess their interplay and relationship with IBD disease activity. Such contributing factors include genetic and environmental factors, gut microbiota composition and function, physiological factors, psychological state and gut immune response. Interdependences are evident across psychological and biological factors and IBD disease activity. Although from the available evidence, it is implausible that a single explanatory model could elucidate the interplay between such factors and the disease course as well as the sequence of the effect during the pathophysiology of IBD. <b>Conclusion:</b> Longitudinal monitoring of IBD patients and integrating data related to the contributing/risk factors including psychological state, physiological conditions, inflammatory/immune modulations, and microbiome composition/function, could help to explain how major factors associate and interrelate leading to exacerbation of symptoms and disease activity. Identifying the temporal trajectory of biological and psychosocial disturbances may also help to assess their effects and interdependence on individuals' disease status. Moreover, this allows greater insight into understanding the temporal progressions of subclinical events as potential ground for disease severity in IBD. Furthermore, understanding the interaction between these risk factors may help better interventions in controlling the disease, reducing the costs related to disease management, further implications for clinical practice and research approaches in addition to improving patients' mental health and quality of life.",Public health reviews,2021,P Tavakoli; U Vollmer-Conna; D Hadzi-Pavlovic; M C Grimm
33677218,Fecal microbiota transplantation ameliorates stress-induced depression-like behaviors associated with the inhibition of glial and NLRP3 inflammasome in rat brain.,"Evidence from previous studies has demonstrated that the gut-microbiota-brain axis is vital in regulating of behavior and neuroinflammation in the central nervous system. Considering the putative connection among gut microbiota, neural function, and behavior, the present study investigated the potential signaling of gut microbiota to modulate depression-like behaviors and neuroinflammation.Rats showing depression-like behaviors induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress received fecal microbiota treatment or vehicle for 14 days, and alterations in behavior and neuroinflammation were assessed. ELISA, immunofluorescence staining and Western blot were used to analysis the activation of glial cells and NLRP3 inflammasome.Treatment with fecal microbiota transplantation ameliorated depression-like behaviors. 5-Hydroxytryptamine decreased in the chronic unpredictable mild stress rat model but significantly increased after fecal microbiota transplantation. The treatment with fecal microbiota transplantation decreased the production of IL-1β and TNF-α. Moreover, fecal microbiota transplantation administration suppressed the activation of Iba1 positive microglia cells and GFAP positive astrocytes cells and reduced the expression of NLRP3, ASC, Caspase-1, and IL-1β pathway in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus.Fecal microbiota transplantation can improve depression-like behaviors induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress.

33511258,Probiotic consumption relieved human stress and anxiety symptoms possibly via modulating the neuroactive potential of the gut microbiota.,"Stress has been shown to disturb the balance of human intestinal microbiota and subsequently causes mental health problems like anxiety and depression. Our previous study showed that ingesting the probiotic strain, <i>Lactobacillus</i> (<i>L</i>.) <i>plantarum</i> P-8, for 12 weeks could alleviate stress and anxiety of stressed adults. The current study was a follow-up work aiming to investigate the functional role of the gut metagenomes in the observed beneficial effects. The fecal metagenomes of the probiotic (n = 43) and placebo (n = 36) receivers were analyzed in depth. The gut microbiomes of the placebo group at weeks 0 and 12 showed a significantly greater Aitchison distance (<i>P</i> < 0.001) compared with the probiotic group. Meanwhile, the Shannon diversity index of the placebo group (<i>P</i> < 0.05) but not the probiotic group decreased significantly at week 12. Additionally, significantly more species-level genome bins (SGBs) of <i>Bifidobacterium adolescentis</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium longum</i>, and <i>Fecalibacterium prausnitzii</i> (<i>P</i> < 0.01) were identified in the fecal metagenomes of the probiotic group, while the abundances of SGBs representing the species <i>Roseburia faecis</i> and <i>Fusicatenibacter saccharivorans</i> decreased significantly (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Furthermore, the 12-week probiotic supplementation enhanced the diversity of neurotransmitter-synthesizing/consuming SGBs and the levels of some predicted microbial neuroactive metabolites (e.g., short-chain fatty acids, gamma-aminobutyric acid, arachidonic acid, and sphingomyelin). Our results showed a potential link between probiotic-induced gut microbiota modulation and stress/anxiety alleviation in stressed adults, supporting that the gut-brain axis was involved in relieving stress-related symptoms. The beneficial effect relied not only on microbial diversity changes but more importantly gut metagenome modulations at the SGB and functional gene levels.",Neurobiology of stress,2021,Teng Ma; Hao Jin; Lai-Yu Kwok; Zhihong Sun; Min-Tze Liong; Heping Zhang
33422641,A role of the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve in depression-like phenotypes in mice after fecal microbiota transplantation from Chrna7 knock-out mice with depression-like phenotypes.,"The α7 subtype of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7 nAChR: coded by Chrna7) regulates the cholinergic ascending anti-inflammatory pathway involved in depression. We previously reported that Chrna7 knock-out (KO) mice show depression-like phenotypes through systemic inflammation. In this study, we investigated whether fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from Chrna7 KO mice causes depression-like phenotypes in mice treated with an antibiotic cocktail (ABX). Chrna7 KO mice with depression-like phenotypes show an abnormal gut microbiota composition, although the alpha diversity and beta diversity were not altered. FMT from Chrna7 KO mice caused depression-like phenotypes, systemic inflammation, and downregulation of synaptic proteins in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in the ABX-treated mice compared to FMT from the control mice. The Principal component analysis based on the OTU level showed that the FMT group from the KO mice were different from the FMT group from the control mice. We found differences in abundance for several bacteria in the FMT group from the KO mice at the taxonomic level when compared with the other group. Interestingly, subdiaphragmatic vagotomy significantly blocked the development of depression-like phenotypes in the ABX-treated mice after FMT from Chrna7 KO mice. These data suggest that FMT from Chrna7 KO mice produce depression-like phenotypes in ABX-treated mice via the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve. The brain-gut-microbiota axis association with the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve plays an important role in the development of depression.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2021,Yaoyu Pu; Yunfei Tan; Youge Qu; Lijia Chang; Siming Wang; Yan Wei; Xingming Wang; Kenji Hashimoto
32667590,The role of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in neuropsychiatric disorders.,"The microbiota-gut-brain axis is a bidirectional signaling mechanism between the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system. The complexity of the intestinal ecosystem is extraordinary; it comprises more than 100 trillion microbial cells that inhabit the small and large intestine, and this interaction between microbiota and intestinal epithelium can cause physiological changes in the brain and influence mood and behavior. Currently, there has been an emphasis on how such interactions affect mental health. Evidence indicates that intestinal microbiota are involved in neurological and psychiatric disorders. This review covers evidence for the influence of gut microbiota on the brain and behavior in Alzheimer disease, dementia, anxiety, autism spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia. The primary focus is on the pathways involved in intestinal metabolites of microbial origin, including short-chain fatty acids, tryptophan metabolites, and bacterial components that can activate the host's immune system. We also list clinical evidence regarding prebiotics, probiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation as adjuvant therapies for neuropsychiatric disorders.","Revista brasileira de psiquiatria (Sao Paulo, Brazil : 1999)",2021,Jaqueline S Generoso; Vijayasree V Giridharan; Juneyoung Lee; Danielle Macedo; Tatiana Barichello

This systematic review evaluated the effectiveness of prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics supplementation during pregnancy to reduce the risk of maternal mental health problems in the perinatal period. <b>Methods:</b> Electronic biomedical databases and clinical trial registries were searched from database inception through August 2020 to identify randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating the effect of probiotic, prebiotic, or synbiotic supplements administered to women during pregnancy on measures of perinatal depression, anxiety, and other mental health outcomes. Study selection, risk of bias appraisal, and data extraction were independently performed by two reviewers. Pooled mean differences (MD) and odds ratios (pOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated in random-effects meta-analyses for the outcomes of interest in the review. <b>Results:</b> From 3,868 studies identified through the search strategy, three RCTs of low risk of bias involving 713 participants were included, all three testing probiotics. There were no differences between probiotics and control groups in the mean depression scores (MD -0.46; 95% CI -2.16, 1.25) at end of follow-up. Although statistical significance was not achieved, probiotics showed an advantage in the proportion of participants scoring below an established cut-off for depression (pOR 0.68; 95% CI 0.43, 1.07). Compared to placebo, probiotics in pregnancy reduced anxiety symptoms (MD -0.99; 95% CI -1.80, -0.18); however, this advantage was not translated in a reduction in the proportion of participants scoring above an established cut-off for anxiety (pOR 0.65; 95% CI 0.23, 1.85). There were no differences between probiotics and control groups in global mental health scores at end of follow-up (MD 1.09; 95% CI -2.04, 4.22). <b>Conclusion:</b> There is limited but promising evidence about the effectiveness of probiotics during pregnancy to reduce anxiety symptoms and reduce the proportion of women scoring ABOVE a cut-off depression score. There is a lack of RCT evidence supporting prebiotics and synbiotics supplementation for similar purposes in the perinatal period. More research is needed before prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics are recommended to support maternal mental health and well-being in the perinatal period. <b>Systematic Review Registration:</b> PROSPERO, CRD42019137158.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2021,Vidhi Desai; Anita L Kozyrskyj; Stuart Lau; Omolara Sanni; Liz Dennett; Jens Walter; Maria B Ospina
33428888,Gut microbiota-derived vitamins - underrated powers of a multipotent ally in psychiatric health and disease.,"Despite the well-established roles of B-vitamins and their deficiencies in health and disease, there is growing evidence indicating a key role of those nutrients in functions of the central nervous system and in psychopathology. Clinical data indicate the substantial role of B-vitamins in various psychiatric disorders, including major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, autism, and dementia, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. As enzymatic cofactors, B-vitamins are involved in many physiological processes such as the metabolism of glucose, fatty acids and amino acids, metabolism of tryptophan in the kynurenine pathway, homocysteine metabolism, synthesis and metabolism of various neurotransmitters and neurohormones including serotonin, dopamine, adrenaline, acetylcholine, GABA, glutamate, D-serine, glycine, histamine and melatonin. Those vitamins are highly involved in brain energetic metabolism and respiration at the cellular level. They have a broad range of anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antioxidant and neuroprotective properties. Furthermore, some of those vitamins are involved in the regulation of permeability of the intestinal and blood-brain barriers. Despite the fact that a substantial amount of the above vitamins is acquired from various dietary sources, deficiencies are not uncommon, and it is estimated that micronutrient deficiencies affect about two billion people worldwide. The majority of gut-resident microbes and the broad range of bacteria available in fermented food, express genetic machinery enabling the synthesis and metabolism of B-vitamins and, consequently, intestinal microbiota and fermented food rich in probiotic bacteria are essential sources of B-vitamins for humans. All in all, there is growing evidence that intestinal bacteria-derived vitamins play a significant role in physiology and that dysregulation of the ""microbiota-vitamins frontier"" is related to various disorders. In this review, we will discuss the role of vitamins in mental health and explore the perspectives and potential of how gut microbiota-derived vitamins could contribute to mental health and psychiatric treatment.",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,2021,Leszek Rudzki; Trevor W Stone; Michael Maes; Błażej Misiak; Jerzy Samochowiec; Agata Szulc
33920695,Neurobiological Processes Induced by Aerobic Exercise through the Endocannabinoidome.,"Evidence suggesting the triangulation of the endocannabinoid system, exercise, and neurological health is emerging. In addition to the endocannabinoids <i>N</i>-arachidonoylethanolamine (anandamide; AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), the expanded endocannabinoid system, known as the endocannabinoidome (eCBome), appears to be an important player in this relationship. The eCBome includes several endocannabinoid-like mediators such as <i>N</i>-acylethanolamines and 2-monoacylglycerols, the enzymes involved in their biosynthesis and degradation, and the receptors they affect. This review aims to relate the functional interactions between aerobic exercise, and the molecular and cellular pathways related to endocannabinoids, in the hypothalamus, hippocampus, and the periphery, with special attention given to associations with emotional state, cognition, and mental health. Given the well-documented roles of many eCBome members in regulating stress and neurological processes, we posit that the eCBome is an important effector of exercise-induced central and peripheral adaptive mechanisms that benefit mental health. Gut microbiota imbalance, affecting the gut-brain axis and metabolism, also influences certain eCBome-modulated inflammation pathways. The integrity of the gut microbiota could thus be crucial in the onset of neuroinflammation and mental conditions. Further studies on how the modulation by exercise of the peripheral eCBome affects brain functions could reveal to be key elements in the prevention and treatment of neuropsychological disorders.",Cells,2021,Fabiola Forteza; Giada Giorgini; Frédéric Raymond
33936013,"GABA Production by Human Intestinal <i>Bacteroides</i> spp.: Prevalence, Regulation, and Role in Acid Stress Tolerance.","The high neuroactive potential of metabolites produced by gut microbes has gained traction over the last few years, with metagenomic-based studies suggesting an important role of microbiota-derived γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in modulating mental health. Emerging evidence has revealed the presence of the glutamate decarboxylase (GAD)-encoding gene, a key enzyme to produce GABA, in the prominent human intestinal genus <i>Bacteroides</i>. Here, we investigated GABA production by <i>Bacteroides</i> in culture and metabolic assays combined with comparative genomics and phylogenetics. A total of 961 <i>Bacteroides</i> genomes were analyzed <i>in silico</i> and 17 metabolically and genetically diverse human intestinal isolates representing 11 species were screened <i>in vitro</i>. Using the model organism <i>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</i> DSM 2079, we determined GABA production kinetics, its impact on milieu pH, and we assessed its role in mitigating acid-induced cellular damage. We showed that the GAD-system consists of at least four highly conserved genes encoding a GAD, a glutaminase, a glutamate/GABA antiporter, and a potassium channel. We demonstrated a high prevalence of the GAD-system among <i>Bacteroides</i> with 90% of all <i>Bacteroides</i> genomes (96% in human gut isolates only) harboring all genes of the GAD-system and 16 intestinal <i>Bacteroides</i> strains producing GABA <i>in vitro</i> (ranging from 0.09 to 60.84 mM). We identified glutamate and glutamine as precursors of GABA production, showed that the production is regulated by pH, and that the GAD-system acts as a protective mechanism against acid stress in <i>Bacteroides</i>, mitigating cell death and preserving metabolic activity. Our data also indicate that the GAD-system might represent the only amino acid-dependent acid tolerance system in <i>Bacteroides</i>. Altogether, our results suggest an important contribution of <i>Bacteroides</i> in the regulation of the GABAergic system in the human gut.",Frontiers in microbiology,2021,Nize Otaru; Kun Ye; Denisa Mujezinovic; Laura Berchtold; Florentin Constancias; Fabián A Cornejo; Adam Krzystek; Tomas de Wouters; Christian Braegger; Christophe Lacroix; Benoit Pugin

Gut microbiota could produce gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) that could modulate the gut-brain axis response<i>.</i> Jianpi Jieyu (JPJY) decoction, a traditional Chinese formula, is mainly composed of <i>Astragalus membranaxeus</i> and Radix <i>Pseudostellariae</i>. Although the JPJY decoction has been used to treat the depression in China, the potential action of its antidepressant has not been well understood. Thus this study was aim to investigate the role of JPJY improve gut microbiota homeostasis in the chronic stress induced depressive mice. <b>Methods:</b> The antidepressant effect of JPJY on chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) mice was evaluated by using sucrose preference test, tail suspension test and forced swim test. Fatigue-like behaviors were evaluated using degree of redness, grip strength test, and exhaustive swimming test. The new object recognition test was used to evaluate cognition performance. Fecal samples were collected and taxonomical analysis of intestinal microbial distribution was conducted with 16S rDNA. Serum level of GABA was measured using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The expression of GluR1 and p-Tau protein in the hippocampus was determined using Western blotting. <b>Results:</b> The dose of 9.2 g/kg JPJY produced antidepressant-like effects. JPJY and its major components also modulated gut microbiota diversity in the CUMS mice. Serum level of GABA and the expressions of hippocampal GluR1 and p-Tau were reversed after the administration of JPJY in CUMS mice. <b>Conclusion:</b> JPJY regulates gut microbiota to produce antidepressant-like effect and improve cognition deficit in depressive mice while its molecular mechanism possibly be enhanced NR1 and Tau expression in hippocampus and increased GABA in serum.",Frontiers in pharmacology,2021,Lanying Liu; Zhilu Zou; Jiangwei Yang; Xiaoqi Li; Boran Zhu; Hailou Zhang; Yan Sun; Yuxuan Zhang; Zhang-Jin Zhang; Wei Wang

33921293,Non-Celiac Gluten/Wheat Sensitivity: Clinical Characteristics and Microbiota and Mycobiota Composition by Response to the Gluten Challenge Test.,"The aims of this observational ""proof-of-concept"" study were to analyze the clinical/psychological characteristics and gut microbiota/mycobiota composition of individuals with suspected non-celiac gluten/wheat sensitivity (NCGS/WS) according to responses to the double-blind-placebo-controlled (DBPC) crossover gluten challenge test. Fifty individuals with suspected NCGS/WS were subjected to the DBPC challenge test; anthropometric measurements, psychometric questionnaires, and fecal samples were collected. Twenty-seven (54%) participants were gluten responsive (NCGS), and 23 were placebo responsive, with an order effect. NCGS individuals displayed a significantly lower risk of eating disorders and a higher mental health score when compared to placebo-responsive participants, confirmed by multiple logistic regression analyses (OR = 0.87; 95% CI 0.76-0.98, <i>p</i> = 0.021, and OR = 1.30; 95% CI 1.06-1.59, <i>p</i> = 0.009, respectively). Principal coordinate analyses based on microbiota composition showed a separation by the DBPC response (<i>p</i> = 0.039). For <i>Bacteroides</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.05) and <i>Parabacteroides</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.007), the frequency of amplicon sequence variants was lower, and that for <i>Blautia</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.009) and <i>Streptococcus</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.004) was higher in NCGS individuals at multiple regression analyses. No difference in the mycobiota composition was detected between the groups. In conclusion, almost half of the individuals with suspected gluten sensitivity reported symptoms with placebo; they showed lower mental health scores, increased risk for eating disorders, and a different gut microbiota composition.",Nutrients,2021,Valentina Ponzo; Ilario Ferrocino; Ilaria Goitre; Marianna Pellegrini; Mauro Bruno; Marco Astegiano; Gianni Cadario; Eleonora Castellana; Fabio Bioletto; Maria Rita Corvaglia; Patrizia Malfa; Luca Cocolin; Ezio Ghigo; Simona Bo
33918462,Gut Microbiota and Bipolar Disorder: An Overview on a Novel Biomarker for Diagnosis and Treatment.,"The gut microbiota is the set of microorganisms that colonize the gastrointestinal tract of living creatures, establishing a bidirectional symbiotic relationship that is essential for maintaining homeostasis, for their growth and digestive processes. Growing evidence supports its involvement in the intercommunication system between the gut and the brain, so that it is called the gut-brain-microbiota axis. It is involved in the regulation of the functions of the Central Nervous System (CNS), behavior, mood and anxiety and, therefore, its implication in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders. In this paper, we focused on the possible correlations between the gut microbiota and Bipolar Disorder (BD), in order to determine its role in the pathogenesis and in the clinical management of BD. Current literature supports a possible relationship between the compositional alterations of the intestinal microbiota and BD. Moreover, due to its impact on psychopharmacological treatment absorption, by acting on the composition of the microbiota beneficial effects can be obtained on BD symptoms. Finally, we discussed the potential of correcting gut microbiota alteration as a novel augmentation strategy in BD. Future studies are necessary to better clarify the relevance of gut microbiota alterations as state and disease biomarkers of BD.",International journal of molecular sciences,2021,Lorenza Lucidi; Mauro Pettorruso; Federica Vellante; Francesco Di Carlo; Franca Ceci; Maria Chiara Santovito; Ilenia Di Muzio; Michele Fornaro; Antonio Ventriglio; Carmine Tomasetti; Alessandro Valchera; Alessandro Gentile; Yong-Ku Kim; Giovanni Martinotti; Silvia Fraticelli; Massimo Di Giannantonio; Domenico De Berardis
33651324,Gut microbiota dysbiosis is associated with worse emotional states in HIV infection.,"The biological mechanisms underlying emotional distress in HIV infection are likely to be complex but remain understudied. We investigated whether dysbiotic signatures in the gut microbiome of persons living with HIV (PLWH) are associated with their emotional status. We retrospectively examined the gut microbiome and clinical evaluation of 129 adults (94 PLWH and 35 HIV-) enrolled at UC San Diego's HIV Neurobehavioral Research Program. A subset of participants (32 PLWH vs. 13 HIV-) underwent an emotional assessment using the NIH Toolbox Emotion Battery summarized by three composite scores (negative affect, social satisfaction, and psychological well-being). We then sequenced the 16S rDNA V3-V4 regions from stool and performed taxonomic assignment using CLC Microbial Genomics Module. The gut microbiota profiles were evaluated in relation to participants' emotional assessment. All analyses were done in R statistical software. We found that the relative abundance of aerotolerant bacteria was significantly higher in PLWH (p < 0.01) and was associated with a lifetime major depression diagnosis independently of HIV status (p = 0.05). Moreover, PLWH experienced significantly worse psychological well-being (p = 0.02), less social satisfaction (p = 0.03), and more negative affect (p = 0.02). Higher levels of aerotolerant bacteria were associated with worse psychological well-being (rho = -0.35, p = 0.02), less social satisfaction (r = - 0.42, p < 0.01), and more negative affect (rho = 0.46, p < 0.01). The association of aerotolerant bacteria with social satisfaction and negative affect was independent of HIV status (p < 0.05, for both). The over-representation of aerotolerant bacteria in the gut may reflect worse oxidative stress and barrier defects and may contribute to emotional distress during HIV infection.",Journal of neurovirology,2021,Josué Pérez-Santiago; María J Marquine; Debralee Cookson; Rafael Giraud-Colón; Robert K Heaton; Igor Grant; Ronald J Ellis; Scott L Letendre; Scott N Peterson
33252574,Understanding the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.,"Schizophrenia is a chronic mental disorder with marked symptoms of hallucination, delusion, and impaired cognitive behaviors. Although multidimensional factors have been associated with the development of schizophrenia, the principal cause of the disorder remains debatable. Microbiome involvement in the etiology of schizophrenia has been widely researched due to the advancement in sequencing technologies. This review describes the contribution of the gut microbiome in the development of schizophrenia that is facilitated by the gut-brain axis. The gut microbiota is connected to the gut-brain axis via several pathways and mechanisms, that are discussed in this review. The role of the oral microbiota, probiotics and prebiotics in shaping the gut microbiota are also highlighted. Lastly, future perspectives for microbiome research in schizophrenia are addressed.",Psychiatric genetics,2021,Mahin Ghorbani; Heera Rajandas; Sivachandran Parimannan; Gerard Benedict Stephen Joseph; Mei Mei Tew; Siti Salwa Ramly; Muhammad Arif Muhamad Rasat; Su Yin Lee
33807447,Changes in Gut Microbiota after a Four-Week Intervention with Vegan vs. Meat-Rich Diets in Healthy Participants: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"An essential role of the gut microbiota in health and disease is strongly suggested by recent research. The composition of the gut microbiota is modified by multiple internal and external factors, such as diet. A vegan diet is known to show beneficial health effects, yet the role of the gut microbiota is unclear. Within a 4-week, monocentric, randomized, controlled trial with a parallel group design (vegan (VD) vs. meat-rich (MD)) with 53 healthy, omnivore, normal-weight participants (62% female, mean 31 years of age), fecal samples were collected at the beginning and at the end of the trial and were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (Clinical Trial register: DRKS00011963). Alpha diversity as well as beta diversity did not differ significantly between MD and VD. Plotting of baseline and end samples emphasized a highly intra-individual microbial composition. Overall, the gut microbiota was not remarkably altered between VD and MD after the trial. <i>Coprococcus</i> was found to be increased in VD while being decreased in MD. <i>Roseburia</i> and <i>Faecalibacterium</i> were increased in MD while being decreased in VD. Importantly, changes in genera <i>Coprococcus, Roseburia</i> and <i>Faecalibacterium</i> should be subjected to intense investigation as markers for physical and mental health.",Microorganisms,2021,Eva Kohnert; Clemens Kreutz; Nadine Binder; Luciana Hannibal; Gregor Gorkiewicz; Alexander Müller; Maximilian Andreas Storz; Roman Huber; Ann-Kathrin Lederer
33938181,Human glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) is an antimicrobial adjuvant re-sensitising multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.,"Increasing antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative bacteria has mandated the development of both novel antibiotics and alternative therapeutic strategies. Evidence of interplay between several gastrointestinal peptides and the gut microbiota led us to investigate potential and broad-spectrum roles for the incretin hormone, human glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) against the <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> bacteria, <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Erwinia amylovora</i>. GIP had a potent disruptive action on drug efflux pumps of the multidrug resistant bacteria <i>E. coli TG1</i> and <i>E. amylovora 1189</i> strains. The effect was comparable to bacterial mutants lacking the inner and outer membrane efflux pump factor proteins AcrB and TolC. While GIP was devoid of direct antimicrobial activity, it has a potent membrane depolarizing effect, and at low concentrations, it significantly potentiated the activity of eight antibiotics and bile salt by reducing MICs by 4-8-fold in <i>E. coli TG1</i> and 4-20-fold in <i>E. amylovora 1189</i>. GIP can thus be regarded as an antimicrobial adjuvant with potential for augmenting the available antibiotic arsenal.",Biological chemistry,2021,Da'san M M Jaradat; Nehaya Al-Karablieh; Basmah H M Zaarer; Wenyi Li; Khalil K Y Saleh; Anas J Rasras; Saeid Abu-Romman; Neil M O'Brien-Simpson; John D Wade

Mental health disorders and functional gastrointestinal disorders co-occur at high rates, although the mechanisms underlying these associations remain unclear. The Bugs and Brains Study aims to investigate complex relationships between anxiety/depression and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in two ways. First, its primary component will compare the gut and oral microbiota in females with anxiety/depression and/or IBS relative to controls, and investigate underlying physiological, endocrine and immune factors, as well as associations with diet and psychosocial factors. In an ancillary component, the study will also investigate gastrointestinal and mental health symptoms in a larger sample, and explore relationships with diet, exercise, oral health, substance use, medical history, early life adversity and psychosocial factors.The Bugs and Brains Study aims to recruit 160 females to the primary component: (1) 40 controls; (2) 40 participants with a depressive/anxiety disorder, but no IBS; (3) 40 participants with IBS, but no depressive/anxiety disorder and (4) 40 participants with both depressive/anxiety disorder and IBS. Participation is completed within 1 month, and involves comprehensive questionnaires, anthropometrics, a diagnostic clinical interview, collection of two saliva samples, and stool, urine and hair samples.

33777957,Brain Neurotransmitter Modulation by Gut Microbiota in Anxiety and Depression.,"Anxiety and depression are highly prevalent mental illnesses worldwide and have long been thought to be closely associated to neurotransmitter modulation. There is growing evidence indicating that changes in the composition of the gut microbiota are related to mental health including anxiety and depression. In this review, we focus on combining the intestinal microbiota with serotonergic, dopaminergic, and noradrenergic neurotransmission in brain, with special emphasis on the anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in stress-related rodent models. Therefore, we reviewed studies conducted on germ-free rodents, or in animals subjected to microbiota absence using antibiotics, as well as via the usage of probiotics. All the results strongly support that the brain neurotransmitter modulation by gut microbiota is indispensable to the physiopathology of anxiety and depression. However, a lot of work is needed to determine how gut microbiota mediated neurotransmission in human brain has any physiological significance and, if any, how it can be used in therapy. Overall, the gut microbiota provides a novel way to alter neurotransmitter modulation in the brain and treat gut-brain axis diseases, such as anxiety and depression.",Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,2021,Fei Huang; Xiaojun Wu
33508544,Transcriptional markers of excitation-inhibition balance in germ-free mice show region-specific dysregulation and rescue after bacterial colonization.,"Studies of germ-free (GF) mice demonstrate that gut microbiota can influence behaviour by modulating neurochemical pathways in the brain, and that bacterial colonization normalizes behavioural deficits in GF-mice. Since disrupted GABAergic and glutamatergic signaling are reported in mood disorders, this study investigated the effect of gut microbiota manipulations on EIB-relevant gene expression in the brain.GF Swiss-Webster mice were colonized with E. coli JM83, complex microbiota (specific-pathogen-free; SPF), or no microbiota, and compared with controls (n = 6/group). 21 synaptic genes representing GABAergic, glutamatergic, BDNF, and astrocytic functions were measured in the hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex using quantitative PCR. Gene co-expression analysis was used to identify gene modules related to colonization status, and compared by permutation analysis. Gene expression profiles were compared to existing post-mortem cohorts of depressed subjects (n = 28 cases vs 28 controls).Region-specific alterations in gene expression were observed in GF-mice compared to controls. 58% of all genes (14/24) altered in GF-mice were normalized following SPF-colonization. GF-mice displayed disorganization of gene co-expression networks in all three brain regions (hippocampus, p = 0.0003; amygdala, p = 0.0012; mPFC, p = 0.0069), which was restored by SPF colonization in hippocampus (p v.s. GF = 0.0003, p v.s. control = 0.60). The hippocampal gene expression profile in GF-mice was significantly correlated with that in human depression (ρ = 0.51, p = 0.027), and this correlation was not observed after colonization.Together, we show that the absence of gut microbiota disrupts the expression of EIB-relevant genes in mice, and colonization restores EIB-relevant expression, in ways that are relevant to human depression.",Journal of psychiatric research,2021,Vivek Philip; Dwight F Newton; Hyunjung Oh; Stephen M Collins; Premysl Bercik; Etienne Sibille
33487078,Nutrition-based interventions for mood disorders.,"<b>Introduction</b>: 'Nutritional Psychiatry' is an emerging area of research that has great potential as an adjunctive tool for the prevention and treatment of diverse neuropsychiatric disorders. Several nutrition-related aspects, such as obesity, dietary patterns, gut microbiome composition and gut permeability, bioactive food compounds, and nutrients can influence pathways implicated in the pathophysiology of mood disorders.<b>Areas covered</b>: Here, the authors review the current evidence on nutrition-mood interaction and nutrition-based treatments for the two main mood disorders, i.e., major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder.<b>Expert opinion</b>: Consistent evidence from observational studies has pointed out the association between a 'healthy' diet, generally characterized by a higher intake of fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, whole grains, and good quality sources of protein (i.e. fish and/or seafood), and decreased risk of mood disorders and the parallel association between a 'Western' diet pattern and increased risk. However, only a few clinical trials have evaluated the effect of nutritional interventions on the treatment of these conditions. The bidirectional interaction between the brain and the gut, named 'brain-gut-microbiome axis' or 'gut-brain axis', plays a key role in the link between nutrition and mood disorders. Therefore, nutrition-based strategies for gut microbiota modulation are promising fields in mood disorders.",Expert review of neurotherapeutics,2021,Lais B Martins; Jenneffer Rayane Braga Tibães; Marsal Sanches; Felice Jacka; Michael Berk; Antônio L Teixeira
33421542,Bipolar disorder: An evolutionary psychoneuroimmunological approach.,"Bipolar disorder is a mental health disorder characterized by extreme shifts in mood, high suicide rate, sleep problems, and dysfunction of psychological traits like self-esteem (feeling inferior when depressed and superior when manic). Bipolar disorder is rare among populations that have not adopted contemporary Western lifestyles, which supports the hypothesis that bipolar disorder results from a mismatch between Homo sapiens's evolutionary and current environments. Recent studies have connected bipolar disorder with low-grade inflammation, the malfunctioning of the internal clock, and the resulting sleep disturbances. Stress is often a triggering factor for mania and sleep problems, but stress also causes low-grade inflammation. Since inflammation desynchronizes the internal clock, chronic stress and inflammation are the primary biological mechanisms behind bipolar disorder. Chronic stress and inflammation are driven by contemporary Western lifestyles, including stressful social environments, unhealthy dietary patterns, limited physical activity, and obesity. The treatment of bipolar disorder should focus on reducing stress, stress sensitivity, and inflammation by lifestyle changes rather than just temporarily alleviating symptoms with psychopharmacological interventions.",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,2021,Markus J Rantala; Severi Luoto; Javier I Borráz-León; Indrikis Krams
33671569,Nutritional Components in Western Diet Versus Mediterranean Diet at the Gut Microbiota-Immune System Interplay. Implications for Health and Disease.,"The most prevalent diseases of our time, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) (including obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and some types of cancer) are rising worldwide. All of them share the condition of an ""inflammatory disorder"", with impaired immune functions frequently caused or accompanied by alterations in gut microbiota. These multifactorial maladies also have in common malnutrition related to physiopathology. In this context, diet is the greatest modulator of immune system-microbiota crosstalk, and much interest, and new challenges, are arising in the area of precision nutrition as a way towards treatment and prevention. It is a fact that the westernized diet (WD) is partly responsible for the increased prevalence of NCDs, negatively affecting both gut microbiota and the immune system. Conversely, other nutritional approaches, such as Mediterranean diet (MD), positively influence immune system and gut microbiota, and is proposed not only as a potential tool in the clinical management of different disease conditions, but also for prevention and health promotion globally. Thus, the purpose of this review is to determine the regulatory role of nutritional components of WD and MD in the gut microbiota and immune system interplay, in order to understand, and create awareness of, the influence of diet over both key components.",Nutrients,2021,Cielo García-Montero; Oscar Fraile-Martínez; Ana M Gómez-Lahoz; Leonel Pekarek; Alejandro J Castellanos; Fernando Noguerales-Fraguas; Santiago Coca; Luis G Guijarro; Natalio García-Honduvilla; Angel Asúnsolo; Lara Sanchez-Trujillo; Guillermo Lahera; Julia Bujan; Jorge Monserrat; Melchor Álvarez-Mon; Miguel A Álvarez-Mon; Miguel A Ortega
34589731,Abnormalities of the composition of the gut microbiota and short-chain fatty acids in mice after splenectomy.,"The brain-gut-microbiota axis is a complex multi-organ bidirectional signaling system between the brain and microbiota that participates in the host immune system. The spleen, as the largest immune organ in the body, has a key role in the brain-gut-microbiota axis. Here, we investigated whether splenectomy could affect depression-like phenotypes and the composition of the gut microbiota in adult mice. In behavioral tests, splenectomy did not cause depression-like behaviors in mice. Conversely, splenectomy led to significant alterations in the diversity of gut microbes compared with the findings in control (no surgery) and sham-operated mice. In an unweighted UniFrac distance analysis, the boxplots representing the splenectomy group were distant from those representing the other two groups. We found differences in abundance for several bacteria in the splenectomy group at the taxonomic level compared with the other two groups. Finally, splenectomy induced significant changes in lactic acid and n-butyric acid levels compared with those in the other groups. Interestingly, there were significant correlations between the counts of certain bacteria and lactic acid (or n-butyric acid) levels in all groups. These data suggest that splenectomy leads to an abnormal composition of the gut microbiota. It is likely that the spleen-gut-microbiota axis plays a crucial role in the composition of the gut microbiota by regulating immune homeostasis.","Brain, behavior, & immunity - health",2021,Yan Wei; Lijia Chang; Tamaki Ishima; Xiayun Wan; Li Ma; Gerile Wuyun; Yaoyu Pu; Kenji Hashimoto

33467657,Mechanisms Underlying the Cognitive and Behavioural Effects of Maternal Obesity.,"The widespread consumption of 'western'-style diets along with sedentary lifestyles has led to a global epidemic of obesity. Epidemiological, clinical and preclinical evidence suggests that maternal obesity, overnutrition and unhealthy dietary patterns programs have lasting adverse effects on the physical and mental health of offspring. We review currently available preclinical and clinical evidence and summarise possible underlying neurobiological mechanisms by which maternal overnutrition may perturb offspring cognitive function, affective state and psychosocial behaviour, with a focus on (1) neuroinflammation; (2) disrupted neuronal circuities and connectivity; and (3) dysregulated brain hormones. We briefly summarise research implicating the gut microbiota in maternal obesity-induced changes to offspring behaviour. In animal models, maternal obesogenic diet consumption disrupts CNS homeostasis in offspring, which is critical for healthy neurodevelopment, by altering hypothalamic and hippocampal development and recruitment of glial cells, which subsequently dysregulates dopaminergic and serotonergic systems. The adverse effects of maternal obesogenic diets are also conferred through changes to hormones including leptin, insulin and oxytocin which interact with these brain regions and neuronal circuits. Furthermore, accumulating evidence suggests that the gut microbiome may directly and indirectly contribute to these maternal diet effects in both human and animal studies. As the specific pathways shaping abnormal behaviour in offspring in the context of maternal obesogenic diet exposure remain unknown, further investigations are needed to address this knowledge gap. Use of animal models permits investigation of changes in neuroinflammation, neurotransmitter activity and hormones across global brain network and sex differences, which could be directly and indirectly modulated by the gut microbiome.",Nutrients,2021,Kyoko Hasebe; Michael D Kendig; Margaret J Morris
33407119,Alterations in the intestinal microbiome and mental health status of workers in an underground tunnel environment.,"Working in an underground tunnel environment is unavoidable in professions such as miners and tunnel workers, and there is a concern about the health of these workers. Few studies have addressed alterations in the intestinal microbiome of workers within that environment.Fecal samples were collected from the workers before they entered the tunnel (baseline status, BS) and after they left the tunnel (exposed status, ES), respectively (a time period of 3 weeks between them). We analyzed 16S rRNA sequencing to show the changes in microbial composition and self-evaluation of mental health questionnaire was also performed. The results showed that Shannon and Simpson indices decreased significantly from BS to ES. A higher abundance was found in the phylum Actinobacteria, classes Actinobacteria and Deltaproteobacteria, orders Bifidobacteriales, Coriobacteriales, and Desulfovibrionales, families Bifidobacteriaceae, Peptostreptococcaceae, Coriobacteriaceae, Clostridiaceae_1, Desulfovibrionaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, and Microbacteriaceae, and genera Bifidobacterium, Romboutsia, Clostridium sensu stricto, and Leucobacter in ES, while BS showed greater levels of genera Faecalibacterium and Roseburia. The self-evaluation showed that at least one-half of the tunnel workers experienced one or more symptoms of mental distress (inattention, sleeplessness, loss of appetite, headache or dizziness, irritability) after working in the underground tunnel environment.Collectively, the underground tunnel environment led to alterations in the intestinal microbiome, which might be relevant to symptoms of mental distress in underground-tunnel workers.",BMC microbiology,2021,Zhen-Hua Lu; Yi-Wen Liu; Zhao-Hua Ji; Ting Fu; Min Yan; Zhong-Jun Shao; Yong Long
34961418,Effects of Berberine on Gut Microbiota in Patients with Mild Metabolic Disorders Induced by Olanzapine.,"Secondary metabolic disturbances in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder may be attributed to olanzapine. It is important to prevent mild metabolic disorders progressing to metabolic syndrome. This study aims to investigate the effects of berberine on intestinal flora in patients with mild metabolic disorders induced by olanzapine. A total of 132 patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or schizoaffective psychosis that had been treated with olanzapine for at least 9 months were randomly assigned ([Formula: see text] = 66 each) to receive berberine or placebo tablets for 12 weeks. Metabolic assessments and intestinal flora were quantified at baseline and after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment. Incidence rates of adverse reactions were recorded. FPG, FPI, HOMA-IR, HbA1, TG, BMI, and WC were significantly lower in patients who received berberine compared to placebo after 12 weeks of treatment ([Formula: see text]< 0.05). The abundance of firmicutes and coliform were significantly lower and the abundance of bacteroides significantly higher in patients who received berberine compared to placebo after 12 weeks of treatment ([Formula: see text]< 0.05). In patients who received berberine, the abundance of firmicutes was significantly decreased, and the abundance of bacteroides was significantly increased, and in patients who received placebo, the abundance of firmicutes was significantly increased post-treatment, compared to baseline (both [Formula: see text]< 0.05). In conclusions, berberine may regulate intestinal flora and metabolism in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and mild metabolic disturbances induced by olanzapine.",The American journal of Chinese medicine,2021,Zhengping Pu; Yunying Sun; Hongxia Jiang; Qingmei Hou; Hui Yan; Hui Wen; Guorong Li
34520319,"Sleep, circadian rhythm and gut microbiota: alterations in Alzheimer's disease and their potential links in the pathogenesis.","ABSTRATCIn recent years, emerging studies have observed gut microbiota (GM) alterations in Alzheimer's disease (AD), even in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Further, impaired sleep and circadian patterns are common symptoms of AD, while sleep and circadian rhythm disruption (SCRD) is associated with greater β-amyloid (Aβ) burden and AD risk, sometimes years before the clinical onset of AD. Moreover, reports have demonstrated that GM and its metabolites exhibit diurnal rhythmicity and the role of SCRD in dampening the GM rhythmicity and eubiosis. This review will provide an evaluation of clinical and animal studies describing GM alterations in distinct conditions, including AD, sleep and circadian disruption. It aims to identify the overlapping and distinctive GM alterations in these conditions and their contributions to pathophysiology. Although most studies are observational and use different methodologies, data indicate partial commonalities in GM alterations and unanimity at functional level. Finally, we discuss the possible interactions between SCRD and GM in AD pathogenesis, as well as several methodological improvements that are necessary for future research.",Gut microbes,2021,Yi Li; Lingzhan Shao; Yang Mou; Yan Zhang; Yong Ping
34348619,"Metabolomic Connections between Schizophrenia, Antipsychotic Drugs and Metabolic Syndrome: A Variety of Players.","Diagnosis of schizophrenia lacks reliable medical diagnostic tests and robust biomarkers applied to clinical practice. Schizophrenic patients undergoing treatment with antipsychotics suffer reduced life expectancy due to metabolic disarrangements that co-exist with their mental illness and predispose them to develop metabolic syndrome, which is also exacerbated by medication. Metabolomics is an emerging and potent technology able to accelerate this biomedical research.This review focus on a detailed vision of the molecular mechanisms involved both in schizophrenia and antipsychotic-induced metabolic syndrome, based on innovative metabolites that consistently change in nascent metabolic syndrome, drug-naïve, first episode psychosis and/or schizophrenic patients compared to healthy subjects. Main Lines: Supported by metabolomic approaches, although not exclusively, noteworthy variations are reported mainly through serum samples of patients and controls in several scenes: 1) alterations in fatty acids, inflammatory response indicators, amino acids and biogenic amines, biometals, and gut microbiota metabolites (schizophrenia); 2) alterations in metabolites involved in carbohydrate and gut microbiota metabolism, inflammation and oxidative stress (metabolic syndrome), some of them shared with schizophrenia; 3) alterations of cytokines secreted by adipose tissue, phosphatidylcholines, acylcarnitines, Sirtuin 1, orexin-A, and changes in microbiota composition (antipsychotic-induced metabolic syndrome).Novel insights into the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and metabolic side-effects associated with its antipsychotic treatment represent an urgent request for scientists and clinicians. Leptin, carnitines, adiponectin, insulin, or interleukin-6 represent some examples of candidate biomarkers. Cutting-edge technologies like metabolomics have the power to strengthen research for achieving preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutical solutions for schizophrenia.",Current pharmaceutical design,2021,Juan D Molina; Sonia Avila; Gabriel Rubio; Francisco López-Muñoz

34032650,Psychobiotics: Evolution of Novel Antidepressants.,"The gut-brain axis is a bidirectional communication system which allows the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract to interact with and respond to each other rapidly and effectively. It is becoming increasingly clear that major players in this complex system are gut bacteria. The mechanisms of signal transmission from bacteria to the brain are complex and not fully elucidated, but include neural, endocrine, immune, and metabolic pathways. It was initially demonstrated in a rodent model of depression that the gut microbiota was altered. This observation has been replicated in patients with major depression who show decreased microbial diversity. Furthermore, when rodents receive a microbiota transplant from a depressed patient their behaviour alters, as does their tryptophan metabolism and immune status. Several studies of psychobiotics (bacteria with a potential mental health benefit) have been conducted in healthy populations and in patients with depression. While some psychobiotics have shown efficacy in treating depression, other bacteria have yielded negative findings. Larger-scale, well-designed studies are required. EU-funded guidelines recommend that patients with depression or vulnerability to depression should be encouraged to enhance a plant-based diet with a high content of grains/fibres, fermented foods, and fish. A significant impact of such a diet is likely mediated through the gut microbiota.",Modern trends in psychiatry,2021,Timothy G Dinan; Mary I Butler; John F Cryan
36989335,Treatment response to supplemental nutrients for ADHD is independent of diet quality: the MADDY Study RCT.,"The 8-week Micronutrients for ADHD in Youth (MADDY) randomized controlled trial (<i>N</i> = 126, age 6-12) of broad-spectrum multinutrients for ADHD with emotional dysregulation found 3 times as many responders with multinutrients (54%) compared to placebo (18%) by Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I). Our primary aim for this analysis tests the hypothesis that those with poor overall diet quality at baseline benefit more. The second aim is to explore whether specific components of diet quality moderate treatment response.124 children (69 multinutrients, 55 placebo) had diet quality assessed using the Healthy Eating Index-2015 (HEI-2015). For each potential moderator, the outcome CGI-I at week 8 (RCT-end), was modeled two ways: (1) as a dichotomous variable: responder/non-responder, with responders defined by a rating of 1 or 2 'very much' or 'much improved,' all else equals non-responder using logistic regression, and (2) as a dimensional improvement outcome from 1 = very much improved to 7 = very much worse, using linear regression.HEI-2015 total score did not moderate treatment response [odds ratio = 1.00 (95% CI: 0.90,1.10), <i>p</i> = 0.984] or improvement [β = -0.01 (95% CI: -0.06,0.04), <i>p</i> = 0.648]. However, total vegetable intake moderated level of improvement in exploratory analysis [β = -0.48 (95% CI: -0.82, -0.13), <i>p</i> = 0.007]: those with higher baseline vegetable intake showed greater benefit from multinutrients compared to placebo.Multinutrients may benefit children with ADHD and irritability regardless of overall diet quality. The finding that higher baseline vegetable intake may improve response to multinutrients deserves further exploration, including dietary effect on gut microbiota and absorption of multinutrients and parental factors.",Nutritional neuroscience,2024,Lisa M Robinette; Irene E Hatsu; Jeanette M Johnstone; Alisha M Bruton; Brenda M Y Leung; L Eugene Arnold
37071196,Development of the gut microbiota in the first 14 years of life and its relations to internalizing and externalizing difficulties and social anxiety during puberty.,"Relations between the gut microbiota and host mental health have been suggested by a growing number of case-control and cross-sectional studies, while supporting evidence is limited in large community samples followed during an extended period. Therefore, the current preregistered study ( https://osf.io/8ymav , September 7, 2022) described child gut microbiota development in the first 14 years of life and explored its relations to internalizing and externalizing difficulties and social anxiety in puberty, a period of high relevance for the development of mental health problems. Fecal microbiota composition was analysed by 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing in a total of 1003 samples from 193 children. Through a clustering method, four distinct microbial clusters were newly identified in puberty. Most children within three of these clusters remained in the same clusters from the age of 12 to 14 years, suggesting stability in microbial development and transition during this period. These three clusters were compositionally similar to enterotypes (i.e., a robust classification of the gut microbiota based on its composition across different populations) enriched in Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Ruminococcus, respectively. Two Prevotella 9-predominated clusters, including one reported by us earlier in middle childhood and the other one in puberty, were associated with more externalizing behavior at age 14. One Faecalibacterium-depleted pubertal cluster was related to more social anxiety at age 14. This finding was confirmed by a negative cross-sectional relation between Faecalibacterium and social anxiety in the 14-year-olds. The findings of this study continue to map gut microbiota development in a relatively large community sample followed from birth onwards, importantly extending our knowledge to puberty. Results indicate that Prevotella 9 and Faecalibacterium may be relevant microbial taxa in relation to externalizing behavior and social anxiety, respectively. These correlational findings need validations from other similar cohort studies, as well as well-designed mechanistic pre-clinical investigations before inferring cause and effect.",European child & adolescent psychiatry,2024,Yangwenshan Ou; Clara Belzer; Hauke Smidt; Carolina de Weerth
36877601,The role of vitamin D in depression and anxiety disorders: a review of the literature.,"Prevalence of mental health disorders continue to increase worldwide. Over the past decades, suboptimal vitamin D (VD) levels and gut dysbiosis have been associated with neurological dysfunction and psychiatric disorders.In this review, we examined the available literature on VD and mental health disorders, particularly depression and anxiety, in both clinical and pre-clinical studies.Our extensive review failed to find a link between VD deficiency, depression, and anxiety-related behavior in preclinical animal models. However, strong evidence suggests that VD supplementation may alleviate symptoms in chronically stressed rodents, with some promising evidence from clinical studies. Further, fecal microbiota transplantations suggest a potential role of gut microbiota in neuropsychiatric disorders, although the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. It has been postulated that serotonin, primarily produced by gut bacteria, may be a crucial factor. Hence, whether VD has the ability to impact gut microbiota and modulate serotonin synthesis warrants further investigation.Taken together, literature has suggested that VD may serve as a key regulator in the gut-brain axis to modulate gut microbiota and alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety. The inconsistent results of VD supplementation in clinical studies, particularly among VD deficient participants, suggests that current intake recommendations may need to be re-evaluated for individuals at-risk (i.e. prior to diagnosis) of developing depression and/or anxiety.",Nutritional neuroscience,2024,Karisa Renteria; Hien Nguyen; Gar Yee Koh
38525261,"Impact of dietary fiber on gut microbiota composition, function and gut-brain-modules in healthy adults - a systematic review protocol.","The gut microbiota has been extensively implicated in health and disease. The functional outputs of the gut microbiota, such as microbial metabolites, are considered particularly important in this regard. Significant associations exist between alterations in the relative abundance of specific microbial taxa and mental health disorders. Dietary fiber has the potential to alter gut microbiota composition and function, modifying bacterial enzymatic function and the production of metabolites. As many taxa of microorganisms have enzymes capable of producing or degrading neurochemicals i.e. neuroactive gut brain modules, new predictive tools can be applied to existing datasets such as those harvested from dietary fiber interventions. We endeavor to perform a systematic review in order to identify studies reporting compositional gut microbiota alterations after interventions with dietary fiber in healthy individuals. We aim to also extract from the selected studies publicly available microbial genomic sequence datasets for reanalysis with a consistent bioinformatics pipeline, with the ultimate intention of identifying altered gut brain modules following dietary fiber interventions.Interventional trials and randomized controlled studies that are originally published, including cross-over and non-crossover design and involving healthy adult humans will be included. A systematic search of PubMed/MEDLINE and EMBASE, two electronic databases, will be completed.Various types of dietary fiber have an impact on the gut microbiota composition, with some promoting the growth of particular taxa while others are reduced in relative abundance. Our search focuses on the impact of this food component on the microbiota of healthy individuals. Compositional gut microbial changes have been reported and our review will compile and update these observations after reanalysis of their datasets with a consistent bioinformatic pipeline. From this it may be possible to predict more detailed functional consequences in terms of neuroactive gut brain modules, of the compositional alterations in gut microbial taxa.",HRB open research,2023,David Antoine Lachmansingh; Benjamin Valderrama; Thomaz Bastiaanssen; John Cryan; Gerard Clarke; Aonghus Lavelle
38353184,Stressed to the Core: Inflammation and Intestinal Permeability Link Stress-Related Gut Microbiota Shifts to Mental Health Outcomes.,"Stress levels are surging, alongside the incidence of stress-related psychiatric disorders. Perhaps a related phenomenon, especially in urban areas, the human gut contains fewer bacterial species than ever before. Although the functional implications of this absence are unclear, one consequence may be reduced stress resilience. Preclinical and clinical evidence has shown how stress exposure can alter the gut microbiota and their metabolites, affecting host physiology. Also, stress-related shifts in the gut microbiota jeopardize tight junctions of the gut barrier. In this context, bacteria and bacterial products can translocate from the gut to the bloodstream, lymph nodes, and other organs, thereby modifying systemic inflammatory responses. Heightened circulating inflammation can be an etiological factor in stress-related psychiatric disorders, including some cases of depression. In this review, we detail preclinical and clinical evidence that traces these brain-to-gut-to-brain pathways that underlie stress-related psychiatric disorders and potentially affect their responsivity to conventional psychiatric medications. We also review evidence for interventions that modulate the gut microbiota (e.g., antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics) to reduce stress responses and psychiatric symptoms. Lastly, we discuss challenges to translation and opportunities for innovations that could impact future psychiatric clinical practice.",Biological psychiatry,2024,Annelise A Madison; Michael T Bailey
38132705,Association of homelessness and diet on the gut microbiome: a United States-Veteran Microbiome Project (US-VMP) study.,"Military veterans account for 8% of homeless individuals living in the United States. To highlight associations between history of homelessness and the gut microbiome, we compared the gut microbiome of veterans who reported having a previous experience of homelessness to those from individuals who reported never having experienced a period of homelessness. Moreover, we examined the impact of the cumulative exposure of prior and current homelessness to understand possible associations between these experiences and the gut microbiome. Microbiome samples underwent genomic sequencing and were analyzed based on alpha diversity, beta diversity, and taxonomic differences. Additionally, demographic information, dietary data, and mental health history were collected. A lifetime history of homelessness was found to be associated with alcohol use disorder, substance use disorder, and healthy eating index compared to those without such a history. In terms of differences in gut microbiota, beta diversity was significantly different between veterans who had experienced homelessness and veterans who had never been homeless (<i>P</i> = 0.047, weighted UniFrac), while alpha diversity was similar. The microbial community differences were, in part, driven by a lower relative abundance of <i>Akkermansia</i> in veterans who had experienced homelessness (mean; range [in percentages], 1.07; 0-33.9) compared to veterans who had never been homeless (2.02; 0-36.8) (<i>P</i> = 0.014, ancom-bc2). Additional research is required to facilitate understanding regarding the complex associations between homelessness, the gut microbiome, and mental and physical health conditions, with a focus on increasing understanding regarding the longitudinal impact of housing instability throughout the lifespan.IMPORTANCEAlthough there are known stressors related to homelessness as well as chronic health conditions experienced by those without stable housing, there has been limited work evaluating the associations between microbial community composition and homelessness. We analyzed, for the first time, bacterial gut microbiome associations among those with experiences of homelessness on alpha diversity, beta diversity, and taxonomic differences. Additionally, we characterized the influences of diet, demographic characteristics, military service history, and mental health conditions on the microbiome of veterans with and without any lifetime history of homelessness. Future longitudinal research to evaluate the complex relationships between homelessness, the gut microbiome, and mental health outcomes is recommended. Ultimately, differences in the gut microbiome of individuals experiencing and not experiencing homelessness could assist in identification of treatment targets to improve health outcomes.",mSystems,2024,Andrew J Hoisington; Kelly A Stearns-Yoder; Christopher E Stamper; Ryan Holliday; Diana P Brostow; Molly E Penzenik; Jeri E Forster; Teodor T Postolache; Christopher A Lowry; Lisa A Brenner
38170072,Global scientific trends in healthy aging in the early 21st century: A data-driven scientometric and visualized analysis.,"According to the World Health Organization (WHO), healthy aging is the process of developing and maintaining the functional capacity for health in old age. A rapidly growing number of research studies on healthy aging have been conducted worldwide. The purpose of this research work is to explore global scientific landscape of healthy aging research over the last 22 years.Scientific publications on healthy aging from January 1, 2000 to October 11, 2022 were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) on October 11, 2022. A total of 6420 publications were included in the scientometric analysis. VOSviewer (1.6.18) was used to conduct scientometric and visualized analysis.The publication growth rate was 35.68 from 2000 to 2021. The United States of America (USA) led in both productivity and citations. <i>PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</i> was prominent in terms of both the highest citation count and the highest average citation count. The National Institute on Aging (NIA) and Evans, Michele K. were the most influential organization and author, respectively. Research hotspots in healthy aging were identified based on the co-occurrence analysis of keywords: (1) physical activity and mental health of older adults; (2) diseases impacting the health and lifespan of older adults; and (3) neuroscience. Our analysis indicates that gut microbiota, loneliness, frailty, mitochondria and resilience were the emerging themes in healthy aging research.The quantity of annual publications on healthy aging has rapidly increased over the past 22 years, especially during 2018-2021. This analysis identified the status, trends, hot topics, and frontiers of healthy aging research.

38123016,The many faces of microbiota-gut-brain axis in autism spectrum disorder.,"The gut-brain axis is gaining more attention in neurodevelopmental disorders, especially autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Many factors can influence microbiota in early life, including host genetics and perinatal events (infections, mode of birth/delivery, medications, nutritional supply, and environmental stressors). The gut microbiome can influence blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, drug bioavailability, and social behaviors. Developing microbiota-based interventions such as probiotics, gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota transplantation, or metabolite supplementation may offer an exciting approach to treating ASD. This review highlights that RNA sequencing, metabolomics, and transcriptomics data are needed to understand how microbial modulators can influence ASD pathophysiology. Due to the substantial clinical heterogeneity of ASD, medical caretakers may be unlikely to develop a broad and effective general gut microbiota modulator. However, dietary modulation followed by administration of microbiota modulators is a promising option for treating ASD-related behavioral and gastrointestinal symptoms. Future work should focus on the accuracy of biomarker tests and developing specific psychobiotic agents tailored towards the gut microbiota seen in ASD patients, which may include developing individualized treatment options.",Life sciences,2024,Cinara L Gonçalves; Tejaswini Doifode; Victoria L Rezende; Maiara A Costa; J Marc Rhoads; Cesar A Soutullo
37879416,Depression-like phenotypes in mice with hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury: A role of gut-microbiota-liver-brain axis via vagus nerve.,"Depression is a frequent symptom in patients with chronic liver disease; however, the mechanisms underlying this association remain unclear. Dysbiosis of gut microbiota plays a critical role in depression through the gut-brain axis via the vagus nerve. In this study, we investigated whether the gut-microbiota-liver-brain axis plays a role in depression-like phenotypes in mice with hepatic ischemia/reperfusion (HI/R) injury via the vagus nerve. Behavioral tests for depression-like behaviors were performed 7 days after sham or HI/R injury surgery. Mice with HI/R injury exhibited splenomegaly, systemic inflammation, depression-like behaviors, reduced expression of synaptic proteins in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), abnormal composition of gut microbiota, and altered blood metabolites and lipids. Furthermore, there were positive or negative correlations between the relative abundance of microbiome and behavioral data or blood metabolites (or lipids). Moreover, subdiaphragmatic vagotomy significantly blocked these changes in mice with HI/R injury. Notably, depression-like phenotypes in mice with HI/R injury were ameliorated after subsequent single injection of the new antidepressant arketamine. The current findings suggest that HI/R injury induces depression-like phenotypes in mice through the gut-microbiota-liver-brain axis via the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve. Furthermore, arketamine may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of depression in patients with chronic liver disease.",Journal of affective disorders,2024,Yong Yang; Akifumi Eguchi; Xiayun Wan; Chisato Mori; Kenji Hashimoto

Probiotics are extensively employed in dermatology and could be an alternative option for acne therapy. Here, we evaluated the effect of oral ingestion of live and inactivated Lactobacillus plantarum CCFM8661 on oleic acid-induced acne using a mouse model.Results indicated that live L. plantarum CCFM8661 suppressed skin inflammation and serum hormone (insulin and testosterone) production in acne mice. Parallelly, live L. plantarum CCFM8661 effectively reduced the formation of skin lipids (triglycerides and non-esterified free fatty acids), and normalized the expression of skin lipid metabolism-related genes (PPAR-γ, SREBP-1c, ACCα, FASN, PPAR-α, ACOX1, HSL and ATGL). In comparison, inactivated L. plantarum CCFM8661 had no effect on skin inflammation or serum hormone secretion, but decreased skin triglycerides and normalized the expression of skin lipid metabolism-related genes (PPAR-γ, SREBP-1c, FASN and ATGL) in acne mice. Both live and inactivated L. plantarum CCFM8661 raised the richness of gut microbiota, reduced the ratio of Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes and decreased the relative abundance of Staphylococcus in the feces of acne mice.Oral ingestion of L. plantarum CCFM8661, particularly live cells, could alleviate acne by suppressing skin inflammation, normalizing the metabolism of hormones and skin lipids, which may be achieved by improving the gut microbial ecosystem. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.",Journal of the science of food and agriculture,2024,Jian Ai; Weiwei Ma; Zhenghao Pan; Bingyong Mao; Xin Tang; Qiuxiang Zhang; Jianxin Zhao; Wei Chen; Shumao Cui

The etiology of ASD remains multifactorial and not yet fully understood. The identification of biomarkers may provide insights into the underlying mechanisms and pathophysiology of the disorder. The present study aimed to explore the causes of ASD by investigating the key biomedical markers, trace elements, and microbiota factors between children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and control subjects.Medline, PubMed, ProQuest, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and EMBSCO databases have been searched for publications from 2012 to 2023 with no language restrictions using the population, intervention, control, and outcome (PICO) approach. Keywords including ""autism spectrum disorder,"" ""oxytocin,"" ""GABA,"" ""Serotonin,"" ""CRP,"" ""IL-6,"" ""Fe,"" ""Zn,"" ""Cu,"" and ""gut microbiota"" were used for the search. The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal checklist was used to assess the article quality, and a random model was used to assess the mean difference and standardized difference between ASD and the control group in all biomedical markers, trace elements, and microbiota factors.From 76,217 records, 43 studies met the inclusion and exclusion criteria and were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled analyses showed that children with ASD had significantly lower levels of oxytocin (mean differences, MD = -45.691, 95% confidence interval, CI: -61.667, -29.717), iron (MD = -3.203, 95% CI: -4.891, -1.514), and zinc (MD = -6.707, 95% CI: -12.691, -0.722), lower relative abundance of <i>Bifidobacterium</i> (MD = -1.321, 95% CI: -2.403, -0.238) and <i>Parabacteroides</i> (MD = -0.081, 95% CI: -0.148, -0.013), higher levels of c-reactive protein, CRP (MD = 0.401, 95% CI: 0.036, 0.772), and GABA (MD = 0.115, 95% CI: 0.045, 0.186), and higher relative abundance of <i>Bacteroides</i> (MD = 1.386, 95% CI: 0.717, 2.055) and <i>Clostridium</i> (MD = 0.281, 95% CI: 0.035, 0.526) when compared with controls. The results of the overall analyses were stable after performing the sensitivity analyses. Additionally, no substantial publication bias was observed among the studies.Children with ASD have significantly higher levels of CRP and GABA, lower levels of oxytocin, iron, and zinc, lower relative abundance of <i>Bifidobacterium</i> and <i>Parabacteroides</i>, and higher relative abundance of <i>Faecalibacterium</i>, <i>Bacteroides,</i> and <i>Clostridium</i> when compared with controls. These results suggest that these indicators may be a potential biomarker panel for the diagnosis or determining therapeutic targets of ASD.

38260914,"Rosacea, microbiome and probiotics: the gut-skin axis.","Rosacea is an inflammatory skin disease involving diverse symptoms with a variable clinical progress which can severely impact the patient's quality of life as well as their mental health. The pathophysiological model of rosacea involves an unbalanced immune system predisposed to excessive inflammation, in addition to vascular and nervous alterations, being certain cutaneous microorganisms' triggers of the symptoms onset. The gut-skin axis explains a bidirectional interaction between skin and gut microbiota in some inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, or rosacea. The introduction and consolidation of the next-generation sequencing in recent years has provided unprecedented information about the microbiome. However, the characterization of the gut and skin microbiota and the impact of the gut-skin axis in patients with rosacea has been little explored, in contrast to other inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis or psoriasis. Furthermore, the clinical evolution of patients with rosacea is not always adequate and it is common for them to present a sustained symptomatology with frequent flare-ups. In this context, probiotic supplementation could improve the clinical evolution of these patients as happens in other pathologies. Through this review we aim to establish and compile the basics and directions of current knowledge to understand the mechanisms by which the microbiome influences the pathogenesis of rosacea, and how modulation of the skin and gut microbiota could benefit these patients.",Frontiers in microbiology,2023,Pedro Sánchez-Pellicer; Cristina Eguren-Michelena; Juan García-Gavín; Mar Llamas-Velasco; Laura Navarro-Moratalla; Eva Núñez-Delegido; Juan Agüera-Santos; Vicente Navarro-López

Academic Search Ultimate, APA PsychINFO, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Scopus and Web of Science were searched for original research documenting differences in microbiota in MDD or changes with a low FODMAP diet in adults (age 18 years +). Studies with fecal microbiota, 16 s RNA sequencing and QIIME pipelines were included. Studies using antibiotics, probiotics, and medications such as antidepressants were excluded. Additionally, studies based on a single gender were excluded as gender impacts microbiota changes in MDD. Four studies addressed differences in microbiota with MDD and another four assessed shifts occurring with a low FODMAP diet. The abundance of <i>Bacteroidetes</i>, <i>Bacteroidaceae</i> and <i>Bacteroides</i> were lower in individuals with MDD but increased with a low FODMAP diet. Abundance of <i>Ruminoccaceae</i> was lower and <i>Bilophila</i> was higher with both a low FODMAP diet and MDD. These results provide preliminary evidence that a low FODMAP diet might drive changes in microbiota that also benefit people with MDD. Further research to assess whether a low FODMAP diet can treat MDD through modification of targeted microbiota is warranted.",Frontiers in nutrition,2023,Simone O'Neill; Michelle Minehan; Catherine R Knight-Agarwal; David B Pyne
38436218,Roles of Diet-Associated Gut Microbial Metabolites on Brain Health: Cell-to-Cell Interactions between Gut Bacteria and the Central Nervous System.,"Gut microbiota have crucial effects on brain function via the gut-brain axis. Growing evidence suggests that this interaction is mediated by signaling molecules derived from dietary components metabolized by the intestinal microbiota. Although recent studies have provided a substantial understanding of the cell-specific effects of gut microbial molecules in gut microbiome-brain research, further validation is needed. This review presents recent findings on gut microbiota-derived dietary metabolites that enter the systemic circulation and influence the cell-to-cell interactions between gut microbes and cells in the central nervous system (CNS), particularly microglia, astrocytes, and neuronal cells, ultimately affecting cognitive function, mood, and behavior. Specifically, this review highlights the roles of metabolites produced by the gut microbiota via dietary component transformation, including short-chain fatty acids, tryptophan metabolites, and bile acid metabolites, in promoting the function and maturation of brain cells and suppressing inflammatory signals in the CNS. We also discuss future directions for gut microbiome-brain research, focusing on diet-induced microbial metabolite-based therapies as possible novel approaches to mental health treatment.","Advances in nutrition (Bethesda, Md.)",2024,Chong-Su Kim

The gut microbiota affects the central nervous system by modulating neuronal pathways through the neuroendocrine and immune system, the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, and various metabolic pathways. The gut microbiota can also influence circadian rhythms. In this study, we observed the gut microbiota composition of patients suffering from narcolepsy type 1, narcolepsy type 2, and idiopathic hypersomnia. We did not observe any changes in the alpha diversity of the gut microbiota among patient groups and healthy controls. We observed changes in beta diversity in accordance with Jaccard dissimilarities between the control group and groups of patients suffering from narcolepsy type 1 and idiopathic hypersomnia. Our results indicate that both these patient groups differ from controls relative to the presence of rare bacterial taxa. However, after adjustment for various confounding factors such as BMI, age, and gender, there were no statistical differences among the groups. This indicates that the divergence in beta diversity in the narcolepsy type 1 and idiopathic hypersomnia groups did not arise due to sleep disturbances. This study implies that using metabolomics and proteomics approaches to study the role of microbiota in sleep disorders might prove beneficial.",Sleep medicine,2024,Janet Jezkova; Karel Sonka; Jakub Kreisinger; Petra Prochazkova; Helena Tlaskalova-Hogenova; Sona Nevsimalova; Jitka Buskova; Radana Merkova; Tereza Dvorakova; Iva Prihodova; Simona Dostalova; Radka Roubalova
37989444,Gut microbiota-mediated ursodeoxycholic acids regulate the inflammation of microglia through TGR5 signaling after MCAO.,"Ischemic stroke has been demonstrated to cause an imbalance of gut microbiota. However, the change in gut microbiota-mediated bile acids (BAs) metabolites remains unclear. Here, we observed a decrease in gut microbiota-mediated BAs, especially ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), in the serum of stroke patients as well as in the intestine, serum and brain of stroke mice. Restoration of UDCA could decrease the area of infarction and improve the neurological function and cognitive function in mice in association with inhibition of NLRP3-related pro-inflammatory cytokines through TGR5/PKA pathway. Furthermore, knocking out TGR5 and inhibiting PKA activity reduce the protective effect of UDCA. Taken together, our results suggest that microbiota-mediated UDCA plays an important role in alleviating inflammatory responses and might be a promising therapeutic target in ischemic stroke.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2024,Feng Zhang; Yiting Deng; Huidi Wang; Jingxiang Fu; Guangyan Wu; Zhuo Duan; Xiru Zhang; Yijia Cai; Hongwei Zhou; Jia Yin; Yan He
37914097,Priming of microglia with dysfunctional gut microbiota impairs hippocampal neurogenesis and fosters stress vulnerability of mice.,"Mental disorders may be involved in neuroinflammatory processes that are triggered by gut microbiota. How gut microbiota influence microglia-mediated sensitivity to stress remains unclear. Here we explored in an animal model of depression whether disruption of the gut microbiome primes hippocampal microglia, thereby impairing neurogenesis and sensitizing to stress.Male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) for 4 weeks, and effects on gut microbiota were assessed using 16S rRNA sequencing. Fecal microbiota was transplanted from control or CUMS mice into naïve animals. The depression-like behaviors of recipients were evaluated in a forced swimming test and sucrose preference test. The morphology and phenotype of microglia in the hippocampus of recipients were examined using immunohistochemistry, quantitative PCR, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The recipients were treated with lipopolysaccharide or chronic stress exposure, and effects were evaluated on behavior, microglial responses and hippocampal neurogenesis. Finally, we explored the ability of minocycline to reverse the effects of CUMS on hippocampal neurogenesis and stress sensitivity in recipients.CUMS altered the gut microbiome, leading to higher relative abundance of some bacteria (Helicobacter, Bacteroides, and Desulfovibrio) and lower relative abundance of some bacteria (Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Akkermansia). Fecal microbiota transplantation from CUMS mice to naïve animals induced microglial priming in the dentate gyrus of recipients. This microglia showed hyper-ramified morphology, and became more sensitive to LPS challenge or chronic stress, which characterized by more significant morphological changes and inflammatory responses, as well as impaired hippocampal neurogenesis and increased depressive-like behaviors. Giving minocycline to recipients reversed these effects of fecal transplantation.These findings suggest that gut microbiota from stressed animals can induce microglial priming in the dentate gyrus, which is associated with a hyper-immune response to stress and impaired hippocampal neurogenesis. Remodeling the gut microbiome or inhibiting microglial priming may be strategies to reduce sensitivity to stress.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2024,Hui He; Haili He; Li Mo; Zili You; Jinqiang Zhang
38011787,Cryptotanshinone regulates gut microbiota and PI3K-AKT pathway in rats to alleviate CUMS induced depressive symptoms.,"Cryptotanshinone (CPT), a bioactive compound derived from the traditional Chinese herb Salvia miltiorrhiza, exhibits promising antidepressant properties. Employing a rat model subjected to Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress (CUMS), behavioral analyses (open field experiment, elevated cross maze experiment, sugar water preference experiment, forced swimming experiment) and inflammatory factor assessments were conducted to assess the efficacy of CPT in alleviating depressive symptoms and inflammatory responses induced by CUMS. Moreover, 16 S rDNA analysis revealed alterations in the gut microbiota of rats exposed to both CUMS and CPT administration. Notably, CPT administration was found to mitigate harmful bacterial shifts associated with depression. Preliminary exploration of the molecular mechanism underlying CPT's antidepressant effects via transcriptomics analysis and molecular docking indicated that CPT might exert its influence by regulating the PI3K-AKT pathway. This study sheds light on the potential therapeutic role of CPT in managing depressive disorders, offering a comprehensive understanding of its impact on behavior, inflammation, gut microbiota, and molecular pathways.",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2023,Li-Hua Bian; Si-Qi Wang; Wen-Jing Li; Jie Li; Yi Yin; Fang-Fu Ye; Jian-You Guo
38117827,"The relationship between sleep, gut microbiota, and metabolome in patients with depression and anxiety: A secondary analysis of the observational study.","Growing attention is paid to the association between alterations in the gut microbiota and their metabolites in patients with psychiatric disorders. Our study aimed to determine how gut microbiota and metabolomes are related to the sleep quality among patients with depression and anxiety disorders by analyzing the datasets of our previous study.Samples were collected from 40 patients (depression: 32 patients [80.0%]); anxiety disorders: 8 patients [20.0%]) in this study. Gut microbiomes were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and gut metabolomes were analyzed by a mass spectrometry approach. Based on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), patients were categorized into two groups: the insomnia group (PSQI score ≥ 9, n = 20) and the non-insomnia group (PSQI score < 9, n = 20).The insomnia group showed a lower alpha diversity in the Chao1 and Shannon indices than the non-insomnia group after the false discovery rate (FDR) correction. The relative abundance of genus Bacteroides showed a positive correlation with PSQI scores in the non-insomnia group. The concentrations of glucosamine and N-methylglutamate were significantly higher in the insomnia group than in the non-insomnia group.Our findings suggest that specific taxa could affect the sleep quality among patients with depression and anxiety disorders.

37709081,Maternal exposure of mice to glyphosate induces depression- and anxiety-like behavior in the offspring via alterations of the gut-brain axis.,"The past decade has been characterized by increased awareness and de-stigmatization of mental health issues, in particular the most common neuropsychiatric disorders depression and anxiety. Further, with growing understanding of neurodevelopmental disorders such as attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder, the number of diagnosed patients has increased. The pathogenesis of these behavioral disorders is multifactorial and early-life exposure to environmental chemicals has been proposed to be a relevant risk factor that might mediate these effects by disturbances on the gut-brain-axis. However, for glyphosate, the most widely used pesticide worldwide, there are only limited and inconsistent findings that link chronic low-dose exposure in particular during early life to neurobehavioral disorders. Here, we explored the impact of maternal oral glyphosate exposure (0.5 and 50 mg/kg body weight/day) during pregnancy and the lactational period on offspring's behavior, brain gene expression and gut microbiota using a cross-generational mouse model. Behavioral analyses revealed a depression- and anxiety-like behavior as well as social deficits most notably in adult female offspring of glyphosate-exposed dams. Furthermore, the expression of tryptophan hydroxylase 2, an enzyme discussed to be linked to behavioral problems, was reduced in the hippocampus of female offspring and correlated to a glyphosate-induced DNA hypermethylation of the gene. Moreover, maternal glyphosate exposure significantly altered the gut microbiota in the female offspring including a decreased abundance of Akkermansia and increased abundance of Alistipes and Blautia, bacteria involved in tryptophan metabolism and associated with depression- and anxiety-like disorders. Our results suggest that glyphosate might influence the gut-brain axis crosstalk following in-utero and lactational exposure. This study underlines the importance of understanding the impact of exposure to pesticides on the gut-brain axis and further emphasizes the need for microbiome analyses to be compulsorily included in health risk assessments of pesticides.",The Science of the total environment,2023,Lisa Buchenauer; Sven-Bastiaan Haange; Mario Bauer; Ulrike E Rolle-Kampczyk; Marita Wagner; Johanna Stucke; Elena Elter; Beate Fink; Maren Vass; Martin von Bergen; Angela Schulz; Ana C Zenclussen; Kristin M Junge; Gabriele I Stangl; Tobias Polte
38203207,"Our Mental Health Is Determined by an Intrinsic Interplay between the Central Nervous System, Enteric Nerves, and Gut Microbiota.","Bacteria in the gut microbiome play an intrinsic part in immune activation, intestinal permeability, enteric reflex, and entero-endocrine signaling. The gut microbiota communicates with the central nervous system (CNS) through the production of bile acids, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), glutamate (Glu), γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), serotonin (5-HT), and histamine. A vast number of signals generated in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) reach the brain via afferent fibers of the vagus nerve (VN). Signals from the CNS are returned to entero-epithelial cells (EES) via efferent VN fibers and communicate with 100 to 500 million neurons in the submucosa and myenteric plexus of the gut wall, which is referred to as the enteric nervous system (ENS). Intercommunications between the gut and CNS regulate mood, cognitive behavior, and neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism, depression, and schizophrenia. The modulation, development, and renewal of nerves in the ENS and changes in the gut microbiome alter the synthesis and degradation of neurotransmitters, ultimately influencing our mental health. The more we decipher the gut microbiome and understand its effect on neurotransmission, the closer we may get to developing novel therapeutic and psychobiotic compounds to improve cognitive functions and prevent mental disorders. In this review, the intricate control of entero-endocrine signaling and immune responses that keep the gut microbiome in a balanced state, and the influence that changing gut bacteria have on neuropsychiatric disorders, are discussed.",International journal of molecular sciences,2023,Leon M T Dicks
38139446,A Pilot Interaction Analysis of Gut Microbiota and Peripheral Markers of Aging in Severe Psychiatric Disorders: A Role for <i>Lachnoclostridium</i>?,"Excessive predominance of pathological species in the gut microbiota could increase the production of inflammatory mediators at the gut level and, via modification of the gut-blood barrier, at the systemic level. This pro-inflammatory state could, in turn, increase biological aging that is generally proxied by telomere shortening. In this study, we present findings from a secondary interaction analysis of gut microbiota, aging, and inflammatory marker data from a cohort of patients with different diagnoses of severe mental disorders. We analyzed 15 controls, 35 patients with schizophrenia (SCZ), and 31 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) recruited among those attending a community mental health center (50 males and 31 females, mean and median age 46.8 and 46.3 years, respectively). We performed 16S rRNA sequencing as well as measurement of telomere length via quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. We applied statistical modeling with logistic regression to test for interaction between gut microbiota and these markers. Our results showed statistically significant interactions between telomere length and gut microbiota pointing to the genus <i>Lachnostridium</i>, which remained significantly associated with a reduced likelihood of MDD even after adjustment for a series of covariates. Although exploratory, these findings show that specific gut microbiota signatures overexpressing <i>Lachnoclostridium</i> and interacting with biological aging could modulate the liability for MDD.",International journal of molecular sciences,2023,Mirko Manchia; Pasquale Paribello; Claudia Pisanu; Donatella Congiu; Athos Antoniades; Paris Vogazianos; Federica Tozzi; Federica Pinna; Aristos Aristodimou; Paola Caria; Tinuccia Dettori; Daniela Virginia Frau; Cristina Cocco; Barbara Noli; Concetta Panebianco; Valerio Pazienza; Bernardo Carpiniello; Alessio Squassina
37294054,EphB6 deficiency in intestinal neurons promotes tumor growth in colorectal cancer by neurotransmitter GABA signaling.,"EphB6 belongs to the receptor tyrosine kinase, whose low expression is associated with shorter survival of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. But the role and mechanism of EphB6 in the progression of CRC need further study. In addition, EphB6 was mainly expressed in intestinal neurons. But how EphB6 is involved in functions of intestinal neurons has not been known. In our study, we constructed a mouse xenograft model of CRC by injecting CMT93 cells into the rectum of EphB6-deficient mice. We found that the deletion of EphB6 in mice promoted tumor growth of CMT93 cells in a xenograft model of CRC, which was independent of changes in the gut microbiota. Interestingly, inhibition of intestinal neurons by injecting botulinum toxin A into rectum of EphB6-deficient mice could eliminate the promotive effect of EphB6 deficiency on tumor growth in the xenograft model of CRC. Mechanically, the deletion of EphB6 in mice promoted the tumor growth in CRC by increasing GABA in the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, EphB6 deficiency in mice increased the expression of synaptosomal-associated protein 25 in the intestinal myenteric plexus, which mediated the release of GABA. Our study concluded that EphB6 knockout in mice promotes tumor growth of CMT93 cells in a xenograft model of CRC by modulating GABA release. Our study found a new regulating mechanism of EphB6 on the tumor progression in CRC that is dependent on intestinal neurons.",Carcinogenesis,2023,Hao Yu; Xiao-Kang Qin; Kai-Wen Yin; Zi-Ming Li; En-De Ni; Jian-Ming Yang; Xun-Hua Liu; Ai-Jun Zhou; Shu-Ji Li; Tian-Ming Gao; Ying Li; Jian-Ming Li
38204948,"Neuroendocrine, neurotransmitter, and gut microbiota imbalance contributing to potential psychiatric disorder prevalence in polycystic ovarian syndrome.","Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in women, affecting up to 15% of reproductive-aged women. Polycystic ovarian syndrome is a heterogeneous disorder, both in the sense that many different factors may play a role in its manifestation and that multiple systems throughout the body can be affected. Polycystic ovarian syndrome has been linked to an increased prevalence of various psychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety. Despite the socioeconomic effect that these disorders may have on patients with PCOS and society as a whole, this association is largely lacking in research. There are currently several theories regarding the link between PCOS and mental health. Some suggest that the overactive hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axes in PCOS patients may alter the hormonal profile and contribute to the development of psychiatric disorders. Other studies speculate that abnormal levels of neurotransmitters and neuronal signaling may play a role. Recently, more research has begun to focus on the gut-brain axis, addressing the nutritional needs of PCOS patients. Studies show that dietary factors such as probiotics and micronutrient supplementation may significantly improve psychiatric symptoms in PCOS patients while helping regulate neurotransmitter levels in the body. In this review, we examine different theories regarding the association between PCOS and psychiatric disorders and point out different areas of research that are needed to broaden our understanding of this association.",F&S reports,2023,Karis I Sarkisian; Lananh Ho; Jane Yang; Rachel Mandelbaum; Frank Z Stanczyk
38045052,Gut microbiota-derived short-chain fatty acids ameliorate methamphetamine-induced depression- and anxiety-like behaviors in a Sigmar-1 receptor-dependent manner.,"Methamphetamine (Meth) abuse can cause serious mental disorders, including anxiety and depression. The gut microbiota is a crucial contributor to maintaining host mental health. Here, we aim to investigate if microbiota participate in Meth-induced mental disorders, and the potential mechanisms involved. Here, 15 mg/kg Meth resulted in anxiety- and depression-like behaviors of mice successfully and suppressed the Sigma-1 receptor (SIGMAR1)/BDNF/TRKB pathway in the hippocampus. Meanwhile, Meth impaired gut homeostasis by arousing the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-related colonic inflammation, disturbing the gut microbiome and reducing the microbiota-derived short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Moreover, fecal microbiota from Meth-administrated mice mediated the colonic inflammation and reproduced anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in recipients. Further, SCFAs supplementation optimized Meth-induced microbial dysbiosis, ameliorated colonic inflammation, and repressed anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. Finally, <i>Sigmar1</i> knockout (<i>Sigmar1</i><sup>-/-</sup>) repressed the BDNF/TRKB pathway and produced similar behavioral phenotypes with Meth exposure, and eliminated the anti-anxiety and -depression effects of SCFAs. The activation of SIGMAR1 with fluvoxamine attenuated Meth-induced anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. Our findings indicated that gut microbiota-derived SCFAs could optimize gut homeostasis, and ameliorate Meth-induced mental disorders in a SIGMAR1-dependent manner. This study confirms the crucial role of microbiota in Meth-related mental disorders and provides a potential preemptive therapy.",Acta pharmaceutica Sinica.

38010793,Multi-omics analyses demonstrate the modulating role of gut microbiota on the associations of unbalanced dietary intake with gastrointestinal symptoms in children with autism spectrum disorder.,"Our previous work revealed that unbalanced dietary intake was an important independent factor associated with constipation and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Growing evidence has shown the alterations in the gut microbiota and gut microbiota-derived metabolites in ASD. However, how the altered microbiota might affect the associations between unbalanced diets and GI symptoms in ASD remains unknown. We analyzed microbiome and metabolomics data in 90 ASD and 90 typically developing (TD) children based on 16S rRNA and untargeted metabolomics, together with dietary intake and GI symptoms assessment. We found that there existed 11 altered gut microbiota (FDR-corrected P-value <0.05) and 397 altered metabolites (P-value <0.05) in children with ASD compared with TD children. Among the 11 altered microbiota, the <i>Turicibacter</i>, <i>Coprococcus 1</i>, and <i>Lachnospiraceae FCS020 group</i> were positively correlated with constipation (FDR-corrected P-value <0.25). The Eggerthellaceae was positively correlated with total GI symptoms (FDR-corrected P-value <0.25). More importantly, three increased microbiota including <i>Turicibacter</i>, <i>Coprococcus 1</i>, and Eggerthellaceae positively modulated the associations of unbalanced dietary intake with constipation and total GI symptoms, and the decreased <i>Clostridium sp. BR31</i> negatively modulated their associations in ASD children (P-value <0.05). Together, the altered microbiota strengthens the relationship between unbalanced dietary intake and GI symptoms. Among the altered metabolites, ten metabolites derived from microbiota (<i>Turicibacter</i>, <i>Coprococcus 1</i>, Eggerthellaceae, and <i>Clostridium sp. BR31</i>) were screened out, enriched in eight metabolic pathways, and were identified to correlate with constipation and total GI symptoms in ASD children (FDR-corrected P-value <0.25). These metabolomics findings further support the modulating role of gut microbiota on the associations of unbalanced dietary intake with GI symptoms.

A scientometric study on BPSD in MCI would be valuable in synthesizing the existing body of research and providing insights into the trends, networks, and influencers within this area. We searched for related literature in the Web of Science database and extracted complete text and citation records of each publication. The primary objective was to map the research evolution of BPSD in MCI and highlight dominant research themes. The secondary objective was to identify research network characteristics (authors, journals, countries, and institutions) and abundances. A total of 12,369 studies published between 1980 and 2022 were included in the analysis. We found 51 distinct clusters from the co-cited reference network that were highly credible with significant modularity (Q = 0.856) and silhouette scores (S = 0.932). Five major research domains were identified: symptoms, diagnosis, brain substrates, biochemical pathways, and interventions. In recent years, the research focus in this area has been on gut microbiota, e-health, COVID-19, cognition, and delirium.

37956855,"Role of the gut-brain axis via the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve in stress resilience of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine in mice exposed to chronic restrain stress.","3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is the most widely used illicit substance worldwide. Nevertheless, recent observational studies demonstrated that lifetime MDMA use among U.S. adults was associated with a lower risk of depression and suicide thoughts. We recently reported that the gut-brain axis may contribute to MDMA-induced stress resilience in mice. To further explore this, we investigated the effects of subdiaphragmatic vagotomy (SDV) in modulating the stress resilience effects of MDMA in mice subjected to chronic restrain stress (CRS). Pretreatment with MDMA (10 mg/kg/day for 14 days) blocked anhedonia-like behavior and reduced expression of synaptic proteins and brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of CRS-exposed mice. Interestingly, SDV blocked the beneficial effects of MDMA on these alterations in CRS-exposed mice. Analysis of gut microbiome revealed alterations in four measures of α-diversity between the sham + MDMA + CRS group and the SDV + MDMA + CRS group. Moreover, specific microbes differed between the vehicle + CRS group and the MDMA + CRS group, and further differences in microbial composition were observed among all four groups. Untargeted metabolomics analysis showed that SDV prevented the increase in plasma levels of three compounds [lactic acid, 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2,2,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidinol, 8-acetyl-7-hydroxyvumaline] observed in the sham + MDMA + CRS group. Interestingly, positive correlations were found between the plasma levels of two of these compounds and the abundance of several microbes across all groups. In conclusion, our data suggest that the gut-brain axis via the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve might contribute to the stress resilience of MDMA.",Neurobiology of disease,2023,Youge Qu; Akifumi Eguchi; Li Ma; Xiayun Wan; Chisato Mori; Kenji Hashimoto
37943628,Gut microbiota and child behavior in early puberty: does child sex play a role?,"A growing number of studies have indicated relations between the gut microbiota and mental health. However, to date, there is a scarcity of microbiota studies in community samples in early puberty. The current preregistered study (https://osf.io/wu2vt) investigated gut microbiota composition in relation to sex in low-risk children and explored behavioral associations with gut microbiota composition and metabolites in the same samples, together with the potential role of sex. Fecal microbiota composition was analyzed in 12-year-old children (<i>N</i> = 137) by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and quantitative PCR. Modest sex differences were observed in beta diversity. Generalized linear models showed consistent behavioral relations to both relative and absolute abundances of individual taxa, including positive associations between Parasutterella and mother-reported internalizing behavior, and negative associations between Odoribacter and mother-reported externalizing behavior. Additionally, Prevotella 9 was positively related to mother-reported externalizing behavior, confirming earlier findings on the same cohort at 5 years of age. Sex-related differences were found in behavioral relations to Ruminiclostridium 5, Alistipes, Streptococcus, Ruminiclostridium 9, Ruminococcaceae UCG-5, and Dialister, for relative abundances, as well as to Family XIII AD3011 group and an unidentified bacterium within the Tenericutes, for absolute abundances. Limited behavioral relations were observed regarding alpha diversity and fecal metabolites. Our findings describe links between the gut microbiota and child behavior, together with differences between child sexes in these relations, in low-risk early pubertal children. Importantly, this study confirmed earlier findings in this cohort of positive relations between Prevotella 9 and externalizing behavior at age 10 years. Results also show the merit of including absolute abundances in microbiota studies.",Gut microbes,2023,Yangwenshan Ou; Eline Rots; Clara Belzer; Hauke Smidt; Carolina de Weerth

An expanding body of evidence indicates a putative role for the inflammatory response. Several meta-analyses showed an increase in systemic peripheral inflammatory markers in individuals with MDD. Numerous conditions and circumstances in the modern world may promote chronic systemic inflammation through mechanisms, including alterations in the gut microbiota. Peripheral cytokines may reach the brain and contribute to neuroinflammation through cellular, humoral, and neural pathways. On the other hand, antidepressant drugs may decrease peripheral levels of inflammatory markers. Anti-inflammatory drugs and nutritional strategies that reduce inflammation also could improve depressive symptoms. The present study provides a critical review of recent advances in the role of inflammation in the pathophysiology of MDD. Furthermore, this review discusses the role of glial cells and the main drivers of changes associated with neuroinflammation.

37849234,Microbiota from Alzheimer's patients induce deficits in cognition and hippocampal neurogenesis.,"Alzheimer's disease is a complex neurodegenerative disorder leading to a decline in cognitive function and mental health. Recent research has positioned the gut microbiota as an important susceptibility factor in Alzheimer's disease by showing specific alterations in the gut microbiome composition of Alzheimer's patients and in rodent models. However, it is unknown whether gut microbiota alterations are causal in the manifestation of Alzheimer's symptoms. To understand the involvement of Alzheimer's patient gut microbiota in host physiology and behaviour, we transplanted faecal microbiota from Alzheimer's patients and age-matched healthy controls into microbiota-depleted young adult rats. We found impairments in behaviours reliant on adult hippocampal neurogenesis, an essential process for certain memory functions and mood, resulting from Alzheimer's patient transplants. Notably, the severity of impairments correlated with clinical cognitive scores in donor patients. Discrete changes in the rat caecal and hippocampal metabolome were also evident. As hippocampal neurogenesis cannot be measured in living humans but is modulated by the circulatory systemic environment, we assessed the impact of the Alzheimer's systemic environment on proxy neurogenesis readouts. Serum from Alzheimer's patients decreased neurogenesis in human cells in vitro and were associated with cognitive scores and key microbial genera. Our findings reveal for the first time, that Alzheimer's symptoms can be transferred to a healthy young organism via the gut microbiota, confirming a causal role of gut microbiota in Alzheimer's disease, and highlight hippocampal neurogenesis as a converging central cellular process regulating systemic circulatory and gut-mediated factors in Alzheimer's.",Brain : a journal of neurology,2023,Stefanie Grabrucker; Moira Marizzoni; Edina Silajdžić; Nicola Lopizzo; Elisa Mombelli; Sarah Nicolas; Sebastian Dohm-Hansen; Catia Scassellati; Davide Vito Moretti; Melissa Rosa; Karina Hoffmann; John F Cryan; Olivia F O'Leary; Jane A English; Aonghus Lavelle; Cora O'Neill; Sandrine Thuret; Annamaria Cattaneo; Yvonne M Nolan
37774944,Gut-muscle-brain axis: Molecular mechanisms in neurodegenerative disorders and potential therapeutic efficacy of probiotic supplementation coupled with exercise.,"Increased longevity is often associated with age-related conditions. The most common neurodegenerative disorders in the older population are Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), associated with progressive neuronal loss leading to functional and cognitive impairments. Although symptomatic treatments are available, there is currently no cure for these conditions. Gut dysbiosis has been involved in the pathogenesis of AD and PD, thus interventions targeting the ""gut-brain axis"" could potentially prevent or delay these pathologies. Recent evidence suggests that the skeletal muscle and the gut microbiota can affect each other via the ""gut-muscle axis"". Importantly, cognitive functions in AD and PD patients significantly benefit from physical activity. In this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive picture of the crosstalk between the brain, the skeletal muscle and the gut microbiota, introducing the concept of ""gut-muscle-brain axis"". Moreover, we discuss human and animal studies exploring the modulatory role of exercise and probiotics on cognition in AD and PD. Collectively, the findings presented here support the potential benefits of physical activity and probiotic supplementation in AD and PD.

37199590,Healthy Human Fecal Microbiota Transplantation into Mice Attenuates MPTP-Induced Neurotoxicity via AMPK/SOD2 Pathway.,"Increasing evidence has shown that gut dysbacteriosis may play a crucial role in neuroinflammation in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the specific mechanisms that link gut microbiota to PD remain unexplored. Given the critical roles of blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction and mitochondrial dysfunction in the development of PD, we aimed to evaluate the interactions among the gut microbiota, BBB, and mitochondrial resistance to oxidation and inflammation in PD. We investigated the effects of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) on the physiopathology of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated mice. The aim was to explore the role of fecal microbiota from PD patients and healthy human controls in neuroinflammation, BBB components, and mitochondrial antioxidative capacity via the AMPK/SOD2 pathway. Compared to control mice, MPTP-treated mice exhibited elevated levels of Desulfovibrio, whereas mice given FMT from PD patients exhibited enriched levels of Akkermansia and mice given FMT from healthy humans showed no significant alterations in gut microbiota. Strikingly, FMT from PD patients to MPTP-treated mice significantly aggravated motor impairments, dopaminergic neurodegeneration, nigrostriatal glial activation and colonic inflammation, and inhibited the AMPK/SOD2 signaling pathway. However, FMT from healthy human controls greatly improved the aforementioned MPTP-caused effects. Surprisingly, the MPTP-treated mice displayed a significant loss in nigrostriatal pericytes, which was restored by FMT from healthy human controls. Our findings demonstrate that FMT from healthy human controls can correct gut dysbacteriosis and ameliorate neurodegeneration in the MPTP-induced PD mouse model by suppressing microgliosis and astrogliosis, ameliorating mitochondrial impairments via the AMPK/SOD2 pathway, and restoring the loss of nigrostriatal pericytes and BBB integrity. These findings raise the possibility that the alteration in the human gut microbiota may be a risk factor for PD and provide evidence for potential application of FMT in PD preclinical treatment.",Aging and disease,2023,Zhenchao Xie; Mahui Zhang; Yuqi Luo; Dana Jin; Xingfang Guo; Wanlin Yang; Jialing Zheng; Hongfei Zhang; Lu Zhang; Chao Deng; Wenhua Zheng; Eng-King Tan; Kunlin Jin; Shuzhen Zhu; Qing Wang

38089822,The relationship between gut microbiota and insomnia: a bi-directional two-sample Mendelian randomization research.,"Insomnia is the second most common mental health issue, also is a social and financial burden. Insomnia affects the balance between sleep, the immune system, and the central nervous system, which may raise the risk of different systemic disorders. The gut microbiota, referred to as the ""second genome,"" has the ability to control host homeostasis. It has been discovered that disruption of the gut-brain axis is linked to insomnia.In this study, we conducted MR analysis between large-scale GWAS data of GMs and insomnia to uncover potential associations.Ten GM taxa were detected to have causal associations with insomnia. Among them, class <i>Negativicutes</i>, genus <i>Clostridiuminnocuumgroup</i>, genus <i>Dorea</i>, genus <i>Lachnoclostridium</i>, genus <i>Prevotella7</i>, and order <i>Selenomonadalesare</i> were linked to a higher risk of insomnia. In reverse MR analysis, we discovered a causal link between insomnia and six other GM taxa.It suggested that the relationship between insomnia and intestinal flora was convoluted. Our findings may offer beneficial biomarkers for disease development and prospective candidate treatment targets for insomnia.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2023,Yan Li; Qingqing Deng; Zhanli Liu
38007616,Fiber intake and fiber intervention in depression and anxiety: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies and randomized controlled trials.,"Dietary fibers hold potential to influence depressive and anxiety outcomes by modulating the microbiota-gut-brain axis, which is increasingly recognized as an underlying factor in mental health maintenance.Evidence for the effects of fibers on depressive and anxiety outcomes remains unclear. To this end, a systematic literature review and a meta-analysis were conducted that included observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs).The PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and PsychINFO databases were searched for eligible studies.Study screening and risk-of-bias assessment were conducted by 2 independent reviewers.Meta-analyses via random effects models were performed to examine the (1) association between fiber intake and depressive and anxiety outcomes in observational studies, and (2) effect of fiber intervention on depressive and anxiety outcomes compared with placebo in RCTs. A total of 181 405 participants were included in 23 observational studies. In cross-sectional studies, an inverse association was observed between fiber intake and depressive (Cohen's d effect size [d]: -0.11; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.16, -0.05) and anxiety (d = -0.25; 95%CI, -0.38, -0.12) outcomes. In longitudinal studies, there was an inverse association between fiber intake and depressive outcomes (d = -0.07; 95%CI, -0.11, -0.04). In total, 740 participants were included in 10 RCTs, all of whom used fiber supplements. Of note, only 1 RCT included individuals with a clinical diagnosis of depression. No difference was found between fiber supplementation and placebo for depressive (d = -0.47; 95%CI, -1.26, 0.31) or anxiety (d = -0.30; 95%CI, -0.67, 0.07) outcomes.Although observational data suggest a potential benefit for higher fiber intake for depressive and anxiety outcomes, evidence from current RCTs does not support fiber supplementation for improving depressive or anxiety outcomes. More research, including RCTs in clinical populations and using a broad range of fibers, is needed.PROSPERO registration no.

38068763,Analysis of the Efficacy of Diet and Short-Term Probiotic Intervention on Depressive Symptoms in Patients after Bariatric Surgery: A Randomized Double-Blind Placebo Controlled Pilot Study.,"(1) Background: studies have shown that some patients experience mental deterioration after bariatric surgery. (2) Methods: We examined whether the use of probiotics and improved eating habits can improve the mental health of people who suffered from mood disorders after bariatric surgery. We also analyzed patients' mental states, eating habits and microbiota. (3) Results: Depressive symptoms were observed in 45% of 200 bariatric patients. After 5 weeks, we noted an improvement in patients' mental functioning (reduction in BDI and HRSD), but it was not related to the probiotic used. The consumption of vegetables and whole grain cereals increased (DQI-I adequacy), the consumption of simple sugars and SFA decreased (moderation DQI-I), and the consumption of monounsaturated fatty acids increased it. In the feces of patients after RYGB, there was a significantly higher abundance of two members of the Muribaculaceae family, namely Veillonella and Roseburia, while those after SG had more Christensenellaceae R-7 group, Subdoligranulum, Oscillibacter, and UCG-005. (4) Conclusions: the noted differences in the composition of the gut microbiota (RYGB vs. SG) may be one of the determinants of the proper functioning of the gut-brain microbiota axis, although there is currently a need for further research into this topic using a larger group of patients and different probiotic doses.",Nutrients,2023,Natalia Komorniak; Mariusz Kaczmarczyk; Igor Łoniewski; Alexandra Martynova-Van Kley; Armen Nalian; Michał Wroński; Krzysztof Kaseja; Bartosz Kowalewski; Marcin Folwarski; Ewa Stachowska
37995075,Microbiota Alters and Its Correlation with Molecular Regulation Underlying Depression in PCOS Patients.,"Depression is one of the complications in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) that leads to considerable mental health. Accumulating evidence suggests that human gut microbiomes are associated with the progression of PCOS and depression. However, whether microbiota influences depression development in PCOS patients is still uncharacterized. In this study, we employed metagenomic sequencing and transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) to profile the composition of the fecal microbiota and gene expression of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in depressed women with PCOS (PCOS-DP, n = 27) in comparison to mentally healthy women with PCOS (PCOS, n = 18) and compared with healthy control (HC, n = 27) and patients with major depressive disorder (MDD, n = 29). Gut microbiota assessment revealed distinct patterns in the relative abundance in the PCOS-DP compared to HC, MDD, and PCOS groups. Several gut microbes exhibited uniquely and significantly higher abundance in the PCOS-DP compared to PCOS patients, inducing EC Ruminococcus torques, Coprococcus comes, Megasphaera elsdenii, Acidaminococcus intestini, and Barnesiella viscericola. Bacteroides eggerthii was a potential gut microbial biomarker for the PCOS-DP. RNA-seq profiling identified that 35 and 37 genes were significantly elevated and downregulated in the PCOS-DP, respectively. The enhanced differential expressed genes (DEGs) in the PCOS-DP were enriched in pathways involved in signal transduction and endocrine and metabolic diseases, whereas several lipid metabolism pathways were downregulated. Intriguingly, genes correlated with the gut microbiota were found to be significantly enriched in pathways of neurodegenerative diseases and the immune system, suggesting that changes in the microbiota may have a systemic impact on the expression of neurodegenerative diseases and immune genes. Gut microbe-related DEGs of CREB3L3 and CCDC173 were possible molecular biomarkers and therapeutic targets of women with PCOS-DP. Our multi-omics data indicate shifts in the gut microbiome and host gene regulation in PCOS patients with depression, which is of possible etiological and diagnostic importance.",Molecular neurobiology,2023,Liying Yu; Xiaoyu Chen; Xuefeng Bai; Jingping Fang; Ming Sui
38003647,Unveiling the Connection between Microbiota and Depressive Disorder through Machine Learning.,"In the last few years, investigation of the gut-brain axis and the connection between the gut microbiota and the human nervous system and mental health has become one of the most popular topics. Correlations between the taxonomic and functional changes in gut microbiota and major depressive disorder have been shown in several studies. Machine learning provides a promising approach to analyze large-scale metagenomic data and identify biomarkers associated with depression. In this work, machine learning algorithms, such as random forest, elastic net, and You Only Look Once (YOLO), were utilized to detect significant features in microbiome samples and classify individuals based on their disorder status. The analysis was conducted on metagenomic data obtained during the study of gut microbiota of healthy people and patients with major depressive disorder. The YOLO method showed the greatest effectiveness in the analysis of the metagenomic samples and confirmed the experimental results on the critical importance of a reduction in the amount of <i>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</i> for the manifestation of depression. These findings could contribute to a better understanding of the role of the gut microbiota in major depressive disorder and potentially lead the way for novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",International journal of molecular sciences,2023,Irina Y Angelova; Alexey S Kovtun; Olga V Averina; Tatiana A Koshenko; Valery N Danilenko
37978477,Intricate role of intestinal microbe and metabolite in schizophrenia.,"The brain-gut axis has gained increasing attention due to its contribution to the etiology of various central nervous system disorders. This study aims to elucidate the hypothesis that schizophrenia is associated with disturbances in intestinal microflora and imbalance in intestinal metabolites. By exploring the intricate relationship between the gut and the brain, with the goal of offering fresh perspectives and valuable insights into the potential contribution of intestinal microbial and metabolites dysbiosis to the etiology of schizophrenia.In this study, we used a 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene sequence-based approach and an untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolic profiling approach to measure the gut microbiome and microbial metabolites from 44 healthy controls, 41 acute patients, and 39 remission patients, to evaluate whether microbial dysbiosis and microbial metabolite biomarkers were linked with the severity of schizophrenic symptoms.Here, we identified 20 dominant disturbances in the gut microbial composition of patients compared with healthy controls, with 3 orders, 4 families, 9 genera, and 4 species. Several unique bacterial taxa associated with schizophrenia severity. Compared with healthy controls, 145 unusual microflora metabolites were detected in the acute and remission groups, which were mainly involved in environmental information processing, metabolism, organismal systems, and human diseases in the Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway. The Sankey diagram showed that 4 abnormal intestinal and 4 anomalous intestinal microbial metabolites were associated with psychiatric clinical symptoms.These findings suggest a possible interactive influence of the gut microbiota and their metabolites on the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.",BMC psychiatry,2023,Li Shi; Peijun Ju; Xiaojing Meng; Zhongxian Wang; Lihui Yao; Mingming Zheng; Xialong Cheng; Jingwei Li; Tao Yu; Qingrong Xia; Junwei Yan; Cuizhen Zhu; Xulai Zhang
37962812,Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis and Antidepressant Treatment.,"In the treatment of depressive disorders, conventional antidepressant therapy has been the mainstay of clinical management, along with well-established nonpharmacological interventions such as various kinds of psychotherapy. Over the last 2 decades, there has been considerable interest in the role of the gastrointestinal system and its microbiota on brain function, behavior, and mental health. Components of what is referred to as the microbiota-gut-brain axis have been uncovered, and further research has elicited functional capabilities such as ""gut-brain modules."" Some studies have found associations with compositional alterations of gut microbiota in patients with depressive disorders and individuals experiencing symptoms of depression. Regarding the pathogenesis and neurobiology of depression itself, there appears to be a multifactorial contribution, in addition to the theories involving deficits in catecholaminergic and monoamine neurotransmission. Interestingly, there is evidence to suggest that antidepressants may play a role in modulating the gut microbiota, thereby possibly having an impact on the microbiota-gut-brain axis in this manner. The development of prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics has led to studies investigating not only their impact on the microbiota but also their therapeutic value in mental health. These psychobiotics have the potential to be used as therapeutic adjuncts in the treatment of depression. Regarding future directions, and in an attempt to further understand the role of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in depression, more studies such as those involving fecal microbiota transplantation will be required. In addition to recent findings, it is also suggested that more research will have to be undertaken to elicit whether specific strains of gut organisms are linked to depression. In terms of further investigation of the therapeutic potential of prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics as adjuncts to antidepressant treatment, we also expect there to be more research targeting specific microorganisms, as well as a strong focus on the effects of specific prebiotic fibers from an individualized (personalized) point of view.",Current topics in behavioral neurosciences,2024,David Antoine Lachmansingh; Aonghus Lavelle; John F Cryan; Gerard Clarke
37657622,Strain-level structure of gut microbiome showed potential association with cognitive function in major depressive disorder: A pilot study.,"Although the association between gut microbiota and the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder (MDD) has been well studied, it is unclear whether gut microbiota affects cognitive function in patients with MDD. In this study, we explored the association between gut microbiota and cognitive function in MDD and its possible mechanisms.We enrolled 57 patients with MDD and 30 healthy controls (HCs) and used 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis and shotgun metagenomic sequencing analysis to determine gut microbial composition.The richness and diversity of gut microbiota in patients with MDD were the same as those in HCs, but there were differences in the abundance of Bifidobacterium and Blautia. Compared with HCs, two strains (bin_32 and bin_55) were significantly increased, and one strain (bin_31) was significantly decreased in patients with MDD based on the strain-level meta-analysis. Time to complete the Stroop-C had significant negative correlations with bin_31 and bin_32. Bin_55 had significant negative correlations with time to complete the Stroop-C, time to complete the Stroop-CW, and repeated animal words in 60 s but significant positive correlations with correct answers in 120 s on the Stroop-CW.This study only tested the cognitive function of MDD in a small sample, which may have caused some bias.Based on our strain-level analysis, we found that gut microbiota may be associated with the pathogenesis of MDD and may have potential effects on cognitive function.",Journal of affective disorders,2023,Zaiquan Dong; Qinglian Xie; Yanling Yuan; Xiaoling Shen; Yanni Hao; Jin Li; Haizhen Xu; Weihong Kuang
37619773,The role of the indoles in microbiota-gut-brain axis and potential therapeutic targets: A focus on human neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases.,"At present, a large number of relevant studies have suggested that the changes in gut microbiota are related to the course of nervous system diseases, and the microbiota-gut-brain axis is necessary for the proper functioning of the nervous system. Indole and its derivatives, as the products of the gut microbiota metabolism of tryptophan, can be used as ligands to regulate inflammation and autoimmune response in vivo. In recent years, some studies have found that the levels of indole and its derivatives differ significantly between patients with central nervous system diseases and healthy individuals, suggesting that they may be important mediators for the involvement of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in the disease course. Tryptophan metabolites produced by gut microbiota are involved in multiple physiological reactions, take indole for example, it participates in the process of inflammation and anti-inflammatory effects through various cellular physiological activities mediated by aromatic hydrocarbon receptors (AHR), which can influence a variety of neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases. This review mainly explores and summarizes the relationship between indoles and human neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, including ischemic stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, cognitive impairment, depression and anxiety, and puts forward that the level of indoles can be regulated through various direct or indirect ways to improve the prognosis of central nervous system diseases and reverse the dysfunction of the microbiota-gut-brain axis.

37951975,"Effect of inulin supplementation on clinical symptoms, inflammatory and oxidative stress markers in women with migraine: study protocol for a randomized clinical trial.","Migraine is a complex, chronic, and debilitating multifactorial disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of headache and related symptoms. It typically begins in early ages and is more prevalent in women than in men. Recently, the gut-brain axis has emerged as a new candidate that may be linked to neurological diseases. We hypothesize that selective modulation of the intestinal microbiota, oxidative stress, and inflammation through inulin supplementation may improve clinical outcomes in these patients. Therefore, this study aims to examine the effects of high-performance inulin supplementation on clinical symptoms, mental health, quality of life (QOL), intestinal permeability, and inflammatory and oxidative stress factors in women with migraine.This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial involving 80 women with migraine who meet the inclusion criteria (aged between 20 and 50 years with a diagnosis of migraine by a neurologist based on the ICDH-3). Participants will be assigned to receive a daily dose of 10 g of inulin for 12 weeks (intervention group, n = 40) or 10 g of maltodextrin as a placebo for the same duration (control group, n = 40). The primary outcome will measure the variations in the frequency of headache experienced by the patients. Secondary outcomes will encompass serum levels of zonulin, high-sensitive C-reactive protein, total antioxidant capacity, total oxidant status, nitric oxide, mental status, QOL, duration, and severity of migraine attacks.This clinical trial aims to evaluate the effect of inulin supplementation on inflammatory status, oxidative stress, intestinal permeability, clinical symptoms, mental health, and QOL in women with migraine. The findings of this trial could contribute to the identification of mechanistic action and evidence-based clinical guidelines that address gut microbiota manipulation to maximize health benefits in the management of clinical outcomes in migraine patients.Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials ( www.irct.ir ) (ID: IRCT20121216011763N58).

38026003,The importance of the intestinal microbiota in humans and dogs in the neonatal period.,"The neonatal period represents a critical stage for the establishment and development of the gut microbiota, which profoundly influences the future health trajectory of individuals. This review examines the importance of intestinal microbiota in humans and dogs, aiming to elucidate the distinct characteristics and variations in the composition between these two species. In humans, the intestinal microbiota contributes to several crucial physiological processes, including digestion, nutrient absorption, immune system development, and modulation of host metabolism. Dysbiosis, an imbalance or disruption of the gut microbial community, has been linked to various disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, and even neurological conditions. Furthermore, recent research has unveiled the profound influence of the gut-brain axis, emphasizing the bidirectional communication between the gut microbiota and the central nervous system, impacting cognitive function and mental health. Similarly, alterations in the canine intestinal microbiota have been associated with gastrointestinal disorders, including chronic enteropathy, such as inflammatory bowel disease, food allergies, and ulcerative histiocytic colitis. However, our understanding of the intricacies and functional significance of the intestinal microbiota in dogs remains limited. Understanding the complex dynamics of the intestinal microbiota in both humans and dogs is crucial for devising effective strategies to promote health and manage disease. Moreover, exploring the similarities and differences in the gut microbial composition between these two species can facilitate translational research, potentially leading to innovative therapeutic interventions and strategies to enhance the well-being of both humans and dogs.",Animal reproduction,2023,Samara Beretta; Maricy Apparicio; Gilson Hélio Toniollo; Marita Vedovelli Cardozo

37817414,The gut-microbiota-brain axis: An introduction to a special issue on its role in neurological disorders.,"The gut microbiota is a complex ecosystem of microorganisms present in the gastrointestinal tract. The composition and functioning of the intestinal microbiota are determined by multiple factors such as age, environmental factors such as diet, antibiotic use, stress, and to a lesser extent host genetics. The host–microbiota interaction is crucial for normal host physiology, metabolism, and immunity. Disruption of the balanced intestinal flora may impact local, but also remote organ systems. There is a growing body of evidence suggesting a complex, bidirectional communication between the gut microbiota and the central nervous system.

37804926,Possible role of tryptophan metabolism along the microbiota-gut-brain axis on cognitive & behavioral aspects in Phenylketonuria.,"Cognitive and psychiatric disorders are well documented across the lifetime of patients with inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs). Gut microbiota impacts behavior and cognitive functions through the gut-brain axis (GBA). According to recent research, a broad spectrum of GBA disorders may be influenced by a perturbed Tryptophan (Trp) metabolism and are associated with alterations in composition or function of the gut microbiota. Furthermore, early-life diets may influence children's neurodevelopment and cognitive deficits in adulthood. In Phenylketonuria (PKU), since the main therapeutic intervention is based on a life-long restrictive diet, important alterations of gut microbiota have been observed. Studies on PKU highlight the impact of alterations of gut microbiota on the central nervous system (CNS), also investigating the involvement of metabolic pathways, such as Trp and kynurenine (KYN) metabolisms, involved in numerous neurodegenerative disorders. An alteration of Trp metabolism with an imbalance of the KYN pathway towards the production of neurotoxic metabolites implicated in numerous neurodegenerative and inflammatory diseases has been observed in PKU patients supplemented with Phe-free amino acid medical foods (AA-MF). The present review investigates the possible link between gut microbiota and the brain in IEMs, focusing on Trp metabolism in PKU. Considering the evidence collected, cognitive and behavioral well-being should always be monitored in routine IEMs clinical management.

The intervention comprised 1.2 g/d of ginger (4 capsules per day totaling 84 mg/d of active gingerols/shogaols) for 14 d following a 1-wk run-in period. Primary outcomes were gastrointestinal community composition, alpha and beta diversity, and differential abundance, measured using 16S rRNA gene sequencing of fecal samples. Secondary outcomes were gastrointestinal symptoms, bowel function, depression, anxiety, stress, fatigue, quality of life, and adverse events.Fifty-one participants were enrolled and analyzed (71% female; mean age 25 ± 3 y; ginger: n = 29, placebo: n = 22). There was a greater increase in relative abundance of phylum, Actinobacteria, observed following ginger supplementation compared to placebo (U: 145.0; z: -2.1; P = 0.033). Ginger was associated with a greater abundance of the genera Parabacteroides, Bacillus, Ruminococcaceae incertae sedis, unclassified Bacilli, families Defluviitaleaceae, Morganellaceae, and Bacillaceae as well as lower abundance of the genus Blautia and family Sphingomonadaceae (P < 0.05). An improvement in indigestion symptoms was observed with ginger supplementation (U: 196.0; z: -2.4; P = 0.015). No differences between ginger and placebo groups were found for alpha and beta diversity or other secondary outcomes. No moderate or severe adverse events were reported.Supplementation with ginger root powder was safe and altered aspects of gastrointestinal bacteria composition; however, it did not change alpha- or beta diversity, bowel function, gastrointestinal symptoms, mood, or quality of life in healthy adults. These results provide further understanding regarding the mechanisms of action of ginger supplementation.

37927130,<i>Lactobacillus reuteri</i> ATG-F4 Alleviates Chronic Stress-induced Anhedonia by Modulating the Prefrontal Serotonergic System.,"Mental health is influenced by the gut-brain axis; for example, gut dysbiosis has been observed in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Gut microbial changes by fecal microbiota transplantation or probiotics treatment reportedly modulates depressive symptoms. However, it remains unclear how gut dysbiosis contributes to mental dysfunction, and how correction of the gut microbiota alleviates neuropsychiatric disorders. Our previous study showed that chronic consumption of <i>Lactobacillus reuteri</i> ATG-F4 (F4) induced neurometabolic alterations in healthy mice. Here, we investigated whether F4 exerted therapeutic effects on depressive-like behavior by influencing the central nervous system. Using chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) to induce anhedonia, a key symptom of MDD, we found that chronic F4 consumption alleviated CUS-induced anhedonic behaviors, accompanied by biochemical changes in the gut, serum, and brain. Serum and brain metabolite concentrations involved in tryptophan metabolism were regulated by CUS and F4. F4 consumption reduced the elevated levels of serotonin (5-HT) in the brain observed in the CUS group. Additionally, the increased expression of <i>Htr1a</i>, a subtype of the 5-HT receptor, in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of stressed mice was restored to levels observed in stress-naïve mice following F4 supplementation. We further demonstrated the role of <i>Htr1a</i> using AAV-shRNA to downregulate <i>Htr1a</i> in the mPFC of CUS mice, effectively reversing CUS-induced anhedonic behavior. Together, our findings suggest F4 as a potential therapeutic approach for relieving some depressive symptoms and highlight the involvement of the tryptophan metabolism in mitigating CUS-induced depressive-like behaviors through the action of this bacterium.",Experimental neurobiology,2023,Jiyun Lee; Eum-Ji Kim; Gun-Seok Park; Jeongseop Kim; Tae-Eun Kim; Yoo Jin Lee; Juyi Park; Jihee Kang; Ja Wook Koo; Tae-Yong Choi
37960197,"Causality Investigation between Gut Microbiota, Derived Metabolites, and Obstructive Sleep Apnea: A Bidirectional Mendelian Randomization Study.","Various studies have highlighted the important associations between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and gut microbiota and related metabolites. Nevertheless, the establishment of causal relationships between these associations remains to be determined. Multiple mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were performed to genetically predict the causative impact of 196 gut microbiota and 83 metabolites on OSA. Two-sample MR was used to assess the potential association, and causality was evaluated using inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, and weighted median (WM) methods. Multivariable MR (MVMR) was employed to ascertain the causal independence between gut microbiota and the metabolites linked to OSA. Additionally, Cochran's Q test, the MR Egger intercept test and the MR Steiger test were used for the sensitivity analyses. The analysis of the 196 gut microbiota revealed that <i>genus</i>_<i>Ruminococcaceae</i> (<i>UCG009</i>) (P<sub>IVW</sub> = 0.010) and <i>genus</i>_<i>Subdoligranulum</i> (P<sub>IVW</sub> = 0.041) were associated with an increased risk of OSA onset. Conversely, <i>Family</i>_<i>Ruminococcaceae</i> (P<sub>IVW</sub> = 0.030), <i>genus</i>_<i>Coprococcus2</i> (P<sub>WM</sub> = 0.025), <i>genus</i>_<i>Eggerthella</i> (P<sub>IVW</sub> = 0.011), and <i>genus</i>_<i>Eubacterium</i> (<i>xylanophilum</i>_<i>group</i>) (P<sub>IVW</sub> = 0.001) were negatively related to the risk of OSA. Among the 83 metabolites evaluated, 3-dehydrocarnitine, epiandrosterone sulfate, and leucine were determined to be potential independent risk factors associated with OSA. Moreover, the reverse MR analysis demonstrated a suggestive association between OSA exposure and six microbiota taxa. This study offers compelling evidence regarding the potential beneficial or detrimental causative impact of the gut microbiota and its associated metabolites on OSA risk, thereby providing new insights into the mechanisms of gut microbiome-mediated OSA development.",Nutrients,2023,Weiheng Yan; Miaomiao Jiang; Wen Hu; Xiaojun Zhan; Yifan Liu; Jiayi Zhou; Jie Ji; Shan Wang; Jun Tai
36757367,Targeting the gut-microbiota-brain axis in irritable bowel disease to improve cognitive function - recent knowledge and emerging therapeutic opportunities.,"The brain-gut axis forms a bidirectional communication system between the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and cognitive brain areas. Disturbances to this system in disease states such as inflammatory bowel disease have consequences for neuronal activity and subsequent cognitive function. The gut-microbiota-brain axis refers to the communication between gut-resident bacteria and the brain. This circuits exists to detect gut microorganisms and relay information to specific areas of the central nervous system (CNS) that in turn, regulate gut physiology. Changes in both the stability and diversity of the gut microbiota have been implicated in several neuronal disorders, including depression, autism spectrum disorder Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. Correcting this imbalance with medicinal herbs, the metabolic products of dysregulated bacteria and probiotics have shown hope for the treatment of these neuronal disorders. In this review, we focus on recent advances in our understanding of the intricate connections between the gut-microbiota and the brain. We discuss the contribution of gut microbiota to neuronal disorders and the tangible links between diseases of the GI tract with cognitive function and behaviour. In this regard, we focus on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) given its strong links to brain function and anxiety disorders. This adds to the growing body of evidence supporting targeted therapeutic strategies to modulate the gut microbiota for the treatment of brain/mental-health-related disease.",Reviews in the neurosciences,2023,Heyong Tang; Xiaoqi Chen; Shun Huang; Gang Yin; Xiyang Wang; Guoming Shen
37954149,Reproducible microbiome composition signatures of anxiety and depressive symptoms.,"The gut microbiome is a significant contributor to mental health, with growing evidence linking its composition to anxiety and depressive disorders. Gut microbiome composition is associated with signs of anxiety and depression both in clinically diagnosed mood disorders and subclinically in the general population and may be influenced by dietary fibre intake and the presence of chronic pain. We provide an update of current evidence on the role of gut microbiome composition in depressive and anxiety disorders or symptoms by reviewing available studies. Analysing data from three independent cohorts (osteoarthritis 1 (OA1); n = 46, osteoarthritis 2 (OA2); n = 58, and healthy controls (CON); n = 67), we identified microbial composition signatures of anxiety and depressive symptoms at genus level and cross-validated our findings performing meta-analyses of our results with results from previously published studies. The genera <i>Bifidobacterium</i> (fixed-effect beta (95% CI) = -0.22 (-0.34, -0.10), p = 3.90e-04) and <i>Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group</i> (fixed-effect beta (95% CI) = -0.09 (-0.13, -0.05), p = 2.53e-06) were found to be the best predictors of anxiety and depressive symptoms, respectively, across our three cohorts and published literature taking into account demographic and lifestyle covariates, such as fibre intake. The association with anxiety was robust in accounting for heterogeneity between cohorts and supports previous observations of the potential prophylactic effect of <i>Bifidobacterium</i> against anxiety symptoms.",Computational and structural biotechnology journal,2023,Afroditi Kouraki; Anthony Kelly; Amrita Vijay; Sameer Gohir; Stuart Astbury; Vasileios Georgopoulos; Bonnie Millar; David Andrew Walsh; Eamonn Ferguson; Cristina Menni; Ana M Valdes
37892465,The Gut-Brain Axis in Schizophrenia: The Implications of the Gut Microbiome and SCFA Production.,"Schizophrenia, a severe mental illness affecting about 1% of the population, manifests during young adulthood, leading to abnormal mental function and behavior. Its multifactorial etiology involves genetic factors, experiences of adversity, infection, and gene-environment interactions. Emerging research indicates that maternal infection or stress during pregnancy may also increase schizophrenia risk in offspring. Recent research on the gut-brain axis highlights the gut microbiome's potential influence on central nervous system (CNS) function and mental health, including schizophrenia. The gut microbiota, located in the digestive system, has a significant role to play in human physiology, affecting immune system development, vitamin synthesis, and protection against pathogenic bacteria. Disruptions to the gut microbiota, caused by diet, medication use, environmental pollutants, and stress, may lead to imbalances with far-reaching effects on CNS function and mental health. Of interest are short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), metabolic byproducts produced by gut microbes during fermentation. SCFAs can cross the blood-brain barrier, influencing CNS activity, including microglia and cytokine modulation. The dysregulation of neurotransmitters produced by gut microbes may contribute to CNS disorders, including schizophrenia. This review explores the potential relationship between SCFAs, the gut microbiome, and schizophrenia. Our aim is to deepen the understanding of the gut-brain axis in schizophrenia and to elucidate its implications for future research and therapeutic approaches.",Nutrients,2023,Songhyun Ju; Yoonhwa Shin; Sunhee Han; Juhui Kwon; Tae Gyu Choi; Insug Kang; Sung Soo Kim
37659269,Disordered gut microbiota and changes in short-chain fatty acids and inflammatory processes in stress-vulnerable mice.,"Long-term exposure to chronic stress increases the incidence of depression. However, chronic stress is an associated risk factor in only a subset of individuals. Inflammation has been identified as a putative mechanism promoting stress vulnerability. Because of the gut microbiota's potential role as a source of inflammatory substances, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) may exert their influence on inflammation, emotional states, and cognition via the gut-brain axis. In this study, Classic behavioral tests were used to categorize C57BL/6 J mice into a CUMS-vulnerable and a CUMS-resilient group after they were exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). We compared the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences retrieved from fecal samples between control, CUMS-vulnerable, and CUMS-resilient mice. SCFAs in fecal samples were detected by liquid chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Hippocampal cytokine production and TLR4/MYD88/NF-κB inflammatory pathway activation were evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and western blotting. Then, we supplemented SCFAs in CUMS mice. we observed depression-like behavior and the expression of TLR4/MYD88/NF-κB inflammatory pathway in hippocampus of SCFAs supplementation mice. Susceptible mice to CUMS showed more severe symptoms of depression and anxiety, α diversity was significantly different, as well as higher expression of interleukin (IL)-1β and TLR4/MYD88/NF-κB inflammatory pathway components in the hippocampus. SCFA levels in the feces were significantly higher in CUMS-resilient mice than in control mice. Depressive behavior was reversed in CUMS-SCFAs group, and the protein level of TLR4/MYD88/NF-κB in hippocampus was decreased. Overall, these results provide new light on the possible involvement of the microbiome in the gut-brain axis development in depressive disorder and provide a theoretical basis for identifying novel therapeutic targets.",Journal of neuroimmunology,2023,Wenjuan Han; Yaxin Zheng; Lan Wang; Cuixia An
37867494,"Exploring the gut microbiota: lifestyle choices, disease associations, and personal genomics.","The gut microbiota is a rich and dynamic ecosystem that actively interacts with the human body, playing a significant role in the state of health and disease of the host. Diet, exercise, mental health, and other factors have exhibited the ability to influence the gut bacterial composition, leading to changes that can prevent and improve, or favor and worsen, both intestinal and extra-intestinal conditions. Altered gut microbial states, or 'dysbiosis', associated with conditions and diseases are often characterized by shifts in bacterial abundance and diversity, including an impaired <i>Firmicutes</i> to <i>Bacteroidetes</i> ratio. By understanding the effect of lifestyle on the gut microbiota, personalized advice can be generated to suit each individual profile and foster the adoption of lifestyle changes that can both prevent and ameliorate dysbiosis. The delivery of effective and reliable advice, however, depends not only on the available research and current understanding of the topic, but also on the methods used to assess individuals and to discover the associations, which can introduce bias at multiple stages. The aim of this review is to summarize how human gut microbial variability is defined and what lifestyle choices and diseases have shown association with gut bacterial composition. Furthermore, popular methods to investigate the human gut microbiota are outlined, with a focus on the possible bias caused by the lack of use of standardized methods. Finally, an overview of the current state of personalized advice based on gut microbiota testing is presented, underlining its power and limitations.",Frontiers in nutrition,2023,Sharlize Pedroza Matute; Sasitaran Iyavoo
37881577,Repeated Social Defeat Stress Induces an Inflammatory Gut Milieu by Altering the Mucosal Barrier Integrity and Gut Microbiota Homeostasis.,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition triggered by exposure to traumatic events in an individual's life. Patients with PTSD are also at a higher risk for comorbidities. However, it is not well understood how PTSD affects human health and/or promotes the risk for comorbidities. Nevertheless, patients with PTSD harbor a proinflammatory milieu and dysbiotic gut microbiota. Gut barrier integrity helps to maintain normal gut homeostasis and its dysregulation promotes gut dysbiosis and inflammation.We used a mouse model of repeated social defeat stress (RSDS), a preclinical model of PTSD. Behavioral studies, metagenomics analysis of the microbiome, gut permeability assay (on mouse colon, using an Ussing chamber), immunoblotting, and immunohistochemical analyses were performed. Polarized intestinal epithelial cells and 3-dimensional crypt cultures were used for mechanistic analysis.The RSDS mice harbor a heightened proinflammatory gut environment and microbiota dysbiosis. The RSDS mice further showed significant dysregulation of gut barrier functions, including transepithelial electrical resistance, mucin homeostasis, and antimicrobial responses. RSDS mice also showed a specific increase in intestinal expression of claudin-2, a tight junction protein, and epinephrine, a stress-induced neurotransmitter. Treating intestinal epithelial cells or 3-dimensional cultured crypts with norepinephrine or intestinal luminal contents (fecal contents) upregulated claudin-2 expression and inhibited transepithelial electrical resistance.Traumatic stress induces dysregulation of gut barrier functions, which may underlie the observed gut microbiota changes and proinflammatory gut milieu, all of which may have an interdependent effect on the health and increased risk of comorbidities in patients with PTSD.",Biological psychiatry global open science,2023,Santosh K Yadav; Rizwan Ahmad; Cassandra M Moshfegh; Jagadesan Sankarasubramanian; Vineet Joshi; Safwan K Elkhatib; Yashpal Singh Chhonker; Daryl J Murry; Geoffrey A Talmon; Chittibabu Guda; Adam J Case; Amar B Singh
37836527,Change in Urinary Inflammatory Biomarkers and Psychological Health with Gut Microbiome Modulation after Six Months of a Lifestyle Modification Program in Children.,"<b>Background:</b> Obesity is a metabolic disorder that negatively impacts the quality of life. Long-term methods such as exercise and low-fat diets can help regulate this health issue, but 93.3 million Americans continue to struggle. Our research investigates if lifestyle changes can affect urinary inflammation markers and psychological aspects through the modification of gut microbiome composition. <b>Methods:</b> Our study included 16 healthy controls with normal BMI as a comparison group and 22 overweight/obese (OW/OB) adolescents. We collected demographic, clinical, psychological, stool, and urine sample data at enrollment and six months after implementing lifestyle modifications. Bacterial genomic data and inflammatory markers in these samples were analyzed. <b>Results:</b> The lifestyle interventions were associated with decreased inflammation and enhanced mental health among overweight teens. We observed differences in bacterial community compositions between healthy participants and those who underwent treatment, including exercise and dietary habit adjustments, although there was no significant change in bacterial species richness. Mental health correlated with gut microbiota compositions without any demographic influences. The research also uncovered connections between inflammatory markers, psychological factors, and gut microbiota phyla through carbohydrate metabolism alterations. <b>Conclusion</b>: Our findings demonstrate that lifestyle modifications are associated with improved mental health and a reduction in inflammation in overweight adolescents by adjusting the gut microbiota composition.",Nutrients,2023,Md Saimul Islam; Shyanne Page-Hefley; Anne P Hernandez; Luke Whelchel; Chiquito Crasto; Whitney Viator; Treyce Money; Babafela Awosile; Noel Howard; Tetyana L Vasylyeva
37741061,The role of the gut-microbiota-brain axis via the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve in chronic inflammatory pain and comorbid spatial working memory impairment in complete Freund's adjuvant mice.,"Chronic inflammatory pain (CIP) is a common public medical problem, often accompanied by memory impairment. However, the mechanisms underlying CIP and comorbid memory impairment remain elusive. This study aimed to examine the role of the gut-microbiota-brain axis in CIP and comorbid memory impairment in mice treated with complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). 16S rRNA analysis showed the altered diversity of gut microbiota from day 1 to day 14 after CFA injection. Interestingly, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from healthy naive mice ameliorated comorbidities, such as mechanical allodynia, thermal hyperalgesia, spatial working memory impairment, neuroinflammation, and abnormal composition of gut microbiota in the CFA mice. Additionally, subdiaphragmatic vagotomy (SDV) blocked the onset of these comorbidities. Interestingly, the relative abundance of the bacterial genus or species was also correlated with these comorbidities after FMT or SDV. Therefore, our results suggest that the gut-microbiota-brain axis via the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve is crucial for the development of CIP and comorbid spatial working memory impairment in CFA mice.",Journal of psychiatric research,2023,Caibao Yue; Weiwei Luan; Hanwen Gu; Di Qiu; Xin Ding; Panmiao Liu; Xingming Wang; Kenji Hashimoto; Jian-Jun Yang
37606895,Gastrointestinal involvement in post-acute Coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 syndrome.,"Ten percentage of patients with coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 report having gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2) not only infects the pulmonary but also the GI tract. GI infections including that due to viral infection is known to cause postinfection disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI); hence, we wish to review the long-term GI consequences following COVID-19, particularly post-COVID-19 DGBI.At least 12 cohort studies, four of which also included controls documented the occurrence of post-COVID-19 DGBI, particularly IBS following COVID-19. The risk factors for post-COVID-19 DGBI included female gender, symptomatic COVID-19, particularly GI symptoms, the severity of COVID-19, the occurrence of anosmia and ageusia, use of antibiotics and hospitalization during the acute illness, persistent GI symptoms beyond 1 month after recovery, presence of mental health factors, The putative mechanisms for post-COVID-19 DGBI include altered gut motility, visceral hypersensitivity, gut microbiota dysbiosis, GI inflammation, and immune activation, changes in intestinal permeability, and alterations in the enteroendocrine system and serotonin metabolism.Long-term sequelae of SARS-CoV2 infection may persist even after recovery from COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 are more likely to develop post-COVID-19 IBS than healthy controls.

37604976,Transmission of Alzheimer's disease-associated microbiota dysbiosis and its impact on cognitive function: evidence from mice and patients.,"Spouses of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients are at a higher risk of developing incidental dementia. However, the causes and underlying mechanism of this clinical observation remain largely unknown. One possible explanation is linked to microbiota dysbiosis, a condition that has been associated with AD. However, it remains unclear whether gut microbiota dysbiosis can be transmitted from AD individuals to non-AD individuals and contribute to the development of AD pathogenesis and cognitive impairment. We, therefore, set out to perform both animal studies and clinical investigation by co-housing wild-type mice and AD transgenic mice, analyzing microbiota via 16S rRNA gene sequencing, measuring short-chain fatty acid amounts, and employing behavioral test, mass spectrometry, site-mutations and other methods. The present study revealed that co-housing between wild-type mice and AD transgenic mice or administrating feces of AD transgenic mice to wild-type mice resulted in AD-associated gut microbiota dysbiosis, Tau phosphorylation, and cognitive impairment in the wild-type mice. Gavage with Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium restored these changes in the wild-type mice. The oral and gut microbiota of AD patient partners resembled that of AD patients but differed from healthy controls, indicating the transmission of microbiota. The underlying mechanism of these findings includes that the butyric acid-mediated acetylation of GSK3β at lysine 15 regulated its phosphorylation at serine 9, consequently impacting Tau phosphorylation. Pending confirmative studies, these results provide insight into a potential link between the transmission of AD-associated microbiota dysbiosis and development of cognitive impairment, which underscore the need for further research in this area.",Molecular psychiatry,2023,Yiying Zhang; Yuan Shen; Ning Liufu; Ling Liu; Wei Li; Zhongyong Shi; Hailin Zheng; Xinchun Mei; Chih-Yu Chen; Zengliang Jiang; Shabnamsadat Abtahi; Yuanlin Dong; Feng Liang; Yujiang Shi; Leo L Cheng; Guang Yang; Jing X Kang; Jeremy E Wilkinson; Zhongcong Xie
37557965,The interactions between host genome and gut microbiome increase the risk of psychiatric disorders: Mendelian randomization and biological annotation.,"The correlation between human gut microbiota and psychiatric diseases has long been recognized. Based on the heritability of the microbiome, genome-wide association studies on human genome and gut microbiome (mbGWAS) have revealed important host-microbiome interactions. However, establishing causal relationships between specific gut microbiome features and psychological conditions remains challenging due to insufficient sample sizes of previous studies of mbGWAS.Cross-cohort meta-analysis (via METAL) and multi-trait analysis (via MTAG) were used to enhance the statistical power of mbGWAS for identifying genetic variants and genes. Using two large mbGWAS studies (7,738 and 5,959 participants respectively) and12 disease-specific studies from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC), we performed bidirectional two-sample mendelian randomization (MR) analyses between microbial features and psychiatric diseases (up to 500,199 individuals). Additionally, we conducted downstream gene- and gene-set-based analyses to investigate the shared biology linking gut microbiota and psychiatric diseases.METAL and MTAG conducted in mbGWAS could boost power for gene prioritization and MR analysis. Increases in the number of lead SNPs and mapped genes were witnessed in 13/15 species and 5/10 genera after using METAL, and MTAG analysis gained an increase in sample size equivalent to expanding the original samples from 7% to 63%. Following METAL use, we identified a positive association between Bacteroides faecis and ADHD (OR, 1.09; 95 %CI, 1.02-1.16; P = 0.008). Bacteroides eggerthii and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron were observed to be positively associated with PTSD (OR, 1.11; 95 %CI, 1.03-1.20; P = 0.007; OR, 1.11; 95 %CI, 1.01-1.23; P = 0.03). These findings remained stable across statistical models and sensitivity analyses. No genetic liabilities to psychiatric diseases may alter the abundance of gut microorganisms.Using biological annotation, we identified that those genes contributing to microbiomes (e.g., GRIN2A and RBFOX1) are expressed and enriched in human brain tissues.Our statistical genetics strategy helps to enhance the power of mbGWAS, and our genetic findings offer new insights into biological pleiotropy and causal relationship between microbiota and psychiatric diseases.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2023,Liling Xiao; Siyi Liu; Yulu Wu; Yunqi Huang; Shiwan Tao; Yunjia Liu; Yiguo Tang; Min Xie; Qianshu Ma; Yubing Yin; Minhan Dai; Mengting Zhang; Elyse Llamocca; Hongsheng Gui; Qiang Wang
37354486,Blood-borne extracellular vesicles of bacteria and intestinal cells in patients with psychotic disorders.,"Human cells and bacteria secrete extracellular vesicles (EV) which play a role in intercellular communication. EV from the host intestinal epithelium are involved in the regulation of bacterial gene expression and growth. Bacterial EV (bactEV) produced in the intestine can pass to various tissues where they deliver biomolecules to many kinds of cells, including neurons. Emerging data indicate that gut microbiota is altered in patients with psychotic disorders. We hypothesized that the amount and content of blood-borne EV from intestinal cells and bactEV in psychotic patients would differ from healthy controls.We analyzed for human intestinal proteins by proteomics, for bactEV by metaproteomic analysis, and by measuring the level of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in blood-borne EV from patients with psychotic disorders (<i>n</i> = 25), tested twice, in the acute phase of psychosis and after improvement, with age- and sex-matched healthy controls (<i>n</i> = 25).Patients with psychotic disorders had lower LPS levels in their EV compared to healthy controls (<i>p</i> = .027). Metaproteome analyses confirmed LPS finding and identified Firmicute<i>s</i> and Bacteroidetes as dominating phyla. Total amounts of human intestine proteins in EV isolated from blood was lower in patients compared to controls (<i>p</i> = .02).Our results suggest that bactEV and host intestinal EV are decreased in patients with psychosis and that this topic is worthy of further investigation given potential pathophysiological implications. Possible mechanisms involve dysregulation of the gut microbiota by host EV, altered translocation of bactEV to systemic circulation where bactEV can interact with both the brain and the immune system.",Nordic journal of psychiatry,2023,Mette Elise Tunset; Hanne Haslene-Hox; Tim Van Den Bossche; Susan Maleki; Arne Vaaler; Daniel Kondziella
36786865,Arketamine for cognitive impairment in psychiatric disorders.,"Cognitive impairment has been observed in patients with various psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, major depressive disorder (MDD), and bipolar disorder (BD). Although modern therapeutic drugs can improve certain symptoms (i.e., psychosis, depression) in these patients, these drugs have not been found to improve cognitive impairment. The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist (R,S)-ketamine has attracted attention as a rapidly acting antidepressant. In addition to its robust antidepressant effects, (R,S)-ketamine has been suggested to improve cognitive impairment in patients with MDD and BD, despite causing cognitive impairment in healthy control subjects. (R,S)-ketamine is a racemic mixture of equal amounts of (R)-ketamine (or arketamine) and (S)-ketamine (or esketamine). Arketamine has been found to have more potent antidepressant-like actions than esketamine in rodents. Interestingly, arketamine, but not esketamine, has been suggested to improve phencyclidine-induced cognitive deficits in mice. Furthermore, arketamine has been suggested to ameliorate cognitive deficits in rodent offspring after maternal immune activation. In the current article, it is proposed that arketamine has therapeutic potential for treating cognitive impairment in patients with psychiatric disorders. Additionally, the potential role of the gut-microbiome-brain axis in cognitive impairment in psychiatric disorders is discussed.",European archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience,2023,Kenji Hashimoto
35996352,Probiotics supplementation and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF): a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"An emerging body of evidence has demonstrated the beneficial effects of probiotics on various mental health conditions. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we sought to examine the effects of probiotics supplementation on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in adults.PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were searched, from database inception to April 2021, for eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We pooled mean differences and standard deviations from RCTs using random-effect models.Overall, meta-analysis of 11 trials (<i>n</i> = 648 participants) showed no significant changes in serum level of BDNF following probiotics. However, subgroup analysis revealed that probiotics increased BDNF levels in individuals suffering from neurological disorders (<i>n</i> = 214 participants; WMD = 3.08 ng/mL, 95% CI: 1.83, 4.34; <i>P</i> = 0.001; <i>I</i><sup>2 </sup>= 7.5%; P-heterogeneity 0.34), or depression (<i>n</i> = 268 participants; WMD = 0.77 ng/mL, 95% CI: 0.07, 1.47; <i>P</i> = 0.032; <i>I</i><sup>2 </sup>= 88.4%; P-heterogeneity < 0.001). Furthermore, a significant increase in BDNF levels was found in studies that administered the mixture of <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Bifidobacterium genera</i>, and were conducted in Asia .Our main findings suggest that probiotics may be effective in elevating BDNF levels in patients with depression and neurological disorders, and a mixed of <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Bifidobacterium</i> appear to show greater efficacy than the single genus supplement. The low quality of evidence reduces clinical advocacy, and indicates that more large-scale, high-quality, RCTs are needed to facilitate reliable conclusions.",Nutritional neuroscience,2023,Fereshteh Dehghani; Shima Abdollahi; Farzad Shidfar; Cain C T Clark; Sepideh Soltani

An increasing body of research has demonstrated the critical role of cellular signaling pathways in initiating and managing intestinal inflammation. This review focuses on the interactions of three cellular signaling pathways (TLR4/NF-κB, PI3K-AKT, MAPKs) with immunity and gut microbiota to explain the possible pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation. Traditional medicinal drugs frequently have drawbacks and negative side effects. This paper also summarizes the pharmacological mechanism and application of Chinese herbal compounds (Berberine, Sanguinarine, Astragalus polysaccharide, Curcumin, and Cannabinoids) and formulae (Wumei Wan, Gegen-Qinlian decoction, Banxia xiexin decoction) against intestinal inflammation. We show that the herbal compounds and formulae may influence the interactions among cell signaling pathways, immune function, and gut microbiota in humans and animals, exerting their immunomodulatory capacity and anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects. This demonstrates their strong potential to improve gut inflammation. We aim to promote herbal medicine and apply it to multispecies animals to achieve better health.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,Yang Yang; Gang Xiao; Pi Cheng; Jianguo Zeng; Yisong Liu

However, how the proteoglycan promotes the progress of CRC through interacting with bacteria and regulating the immune response of enteric neurons remains largely unknown. In the present study, we found that biglycan deficiency changed tumor distribution in a colitis-associated colon cancer model. Furthermore, we revealed that BGN deficiency inhibits tumor growth in an allograft tumor model and the migration of cancer cell by upregulating interleukin-10 expression in enteric neurons. Significantly, we demonstrated that biglycan deficiency enriched the abundance of <i>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</i> through competing with it for chondroitin sulfate to inhibit CRC progress.

However, research on the connections between food nutrients, gut microbiota, and mental health remains limited. To address this, the present study aimed to assess the effects of a personalized diet, based on individual needs and aligned with the Mediterranean diet principles, on depression symptoms, quality of life, nutritional intake, and gut microbiota changes among older adults living in the community.The intervention involved regular visits from a registered dietitian, who provided tailored dietary recommendations. During the 6-month study, participants completed questionnaires to evaluate their depression levels, quality of life, and dietary habits. Additionally, they provided stool samples for analysis of gut microbiota and metabolites.The results demonstrated that the personalized dietary intervention reduced depression symptoms and improved the quality of life among older adults. Furthermore, significant changes in the intake of certain nutrients, such as folate, lutein, zeaxanthin, EPA, and DHA, were observed following the intervention. Moreover, the intervention was associated with increased diversity in the gut microbiome and reduced total short-chain fatty acids, the main metabolites produced by gut microorganisms. The study also revealed correlations between food nutrients, gut microbiota, and mental health parameters.In conclusion, this research highlights the potential advantages of personalized dietary interventions in managing depression and enhancing overall well-being among older populations. It also sheds light on the role of gut microbiota and its metabolites in these effects. The findings offer valuable insights into the significance of nutrition and gut health for mental well-being in older adults.",Frontiers in nutrition,2023,Faiga Magzal; Silvia Turroni; Marco Fabbrini; Monica Barone; Adi Vitman Schorr; Ariella Ofran; Snait Tamir
37764088,Altered Gut Microbiota Composition Is Associated with Difficulty in Explicit Emotion Regulation in Young Children.,"Executive function (EF) consists of explicit emotion regulation (EER) and cognitive control (CC). Childhood EER in particular predicts mental and physical health in adulthood. Identifying factors affecting EER development has implications for lifelong physical and mental health. Gut microbiota (GM) has attracted attention as a potential biomarker for risk of physical and mental problems in adulthood. Furthermore, GM is related to brain function/structure, which plays a crucial role in emotional processing. However, little is known about how GM compositions are associated with the development of emotion regulation in early childhood. Therefore, in this study, we examined 257 children aged 3-4 to investigate links between GM and risk to EF. EF was measured using the Mother-Reported Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Preschool version. GM composition (alpha/beta diversity and genus abundance) was evaluated using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and compared between EF-risk and non-risk groups. Our results show that children with EER-risk (an index of inhibitory self-control) had a higher abundance of the genera <i>Actinomyces</i> and <i>Sutterella</i>. Although we have not established a direct link between GM and CC risk, our findings indicate that GM of preschoolers is closely associated with emotional processing and that EERrisk children have more inflammation-related bacteria.",Microorganisms,2023,Hideaki Fujihara; Michiko Matsunaga; Eriko Ueda; Takamasa Kajiwara; Aya K Takeda; Satoshi Watanabe; Kairi Baba; Keisuke Hagihara; Masako Myowa
37744899,Impact of clozapine monotherapy on gut microbiota and metabolism in people with schizophrenia.,"Clozapine is considered one of the most effective antipsychotic drugs, but it is most likely to cause metabolic abnormalities. Researchers have studied the causes of metabolic abnormalities caused by clozapine from multiple perspectives, but the reasons remain unclear.Characterize the gut microbiota of people with schizophrenia taking clozapine, exploring the association between gut microbiota and glucose lipid metabolic markers in schizophrenia patients taking clozapine.Sixty-one long-term inpatients with schizophrenia in clozapine monotherapy were selected as study subjects. We got four subgroups by sex and the presence of metabolic syndrome.16s analysis technology was applied at the genus level to determine the classification of gut microbiota. Then we compared the characteristics of gut microbiota and the association of gut microbiota with glucose lipid metabolic markers in each group.We found differences in the diversity of gut microbiota among groups. The association between gut microbiota and glucose lipid metabolic markers was complicated. Gender was an important differentiating factor. <i>Oscillibacter</i> has a low abundance. However, it was the only genus associated with glycemic or lipids in each group. Among metabolic syndromes, <i>Gemmiger</i> was positively correlated with most lipids in females but negatively correlated in males, showing gender differences. In female non-metabolic syndromes, <i>Bifidobacterium</i> lost its probiotic character; instead, showing pathogenicity, which has strong positive correlations with fasting blood glucose and low-density lipoprotein but negative correlations with Apolipoprotein A1. Maybe schizophrenia, taking clozapine, and gender factors influenced the gut microbiota, which complicated our findings. The significance of the results remains to be determined by in-depth studies.",Frontiers in microbiology,2023,Feiyan Yin; Zhidao Shi; Xiquan Ma; Kai Ding; Yuan Zhang; Sha Ma
37845499,Emerging role of the host microbiome in neuropsychiatric disorders: overview and future directions.,"The human body harbors a diverse ecosystem of microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi, collectively known as the microbiota. Current research is increasingly focusing on the potential association between the microbiota and various neuropsychiatric disorders. The microbiota resides in various parts of the body, such as the oral cavity, nasal passages, lungs, gut, skin, bladder, and vagina. The gut microbiota in the gastrointestinal tract has received particular attention due to its high abundance and its potential role in psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. However, the microbiota presents in other body tissues, though less abundant, also plays crucial role in immune system and human homeostasis, thus influencing the development and progression of neuropsychiatric disorders. For example, oral microbiota imbalance and associated periodontitis might increase the risk for neuropsychiatric disorders. Additionally, studies using the postmortem brain samples have detected the widespread presence of oral bacteria in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. This article provides an overview of the emerging role of the host microbiota in neuropsychiatric disorders and discusses future directions, such as underlying biological mechanisms, reliable biomarkers associated with the host microbiota, and microbiota-targeted interventions, for research in this field.",Molecular psychiatry,2023,Kenji Hashimoto
37624502,The association between greenery type and gut microbiome in schizophrenia: did all greenspaces play the equivalent role?,"In recent years, attention has been focused on the benefit of greenspace on mental health, and it is suggested this link may vary with the type of greenspace. More and more studies have emphasized the influence of the gut microbiome on schizophrenia (SCZ). However, the effects of greenspaces on the gut microbiota in SCZ and the effect of different types of greenspaces on the gut microbiota remain unclear. We aim to examine if there were variations in the effects of various greenspace types on the gut microbiome in SCZ. Besides, we sink to explore important taxonomic compositions associated with different greenspace types. We recruited 243 objects with schizophrenia from Anhui Mental Health Center and collected fecal samples for 16Sr RNA gene sequencing. Three types of greenery coverage were calculated with different circular buffers (800, 1500, and 3000 m) corresponding to individual addresses. The association between greenspace and microbiome composition was analyzed with permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA). We conducted the linear regression to capture specific gut microbiome taxa associated with greenery coverage. Tree coverage was consistently associated with microbial composition in both 1500 m (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.007, P = 0.030) and 3000 m (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.007, P = 0.039). In contrast, there was no association with grass cover in any of the buffer zones. In the regression analysis, higher tree coverage was significantly correlated with the relative abundance of several taxa. Among them, tree coverage was positively associated with increased Bifidobacterium longum (β = 1.069, P = 0.004), which was the dominant composition in the gut microbiota. The relationship between greenspace and gut microbiome in SCZ differed by the type of greenspace. Besides, ""tree coverage"" may present a dominant effect on the important taxonomic composition. Our findings might provide instructive evidence for the design of urban greenspace to optimize health and well-being in SCZ as well as the whole people.",Environmental science and pollution research international,2023,Ning Wei; Shusi Wang; Xuanxuan Li; Rubing Pan; Weizhuo Yi; Jian Song; Li Liu; Jintao Liu; Jiajun Yuan; Rong Song; Jian Cheng; Hong Su
37343494,Gut microbes influence the development of central nervous system disorders through epigenetic inheritance.,"Central nervous system (CNS) disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and Alzheimer's disease (AD), affect quality of life of patients and pose significant economic and social burdens worldwide. Due to their obscure and complex pathogeneses, current therapies for these diseases have limited efficacy. Over the past decade, the gut microbiome has been shown to exhibit direct and indirect influences on the structure and function of the CNS, affecting multiple pathological pathways. In addition to the direct interactions between the gut microbiota and CNS, the gut microbiota and their metabolites can regulate epigenetic processes, including DNA methylation, histone modification, and regulation of non-coding RNAs. In this review, we discuss the tripartite relationship among gut microbiota, epigenetic inheritance, and CNS disorders. We suggest that gut microbes and their metabolites influence the pathogenesis of CNS disorders at the epigenetic level, which may inform the development of effective therapeutic strategies for CNS disorders.",Microbiological research,2023,Tianyou Liu; Dongru Du; Rui Zhao; Qinglian Xie; Zaiquan Dong
37150361,Gut microbiota maturity mediates the protective effect of siblings on food allergy.,"The mechanisms underlying the protective effect of older siblings on allergic disease remain unclear but may relate to the infant gut microbiota.We sought to investigate whether having older siblings decreases the risk of IgE-mediated food allergy by accelerating the maturation of the infant gut microbiota.In a birth cohort assembled using an unselected antenatal sampling frame (n = 1074), fecal samples were collected at 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year, and food allergy status at 1 year was determined by skin prick test and in-hospital food challenge. We used 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to derive amplicon sequence variants. Among a random subcohort (n = 323), microbiota-by-age z scores at each time point were calculated using fecal amplicon sequence variants to represent the gut microbiota maturation over the first year of life.A greater number of siblings was associated with a higher microbiota-by-age z score at age 1 year (β  = 0.15 per an additional sibling; 95% CI, 0.05-0.24; P = .003), which was in turn associated with decreased odds of food allergy (odds ratio, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.33-0.61; P < .001). Microbiota-by-age z scores mediated 63% of the protective effect of siblings. Analogous associations were not observed at younger ages.The protective effect of older siblings on the risk of developing IgE-mediated food allergy during infancy is substantially mediated by advanced maturation of the gut microbiota at age 1 year.",The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,2023,Yuan Gao; Jakob Stokholm; Martin O'Hely; Anne-Louise Ponsonby; Mimi L K Tang; Sarath Ranganathan; Richard Saffery; Leonard C Harrison; Fiona Collier; Lawrence Gray; David Burgner; John Molloy; Peter D Sly; Susanne Brix; Hanne Frøkiær; Peter Vuillermin; 
37088645,Understanding the impact of radical changes in diet and the gut microbiota on brain function and structure: rationale and design of the EMBRACE study.,"Bariatric surgery leads to profound changes in gut microbiota and dietary patterns, both of which may interact to impact gut-brain communication. Though cognitive function improves postsurgery, there is a large variability in outcomes. How bariatric surgery-induced modifications in the gut microbiota and dietary patterns influence the variability in cognitive function is still unclear.To elucidate the associations between bariatric surgery-induced changes in dietary and gut microbiota patterns with cognition and brain structure.University hospital.A total of 120 adult patients (≥30 years) scheduled to undergo a primary bariatric surgery along with 60 age-, sex-, and body mass index-matched patients on the surgery waitlist will undergo assessments 3-months presurgery and 6- and 12-month postsurgery (or an equivalent time for the waitlist group). Additionally, 60 age-and sex-matched nonbariatric surgery eligible individuals will complete the presurgical assessments only. Evaluations will include sociodemographic and health behavior questionnaires, physiological assessments (anthropometrics, blood-, urine-, and fecal-based measures), neuropsychological cognitive tests, and structural magnetic resonance imaging. Cluster analyses of the dietary and gut microbiota changes will define the various dietary patterns and microbiota profiles, then using repeated measures mixed models, their associations with global cognitive and structural brain alterations will be explored.The coordinating study site (Centre intégré universitaire de santé et de services sociaux du Nord-de-l'Île-de-Montréal, QC, Canada), provided the primary ethical approval (Research Ethics Board#: MP-32-2022-2412).The insights generated from this study can be used to develop individually-targeted neurodegenerative disease prevention strategies, as well as providing critical mechanistic information.",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,2023,Tair Ben-Porat; Angela Alberga; Marie-Claude Audet; Sylvie Belleville; Tamara R Cohen; Pierre Y Garneau; Kim L Lavoie; Patrick Marion; Samira Mellah; Radu Pescarus; Elham Rahme; Sylvia Santosa; Anne-Sophie Studer; Dajana Vuckovic; Robbie Woods; Reyhaneh Yousefi; Simon L Bacon; 
36943505,Ketogenic diet for mood disorders from animal models to clinical application.,"Mood disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD) are often resistant to current pharmacological treatment. Therefore, various alternative therapeutic approaches including diets are, therefore, under investigation. Ketogenic diet (KD) is effective for treatment-resistant epilepsy and metabolic diseases, however, only a few clinical studies suggest its beneficial effect also for mental disorders. Animal models are a useful tool to uncover the underlying mechanisms of therapeutic effects. Women have a twice-higher prevalence of mood disorders but very little is known about sex differences in nutritional psychiatry. In this review, we aim to summarize current knowledge of the sex-specific effects of KD in mood disorders. Ketone bodies improve mitochondrial functions and suppress oxidative stress, inducing neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects which are both beneficial for mental health. Limited data also suggest KD-induced improvement of monoaminergic circuits and hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis-the key pathophysiological pathways of mood disorders. Gut microbiome is an important mediator of the beneficial and detrimental effects of diet on brain functioning and mental health. Gut microbiota composition is affected in mood disorders but its role in the therapeutic effects of different diets, including KD, remains poorly understood. Still little is known about sex differences in the effects of KD on mental health as well as on metabolism and body weight. Some animal studies used both sexes but did not find differences in behavior, body weight loss or gut microbiota composition. More studies, both on a preclinical and clinical level, are needed to better understand sex-specific effects of KD on mental health.","Journal of neural transmission (Vienna, Austria : 1996)",2023,Ilya V Smolensky; Kilian Zajac-Bakri; Peter Gass; Dragos Inta
37686747,Influence of Food Type on Human Psychological-Behavioral Responses and Crime Reduction.,"The purpose of this narrative review is to emphasize the importance of food consumption and meal selection on mental health and brain function, including psychological and behavioral reactions such as mood, loving relationships, violence, and criminal activity. Additionally, by being aware of the link between food and mental health, the community can be encouraged to make informed food choices in order to avoid unfavorable outcomes like criminality. Food behaviors are shifting significantly over the world. There are also significant changes in mood, sadness, happiness, and violence, as well as the spread of the variety and severity of mental diseases that lead to violent acts. Food intake and meal selection have evolved over the last ten years as the variety and accessibility of food options have become easier and more diverse. These modifications might have both beneficial and bad consequences. This article examines the relationship between food intake and its impact on marital satisfaction. The goal of this review is to support or refute the claim that food influences mood, love, or criminal behavior, or vice versa. Various diets can have an impact on one's mental health and brain, influencing psychological reactions and behavioral responses such as mood, loving relationships, violence, and even criminal activity. Food insecurity has been demonstrated in various studies to have a negative impact on health and psychological well-being, leading to despair, loss of happiness, marital conflict, and violence. For example, herbal extracts and flavonoids have the potential to improve gut microbiota and treat mood disorders. Understanding how the gut-brain axis communicates might help guide interventions for mood and cognitive function. Since the root of most diseases and behaviors is significantly related to the type of food consumed, this research addresses this issue in order to reduce the cost of treatment and prevention of crime and delinquency at the community level by consciously choosing the food consumed by the society. In other words, prevention is always better than cure.",Nutrients,2023,Masoud Heidari; Yalda Khodadadi Jokar; Shirin Madani; Sharifeh Shahi; Mohammad Sharif Shahi; Mohammad Goli
37627638,Multi-Omics Approach Reveals Prebiotic and Potential Antioxidant Effects of Essential Oils from the Mediterranean Diet on Cardiometabolic Disorder Using Humanized Gnotobiotic Mice.,"Essential oils sourced from herbs commonly used in the Mediterranean diet have demonstrated advantageous attributes as nutraceuticals and prebiotics within a model of severe cardiometabolic disorder. The primary objective of this study was to assess the influences exerted by essential oils derived from thyme (<i>Thymus vulgaris</i>) and oregano (<i>Origanum vulgare</i>) via a comprehensive multi-omics approach within a gnotobiotic murine model featuring colonic microbiota acquired from patients diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD) and type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Our findings demonstrated prebiotic and potential antioxidant effects elicited by these essential oils. We observed a substantial increase in the relative abundance of the <i>Lactobacillus</i> genus in the gut microbiota, accompanied by higher levels of short-chain fatty acids and a reduction in trimethylamine N-oxide levels and protein oxidation in the plasma. Moreover, functional enrichment analysis of the cardiac tissue proteome unveiled an over-representation of pathways related to mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, and cardiac contraction. These findings provide compelling evidence of the prebiotic and antioxidant actions of thyme- and oregano-derived essential oils, which extend to cardiac function. These results encourage further investigation into the promising utility of essential oils derived from herbs commonly used in the Mediterranean diet as potential nutraceutical interventions for mitigating chronic diseases linked to CAD and T2DM.","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,María José Sánchez-Quintero; Josué Delgado; Laura Martín Chaves; Dina Medina-Vera; Mora Murri; Víctor M Becerra-Muñoz; Mario Estévez; María G Crespo-Leiro; Guillermo Paz López; Andrés González-Jiménez; Juan A G Ranea; María Isabel Queipo-Ortuño; Isaac Plaza-Andrades; Jorge Rodríguez-Capitán; Francisco Javier Pavón-Morón; Manuel F Jiménez-Navarro

37630649,Microbiota in Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Endometriosis: Birds of a Feather Flock Together-A Review.,"Endometriosis and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are chronic conditions affecting up to 10% of the global population, imposing significant burdens on healthcare systems and patient quality of life. Interestingly, around 20% of endometriosis patients also present with symptoms indicative of IBS. The pathogenesis of both these multifactorial conditions remains to be fully elucidated, but connections to gut microbiota are becoming more apparent. Emerging research underscores significant differences in the gut microbiota composition between healthy individuals and those suffering from either endometriosis or IBS. Intestinal dysbiosis appears pivotal in both conditions, exerting an influence via similar mechanisms. It impacts intestinal permeability, triggers inflammatory reactions, and initiates immune responses. Furthermore, it is entwined in a bidirectional relationship with the brain, as part of the gut-brain axis, whereby dysbiosis influences and is influenced by mental health and pain perception. Recent years have witnessed the development of microbiota-focused therapies, such as low FODMAP diets, prebiotics, probiotics, antibiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation, designed to tackle dysbiosis and relieve symptoms. While promising, these treatments present inconsistent data, highlighting the need for further research. This review explores the evidence of gut dysbiosis in IBS and endometriosis, underscoring the similar role of microbiota in both conditions.

Major depressive disorders seriously threaten mental health worldwide and may even lead to death. Chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depressive-like symptoms in mice are usually considered as the highest similarity to the situation in humans. Herein, we determined the potential functions of the flavonoid-enriched fraction from Seabuckthorn, which was named SBF, in treating major depressive disorder in mice. In the CUMS-induced mouse model, the intake of SBF reversed their depressive behaviors and relieved the CUMS-disturbed levels of neurotrophins, neurotransmitters, stress-related hormones, and inflammation-related cytokines. Additionally, the treatment of depressive mice with SBF showed ability to regulate the gut microbiota, especially in decreasing the abundance of <i>Lactobacillaceae</i>, while increasing the abundance of <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> at the family level. The results suggest the beneficial effects of Seabuckthorn flavonoids in functioning as a health food supplement to treat major depressive disorders.",Food & function,2023,Chen-Xi Xia; Alex Xiong Gao; Yue Zhu; Tina Ting-Xia Dong; Karl Wah-Keung Tsim

37400661,Isoalantolactone relieves depression-like behaviors in mice after chronic social defeat stress via the gut-brain axis.,"The management of depression continues to be challenging despite the variety of available antidepressants. Herbal medicines are used in many cultures but lack stringent testing to understand their efficacy and mechanism of action. Isoalantolactone (LAT) from Elecampane (Inula helenium) improved the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS)-induced anhedonia-like phenotype in mice comparable to fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).Compare the effects of LAT and fluoxetine on depression-like behaviors in mice exposed to CSDS.The CSDS-induced decrease in protein expression of postsynaptic density (PSD95), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and glutamate receptor subunit-1 (GluA1) in the prefrontal cortex was restored by LAT. LAT showed robust anti-inflammatory activity and can lessen the increase in IL-6 and TNF-α caused by CSDS. CSDS altered the gut microbiota at the taxonomic level, resulting in significant changes in α- and β-diversity. LAT treatment reestablished the bacterial abundance and diversity and increased the production of butyric acid in the gut that was inhibited by CSDS. The levels of butyric acid were negatively correlated with the abundance of Bacteroidetes, and positively correlated with those of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes across all treatment groups.The current data suggest that, similar to fluoxetine, LAT show antidepressant-like effects in mice exposed to CSDS through the modulation of the gut-brain axis.",Psychopharmacology,2023,Siming Wang; Qihan Cai; Lu Xu; Yanan Sun; Mengmeng Wang; Yu Wang; Lili Zhang; Keqing Li; Zhiyu Ni
37121952,Connecting the Gut Microbiota and Neurodegenerative Diseases: the Role of Bile Acids.,"With the acceleration of global population aging, neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) will become the second leading cause of death in the world, which seriously threatens human life and health. Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease are the most common and typical NDs. The exact mechanisms of the NDs occurrence and development remain unclear, which may be related to immune, oxidative stress, and abnormal aggregation of pathogenic proteins. Studies have suggested that gut microbiota (GM) influences brain function and plays an important role in regulating emotional and cognitive function. Recently, bile acids (BAs) have become the ""star molecule"" in the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis research. BAs have been reported to exert anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective activities in NDs. However, the role of BAs in the connection between GM and the central nervous system (CNS) is still unclear.

36801431,"Proton Pump Inhibitor Use, Fatigue, and Health-Related Quality of Life in Kidney Transplant Recipients: Results From the TransplantLines Biobank and Cohort Study.","Prior studies report that the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) can adversely affect gut microbiota and gastrointestinal uptake of micronutrients, in particular iron and magnesium, and are used frequently by kidney transplant recipients. Altered gut microbiota, iron deficiency, and magnesium deficiency have been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic fatigue. Therefore, we hypothesized that PPI use may be an important and underappreciated cause of fatigue and reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in this population.Cross-sectional study.Kidney transplant recipients (≥1 year after transplantation) enrolled in the TransplantLines Biobank and Cohort Study.PPI use, PPI type, PPI dosage, and duration of PPI use.Fatigue and HRQoL, assessed using the validated Checklist Individual Strength 20 Revised questionnaire and Short Form-36 questionnaire.Logistic and linear regression.We included 937 kidney transplant recipients (mean age 56±13 years, 39% female) at a median of 3 (1-10) years after transplantation. PPI use was associated with fatigue severity (regression coefficient 4.02, 95% CI, 2.18 to 5.85, P<0.001), a higher risk of severe fatigue (OR 2.05, 95% CI, 1.48 to 2.84, P<0.001), lower physical HRQoL (regression coefficient-8.54, 95% CI, -11.54 to-5.54, P<0.001), and lower mental HRQoL (regression coefficient-4.66, 95% CI, -7.15 to-2.17, P<0.001). These associations were independent of potential confounders including age, time since transplantation, history of upper gastrointestinal disease, antiplatelet therapy, and the total number of medications. They were present among all individually assessed PPI types and were dose dependent. Duration of PPI exposure was only associated with fatigue severity.Residual confounding and inability to assess causal relationships.PPI use is independently associated with fatigue and lower HRQoL among kidney transplant recipients. PPI use might be an easily accessible target for alleviating fatigue and improving HRQoL among kidney transplant recipients. Further studies examining the effect of PPI exposure in this population are warranted.In this observational study, we investigated the association of proton pump inhibitors with fatigue and health-related quality of life among kidney transplant recipients. Our data showed that proton pump inhibitors were independently associated with fatigue severity, severe fatigue, and lower physical and mental health-related quality of life. These associations were present among all individually assessed proton pump inhibitor types and were dose dependent.

37576972,Profiles and diagnostic value of intestinal microbiota in schizophrenia patients with metabolic syndrome.,"It is widely thought that the intestinal microbiota plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders. However, the gut microbiota composition and characteristics of schizophrenia patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS) have been largely understudied. Herein, we investigated the association between the metabolic status of mainland Chinese schizophrenia patients with MetS and the intestinal microbiome.Fecal microbiota communities from 115 male schizophrenia patients (57 with MetS and 58 without MetS) were assessed by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. We assessed the variations of gut microbiome between both groups and explored potential associations between intestinal microbiota and parameters of MetS. In addition, the Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) based on the KEGG database was used to predict the function of intestinal microbiota. We also conducted Decision Tree Analysis to develop a diagnostic model for the MetS in patients with schizophrenia based on the composition of intestinal microbiota.The fecal microbial diversity significantly differed between groups with or without MetS (α-diversity (Shannon index and Simpson index): p=0.0155, p=0.0089; β-diversity: p=0.001). Moreover, the microbial composition was significantly different between the two groups, involving five phyla and 38 genera (p<0.05). In addition, a significant correlation was observed between the metabolic-related parameters and abundance of altered microbiota including HDL-c (r2 = 0.203, p=0.0005), GLU (r2 = 0.286, p=0.0005) and WC (r2 = 0.061, p=0.037). Furthermore, KEGG pathway analysis showed that 16 signaling pathways were significantly enriched between the two groups (p<0.05). Importantly, our diagnostic model based on five microorganisms established by decision tree analysis could effectively distinguish between patients with and without MetS (AUC = 0.94).Our study established the compositional and functional characteristics of intestinal microbiota in schizophrenia patients with MetS. These new findings provide novel insights into a better understanding of this disease and provide the theoretical basis for implementing new interventional therapies in clinical practice.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2023,Mengjuan Xing; Hui Gao; Lili Yao; Li Wang; Chengfang Zhang; Liping Zhu; Donghong Cui
37498481,The Role of Gut Microbiota in Blood-Brain Barrier Disruption after Stroke.,"Growing evidence has proved that alterations in the gut microbiota have been linked to neurological disorders including stroke. Structural and functional disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is observed after stroke. In this context, there is pioneering evidence supporting that gut microbiota may be involved in the pathogenesis of stroke by regulating the BBB function. However, only a few experimental studies have been performed on stroke models to observe the BBB by altering the structure of gut microbiota, which warrant further exploration. Therefore, in order to provide a novel mechanism for stroke and highlight new insights into BBB modification as a stroke intervention, this review summarizes existing evidence of the relationship between gut microbiota and BBB integrity and discusses the mechanisms of gut microbiota on BBB dysfunction and its role in stroke.",Molecular neurobiology,2023,Meiqin Zeng; Meichang Peng; Jianhao Liang; Haitao Sun
37569349,Microbial Reprogramming in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorders: A Review of Gut-Brain Communication and Emerging Evidence.,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a debilitating mental health disorder characterized by intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors (compulsions). Dysbiosis, an imbalance in the gut microbial composition, has been associated with various health conditions, including mental health disorders, autism, and inflammatory diseases. While the exact mechanisms underlying OCD remain unclear, this review presents a growing body of evidence suggesting a potential link between dysbiosis and the multifaceted etiology of OCD, interacting with genetic, neurobiological, immunological, and environmental factors. This review highlights the emerging evidence implicating the gut microbiota in the pathophysiology of OCD and its potential as a target for novel therapeutic approaches. We propose a model that positions dysbiosis as the central unifying element in the neurochemical, immunological, genetic, and environmental factors leading to OCD. The potential and challenges of microbial reprogramming strategies, such as probiotics and fecal transplants in OCD therapeutics, are discussed. This review raises awareness of the importance of adopting a holistic approach that considers the interplay between the gut and the brain to develop interventions that account for the multifaceted nature of OCD and contribute to the advancement of more personalized approaches.",International journal of molecular sciences,2023,Ghizlane Bendriss; Ross MacDonald; Clare McVeigh
37513676,"The Role of Gut Microbiota in Anxiety, Depression, and Other Mental Disorders as Well as the Protective Effects of Dietary Components.","The number of individuals experiencing mental disorders (e.g., anxiety and depression) has significantly risen in recent years. Therefore, it is essential to seek prevention and treatment strategies for mental disorders. Several gut microbiota, especially Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, are demonstrated to affect mental health through microbiota-gut-brain axis, and the gut microbiota dysbiosis can be related to mental disorders, such as anxiety, depression, and other mental disorders. On the other hand, dietary components, including probiotics (e.g., <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Bifidobacterium</i>), prebiotics (e.g., dietary fiber and alpha-lactalbumin), synbiotics, postbiotics (e.g., short-chain fatty acids), dairy products, spices (e.g., <i>Zanthoxylum bungeanum</i>, curcumin, and capsaicin), fruits, vegetables, medicinal herbs, and so on, could exert protective effects against mental disorders by enhancing beneficial gut microbiota while suppressing harmful ones. In this paper, the mental disorder-associated gut microbiota are summarized. In addition, the protective effects of dietary components on mental health through targeting the gut microbiota are discussed. This paper can be helpful to develop some dietary natural products into pharmaceuticals and functional foods to prevent and treat mental disorders.",Nutrients,2023,Ruo-Gu Xiong; Jiahui Li; Jin Cheng; Dan-Dan Zhou; Si-Xia Wu; Si-Yu Huang; Adila Saimaiti; Zhi-Jun Yang; Ren-You Gan; Hua-Bin Li
37468912,Altered gut microbiota-host bile acid metabolism in IBS-D patients with liver depression and spleen deficiency pattern.,"Dysregulation of gut microbiota-host bile acid (BA) co-metabolism is a critical pathogenic factor of diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), instructed by pattern differentiation, is effective in treating IBS-D, in which liver depression and spleen deficiency (LDSD) is the most prevalent pattern. Still, it is unclear the linkage between the LDSD pattern and the BA metabolic phenotype.This study aimed to uncover the biological basis of the LDSD pattern from the BA metabolic perspective.Patients with IBS-D completed questionnaires regarding the irritable bowel severity scoring system (IBS-SSS), stool frequency, Stool Bristol scale, and Self-Rating Scales of mental health. Fasting blood and morning feces were collected to analyze the gut metagenome and BA-related indices/metabolites.IBS-D patients with LDSD had a higher incidence of BA overexcretion (41% vs. 23% non-LDSD) with significant elevations in fecal total BAs and serum BA precursor 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one levels. Compared to controls or non-LDSD patients, LDSD patients had a featured fecal BA profile, with higher proportions of deoxycholic acid (DCA), 7-ketodeoxycholic acid, and lithocholic acid. It is consistent with the BA-metabolizing genomic changes in the LDSD gut microbiota characterized by overabundances of 7-dehydroxylating bacteria and BA-inducible genes (baiCD/E/H). The score of bowel symptoms (stool frequency and abdominal pain) showing greater severity in the LDSD pattern were positively correlated with bai-expressing bacterial abundances and fecal DCA levels separately.We clarified a differed BA metabolic phenotype in IBS patients with LDSD, which closely correlates with the severity of bowel symptoms. It demonstrates that gut microbiota and host co-metabolism of BAs would provide crucial insight into the biology of the LDSD pattern and its internal relationship with IBS progression.",Chinese medicine,2023,Liqing Du; Zhaozhou Zhang; Lixiang Zhai; Shujun Xu; Wei Yang; Chunhua Huang; Chengyuan Lin; Linda L D Zhong; Zhaoxiang Bian; Ling Zhao
37502424,"Effects of human probiotics on memory and psychological and physical measures in community-dwelling older adults with normal and mildly impaired cognition: results of a bi-center, double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled clinical trial (CleverAge biota).","This study presents results of our randomized clinical trial studying the effect of human probiotics on memory and psychological and physical measures following our study protocol registered at clinicaltrials.gov NCT05051501 and described in detail in our previous paper.Community dwelling participants aged between 55 and 80  years were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of 10<sup>6</sup> colony-forming units of human <i>Streptococcus thermophilus</i> GH, <i>Streptococcus salivarius</i> GH NEXARS, Lactobacilus plantarum GH, and <i>Pediococcus pentosaceus</i> GH or placebo. A cross-over design allowed each group to receive probiotics and placebo for 3  months each in reverse order. A small subset of participants was examined online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. After 6  months a small number of volunteers were additionally assessed after 2  months without any intervention. Primary outcome measures included changes in cognitive functions assessed using brief tests and a neuropsychological battery and changes in mood assessed using validated questionnaires. Secondary outcome measures included changes in self-report and subjective measures using depression and anxiety questionnaires, seven visual analog scales of subjective feelings (memory, digestion, etc.), and physical performance.At baseline, the probiotic-placebo group A (<i>n</i> = 40, age 69 ± 7 years, education 16 ± 3 years, 63% females, body mass index 28.5 ± 6, subjective memory complaint in 43%) did not differ from the placebo-probiotic group B (<i>n</i> = 32) in any of the sociodemographic characteristics and evaluated measures including cognitive status. At follow-up visits after 3, 6, and 8  months, no cross-sectional differences in any of the measures were found between the groups except worse sentence recall of the ALBA test after 3  months of probiotic use. Score changes were not observed for all cognitive tests but one in any group between visits 1 and 3 and between visits 3 and 6. The only change was observed for the TMT B test after the first three months but no change was observed after the second three months.The treatment with human probiotics and prebiotics did not improve cognitive, affective, or physical measures in community-dwelling individuals with normal or mildly impaired cognitive functions.clinicaltrials.gov, identifier NCT05051501.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2023,Ales Bartos; Josefina Weinerova; Sofia Diondet
37485386,Prebiotics for depression: how does the gut microbiota play a role?,"Depression, a mood disorder characterized by persistent feelings of sadness and aversion to activity that can interfere with daily life, is a condition of great concern. Prebiotics, which are non-digestible substances selectively utilized by host microorganisms for health benefits, have gained attention for their potential to improve overall wellness and alleviate various disorders including depression. This study aims to review clinical trials utilizing carbohydrate-type prebiotics such as inulin-type fructans, galactooligosaccharides (GOS), human milk oligosaccharides, resistant starch, prebiotic phytochemicals including epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), chlorogenic acids, resveratrol, and prebiotic lipids (n-3 polysaturated fatty acids) to determine their effects on depression. Our findings suggest that GOS at a daily dosage of 5 g and eicosapentaenoic acid at or less than 1 g can effectively mitigate depressive symptoms. While EGCG exhibits potential antidepressant properties, a higher dosage of 3 g/d may be necessary to elicit significant effects. The plausible mechanisms underlying the impact of prebiotics on depression include the synthesis of neurotransmitters, production of short-chain fatty acids, and regulation of inflammation.",Frontiers in nutrition,2023,Yongde Yang; Bi Zhou; Sheng Zhang; Liang Si; Xiaobo Liu; Fu Li
37447374,Serotonin Transporter (SERT) Expression Modulates the Composition of the Western-Diet-Induced Microbiota in Aged Female Mice.,"<b>Background.</b> The serotonin transporter (SERT), highly expressed in the gut and brain, is implicated in metabolic processes. A genetic variant of the upstream regulatory region of the <i>SLC6A4</i> gene encoding SERT, the so-called short (s) allele, in comparison with the long (l) allele, results in the decreased function of this transporter, altered serotonergic regulation, an increased risk of psychiatric pathology and type-2 diabetes and obesity, especially in older women. Aged female mice with the complete (<i>Sert</i><sup>-/-</sup>: KO) or partial (<i>Sert</i><sup>+/-</sup>: HET) loss of SERT exhibit more pronounced negative effects following their exposure to a Western diet in comparison to wild-type (<i>Sert</i><sup>+/+</sup>: WT) animals. <b>Aims.</b> We hypothesized that these effects might be mediated by an altered gut microbiota, which has been shown to influence serotonin metabolism. We performed V4 16S rRNA sequencing of the gut microbiota in 12-month-old WT, KO and HET female mice that were housed on a control or Western diet for three weeks. <b>Results.</b> The relative abundance of 11 genera was increased, and the abundance of 6 genera was decreased in the Western-diet-housed mice compared to the controls. There were correlations between the abundance of <i>Streptococcus</i> and <i>Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014</i> and the expression of the pro-inflammatory marker Toll-like-Receptor 4 (<i>Tlr4</i>) in the dorsal raphe, as well as the expression of the mitochondrial activity marker perixome-proliferator-activated-receptor-cofactor-1b (<i>Ppargc1b</i>) in the prefrontal cortex. Although there was no significant impact of genotype on the microbiota in animals fed with the Control diet, there were significant interactions between diet and genotype. Following FDR correction, the Western diet increased the relative abundance of <i>Intestinimonas</i> and <i>Atopostipes</i> in the KO animals, which was not observed in the other groups. <i>Erysipelatoclostridium</i> abundance was increased by the Western diet in the WT group but not in HET or KO animals. <b>Conclusions.</b> The enhanced effects of a challenge with a Western diet in SERT-deficient mice include the altered representation of several gut genera, such as <i>Intestinimonas</i>, <i>Atopostipes</i> and <i>Erysipelatoclostridium</i>, which are also implicated in serotonergic and lipid metabolism. The manipulation of these genera may prove useful in individuals with the short SERT allele.",Nutrients,2023,Mirjam Bloemendaal; Ekaterina Veniaminova; Daniel C Anthony; Anna Gorlova; Priscilla Vlaming; Adel Khairetdinova; Raymond Cespuglio; Klaus Peter Lesch; Alejandro Arias Vasquez; Tatyana Strekalova
37469436,"Exopolysaccharide is the potential effector of <i>Lactobacillus fermentum</i> PS150, a hypnotic psychobiotic strain.","Psychobiotics are a class of probiotics that confer beneficial effects on the mental health of the host. We have previously reported hypnotic effects of a psychobiotic strain, <i>Lactobacillus fermentum</i> PS150 (PS150), which significantly shortens sleep latency in experimental mice, and effectively ameliorate sleep disturbances caused by either caffeine consumption or a novel environment. In the present study, we discovered a <i>L. fermentum</i> strain, GR1009, isolated from the same source of PS150, and found that GR1009 is phenotypically distinct but genetically similar to PS150. Compared with PS150, GR1009 have no significant hypnotic effects in the pentobarbital-induced sleep test in mice. In addition, we found that heat-killed PS150 exhibited hypnotic effects and altered the gut microbiota in a manner similar to live bacteria, suggesting that a heat-stable effector, such as exopolysaccharide (EPS), could be responsible for these effects. Our comparative genomics analysis also revealed distinct genetic characteristics in EPS biosynthesis between GR1009 and PS150. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy imaging showed a sheet-like EPS structure in PS150, while GR1009 displayed no apparent EPS structure. Using the phenol-sulfate assay, we found that the sugar content value of the crude extract containing EPS (C-EPS) from PS150 was approximately five times higher than that of GR1009, indicating that GR1009 has a lower EPS production activity than PS150. Through the pentobarbital-induced sleep test, we confirmed the hypnotic effects of the C-EPS isolated from PS150, as evidenced by a significant reduction in sleep latency and recovery time following oral administration in mice. In summary, we utilized a comparative approach to delineate differences between PS150 and GR1009 and proposed that EPS may serve as a key factor that mediates the observed hypnotic effect.",Frontiers in microbiology,2023,Chin-Lin Huang; Hsu-Feng Chu; Chien-Chen Wu; Fu-Sheng Deng; Pei-Jun Wen; Shao-Ping Chien; Chi-Hsein Chao; Ying-Tsong Chen; Mei-Kuang Lu; Ying-Chieh Tsai
37396336,Sex-specific effects of voluntary wheel running on behavior and the gut microbiota-immune-brain axis in mice.,"Physical exercise has been positioned as a promising strategy to prevent and/or alleviate anxiety and depression, but the biological processes associated with its effects on mental health have yet to be entirely determined. Although the prevalence of depression and anxiety in women is about twice that of men, very few studies have examined whether physical exercise could affect mental health differently according to sex. This study examined, in singly-housed mice, the sex-specific effects of voluntary exercise on depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors as well as on different markers along the gut microbiota-immune-brain axis. Male and female C57BL/6N mice had voluntary access to running wheels in their home-cages for 24 days or were left undisturbed in identical home-cages without running wheels. Behaviors were then examined in the open field, splash, elevated plus maze, and tail suspension tests. Gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, microglia activation-related genes, and tight junction proteins was determined in the jejunum and the hippocampus, while microbiota composition and predicted function were verified in cecum contents. Voluntary exercise reduced anxiety-like behaviors and altered grooming patterns in males exclusively. Although the exercise intervention resulted in changes to brain inflammatory activity and to cecal microbiota composition and inferred function in both sexes, reductions in the jejunal expression of pro-inflammatory markers were observed in females only. These findings support the view that voluntary exercise, even when performed during a short period, is beneficial for mental and intestinal health and that its sex-specific effects on behavior could be, at least in part, related to some components of the gut microbiota-immune-brain axis.","Brain, behavior, & immunity - health",2023,Zoë A P Williams; Joanna Kasia Szyszkowicz; Natasha Osborne; Bshaier Allehyany; Christophe Nadon; Maryann Chinonye Udechukwu; Ana Santos; Marie-Claude Audet
37209162,Bacillus licheniformis prevents and reduces anxiety-like and depression-like behaviours.,"As common mental disorders, depression and anxiety impact people all around the world. Recent studies have found that the gut microbiome plays an important role in mental health. It is becoming possible to treat mental disorders by regulating the composition of the gut microbiota. Bacillus licheniformis is a probiotic used to treat gut diseases through balancing the gut microbiome during lasting years. Considering the role of gut microbiota in the gut-brain axis, this study used chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model rats to explore whether Bacillus licheniformis can prevent and treat depression and anxiety. We found that B. licheniformis reduced the depressive-like and anxiety-like behaviours of the rats during the CUMS process. Meanwhile, B. licheniformis changed the gut microbiota composition; increased the short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the colon, decreased kynurenine, norepinephrine, and glutamate levels; and increased the tryptophan, dopamine, epinephrine, and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain. After correlation analysis, we found Parabacteroides, Anaerostipes, Ruminococcus-2, and Blautia showed significant correlation with neurotransmitters and SCFAs, indicating the gut microbiome plays an important role in B. licheniformis reducing depressive-like behaviours. Therefore, this study suggested B. licheniformis may prevent depressive-like and anxiety-like behaviours while regulating the gut microbiota composition and increasing the SCFA levels in the colon to alter the levels of the neurotransmitters in the brain. KEY POINTS: • B. licheniformis reduced depressive-like and anxiety-like behaviours induced by the chronic unpredictable mild stress. • GABA levels in the brain are assonated with B. licheniformis regulating depressive-like and anxiety-like behaviours. • Gut microbiota composition alteration followed by metabolic changes may play a role in the GABA levels increase.",Applied microbiology and biotechnology,2023,Siyuan Feng; Chen Meng; Yiyuan Liu; Yue Yi; Axin Liang; Yingyu Zhang; Zikai Hao
37016046,"Komagataella pastoris KM71H Mitigates Depressive-Like Phenotype, Preserving Intestinal Barrier Integrity and Modulating the Gut Microbiota in Mice.","The role of intestinal microbiota in the genesis of mental health has received considerable attention in recent years, given that probiotics are considered promising therapeutic agents against major depressive disorder. Komagataella pastoris KM71H is a yeast with probiotic properties and antidepressant-like effects in animal models of depression. Hence, we evaluated the antidepressant-like effects of K. pastoris KM71H in a model of antibiotic-induced intestinal dysbiosis in male Swiss mice. The mice received clindamycin (200 μg, intraperitoneal) and, after 24 h, were treated with K. pastoris KM71H at a dose of 8 log CFU/animal by intragastric administration (ig) or PBS (vehicle, ig) for 14 consecutive days. Afterward, the animals were subjected to behavioral tests and biochemical analyses. Our results showed that K. pastoris KM71H administration decreased the immobility time in the tail suspension test and increased grooming activity duration in the splash test in antibiotic-treated mice, thereby characterizing its antidepressant-like effect. We observed that these effects of K. pastoris KM71H were accompanied by the modulation of the intestinal microbiota, preservation of intestinal barrier integrity, and restoration of the mRNA levels of occludin, zonula occludens-1, zonula occludens-2, and toll-like receptor-4 in the small intestine, and interleukin-1β in the hippocampi of mice. Our findings provide solid evidence to support the development of K. pastoris KM71H as a new probiotic with antidepressant-like effects.",Molecular neurobiology,2023,Paloma T Birmann; Angela M Casaril; Ana Paula Pesarico; Rafael R Rodrigues; Fabricio R Conceição; Fernanda Severo Sabedra Sousa; Tiago Collares; Fabiana K Seixas; Lucielli Savegnago
37004759,Gut-derived bacterial LPS attenuates incubation of methamphetamine craving via modulating microglia.,"The microbiota-gut-brain axis plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders, and the compositions of gut microbiota are altered by addictive drugs. However, the role of gut microbiota in the incubation of methamphetamine (METH) craving remains poorly understood.16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed to assess the richness and diversity of gut microbiota in METH self-administration model. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed to evaluate the integrity of intestinal barrier. Immunofluorescence and three-dimensional reconstruction were performed to assess the morphologic changes of microglia. Serum levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were determined using the rat enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to assess transcript levels of dopamine receptor, glutamate ionotropic AMPA receptor 3 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor.METH self-administration induced gut microbiota dysbiosis, intestinal barrier damage and microglia activation in the nucleus accumbens core (NAcc), which was partially recovered after prolonged withdrawal. Microbiota depletion via antibiotic treatment increased LPS levels and induced a marked change in the microglial morphology in the NAcc, as indicated by the decreases in the lengths and numbers of microglial branches. Depleting the gut microbiota also prevented the incubation of METH craving and increased the population of Klebsiella oxytoca. Furthermore, Klebsiella oxytoca treatment or exogenous administration of the gram-negative bacterial cell wall component LPS increased serum and central LPS levels, induced microglial morphological changes and reduced the dopamine receptor transcription in the NAcc. Both treatments and NAcc microinjections of gut-derived bacterial LPS significantly decreased METH craving after prolonged withdrawal.These data suggest that LPS from gut gram-negative bacteria may enter circulating blood, activate microglia in the brain and consequently decrease METH craving after withdrawal, which may have important implications for novel strategies to prevent METH addiction and relapse.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2023,Zhoulong Yu; Wenjun Chen; Libo Zhang; Yun Chen; Wenxi Chen; Shiqiu Meng; Lin Lu; Ying Han; Jie Shi
36707651,Microbiota-gut-brain axis mechanisms in the complex network of bipolar disorders: potential clinical implications and translational opportunities.,"Bipolar disorders (BD) represent a severe leading disabling mental condition worldwide characterized by episodic and often progressive mood fluctuations with manic and depressive stages. The biological mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of BD remain incompletely understood, but it seems that there is a complex picture of genetic and environmental factors implicated. Nowadays, gut microbiota is in the spotlight of new research related to this kind of psychiatric disorder, as it can be consistently related to several pathophysiological events observed in BD. In the context of the so-called microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis, it is shown to have a strong influence on host neuromodulation and endocrine functions (i.e., controlling the synthesis of neurotransmitters like serotonin or mediating the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis), as well as in modulation of host immune responses, critically regulating intestinal, systemic and brain inflammation (neuroinflammation). The present review aims to elucidate pathophysiological mechanisms derived from the MGB axis disruption and possible therapeutic approaches mainly focusing on gut microbiota in the complex network of BD. Understanding the mechanisms of gut microbiota and its bidirectional communication with the immune and other systems can shed light on the discovery of new therapies for improving the clinical management of these patients. Besides, the effect of psychiatric drugs on gut microbiota currently used in BD patients, together with new therapeutical approaches targeting this ecosystem (dietary patterns, probiotics, prebiotics, and other novelties) will also be contemplated.",Molecular psychiatry,2023,Miguel A Ortega; Miguel Angel Álvarez-Mon; Cielo García-Montero; Óscar Fraile-Martínez; Jorge Monserrat; Lucia Martinez-Rozas; Roberto Rodríguez-Jiménez; Melchor Álvarez-Mon; Guillermo Lahera

Studies of gut microbiota effects on functional and behavioral effects of antidepressants in human and animal models were identified from PubMed up to December 2022. Risk of bias was assessed, and results are presented as a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines. A total of 28 (21 animal, 7 human) studies were included in the review. The reviewed papers converged on three themes: (1) Antidepressants can alter the composition and metabolites of gut microbiota, (2) gut microbiota can alter the bioavailability of certain antidepressants, and (3) gut microbiota may modulate the clinical or modeled mood modifying effects of antidepressants. The majority (n = 22) of studies had at least moderate levels of bias present. While strong evidence is still lacking to understand the clinical role of antidepressant PMx in human health, there is evidence for interactions among antidepressants, microbiota changes, microbiota metabolite changes, and behavior. Well-controlled studies of the mediating and moderating effects of baseline and treatment-emergent changes in microbiota on therapeutic and adverse responses to antidepressants are needed to better establish a potential role of PMx in personalizing antidepressant treatment selection and response prediction.",Journal of personalized medicine,2023,Lisa C Brown; William V Bobo; Cory A Gall; Daniel J Müller; Chad A Bousman

However, available data directly linking GM to HTN based on sex differences are limited.This study investigated the GM characteristics in HTN subjects in Northwestern China, and evaluate the associations of GM with blood pressure levels based on sex differences. A total of 87 HTN subjects and 45 controls were recruited with demographic and clinical characteristics documented. Fecal samples were collected for 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metagenomic sequencing.GM diversity was observed higher in females compared to males, and principal coordinate analysis showed an obvious segregation of females and males. Four predominant phyla of fecal GM included Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. LEfSe analysis indicated that phylum unidentified_Bacteria was enriched in HTN females, while Leuconostocaceae, Weissella and Weissella_cibaria were enriched in control females (P < 0.05). Functionally, ROC analysis revealed that Cellular Processes (0.796, 95% CI 0.620 ~ 0.916), Human Diseases (0.773, 95% CI 0.595 ~ 0.900), Signal transduction (0.806, 95% CI 0.631 ~ 0.922) and Two-component system (0.806, 95% CI 0.631 ~ 0.922) could differentiate HTN females as effective functional classifiers, which were also positively correlated with systolic blood pressure levels.This work provides evidence of fecal GM characteristics in HTN females and males in a northwestern Chinese population, further supporting the notion that GM dysbiosis may participate in the pathogenesis of HTN, and the role of sex differences should be considered.

The composition of gut microbiota and metabolites in the brain and blood from control (no stress) rats, LH resilient rats, and LH susceptible rats were examined.At the genus level, the relative abundances of Asaccharobacter, Eisenbergiella, and Klebsiella in LH susceptible rats were significantly higher than that of LH resilient rats. At the species level, the relative abundances of several microbiome were significantly altered between LH susceptible rats and LH resilient rats. Furthermore, there were several metabolites in the brain and blood altered between LH susceptible rats and LH resilient rats. A network analysis showed correlations between the abundance of several microbiome and metabolites in the brain (or blood).Detailed roles of microbiome and metabolites are unclear.These findings suggest that abnormal compositions of the gut microbiota and metabolites might contribute to susceptibility versus resilience in rats subjected to inescapable electric foot shock.",Journal of affective disorders,2023,Xingming Wang; Akifumi Eguchi; Yuko Fujita; Xiayun Wan; Lijia Chang; Yong Yang; Jiajing Shan; Youge Qu; Li Ma; Yukihiko Shirayama; Chisato Mori; Jianjun Yang; Kenji Hashimoto

The alterations that occur in the spinal cord have not only local but also systemic consequences and virtually all organs and tissues of the body incur important changes after SCI, explaining the progression and detrimental consequences related to this condition. Psychoneuroimmunoendocrinology (PNIE) is a growing area of research aiming to integrate and explore the interactions among the different systems that compose the human organism, considering the mind and the body as a whole. The initial traumatic event and the consequent neurological disruption trigger immune, endocrine, and multisystem dysfunction, which in turn affect the patient's psyche and well-being. In the present review, we will explore the most important local and systemic consequences of SCI from a PNIE perspective, defining the changes occurring in each system and how all these mechanisms are interconnected.

37377497,Insights into the potential benefits of triphala polyphenols toward the promotion of resilience against stress-induced depression and cognitive impairment.,"In response to environmental challenges, stress is a common reaction, but dysregulation of the stress response can lead to neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression and cognitive impairment. Particularly, there is ample evidence that overexposure to mental stress can have lasting detrimental consequences for psychological health, cognitive function, and ultimately well-being. In fact, some individuals are resilient to the same stressor. A major benefit of enhancing stress resilience in at-risk groups is that it may help prevent the onset of stress-induced mental health problems. A potential therapeutic strategy for maintaining a healthy life is to address stress-induced health problems with botanicals or dietary supplements such as polyphenols. Triphala, also known as Zhe Busong decoction in Tibetan, is a well-recognized <i>Ayurvedic</i> polyherbal medicine comprising dried fruits from three different plant species. As a promising food-sourced phytotherapy, triphala polyphenols have been used throughout history to treat a variety of medical conditions, including brain health maintenance. Nevertheless, a comprehensive review is still lacking. Here, the primary objective of this review article is to provide an overview of the classification, safety, and pharmacokinetics of triphala polyphenols, as well as recommendations for the development of triphala polyphenols as a novel therapeutic strategy for promoting resilience in susceptible individuals. Additionally, we summarize recent advances demonstrating that triphala polyphenols are beneficial to cognitive and psychological resilience by regulating 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) receptors, gut microbiota, and antioxidant-related signaling pathways. Overall, scientific exploration of triphala polyphenols is warranted to understand their therapeutic efficacy. In addition to providing novel insights into the mechanisms of triphala polyphenols for promoting stress resilience, blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability and systemic bioavailability of triphala polyphenols also need to be improved by the research community. Moreover, well-designed clinical trials are needed to increase the scientific validity of triphala polyphenols' beneficial effects for preventing and treating cognitive impairment and psychological dysfunction.",Current research in food science,2023,Wenjun Wang; Olufola Oladoyin Ige; Yi Ding; Mengshan He; Pan Long; Shaohui Wang; Yi Zhang; Xudong Wen
37156128,Comparison of gut microbiome profile in patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls - A plausible non-invasive biomarker?,"The human gut microbiome regulates brain function through the microbiome-gut-brain axis and is implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the relationship between the gut microbiome and the pathogenesis of schizophrenia (SCZ) is poorly defined, and very few studies have examined the effect of antipsychotic treatment response. We aim to study the differences in the gut microbiota among drug-naïve (DN SCZ) and risperidone-treated SCZ patients (RISP SCZ), compared to healthy controls (HCs). We recruited a total of 60 participants, from the clinical services of a large neuropsychiatric hospital, which included DN SCZ, RISP SCZ and HCs (n = 20 each). Fecal samples were analyzed using 16s rRNA sequencing in this cross-sectional study. No significant differences were found in taxa richness (alpha diversity) but microbial composition differed between SCZ patients (both DN and RISP) and HCs (PERMANOVA, p = 0.02). Linear Discriminant Analysis Effect Size (LEfSe) and Random Forest model identified the top six genera, which significantly differed in abundance between the study groups. A specific genus-level microbial panel of Ruminococcus, UCG005, Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 and Bifidobacterium could discriminate SCZ patients from HCs with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.79, HCs vs DN SCZ (AUC: 0.68), HCs vs RISP SCZ (AUC: 0.93) and DN SCZ vs RISP SCZ (AUC: 0.87). Our study identified distinct microbial signatures that could aid in the differentiation of DN SCZ, RISP SCZ, and HCs. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the role of the gut microbiome in SCZ pathophysiology and suggest potential targeted interventions.",Journal of psychiatric research,2023,Kuppan Gokulakrishnan; Joyappa Nikhil; Biju Viswanath; Chinnasamy Thirumoorthy; Sandhya Narasimhan; Bharanidharan Devarajan; Ebin Joseph; Arul Kevin Daniel David; Sapna Sharma; Kavitha Vasudevan; Vanteemar S Sreeraj; Bharath Holla; Venkataram Shivakumar; Monojit Debnath; Ganesan Venkatasubramanian; Shivarama Varambally
37127945,A systematic review on gut-brain axis aberrations in bipolar disorder and methods of balancing the gut microbiota.,"Bipolar disorder (BD) is a mood disorder that affects millions worldwide. Up to half of the diagnosed patients are reported to not receive adequate treatment. This study aims to assess the relationship between the gut-brain axis and BD and to discuss and compare the efficacy of varying methods of balancing gut microbiotas in BD.Using PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar from November 2021 to February 2022, we found 5310 studies on gut microbiota and its relation to BD. Using our inclusion criteria, 5283 studies were excluded. A total of 27 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. Also, 12 articles that met our criteria and eligibility criteria reported on 613 BD patients.Most studies analyzed found an overall difference in gut microbiota composition in bipolar patients compared to healthy controls, though the alterations found were not consistent. Differences in Lactobacillus, Faecalibacterium, and Ruminococcus abundance in BD compared to controls were found to be the most consistent across a few of the studies, but their effects on the gut-brain axis conflicted. Probiotic supplementation was found to lower patient rehospitalizations and significantly improve depressive symptoms and cognitive impairments among patients with BD.Multiple studies included in this review point toward a possible link between BD and the gut microbiota. Probiotic supplements and other gut-balancing therapies could serve as effective adjunctive methods for the treatment of BD. Notable limitations of the studies included for analysis were small sample sizes and majority observational study designs. Furthermore, the microbiota aberrations found in patients with BD were not consistent across multiple studies. Despite these limitations, our findings demonstrate the need for further research regarding the relationship between aberrant gut microbiota profiles and BD, as well as the effectiveness of gut balancing methods as adjunctive treatments.",Brain and behavior,2023,Crystal Obi-Azuike; Ruona Ebiai; Taneil Gibson; Ariana Hernandez; Asma Khan; Gibson Anugwom; Alexsandra Urhi; Sakshi Prasad; Sara Ait Souabni; Funso Oladunjoye
37062706,The Leap of Inulin Fructans from Food Industry to Medical Application.,"As a dietary supplement, the efficacy of prebiotics has become a hot issue in recent years. Inulin is one of internationally recognized prebiotics and belongs to a group of non-digestible and fermentable carbohydrates. Currently, the food industry is increasingly using prebiotic inulin as a health-promoting substrate, not just as food supplement. In addition, inulin has also shown great promise in the treatment of various diseases. This article reviews the application of inulin in the food industry and summarizes physiological function of inulin. Through the review and prospect of the research on obesity, diabetes and mental illness, it provides the theoretical basis for the joint development of inulin in food industry and medical application.",Chemistry & biodiversity,2023,Xuemei Zhou; Shixu Wang; Chongchong Xu; Jiaolin Li; Hongyan Liu; Lin He; Shurong Zhong; Kuan Li
36990371,"Outrunning a bad diet: Interactions between exercise and a Western-style diet for adolescent mental health, metabolism and microbes.","Adolescence is a period of biological, psychological and social changes, and the peak time for the emergence of mental health problems. During this life stage, brain plasticity including hippocampal neurogenesis is increased, which is crucial for cognitive functions and regulation of emotional responses. The hippocampus is especially susceptible to environmental and lifestyle influences, mediated by changes in physiological systems, resulting in enhanced brain plasticity but also an elevated risk for developing mental health problems. Indeed, adolescence is accompanied by increased activation of the maturing hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, sensitivity to metabolic changes due to increased nutritional needs and hormonal changes, and gut microbiota maturation. Importantly, dietary habits and levels of physical activity significantly impact these systems. In this review, the interactions between exercise and Western-style diets, which are high in fat and sugar, on adolescent stress susceptibility, metabolism and the gut microbiota are explored. We provide an overview of current knowledge on implications of these interactions for hippocampal function and adolescent mental health, and speculate on potential mechanisms which require further investigation.",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,2023,Minke H C Nota; Sarah Nicolas; Olivia F O'Leary; Yvonne M Nolan
36871911,The effect of exercise on suicidal ideation and behaviors: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Although exercise may positively impact those with mental or other medical illnesses, there is a lack of understanding on how it influences suicidal ideation or risk.We conducted a PRISMA 2020-compliant systematic review searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, and PsycINFO from inception to June 21, 2022. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating exercise and suicidal ideation in subjects with mental or physical conditions were included. Random-effects meta-analysis was conducted. The primary outcome was suicidal ideation. We assessed bias of studies with risk of bias 2 tool.We identified 17 RCTs encompassing 1021 participants. Depression was the most included condition (71 %, k = 12). Mean follow up was 10.0 weeks (SD = 5.2). Post-intervention suicidal ideation (SMD = -1.09, CI -3.08-0.90, p = 0.20, k = 5) was not significantly different between exercise and control groups. Suicide attempts were significantly reduced in participants randomized to exercise interventions as compared to inactive controls (OR = 0.23, CI 0.09-0.67, p = 0.04, k = 2). Fourteen studies (82 %) were at high risk of bias.This meta-analysis is limited by few, underpowered and heterogenous studies.Overall, our meta-analysis did not find a significant decrease in suicidal ideation or mortality between exercise and control groups. However, exercise did significantly decrease suicide attempts. Results should be considered preliminary, and more and larger studies assessing suicidality in RCTs testing exercise are needed.",Journal of affective disorders,2023,Nicholas Fabiano; Arnav Gupta; Jess G Fiedorowicz; Joseph Firth; Brendon Stubbs; Davy Vancampfort; Felipe B Schuch; Lucas J Carr; Marco Solmi
36650644,Sex difference in prebiotics on gut and blood-brain barrier dysfunction underlying stress-induced anxiety and depression.,"Most of the previous studies have demonstrated the potential antidepressive and anxiolytic role of prebiotic supplement in male subjects, yet few have females enrolled. Herein, we explored whether prebiotics administration during chronic stress prevented depression-like and anxiety-like behavior in a sex-specific manner and the mechanism of behavioral differences caused by sex.Female and male C57 BL/J mice on normal diet were supplemented with or without a combination of fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) and galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) during 3- and 4-week chronic restraint stress (CRS) treatment, respectively. C57 BL/J mice on normal diet without CRS were used as controls. Behavior consequences, gut microbiota, dysfunction of gut and brain-blood barriers, and inflammatory profiles were measured.In the 3rd week, FOS + GOS administration attenuated stress-induced anxiety-like behavior in female, but not in male mice, and the anxiolytic effects in males were observed until the 4th week. However, protective effects of prebiotics on CRS-induced depression were not observed. Changes in the gene expression of tight junction proteins in the distal colon and hippocampus, and decreased number of colon goblet cells following CRS were restored by prebiotics only in females. In both female and male mice, prebiotics alleviated stress-induced BBB dysfunction and elevation in pro-inflammatory cytokines levels, and modulated gut microbiota caused by stress. Furthermore, correlation analysis revealed that anxiety-like behaviors were significantly correlated with levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and gene expression of tight junction proteins in the hippocampus of female mice, and the abundance of specific gut microbes was also correlated with anxiety-like behaviors, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and gene expression of tight junction proteins in the hippocampus of female mice.Female mice were more vulnerable to stress and prebiotics than males. The gut microbiota, gut and blood-brain barrier, and inflammatory response may mediate the protective effects of prebiotics on anxiety-like behaviors in female mice.",CNS neuroscience & therapeutics,2023,Jiajun Jiang; Yaoyang Fu; Anying Tang; Xingle Gao; Danhua Zhang; Yuting Shen; Tingting Mou; Shaohua Hu; Jingfang Gao; Jianbo Lai
36601680,When the microbiome helps the brain-current evidence.,"The gut microbiota-brain axis has been recognized as a network of connections that provides communication between the gut microflora and both central and autonomic nervous system. The gut microbiota alteration has been targeted for therapy in various neurodegenerative and psychiatric disbalances. Psychobiotics are probiotics that contribute beneficially to the brain function and the host mental health as a result of an interaction with the commensal gut bacteria, although their mechanism of action has not been completely revealed. In this state-of-art review, the findings about the potential therapeutic effects of the psychobiotics alone or in combination with conventional medicine in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, as well as in some psychiatric diseases like depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, have been summarized. The evidence of the psychobiotics therapeutic outcomes obtained in preclinical and clinical trials have been given respectively for the observed neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders.",CNS neuroscience & therapeutics,2023,Jovana Drljača; Nataša Milošević; Maja Milanović; Ludovico Abenavoli; Nataša Milić
36550632,Oxymatrine ameliorates white matter injury by modulating gut microbiota after intracerebral hemorrhage in mice.,"White matter injury (WMI) significantly affects neurobehavioral recovery in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) patients. Gut dysbiosis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders. Oxymatrine (OMT) has therapeutic effects on inflammation-mediated diseases. Whether OMT exerts therapeutic effects on WMI after ICH and the role of gut microbiota involved in this process is largely unknown.Neurological deficits, WMI, gut microbial composition, intestinal barrier function, and systemic inflammation were investigated after ICH. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) was performed to elucidate the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of ICH.OMT promoted long-term neurological function recovery and ameliorated WMI in the peri-hematoma region and distal corticospinal tract (CST) region after ICH. ICH induced significant and persistent gut dysbiosis, which was obviously regulated by OMT. In addition, OMT alleviated intestinal barrier dysfunction and systemic inflammation. Correlation analysis revealed that gut microbiota alteration was significantly correlated with inflammation, intestinal barrier permeability, and neurological deficits after ICH. Moreover, OMT-induced gut microbiota alteration could confer protection against neurological deficits and intestinal barrier disruption.Our study demonstrates that OMT ameliorates ICH-induced WMI and neurological deficits by modulating gut microbiota.",CNS neuroscience & therapeutics,2023,Jing Li; Jianhao Liang; Meiqin Zeng; Kaijian Sun; Yunhao Luo; Huaping Zheng; Feng Li; Wen Yuan; Hongwei Zhou; Junshan Liu; Haitao Sun
37371676,Using the Microbiome as a Regenerative Medicine Strategy for Autoimmune Diseases.,"Autoimmune (AI) diseases, which present in a multitude of systemic manifestations, have been connected to many underlying factors. These factors include the environment, genetics, individual microbiomes, and diet. An individual's gut microbiota is an integral aspect of human functioning, as it is intimately integrated into the metabolic, mechanical, immunological, and neurologic pathways of the body. The microbiota dynamically changes throughout our lifetimes and is individually unique. While the gut microbiome is ever-adaptive, gut dysbiosis can exert a significant influence on physical and mental health. Gut dysbiosis is a common factor in various AI, and diets with elevated fat and sugar content have been linked to gut microbiome alterations, contributing to increased systemic inflammation. Additionally, multiple AI's have increased levels of certain inflammatory markers such as TNF-a, IL-6, and IL-17 that have been shown to contribute to arthropathy and are also linked to increased levels of gut dysbiosis. While chronic inflammation has been shown to affect many physiologic systems, this review explores the connection between gut microbiota, bone metabolism, and the skeletal and joint destruction associated with various AI, including psoriatic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, irritable bowel disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. This review aims to define the mechanisms of microbiome crosstalk between the cells of bone and cartilage, as well as to investigate the potential bidirectional connections between AI, bony and cartilaginous tissue, and the gut microbiome. By doing this, the review also introduces the concept of altering an individual's specific gut microbiota as a form of regenerative medicine and potential tailored therapy for joint destruction seen in AI. We hope to show multiple, specific ways to target the microbiome through diet changes, rebalancing microbial diversity, or decreasing specific microbes associated with increased gut permeability, leading to reduced systemic inflammation contributing to joint pathology. Additionally, we plan to show that diet alterations can promote beneficial changes in the gut microbiota, supporting the body's own endogenous processes to decrease inflammation and increase healing. This concept of microbial alteration falls under the definition of regenerative medicine and should be included accordingly. By implementing microbial alterations in regenerative medicine, this current study could lend increasing support to the current research on the associations of the gut microbiota, bone metabolism, and AI-related musculoskeletal pathology.",Biomedicines,2023,Kaitlin L Williams; Ryan Enslow; Shreyas Suresh; Camille Beaton; Mitchell Hodge; Amanda E Brooks
37304433,Altered gut microbiota profile in patients with perimenopausal panic disorder.,"Females in the perimenopausal period are susceptible to mood disorders. Perimenopausal panic disorder (PPD) is characterized by repeated and unpredictable panic attacks during perimenopause, and it impacts the patient's physical and mental health and social function. Pharmacotherapy is limited in the clinic, and its pathological mechanism is unclear. Recent studies have demonstrated that gut microbiota is strongly linked to emotion; however, the relation between PPD and microbiota is limitedly known.This study aimed to discover specific microbiota in PPD patients and the intrinsic connection between them. Gut microbiota was analyzed in PPD patients (<i>n</i> = 40) and healthy controls (<i>n</i> = 40) by 16S rRNA sequencing.The results showed reduced α-diversity (richness) in the gut microbiota of PPD patients. β-diversity indicated that PPD and healthy controls had different intestinal microbiota compositions. At the genus level, 30 species of microbiota abundance had significantly different between the PPD and healthy controls. In addition, HAMA, PDSS, and PASS scales were collected in two groups. It was found that Bacteroides and Alistipes were positively correlated with PASS, PDSS, and HAMA.Bacteroides and Alistipes dysbiosis dominate imbalanced microbiota in PPD patients. This microbial alteration may be a potential pathogenesis and physio-pathological feature of PPD. The distinct gut microbiota can be a potential diagnostic marker and a new therapeutic target for PPD.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2023,Shen Lin; Hongjin Wang; Jingjing Qiu; Minghong Li; Ebin Gao; Xiaofeng Wu; Yunxiang Xu; Guizhen Chen
37218177,Impact of probiotic on anxiety and depression symptoms in pregnant and lactating women and microbiota of infants: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Probiotics are non-invasive therapies composed of live bacteria and yeast. Administration of prebiotics improved the health status of pregnant and lactating women, as well as newborns. This review aimed to appraise the evidence concerning the effectiveness of probiotics on the mental health of pregnant women, lactating mother and the microbiota of the newborn.This systematic review and meta-analysis ascertained quantitative studies published in Medline (PubMed), Clinical Key, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Cochrane Library, and Google scholar. Two authors independently screened and extracted the data from the primary studies that analysed the efficacy of probiotics on the mental health of pregnant and lactating women and the microbiota of the newborn. We adopted Cochrane Collaboration guidelines and reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement. The qualities of included trials were assessed by Cochrane collaboration's risk of bias tool (ROB-2).Sixteen trials comprised 946 pregnant women, 524 were lactating mothers, and 1678 were infants. The sample size of primary studies ranged from 36 to 433. Probiotics were administered as interventions, using either a single strain of Bifidobacterium or Lactobacillus or a double-strain combination of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. Probiotics supplementation reduced anxiety in pregnant (n = 676, standardised mean difference (SMD) = 0.01; 95% confidence interval (CI) = -0.28,0.30, P = 0.04, I<sup>2</sup> = 70) and lactating women (n = 514, SMD = -0.17; 95% CI = -1.62,1.27, P = 0.98, I<sup>2</sup> = 0). Similarly, probiotics decreased depression in pregnant (n = 298, SMD = 0.05; 95% CI = -0.24,0.35, P = 0.20, I<sup>2</sup> = 40) and lactating women (n = 518, SMD = -0.10; 95% CI = -1.29,-1.05, P = 0.11, I<sup>2</sup> = 60%). Similarly, probiotics supplementation improved the gut microbiota and reduced the duration of crying, abdominal distension, abdominal colic and diarrhoea.Non-invasive probiotic therapies are more useful to pregnant and lactating women and newborns.The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022372126).",Journal of global health,2023,Kurvatteppa Halemani; Asha P Shetty; Latha Thimmappa; Alwin Issac; Sanjay Dhiraaj; K Radha; Prabhaker Mishra; Edlin Glane Mathias
37193253,Anxiety Disorders and Gut Dysbiosis in Primary Sjögren's Syndrome-Mediated Dry Eye Patients.,"Primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS), a disease that is associated with a high prevalence of psychological disorders, has become increasingly important. Interactions between the gut microbiota and ocular conditions have been identified in pSS. As mental intervention is frequently needed, this study aims to investigate the relationship between anxiety disorders and the gut microbiome in patients with pSS-mediated dry eye.Demographics and self-administered questionnaires were obtained. Faecal samples were evaluated using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing.The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-A) cut-off point of ≥ 8 points showed a sensitivity and specificity of 76.5% and 80.0%, respectively. In all participants, we found that the prevalence of anxiety disorder was 30.4%. Dry eye discomfort could promote an anxious state, and conversely, anxiety could threaten tear film and increase the risk of pSS activity. There was a certain correlation between anxiety disorder and gut dysbiosis. Prevotella was associated with dry eye severity (<i>p</i> <0.001). Bacteroidetes (<i>p</i> =0.046) and Odoribacter (<i>p</i> =0.001) were correlated with pSS activity.There is a bidirectional relationship between anxiety disorder and the gut microbiota in pSS-mediated dry eye. Alterations in certain classes of gut microbiota are associated with pSS activity and dry eye severity. Main gut microbiota alterations that have a facilitating impact on anxiety are emerging in pSS-mediated dry eye. Future studies are needed to explore specific therapeutic targets for improving mental health in pSS-mediated dry eye by microbiota intervention.",International journal of general medicine,2023,Yiting Zhang; Meiqi Gan; Yuqin He; Tingting Liu; Mei Xu
37233680,Positive Effects of Probiotic Therapy in Patients with Post-Infectious Fatigue.,"Post-infectious fatigue is a common complication that can lead to decreased physical efficiency, depression, and impaired quality of life. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota has been proposed as a contributing factor, as the gut-brain axis plays an important role in regulating physical and mental health. This pilot study aimed to investigate the severity of fatigue and depression, as well as the quality of life of 70 patients with post-infectious fatigue who received a multi-strain probiotic preparation or placebo in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients completed questionnaires to assess their fatigue (fatigue severity scale (FSS)), mood (Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II)), and quality of life (short form-36 (SF-36)) at baseline and after 3 and 6 months of treatment. Routine laboratory parameters were also assessed, including immune-mediated changes in tryptophan and phenylalanine metabolism. The intervention was effective in improving fatigue, mood, and quality of life in both the probiotic and placebo groups, with greater improvements seen in the probiotic group. FSS and BDI-II scores declined significantly under treatment with both probiotics and placebo, but patients who received probiotics had significantly lower FSS (<i>p</i> < 0.001) and BDI-II (<i>p</i> < 0.001) scores after 6 months. Quality of life scores improved significantly in patients who received probiotics (<i>p</i> < 0.001), while patients taking a placebo only saw improvements in the ""Physical limitation"" and ""Energy/Fatigue"" subcategories. After 6 months neopterin was higher in patients receiving placebo, while no longitudinal changes in interferon-gamma mediated biochemical pathways were observed. These findings suggest that probiotics may be a promising intervention for improving the health of patients with post-infectious fatigue, potentially through modulating the gut-brain axis.",Metabolites,2023,Katharina Obermoser; Natascha Brigo; Andrea Schroll; Pablo Monfort-Lanzas; Johanna M Gostner; Sabine Engl; Simon Geisler; Miriam Knoll; Harald Schennach; Günter Weiss; Dietmar Fuchs; Rosa Bellmann-Weiler; Katharina Kurz
37232729,The Effect of Probiotic Supplementation on the Gut-Brain Axis in Psychiatric Patients.,"The pathophysiology of several psychiatric diseases may entail disturbances in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and metabolic pathways. Variations in how these effects present themselves may be connected to individual variances in clinical symptoms and treatment responses, such as the observation that a significant fraction of participants do not respond to current antipsychotic drugs. A bidirectional signaling pathway between the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract is known as the microbiota-gut-brain axis. The large and small intestines contain more than 100 trillion microbial cells, contributing to the intestinal ecosystem's incredible complexity. Interactions between the microbiota and intestinal epithelium can alter brain physiology and affect mood and behavior. There has recently been a focus on how these relationships impact mental health. According to evidence, intestinal microbiota may play a role in neurological and mental illnesses. Intestinal metabolites of microbial origin, such as short-chain fatty acids, tryptophan metabolites, and bacterial components that might stimulate the host's immune system, are mentioned in this review. We aim to shed some on the growing role of gut microbiota in inducing/manipulating several psychiatric disorders, which may pave the way for novel microbiota-based therapies.",Current issues in molecular biology,2023,Hussein Sabit; Areej Kassab; Donia Alaa; Shaza Mohamed; Shaimaa Abdel-Ghany; Mohamed Mansy; Osama A Said; Mona A Khalifa; Halah Hafiz; Asmaa M Abushady
37213508,Global research trends and focus on the link between colorectal cancer and gut flora: a bibliometric analysis from 2001 to 2021.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a highly prevalent cancer, and the global healthcare system bears a significant burden due to its incidence. Modulating the gut microbiota is a promising approach to enhance the efficacy of CRC treatment and reduce its adverse effects. The causal relationship between specific microorganisms' presence and CRC development has been widely validated. However, few studies have investigated this relationship using bibliometric methods. Therefore, this study analyzed the research hotspots and trends in human gut microbiology and CRC over the last two decades from a bibliometric perspective. The study aims to provide novel insights into basic and clinical research in this field.The articles and reviews on gut microbiota in CRC were obtained from the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC) on November 2, 2022. CiteSpace and VOSviewer were used to conduct the bibliometric and knowledge-map analysis.A total of 2,707 publications were obtained, with a rapid increase in the number of publications since 2015. The United States and China are the main contributors in this field and have established a network of partnerships in several countries. 414 academic journals have published articles on this topic. The author with the highest number of publications is Jun Yu from the Chinese University of Hong Kong. In addition to ""intestinal flora"" and ""colorectal cancer,"" high frequency terms in the keyword co-occurrence network analysis included inflammatory bowel disease, <i>Fusobacterium nucleatum</i>, inflammation, long-chain fatty acids, ulcerative colitis, bile acids, and resistant starch. Analysis of keyword trends using burst testing revealed that biomarkers, abnormal crypt foci, bifidobacteria, β-glucuronidase, short-chain fatty acids, bile acids, and DNA methylation are at the forefront of research in this area.The findings of this study provide a bibliometric analysis and visualization of the key research areas in gut microbiota and CRC over the past 20 years. The results suggest that the role of gut microbiota in CRC and its underlying mechanisms should be closely monitored, particularly in the areas of biomarkers, metabolic pathways, and DNA methylation, which may emerge as hot topics in this field.",Frontiers in microbiology,2023,Yonglong Chang; Qinling Ou; Xuhui Zhou; Jinhui Liu; Sifang Zhang
36462169,Elevated Systemic Levels of Markers Reflecting Intestinal Barrier Dysfunction and Inflammasome Activation Are Correlated in Severe Mental Illness.,"Gut microbiota alterations have been reported in severe mental illness (SMI) but fewer studies have probed for signs of gut barrier disruption and inflammation. We hypothesized that gut leakage of microbial products due to intestinal inflammation could contribute to systemic inflammasome activation in SMI.We measured plasma levels of the chemokine CCL25 and soluble mucosal vascular addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (sMAdCAM-1) as markers of T cell homing, adhesion and inflammation in the gut, lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) and intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) as markers of bacterial translocation and gut barrier dysfunction, in a large SMI cohort (n = 567) including schizophrenia (SCZ, n = 389) and affective disorder (AFF, n = 178), relative to healthy controls (HC, n = 418). We assessed associations with plasma IL-18 and IL-18BPa and leukocyte mRNA expression of NLRP3 and NLRC4 as markers of inflammasome activation.Our main findings were: (1) higher levels of sMAdCAM-1 (P = .002), I-FABP (P = 7.6E-11), CCL25 (P = 9.6E-05) and LBP (P = 2.6E-04) in SMI compared to HC in age, sex, BMI, CRP and freezer storage time adjusted analysis; (2) the highest levels of sMAdCAM-1 and CCL25 (both P = 2.6E-04) were observed in SCZ and I-FABP (P = 2.5E-10) and LBP (3) in AFF; and (3), I-FABP correlated with IL-18BPa levels and LBP correlated with NLRC4.Our findings support that intestinal barrier inflammation and dysfunction in SMI could contribute to systemic inflammation through inflammasome activation.",Schizophrenia bulletin,2023,Søren B Jensen; Mashhood A Sheikh; Ibrahim A Akkouh; Attila Szabo; Kevin S O'Connell; Tove Lekva; John A Engh; Ingrid Agartz; Torbjørn Elvsåshagen; Monica B E G Ormerod; Melissa A Weibell; Erik Johnsen; Rune A Kroken; Ingrid Melle; Ole K Drange; Terje Nærland; Arne E Vaaler; Lars T Westlye; Pål Aukrust; Srdjan Djurovic; Nils Eiel Steen; Ole A Andreassen; Thor Ueland
37228982,Gut-brain axis: altered microbiome and depression - review.,"The concept of a 'gut-brain axis' was recently developed when the complex communications between the brain and the gut became evident. The interaction may affect emotions, motivation, mood, and higher cognitive functions as well as gut homeostasis. Human microbe symbiosis's merits are now acknowledged to transcend human mental health. Research has recently indicated that the gut-brain axis plays a vital role in brain health maintenance. The term 'gut-brain axis' can only partially capture the intricacy of these interactions. Dysbiosis of the gut commensals has been seen in patients with psychiatric diseases, such as depression. Major depressive disorder is caused by complicated interactions between the individual gene and the environment. In a forced swimming test, P. Zheng <i>et al.</i> discovered that germ-free mice with no gut microbiota had a shorter immobility duration than healthy mice. More radical effects were expressed on the use of probiotics rather than prebiotics and postbiotics in reducing the symptoms of depression in patients with major depressive disorder. One of prime importance can be given to exploring more microbiota to investigate the better therapeutic effects of probiotics, prebiotics, and postbiotics.",Annals of medicine and surgery (2012),2023,Anmol Mohan; Swathi Godugu; Saumya S Joshi; Kenisha B Shah; Srija C Vanka; Hania Shakil; Dhanush P; Swathi Veliginti; Prajwal S Sure; Jyothsna Goranti
37069399,The gut microbiota contributes to the pathogenesis of anorexia nervosa in humans and mice.,"Anorexia nervosa (AN) is an eating disorder with a high mortality. About 95% of cases are women and it has a population prevalence of about 1%, but evidence-based treatment is lacking. The pathogenesis of AN probably involves genetics and various environmental factors, and an altered gut microbiota has been observed in individuals with AN using amplicon sequencing and relatively small cohorts. Here we investigated whether a disrupted gut microbiota contributes to AN pathogenesis. Shotgun metagenomics and metabolomics were performed on faecal and serum samples, respectively, from a cohort of 77 females with AN and 70 healthy females. Multiple bacterial taxa (for example, Clostridium species) were altered in AN and correlated with estimates of eating behaviour and mental health. The gut virome was also altered in AN including a reduction in viral-bacterial interactions. Bacterial functional modules associated with the degradation of neurotransmitters were enriched in AN and various structural variants in bacteria were linked to metabolic features of AN. Serum metabolomics revealed an increase in metabolites associated with reduced food intake (for example, indole-3-propionic acid). Causal inference analyses implied that serum bacterial metabolites are potentially mediating the impact of an altered gut microbiota on AN behaviour. Further, we performed faecal microbiota transplantation from AN cases to germ-free mice under energy-restricted feeding to mirror AN eating behaviour. We found that the reduced weight gain and induced hypothalamic and adipose tissue gene expression were related to aberrant energy metabolism and eating behaviour. Our 'omics' and mechanistic studies imply that a disruptive gut microbiome may contribute to AN pathogenesis.",Nature microbiology,2023,Yong Fan; René Klinkby Støving; Samar Berreira Ibraim; Tuulia Hyötyläinen; Florence Thirion; Tulika Arora; Liwei Lyu; Evelina Stankevic; Tue Haldor Hansen; Pierre Déchelotte; Tim Sinioja; Oddny Ragnarsdottir; Nicolas Pons; Nathalie Galleron; Benoît Quinquis; Florence Levenez; Hugo Roume; Gwen Falony; Sara Vieira-Silva; Jeroen Raes; Loa Clausen; Gry Kjaersdam Telléus; Fredrik Bäckhed; Matej Oresic; S Dusko Ehrlich; Oluf Pedersen
37023596,Different roles of microbiota and genetics in the prediction of treatment response in major depressive disorder.,"The roles of gut microbiota and susceptibility genes in patients with major depression disorder (MDD) are not well understood. Examining the microbiome and host genetics might be helpful for clinical decision-making. Patients with MDD were recruited in this study and subsequently treated for eight weeks. We identified the differences between the population with a response after two weeks and those with a response after eight weeks. The factors that were significantly correlated with efficacy were used to predict the treatment response. The differences in the importance of microbiota and genetics in prediction were analyzed. Our study identified rs58010457 as a potentially key locus affecting the treatment effect. Different microbiota and enriched pathways might play different roles in the response after two and eight weeks. We found that the area under the curve (AUC) value was greater than 0.8 for both random forest models. The contribution of different components to the AUC was evaluated by removing genetic information, microbiota abundance, and pathway data. The gut microbiome was an important predictor of the response after eight weeks, while genetics was an important predictor of the response after two weeks. These results suggested a dynamic effect of interaction among genetics and gut microbes on treatment. Furthermore, these results provide new guidance for clinical decisions: in cases of inadequate treatment effects after two weeks, the composition of the intestinal flora can be improved by diet therapy, which could ultimately affect the efficacy.",Journal of psychiatric research,2023,Ke Han; Lei Ji; Qinglian Xie; Liangjie Liu; Xi Wu; Lin He; Yi Shi; Rong Zhang; Guang He; Zaiquan Dong; Tao Yu
36881113,Mesenchymal stem-cell-derived microvesicles ameliorate MPTP-induced neurotoxicity in mice: a role of the gut-microbiota-brain axis.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Increasing evidence suggests the role of the gut-microbiota-brain axis in the pathogenesis of PD. Mesenchymal stem-cell-derived microvesicles (MSC-MVs) have emerged as a therapeutic potential for neurological disorders over the last years.The objective of this study was to investigate whether MSC-MVs could improve PD-like neurotoxicity in mice after administration of MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine).MPTP-induced reductions in the dopamine transporter and tyrosine hydroxylase expressions in the striatum and substantia nigra (SNr) were attenuated after a subsequent single administration of MSC-MVs. Increases in the phosphorylated α-synuclein (p-α-Syn)/α-Syn ratio in the striatum, SNr, and colon after MPTP injection were also attenuated after MSC-MVs injection. Furthermore, MSC-MVs restored MPTP-induced abnormalities of the gut microbiota composition. Interestingly, positive correlations between the genus Dubosiella and the p-α-Syn/α-Syn ratio were observed in the brain and colon, suggesting their roles in the gut-microbiota-brain communication. Moreover, MSC-MVs attenuated MPTP-induced reduction of the metabolite, 3,6-dihydroxy-2-[3-methoxy-4-(sulfooxy)phenyl]-7-(sulfinooxy)-3,4-dihydro-2H-1-benzopyran-5-olate, in the blood. Interestingly, a negative correlation between this compound and the p-α-Syn/α-Syn ratio was observed in the brain and colon.These data suggest that MSC-MVs could ameliorate MPTP-induced neurotoxicity in the brain and colon via the gut-microbiota-brain axis. Therefore, MSC-MVs would have a new therapeutic potential for neurological disorders such as PD.",Psychopharmacology,2023,Yaoyu Pu; Qiuhong Wu; Qiuping Zhang; Tianwen Huang; Ji Wen; Long Wei; Kenji Hashimoto; Yi Liu
36804535,Beneficial effects of arketamine on the reduced bone mineral density in susceptible mice after chronic social defeat stress: Role of the gut-microbiota-bone-brain axis.,"Patients with depression exhibit reduced bone mineral density (BMD). We previously reported that the new antidepressant arketamine improved the reduced BMD seen in chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) susceptible mice and ovariectomized mice. Considering the role of the gut microbiota in maintaining bone health, the current study investigated whether the gut microbiota, along with metabolites derived from the microbiome, play a role in the beneficial actions of arketamine with respect to the anhedonia-like behavior and reduced BMD seen in CSDS susceptible mice. A single administration of arketamine (10 mg/kg) ameliorated anhedonia-like behavior and decreased femoral neck cortical (and total) BMD in CSDS susceptible mice. There was a negative correlation between anhedonia-like behavior and BMD. Furthermore, significant differences in the abundance of microbiota (and plasma metabolites) were found between the CSDS + saline and CSDS + arketamine groups. Correlations were observed between the abundance of certain microbiota (and plasma metabolites) and cortical (and total) BMD. These data suggest that, in addition to its anti-anhedonia effect, arketamine might ameliorate the reduced cortical (and total) BMD seen in CSDS susceptible mice through the gut-microbiota-bone-brain axis. Therefore, arketamine could serve as a drug therapy for depressed patients with low BMD.

37181872,Autism spectrum disorder research: knowledge mapping of progress and focus between 2011 and 2022.,"In recent years, a large number of studies have focused on autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The present study used bibliometric analysis to describe the state of ASD research over the past decade and identify its trends and research fronts.Studies on ASD published from 2011 to 2022 were obtained from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC). Bibliometrix, CiteSpace, and VOSviewer were used for bibliometric analysis.A total of 57,108 studies were included in the systematic search, and articles were published in more than 6,000 journals. The number of publications increased by 181.7% (2,623 in 2011 and 7,390 in 2021). The articles in the field of genetics are widely cited in immunology, clinical research, and psychological research. Keywords co-occurrence analysis revealed that ""causative mechanisms,"" ""clinical features,"" and ""intervention features"" were the three main clusters of ASD research. Over the past decade, genetic variants associated with ASD have gained increasing attention, and immune dysbiosis and gut microbiota are the new development frontiers after 2015.This study uses a bibliometric approach to visualize and quantitatively describe autism research over the last decade. Neuroscience, genetics, brain imaging studies, and gut microbiome studies improve our understanding of autism. In addition, the microbe-gut-brain axis may be an exciting research direction for ASD in the future. Therefore, through visual analysis of autism literature, this paper shows the development process, research hotspots, and cutting-edge trends in this field to provide theoretical reference for the development of autism in the future.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2023,Miaomiao Jiang; Tianlan Lu; Kang Yang; Xianjing Li; Liyang Zhao; Dai Zhang; Jun Li; Lifang Wang
37174495,"Gut Microbiota and Behavioural Issues in Production, Performance, and Companion Animals: A Systematic Review.","The literature has identified poor nutrition as the leading factor in the manifestation of many behavioural issues in animals, including aggression, hyperalertness, and stereotypies. Literature focused on all species of interest consistently reported that although there were no significant differences in the richness of specific bacterial taxa in the microbiota of individual subjects with abnormal behaviour (termed alpha diversity), there was variability in species diversity between these subjects compared to controls (termed beta diversity). As seen in humans with mental disorders, animals exhibiting abnormal behaviour often have an enrichment of pro-inflammatory and lactic acid-producing bacteria and a reduction in butyrate-producing bacteria. It is evident from the literature that an association exists between gut microbiota diversity (and by extension, the concurrent production of microbial metabolites) and abnormal behavioural phenotypes across various species, including pigs, dogs, and horses. Similar microbiota population changes are also evident in human mental health patients. However, there are insufficient data to identify this association as a cause or effect. This review provides testable hypotheses for future research to establish causal relationships between gut microbiota and behavioural issues in animals, offering promising potential for the development of novel therapeutic and/or preventative interventions aimed at restoring a healthy gut-brain-immune axis to mitigate behavioural issues and, in turn, improve health, performance, and production in animals.",Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,2023,Bonnie Homer; Jackson Judd; Manijeh Mohammadi Dehcheshmeh; Esmaeil Ebrahimie; Darren J Trott
37168424,Features of gut microbiota and short-chain fatty acids in patients with first-episode depression and their relationship with the clinical symptoms.,"To compare the differences in gut microbiota and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs; metabolites of gut microbiota) in the serum of patients with first-episode depression and the healthy population and to analyze the relationship between gut microbiota and metabolite SCFAs and the clinical symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD).A total of 45 patients with first-episode depression and 22 healthy volunteers were chosen to complete relevant scale evaluations, and feces samples and venous blood samples were collected. The 16S RNA method was used to analyze the intestinal microflora and the characteristics of serum SCFAs detection by ELISA kit, as well as the intestinal flora, SCFAs content and their correlation with MDD clinical indicators.The abundance of <i>Akkermansia</i>, <i>Megamonas</i>, <i>Prevotellaceae NK3B31 group</i>, and butyrate-producing bacteria, <i>Lachnospira</i>, <i>Subdoligranulum</i>, <i>Blautia</i>, and <i>Dialister</i>, and acetate-producing bacteria, <i>Streptococcus</i>, in the gut microbiota of the MDD group was lower than that in the control (C) group. The abundance of <i>Parasutterella</i> in the MDD group was higher than that in the C group. <i>Dialister</i> negatively correlated with all measured clinical symptoms (<i>r</i> < 0, <i>P</i> < 0.05). The serum SCFA content in the MDD group was higher than that in the C group, and the content positively correlated with the Hamilton anxiety scale scores (<i>r</i> = 0.584, <i>P</i> < 0.05).The results demonstrated that the MDD group differed from the C group in terms of gut microbiota and SCFAs in the serum and that the change in certain intestinal bacteria might participate in the pathogenic mechanism of MDD.",Frontiers in psychology,2023,Shuhan Yu; Lan Wang; Xinyang Jing; Yujing Wang; Cuixia An
37095530,"Positive mood-related gut microbiota in a long-term closed environment: a multiomics study based on the ""Lunar Palace 365"" experiment.","Psychological health risk is one of the most severe and complex risks in manned deep-space exploration and long-term closed environments. Recently, with the in-depth research of the microbiota-gut-brain axis, gut microbiota has been considered a new approach to maintain and improve psychological health. However, the correlation between gut microbiota and psychological changes inside long-term closed environments is still poorly understood. Herein, we used the ""Lunar Palace 365"" mission, a 1-year-long isolation study in the Lunar Palace 1 (a closed manned Bioregenerative Life Support System facility with excellent performance), to investigate the correlation between gut microbiota and psychological changes, in order to find some new potential psychobiotics to maintain and improve the psychological health of crew members.We report some altered gut microbiota that were associated with psychological changes in the long-term closed environment. Four potential psychobiotics (Bacteroides uniformis, Roseburia inulinivorans, Eubacterium rectale, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii) were identified. On the basis of metagenomic, metaproteomic, and metabolomic analyses, the four potential psychobiotics improved mood mainly through three pathways related to nervous system functions: first, by fermenting dietary fibers, they may produce short-chain fatty acids, such as butyric and propionic acids; second, they may regulate amino acid metabolism pathways of aspartic acid, glutamic acid, tryptophan, etc. (e.g., converting glutamic acid to gamma-aminobutyric acid; converting tryptophan to serotonin, kynurenic acid, or tryptamine); and third, they may regulate other pathways, such as taurine and cortisol metabolism. Furthermore, the results of animal experiments confirmed the positive regulatory effect and mechanism of these potential psychobiotics on mood.These observations reveal that gut microbiota contributed to a robust effect on the maintenance and improvement of mental health in a long-term closed environment. Our findings represent a key step towards a better understanding the role of the gut microbiome in mammalian mental health during space flight and provide a basis for future efforts to develop microbiota-based countermeasures that mitigate risks to crew mental health during future long-term human space expeditions on the moon or Mars. This study also provides an essential reference for future applications of psychobiotics to neuropsychiatric treatments.

37432210,"The Influence of Topinambur and Inulin Preventive Supplementation on Microbiota, Anxious Behavior, Cognitive Functions and Neurogenesis in Mice Exposed to the Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress.","Daily living and functioning under stress can lead to mental health problems such as anxiety or depression. Over the past decades, a number of studies have been conducted to determine the relationship between the central nervous system (CNS), intestinal flora and bidirectional communication along the gut brain axis (GBA) in the maintaining of homeostasis. One of the most important factors regulating GBA functioning in exposure to stress may be a proper diet enriched in the supplementation with pre-, pro-and synbiotics. In the present study, we examined whether a 10-week oral preventive supplementation with natural prebiotics: topinambur powder (TPB) and chicory root inulin (INU) influenced an anxiety, depressive behavior and cognition in mice exposed to the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). Additionally, a fluoxetine (FLU) has been used as a reference antidepressive drug. Furthermore, we assessed the effect of TPB, INU and FLU administration on neurogenesis in mice exposed to CUMS and finally analyzed fecal microbiota for possible changes after TPB and INU supplementation in CUMS induced mice. Results obtained from the behavioral studies (elevated plaze maze, forced swim and Morris water maze test) indicated, that 10 week supplementation with TPB (250 mg/kg) and INU (66 mg/kg), similarly to FLU (12 mg/kg), significantly mitigated an anxiety and stress as well as protected learning and memory functions in the CUMS induced mice compared to the control stressed group. Additionally, TPB and INU CUMS mice showed significantly higher level of neurogenesis in comparison to control CUMS group. Interestingly, results obtained from the fecal microbiota analysis showed a beneficial effect of TPB and INU supplementation against CUMS-induced intestinal dysbiosis in mice. In conclusion, the obtained results showed that a long-term, preventive supplementation with TPB or INU alleviates the negative effects such as anxiety, cognitive disorders or dysbiosis in mice exposed to chronic unpredictable stress.",Nutrients,2023,Joanna Szala-Rycaj; Aleksandra Szewczyk; Mirosław Zagaja; Agnieszka Kaczmarczyk-Ziemba; Maciej Maj; Marta Andres-Mach
37108739,Circadian Disruption and Mental Health: The Chronotherapeutic Potential of Microbiome-Based and Dietary Strategies.,"Mental illness is alarmingly on the rise, and circadian disruptions linked to a modern lifestyle may largely explain this trend. Impaired circadian rhythms are associated with mental disorders. The evening chronotype, which is linked to circadian misalignment, is a risk factor for severe psychiatric symptoms and psychiatric metabolic comorbidities. Resynchronization of circadian rhythms commonly improves psychiatric symptoms. Furthermore, evidence indicates that preventing circadian misalignment may help reduce the risk of psychiatric disorders and the impact of neuro-immuno-metabolic disturbances in psychiatry. The gut microbiota exhibits diurnal rhythmicity, as largely governed by meal timing, which regulates the host's circadian rhythms. Temporal circadian regulation of feeding has emerged as a promising chronotherapeutic strategy to prevent and/or help with the treatment of mental illnesses, largely through the modulation of gut microbiota. Here, we provide an overview of the link between circadian disruption and mental illness. We summarize the connection between gut microbiota and circadian rhythms, supporting the idea that gut microbiota modulation may aid in preventing circadian misalignment and in the resynchronization of disrupted circadian rhythms. We describe diurnal microbiome rhythmicity and its related factors, highlighting the role of meal timing. Lastly, we emphasize the necessity and rationale for further research to develop effective and safe microbiome and dietary strategies based on chrononutrition to combat mental illness.",International journal of molecular sciences,2023,Pilar Codoñer-Franch; Marie Gombert; José Martínez-Raga; María Carmen Cenit
36738999,High-cholesterol diet promotes depression- and anxiety-like behaviors in mice by impact gut microbe and neuroinflammation.,"Neuropsychiatric disorders, including anxiety and depression, are one of the most common mental illnesses worldwide. A growing body of evidence shows that there is a complex relationship between dietary patterns and mental health. In our study, C57BL/6J mice were divided into three groups: control diet group (CON, 10 % kcal fat), high-cholesterol diet model group (HCD, 42.0 % kcal fat + 1.25 % kcal Cholesterol), and chronic restraint stress group (CRS, 10 % kcal fat) which as a positive control group for the depression model. Six weeks later, depressive- and anxiety-like behavior were evaluated for using the OFT, SPT and TST. Glucose intolerance and liver fat were detected by IGTT and liver lipid kit. The expression of peripheral and central inflammation was detected by LEGEND plex kits. 5-HT (also named 5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) and related receptors expression were monitored by ELISA, RT-PCR and Western blot. Meantime, gut microbe of stool samples was performed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Similar to CRS model, short-term HCD intervention induced anxiety and depression-like behavior behavioral abnormalities in mice. HCD consumption resulted in significantly increased body weight, liver fat (LDL-C, TC, TG), peripheral inflammation (IL-1β, MCP-1, IL-17A) and neuroinflammation (MCP-1). The concentration of 5-HT increased in the hippocampus, meanwhile, the expression of 5-HT receptor HTR2A was distinct in different regions of the brain tissue. More importantly, we found that compared with the CON diet, HCD induced the decrease of intestinal flora diversity, especially the decrease the relative abundance of Akkermansia_muciniphila, which was statistically significant. Further, Pearson correlation analysis showed that Akkermansia_muciniphila was significantly negatively correlated with the concentration of MCP-1, IL-17A in serum and 5-HT in hippocampus. Therefore, we speculated that the disorder of neuroinflammation induced by HCD consumption promotes depression- and anxiety-like behaviors in mice through the gut microbe.",Journal of affective disorders,2023,Lili Zou; Yaling Tian; Yuanfei Wang; Dongliang Chen; Xiaomin Lu; Ze Zeng; Zumin Chen; Chenli Lin; Yinji Liang
37046334,"Effects of prebiotic supplement on gut microbiota, drug bioavailability, and adverse effects in patients with colorectal cancer at different primary tumor locations receiving chemotherapy: study protocol for a randomized clinical trial.","The prevalence of colorectal cancer (CRC) worldwide is a huge challenge to human health. Primary tumor locations found to impact prognosis and response to therapy. The important role of gut microbiota in the progression and treatment of CRC has led to many attempts of alleviating chemotherapy-induced adverse effects using microecologics. However, the underlying mechanism of the difference in the prognosis of different primary tumor locations and the synergistic effect of prebiotics on chemotherapy need to be further elucidated. This study aims to explore the differences in tumor microbiota and examine the effectiveness of xylooligosaccharides (XOS) on gut microbiota, adverse effects, and bioavailability of chemotherapy drugs in CRC patients at different primary tumor locations.This is a double-blinded, randomized, parallel controlled clinical trial. Participants with left-sided CRC (LSCRC, n = 50) and right-sided CC (RSCC, n = 50) will randomly allocated to prebiotic group (n = 25) or control group (n = 25) and will receive either a daily XOS (3 g/day) or placebo, respectively, for 12 weeks. The primary outcomes will be the differences in the mucosa microbiota composition at different tumor locations and differences in gut microbiota composition, adverse effects, and blood concentration of capecitabine posttreatment. The secondary outcomes will include other blood indicators, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) concentration, quality of life, and mental health.This study will reveal the potential benefits of prebiotic for improving the gut microbiota composition, alleviating the adverse effects, and improving the efficacy of chemotherapy in patients with CRC. In addition, this study will provide data on the different distribution of tumor microbiota and the different changes of gut microbiota during treatment in LSCRC and RSCC, which may provide novel insights into personalized cancer treatment strategies based on primary tumor locations and gut microbiota in the future.Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ( www.chictr.org.cn ): ChiCTR2100046237.

37049619,Characteristics of the Gut Microbiome and Serum Metabolome in Patients with Functional Constipation.,"Functional constipation (FC) is a gastrointestinal disorder with high incidence, and it seriously affects patients' physical and mental health. Several studies have shown that the gut microbiome is associated with FC, but these studies have produced inconsistent findings, with few reflecting the relationship between the gut microbiome and metabolites. This study used 16S rRNA microbial genomics and non-target metabolome based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to analyze the gut microbiota composition and serum metabolic profiles of 30 FC patients and 28 healthy individuals. We found that patients with FC and healthy individuals have different gut microbiota structures and serum metabolic profiles. FC patients had more Bacteroides and butyrate-producing bacteria (Roseburia, Faecaliberium, Butyriccoccus). The upstream products of host arginine biosynthesis (2-oxoglutaric acid, <i>L</i>-glutamic acid, <i>N</i>-acetylornithine, and <i>L</i>-ornithine) were significantly reduced in FC patients' serum metabolites. In summary, our study describes the gut microbiome and serum metabolome of patients with functional constipation. It reveals that functional constipation may be associated with increased Bacteroidetes and downregulation of upstream products of host arginine biosynthesis, which may be potential markers for diagnosing functional constipation.",Nutrients,2023,Jialiang Wang; Linlin Wang; Qiangqing Yu; Nan Tang; Chunxia Mei; Hao Zhang; Gang Wang; Jian Lu; Wei Chen

However, gut microbiota changes in major depressive disorder (MDD) patients and their association with disease mechanisms remain undefined. Fifty MDD patients and sixty healthy controls were recruited from the Shanghai Healthy Mental Center, China. Fecal samples were collected, and the compositional characteristics of the intestinal flora were determined in MDD patients by MiSeq sequencing. Venous blood was collected for the detection of plasma indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (Ido), kynurenine (Kyn) and tryptophan (Trp) levels. Stool samples of bacterial 16S sequencing was carried out. A total of 2,705,809 optimized sequences were obtained, with an average of 54,116 per sample. More unique OTUs were observed at the family, genus and species levels in the control group compared with the MDD cases. Further analysis showed significant changes in the α- and β-diversities and relative abundance levels of gut microbial entities in MDD patients, as well as elevated amounts of Ido and Kyn indicating Kyn pathway activation, KEGG bacterial 16S function prediction analysis shows a variety of amino acids and metabolic (including Ido, Trp and Kyn) changes in the body of patients with MDD. These may result in increased neurotoxic metabolites and reduced generation of serotonin in the disease process. These changed factors may potentially be utilized as biomarkers for MDD in the future, playing more important roles in the disease course.",Nutrients,2023,Ping Lin; Dan Li; Yun Shi; Qingtian Li; Xiaokui Guo; Ke Dong; Qing Chen; Xiaoyan Lou; Zhenhua Li; Ping Li; Weifeng Jin; Shuzi Chen; Yang Sun; Jing Sun; Xunjia Cheng
37124355,Alteration of Gut Microbiome in Patients With Schizophrenia Indicates Links Between Bacterial Tyrosine Biosynthesis and Cognitive Dysfunction.,"Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a heterogeneous neuropsychiatric disorder for which current treatment has insufficient efficacy and severe adverse effects. The modifiable gut microbiome might be a potential target for intervention to improve neurobiological functions through the gut-microbiome-brain axis.In this case-control study, gut microbiota of 132 patients with SCZ and increased waist circumference were compared with gut microbiota of two age- and sex-matched control groups, composed of 132 healthy individuals and 132 individuals with metabolic syndrome. Shotgun sequencing was used to characterize fecal samples at the taxonomic and functional levels. Cognition of the patients with SCZ was evaluated using the Brief Assessment of Cognition instrument.SCZ gut microbiota differed significantly from those of healthy control subjects and individuals with metabolic syndrome in terms of richness and global composition. SCZ gut microbiota were notably enriched in <i>Flavonifractor plautii</i>, <i>Collinsella aerofaciens</i>, <i>Bilophila wadsworthia</i>, and <i>Sellimonas intestinalis</i>, while depleted in <i>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</i>, <i>Ruminococcus lactaris</i>, <i>Ruminococcus bicirculans</i>, and <i>Veillonella rogosae</i>. Functional potential of the gut microbiota accounted for 11% of cognition variability. In particular, the bacterial functional module for synthesizing tyrosine, a precursor for dopamine, was in SCZ cases positively associated with cognitive score (ρ = 0.34, <i>q</i> ≤ .1).Overall, this study shows that the gut microbiome of patients with SCZ differs greatly from that of healthy control subjects or individuals with metabolic syndrome. Cognitive function of patients with SCZ is associated with the potential for gut bacterial biosynthesis of tyrosine, a precursor for dopamine, suggesting that gut microbiota might be an intervention target for alleviation of cognitive dysfunction in SCZ.",Biological psychiatry global open science,2023,Florence Thirion; Helene Speyer; Tue Haldor Hansen; Trine Nielsen; Yong Fan; Emmanuelle Le Chatelier; Sébastien Fromentin; Magali Berland; Florian Plaza Oñate; Nicolas Pons; Nathalie Galleron; Florence Levenez; Lajos Markó; Till Birkner; Torben Jørgensen; Sofia K Forslund; Henrik Vestergaard; Torben Hansen; Merete Nordentoft; Ole Mors; Michael E Benros; Oluf Pedersen; Stanislav D Ehrlich
36804416,A snapshot of gut microbiota data from murine models of Autism Spectrum Disorder: Still a blurred picture.,"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in social communication and interaction and repetitive/stereotyped behaviors. In recent years, the role of microbiota-gut-brain axis in ASD pathogenesis received growing attention, appearing as an attractive therapeutic target. We provide a comprehensive overview of changes in microbiota composition in ASD murine models so far identified, and summarize the therapeutic approaches targeting the microbiota on ASD-like neurobehavioral profile. Although alterations in microbiota composition have been observed in both genetic and environmental murine models of ASD, a clear microbiota profile shared by different ASD murine models has not been identified. We documented substantial discrepancies among studies (often within the same model), likely due to several confounding factors (from sex and age of animals to housing conditions). Despite these limitations, ASD animal models (under standardized conditions) remain a useful tool to evaluate (i) the beneficial effects of manipulations of gut microbiota on behavioral abnormalities; (ii) underlying neurobiological mechanisms related to gut-brain axis; and (iii) to identify optimal time windows for therapeutic interventions.",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,2023,A M Tartaglione; V Pazienza; G Calamandrei; L Ricceri

This study aimed to examine the influence of maternal overweight, obesity and/or gestational diabetes on the offspring behavior at 3.5 years of age and its association with the gut microbiota already established at 18 months of life.156 children born to overweight (OV, n = 45), obese (OB, n = 40) and normoweight (NW, n = 71) pregnant women participating in the PREOBE study were included in the current analysis. Stool samples were collected at 18 months of life and gut microbiome was obtained by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Behavioral problems were evaluated at 3.5 years by using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). ANOVA, Chi-Square Test, ANCOVA, Spearman's correlation, logistic regression model and generalized linear model (GLM) were performed.At 3.5 years of age, Children born to OV/OB mothers showed higher scores in behavioral problems than those born to NW mothers. Additionally, offspring born to OB mothers who developed gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) presented higher scores in attention/deficit hyperactivity and externalizing problems than those born to GDM OV/NW mothers. Fusicatenibacter abundance found at 18 months of age was associated to lower scores in total, internalizing and pervasive developmental problems, while an unidentified genus within Clostridiales and Flavonifractor families abundance showed a positive correlation with anxiety/depression and somatic complaints, respectively. On the other hand, children born to mothers with higher BMI who were breastfed presented elevated anxiety, internalizing problems, externalizing problems and total problems scores; likewise, their gut microbiota composition at 18 months of age showed positive correlation with behavioral problems at 3.5 years: Actinobacteria abundance and somatic complaints and between Fusobacteria abundance and withdrawn behavior and pervasive developmental problems.Our findings suggests that OV/OB and/or GDM during pregnancy is associated with higher behavioral problems scores in children at 3.5 years old.

36986226,The Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis: Psychoneuroimmunological Insights.,"There is growing interest in the role that the intestinal microbiota and the related autoimmune processes may have in the genesis and presentation of some psychiatric diseases. An alteration in the communication of the microbiota-gut-brain axis, which constitutes a communicative model between the central nervous system (CNS) and the gastro-enteric tract, has been identified as one of the possible causes of some psychiatric diseases. The purpose of this narrative review is to describe evidence supporting a role of the gut microbiota in psychiatric diseases and the impact of diet on microbiota and mental health. Change in the composition of the gut microbiota could determine an increase in the permeability of the intestinal barrier, leading to a cytokine storm. This could trigger a systemic inflammatory activation and immune response: this series of events could have repercussions on the release of some neurotransmitters, altering the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and reducing the presence of trophic brain factors.

36931666,"Effect of date seed (<i>Phoenix dactylifera</i>) supplementation as functional food on cardiometabolic risk factors, metabolic endotoxaemia and mental health in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a blinded randomised controlled trial protocol.","Recently, the improvement of chronic hyperglycaemia-related damage of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) through functional food consumption has attracted the attention of many clinicians. This study aims to determine the effectiveness of date seed powder (DSP) as a functional food (prebiotic) on the cardiometabolic risk factors, oxidative stress, anti-/inflammatory biomarkers, metabolic endotoxaemia (gut microbiota), adipokines, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis biomarkers, immune system, anthropometric indices and mental health in patients with T2DM.This study protocol will be conducted as randomised, triple-blind, placebo-controlled trial with the inclusion of 48 patients with T2DM. The participants will be randomly assigned into two equal groups of intervention (n=24) and placebo (n=24) and receive 5 g/day of DSP or placebo for 8 weeks, respectively. At baseline and post-intervention, fasting blood samples will be collected to assess the serum levels of lipid profile, glycaemic indices, antioxidant and oxidative stress, anti-/inflammatory biomarkers, lipopolysaccharide, 8-hydroxy-guanine, adipokines, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis biomarkers, immune system and mental health. Data will be analysed using the SPSS software (V.16.0). To compare the quantitative variables, paired and unpaired Student's t-tests and covariance analyses will be used.In this study, the potential effects of DSP on patients with T2DM will be evaluated for the first time. It is hoped that the results would increase the body of scientific knowledge about DSP supplementation on the cardiometabolic risk factors, oxidative stress, anti-/inflammatory biomarkers, metabolic endotoxaemia, adipokines, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis biomarkers, immune system, anthropometric indices and mental health in patients with T2DM.The study protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran (code: IR.TBZMED.REC.1400.752).Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (www.irct.ir/IRCT20150205020965N10).",BMJ open,2023,Mehdi Mohammadi Zadeh; Parvin Dehghan; Zahra Eslami
37007475,Influence of mental health medication on microbiota in the elderly population in the Valencian region.,"Spain has an aging population; 19.93% of the Spanish population is over 65. Aging is accompanied by several health issues, including mental health disorders and changes in the gut microbiota. The gut-brain axis is a bidirectional network linking the central nervous system with gastrointestinal tract functions, and therefore, the gut microbiota can influence an individual's mental health. Furthermore, aging-related physiological changes affect the gut microbiota, with differences in taxa and their associated metabolic functions between younger and older people. Here, we took a case-control approach to study the interplay between gut microbiota and mental health of elderly people. Fecal and saliva samples from 101 healthy volunteers over 65 were collected, of which 28 (EE|MH group) reported using antidepressants or medication for anxiety or insomnia at the time of sampling. The rest of the volunteers (EE|NOMH group) were the control group. 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metagenomic sequencing were applied to determine the differences between intestinal and oral microbiota. Significant differences in genera were found, specifically eight in the gut microbiota, and five in the oral microbiota. Functional analysis of fecal samples showed differences in five orthologous genes related to tryptophan metabolism, the precursor of serotonin and melatonin, and in six categories related to serine metabolism, a precursor of tryptophan. Moreover, we found 29 metabolic pathways with significant inter-group differences, including pathways regulating longevity, the dopaminergic synapse, the serotoninergic synapse, and two amino acids.",Frontiers in microbiology,2023,Nicole Pesantes; Ana Barberá; Benjamí Pérez-Rocher; Alejandro Artacho; Sergio Luís Vargas; Andrés Moya; Susana Ruiz-Ruiz
36283312,Ginsenoside Rh4 remodels the periphery microenvironment by targeting the brain-gut axis to alleviate depression-like behaviors.,"Depression is a neuropsychiatric disease that threatens the physical and mental health of humans worldwide. This study explored the potential anti-depressant effects of ginsenoside Rh4 and its mechanisms of action. The results showed that Rh4 could significantly inhibit depression-like behavior in the depression mouse model and alleviate neuronal damage and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis disorder. Concurrently, Rh4 inhibits hippocampal neuronal apoptosis and synaptic structural damage due to the overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines and overactivation of microglia and astrocytes by inhibiting the immune-inflammatory response and signaling molecular interaction pathways. Rh4 can also improve intestinal flora and increase the short-chain fatty-acids content. The correlation analysis indicated that the Rh4-inhibited LPS/NLRP3/caspase-1/IL-1β signaling pathway plays a key role in ameliorating depression. Therefore, this study provides valuable insights into the mode of action of Rh4 on the brain-gut axis in depression, suggesting that Rh4 may be a promising clinical drug for the treatment of depression.",Food chemistry,2023,Jingjing Shao; Xiaoxuan Ma; Linlin Qu; Pei Ma; Rong Huang; Daidi Fan
36937822,Bone fragility during the COVID-19 pandemic: the role of macro- and micronutrients.,"Bone fragility is the susceptibility to fracture due to poor bone strength. This condition is usually associated with aging, comorbidities, disability, poor quality of life, and increased mortality. International guidelines for the management of patients with bone fragility include a nutritional approach, mainly aiming at optimal protein, calcium, and vitamin D intakes. Several biomechanical features of the skeleton, such as bone mineral density (BMD), trabecular and cortical microarchitecture, seem to be positively influenced by micro- and macronutrient intake. Patients with major fragility fractures are usually poor consumers of dairy products, fruit, and vegetables as well as of nutrients modulating gut microbiota. The COVID-19 pandemic has further aggravated the health status of patients with skeletal fragility, also in terms of unhealthy dietary patterns that might adversely affect bone health. In this narrative review, we discuss the role of macro- and micronutrients in patients with bone fragility during the COVID-19 pandemic.",Therapeutic advances in musculoskeletal disease,2023,Antimo Moretti; Sara Liguori; Marco Paoletta; Silvia Migliaccio; Giuseppe Toro; Francesca Gimigliano; Giovanni Iolascon
36969812,"Demonstrating a link between diet, gut microbiota and brain: <sup>14</sup>C radioactivity identified in the brain following gut microbial fermentation of <sup>14</sup>C-radiolabeled tyrosine in a pig model.","There is a need to better understand the relationship between the diet, the gut microbiota and mental health. Metabolites produced when the human gut microbiota metabolize amino acids may enter the bloodstream and have systemic effects. We hypothesize that fermentation of amino acids by a resistant protein-primed gut microbiota could yield potentially toxic metabolites and disturb the availability of neurotransmitter precursors to the brain. However, these mechanisms are challenging to investigate <i>via</i> typical <i>in vitro</i> and clinical methods.We developed a novel workflow using <sup>14</sup>C radiolabeling to investigate complex nutrient-disease relationships. The first three steps of the workflow are reported here. α-Linolenic acid (ALA) was used as a model nutrient to confirm the efficacy of the workflow, and tyrosine (Tyr) was the test nutrient. <sup>14</sup>C-Tyr was administered to male weanling pigs fed a high resistant protein diet, which primed the gut microbiota for fermenting protein. The hypotheses were; (1) that expected biodistribution of <sup>14</sup>C-ALA would be observed, and (2) that radioactivity from <sup>14</sup>C-Tyr, representing Tyr and other amino acids released from resistant protein following gut microbial fermentation, would be bioavailable to the brain.Radioactivity from the <sup>14</sup>C-ALA was detected in tissues reflecting normal utilization of this essential fatty acid. Radioactivity from the <sup>14</sup>C-Tyr was detected in the brain (0.15% of original dose).Metabolites of gut-fermented protein and specifically amino acid precursors to neurotransmitters such as tyrosine, are potentially able to affect brain function. By extension, resistant proteins in the diet reaching the gut microbiota, also have potential to release metabolites that can potentially affect brain function. The high specificity of detection of <sup>14</sup>C radioactivity demonstrates that the proposed workflow can similarly be applied to understand other key diet and health paradigms.",Frontiers in nutrition,2023,Margaret Murray; Christopher K Barlow; Scott Blundell; Mark Buecking; Anne Gibbon; Bernd Goeckener; Lisa M Kaminskas; Patricia Leitner; Sophie Selby-Pham; Andrew Sinclair; Habtewold D Waktola; Gary Williamson; Louise E Bennett

However, the scale and heterogeneous nature of multi-modal data makes integration and inference a non-trivial task. We developed a deep-learning-based framework, multi-omics variational autoencoders (MOVE), to integrate such data and applied it to a cohort of 789 people with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes with deep multi-omics phenotyping from the DIRECT consortium. Using in silico perturbations, we identified drug-omics associations across the multi-modal datasets for the 20 most prevalent drugs given to people with type 2 diabetes with substantially higher sensitivity than univariate statistical tests. From these, we among others, identified novel associations between metformin and the gut microbiota as well as opposite molecular responses for the two statins, simvastatin and atorvastatin.

36542917,Gut microbiota and its roles in the pathogenesis and therapy of endocrine system diseases.,"A new field of microbial research is the relationship between microorganisms and multicellular hosts. It is known that gut microbes can cause various endocrine system diseases, such as diabetes and thyroid disease. Changes in the composition or structure and the metabolites of gut microbes may cause gastrointestinal disorders, including ulcers or intestinal perforation and other inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. In recent years, reports on the interactions between intestinal microorganisms and endocrine system diseases have been increasingly documented. In the meantime, the treatment based on gut microbiome has also been paid much attention. For example, fecal microbiota transplantation is found to have a therapeutic effect on many diseases. As such, understanding the gut microbiota-endocrine system interactions is of great significance for the theranostic of endocrine system diseases. Herein, we summarize the relations of gut microbiome with endocrine system diseases, and discuss the potentials of regulating gut microbiome in treating those diseases. In addition, the concerns and possible solutions regarding the gut microbiome-based therapy are discussed.",Microbiological research,2023,Zhuoxuan Wu; Erkang Tian; Yuyang Chen; Zaiquan Dong; Qiang Peng
36517709,Porphyra haitanensis Polysaccharides Attenuates Blood Lipid via Gut-Liver Axis in Diet-Induced High-Fat Mesocricetus auratus through Multiple Integrated Omics.,"Hyperlipidemia is currently a global public health problem severely affecting people's physical and mental health, as well as their quality of life.The present study is aimed at revealing the mechanism of Porphyra haitanensis polysaccharide (PHP) in decreasing blood lipids by acting through gut-liver axis in Mesocricetus auratus fed a high-fat diet. PHP significantly prevented increases in serum total cholesterol, triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and alleviated damage to liver cells induced by a high-fat diet M. auratus, in a dose-dependent manner. PHP promotes proliferation of Muribaculaceae and Faecalibaculum, thereby enhancing the production of butyric acid both in the colon and liver, particularly high-dose PHP (HPHP). Low-dose PHP (LPHP) promotes the expression of phosphatidylcholine metabolites and fatty acid transport genes, and inhibits the expression of genes involved in fat degradation (Abhd5), adipogenesis (Me1), fatty acid synthesis (Fasn and Pnpla3), and fatty acid chain elongation (Elovl6) in the liver. However, HPHP inhibits the expression of triglyceride metabolites and promotes the expression of fatty acid transporter (CD36), fatty acid oxidation (Acacb), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARg) genes in the liver.PHP regulates lipid metabolism through the gut microbiota, and the gut-liver axis plays an important role in its hypolipidemic effects.",Molecular nutrition & food research,2023,Hongliang Zeng; Peilin Chen; Zhiyun Wang; Xiaoke Hu; Yi Zhang; Baodong Zheng
36549572,The effect of microbiome composition on impulsive and violent behavior: A systematic review.,"The impact of the microbiome on brain function and behavior has recently become an important research topic. We searched for a link between the gut microbiome and impulsive and violent behavior. We focused on critical factors influencing the microbiome establishment that may affect human health later in life, i.e., delivery mode, early-life feeding, and early antibiotic exposure. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. We included original human studies examining adults and children with impulsive and/or violent behavior that assessed the gut microbiota composition of participants, delivery mode, infant feeding mode, or early antibiotic exposure. Bibliographic searches yielded 429 articles, and 21 met the eligibility criteria. Two studies reported data on patients with schizophrenia with violent behavior, while 19 studies reported data on patients with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The results showed several bacterial taxa associated with ADHD symptomatology and with violent behavior in patients with schizophrenia. No association was found between delivery mode and impulsive behavior, nor did any articles relate infant feeding mode to violent human behavior. Those studies investigating early antibiotic exposure yielded ambiguous results. The heterogeneity of the data and the different methodologies of the included studies limited the external validity of the results. We found few studies that addressed the possible microbiome involvement in the pathophysiology of impulsive and violent behavior in humans. Our review revealed a gap in knowledge regarding links between the gut microbiome and these extreme behavioral patterns.",Behavioural brain research,2023,Michaela Langmajerová; Radka Roubalová; Antonín Šebela; Jan Vevera
36910501,Efficacy of acupuncture in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease and its impact on gut microbiota: Study protocol for a randomized sham-controlled trial.,"Acupuncture is used as an adjuvant therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but available evidence for efficacy is limited so far. Growing studies suggest that resident gut microbiota contributes to the development and progression of AD. Meanwhile, acupuncture is reported to treat gastrointestinal and neurodegenerative disorders <i>via</i> the gut-brain axis. Therefore, our aim is to confirm the adjunctive therapeutic effects of acupuncture for AD, and explore the relationship between clinical efficacy and shifts of gut microbiota.This is a randomized, participant-masked, sham-controlled trial. One hundred and sixty participants with mild AD will be randomly assigned (1:1) to either active acupuncture or non-penetrating sham acupuncture (three times weekly for 14 weeks) added to donepezil treatment (5 mg per day for 28 weeks). The primary efficacy outcome is the change from baseline to week 28 in the Alzheimer's disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog12). Secondary efficacy outcomes include other assessments of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Alzheimer's disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL), and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Gut microbiota will be measured using 16S rRNA tag sequencing.This rigorous trial will provide high-quality evidence on the efficacy of acupuncture as adjunctive treatment for mild AD, and identify the possible mechanisms of acupuncture from gut microbiota.[https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05078944], ClinicalTrials.gov [NCT05078944].

36900437,Fermented Wheat Germ Alleviates Depression-like Behavior in Rats with Chronic and Unpredictable Mild Stress.,"Depression is a chronic mental illness with devastating effects on a person's physical and mental health. Studies have reported that food fermentation with probiotics can enrich the nutritional values of food and produce functional microorganisms that can alleviate depression and anxiety. Wheat germ is an inexpensive raw material that is rich in bioactive ingredients. For example, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is reported to have antidepressant effects. Several studies concluded that <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> is a GABA-producing bacteria and can alleviate depression. Herein, fermented wheat germs (FWGs) were used to treat stress-induced depression. FWG was prepared by fermenting wheat germs with <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i>. The chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model was established in rats, and these rats were treated with FWG for four weeks to evaluate the effects of FWG in relieving depression. In addition, the study also analyzed the potential anti-depressive mechanism of FWG based on behavioral changes, physiological and biochemical index changes, and intestinal flora changes in depressed rats. The results demonstrated that FWG improved depression-like behaviors and increased neurotransmitter levels in the hippocampus of CUMS model rats. In addition, FWG effectively altered the gut microbiota structure and remodeled the gut microbiota in CUMS rats, restored neurotransmitter levels in depressed rats through the brain-gut axis, and restored amino acid metabolic functions. In conclusion, we suggest that FWG has antidepressant effects, and its potential mechanism may act by restoring the disordered brain-gut axis.","Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,Zheyuan Hu; Penghui Zhao; Aimei Liao; Long Pan; Jie Zhang; Yuqi Dong; Jihong Huang; Weiwei He; Xingqi Ou

All patients then received 4-weeks quetiapine treatment and were further classified as responders and non-responders. Based on pre-treatment datasets, the correlation networks were established between gut microbiota and neuroimaging measures and the multimodal kernal combination support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were constructed to distinguish BD patients from HCs, and quetiapine responders from non-responders.The multi-modal pre-treatment characteristics of quetiapine responders, were closer to the HCs compared to non-responders. And the correlation network analyses found the substantial correlations existed in HC between the Anaerotruncus_ unclassified，Porphyromonas_asaccharolytica，Actinomyces_graevenitzii et al. and the functional connectomes involved default mode network (DMN),somatomotor (SM), visual, limbic and basal ganglia networks were disrupted in BD. Moreover, in terms of the multimodal classifier, it reached optimized area under curve (AUC-ROC) at 0.9517 when classified BD from HC, and also acquired 0.8292 discriminating quetiapine responders from non-responders, which consistently better than even using the best unique modality.Lack post-treatment and external validation datasets; size of HCs is modest.Multi-modalities of combining pre-treatment gut microbiota with neuroimaging endophenotypes might be a superior approach for accurate diagnosis and quetiapine efficacy prediction in BD.",Journal of affective disorders,2023,Caixi Xi; Ang Li; Jianbo Lai; Xiaojie Huang; Peifen Zhang; Su Yan; Mengfan Jiao; Huimin Huang; Shaohua Hu

The primary outcome was assessment of total mood disturbance (TMD; Profile of Mood States Short Form) from baseline to 8 weeks. Secondary outcomes included anxiety, depression, stress, sleep, and wellbeing measures.A modified intention-to-treat analysis using linear mixed effects models revealed that the prebiotic diet reduced TMD relative to placebo at 8 weeks [Cohen's <i>d</i> = -0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) = -1.18, -0.03; <i>p</i> = 0.039]. There was no evidence of symptom improvement from the probiotic (<i>d</i> = -0.19, 95% CI = -0.75, 0.38; <i>p</i> = 0.51) or synbiotic treatments (<i>d</i> = -0.03, 95% CI = -0.59, 0.53; <i>p</i> = 0.92). Improved anxiety, stress, and sleep were noted in response to the prebiotic diet while the probiotic tentatively improved wellbeing, relative to placebo. No benefit was found in response to the synbiotic intervention. All treatments were well tolerated with few adverse events.A high-prebiotic dietary intervention may improve mood, anxiety, stress, and sleep in adults with moderate psychological distress and low prebiotic intake.

36710917,Metagenomic data reveals microbiome characteristics of culture-negative brain abscess samples.,"A brain abscess is a focal collection of pus in the brain parenchyma surrounded by a well-vascularized collagenous capsule in response to an infection. The microbiome of brain abscesses has been shown to be polymicrobial, dominated by uncultivable and anaerobic organisms of odontogenic origin. The data provided in this article includes the sequences of bacterial 16S rRNA gene from three culture-negative brain abscess samples suspected to have poly-microbial aetiology based on Sanger sequencing. DNA was extracted from brain abscess samples, and targeted-metagenomics sequencing was done by amplifying the full-length bacterial 16S rRNA followed by a nested PCR for V3-V4 regions using universal and specific primers. The barcoded amplicons were sequenced on Illumina MiSeq V2 instrument to generate 0.5M, 250bp paired-end reads/sample. The total sequencing reads were 455966, 345746, and 438658 for samples P32, P49, and P8, respectively. Bioinformatics tools such as FLASH, VSEARCH, and QIIME1 were used to process the reads generated for Operational Taxonomic Unit analysis (OTU). Bacterial species belonging to phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Fusobacteria were abundant in samples P49 and P8, which are mainly anaerobic and microaerophilic bacteria. These are typical of the human oral/gut microbiota and are implicated in brain abscess formation. Sample P32 showed the abundance of bacterial species belonging to phyla Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, which are commonly found in the environment. Raw data files are available at the Sequence Read Archive (SRA), National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), and data information can be found at the BioProject, PRJNA785100 under the accession numbers SRX13271109, SRX13271110, SRX13295897.

36583066,Impact of broad-spectrum antibiotics on the gut-microbiota-spleen-brain axis.,"The spleen is a key immune-related organ that plays a role in communication between the brain and the immune system through the brain-spleen axis and brain-gut-microbiota axis. However, how the gut microbiota affects spleen and brain function remains unclear. Here, we investigated whether microbiome depletion induced by administration of an antibiotic cocktail (ABX) affects spleen and brain function. Treatment with ABX for 14 days resulted in a significant decrease in spleen weight and significant alterations in splenic functions, including the percentage of neutrophils, NK cells, macrophages, and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Furthermore, ABX treatment resulted in the depletion of a large portion of the gut microbiota. Untargeted metabolomics analysis showed that ABX treatment caused alterations in the levels of certain compounds in the plasma, spleen, and brain. Moreover, ABX treatment decreased the expression of microglia marker Iba1 in the cerebral cortex. Interestingly, correlations were found between the abundance of different microbiome components and metabolites in various tissues, as well as splenic cell populations and spleen weight. These findings suggest that ABX-induced microbiome depletion and altered metabolite levels may affect spleen and brain function through the gut-microbiota-spleen-brain axis.","Brain, behavior, & immunity - health",2023,Xiayun Wan; Akifumi Eguchi; Akemi Sakamoto; Yuko Fujita; Yong Yang; Youge Qu; Masahiko Hatano; Chisato Mori; Kenji Hashimoto
36571897,"Repeated use of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine is associated with the resilience in mice after chronic social defeat stress: A role of gut-microbiota-brain axis.","3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), the most widely used illicit compound worldwide, is the most attractive therapeutic drug for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Recent observational studies of US adults demonstrated that lifetime MDMA use was associated with lower risk of depression. Here, we examined whether repeated administration of MDMA can affect resilience versus susceptibility in mice exposed to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS). CSDS produced splenomegaly, anhedonia-like phenotype, and higher plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the saline-treated mice. In contrast, CSDS did not cause these changes in the MDMA-treated mice. Analysis of gut microbiome found several microbes altered between saline + CSDS group and MDMA + CSDS group. Untargeted metabolomics analysis showed that plasma levels of N-epsilon-methyl-L-lysine in the saline + CSDS group were significantly higher than those in the control and MDMA + CSDS groups. Interestingly, there were positive correlations between plasma IL-6 levels and the abundance of several microbes (or plasma N-epsilon-methyl-L-lysine) in the three groups. Furthermore, there were also positive correlations between the abundance of several microbes and N-epsilon-methyl-L-lysine in the three groups. In conclusion, these data suggest that repeated administration of MDMA might contribute to stress resilience in mice subjected to CSDS through gut-microbiota-brain axis.",Psychiatry research,2023,Youge Qu; Akifumi Eguchi; Xiayun Wan; Li Ma; Lijia Chang; Jiajing Shan; Yong Yang; Chisato Mori; Kenji Hashimoto

Products of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis, neurotransmitter, and serum cytokines were investigated by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a biomarker of astrocyte, was quantified using immunofluorescence. Microbiota culturing in vitro after XPJYF treatment was analyze by 16 s RNA sequencing technology. We used lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to mimic activated rat primary astrocyte in vitro. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), cytokines, and oxidative stress factors were determined by western blotting, and glycometabolism in astrocyte was investigated by 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) uptake, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and glucose-1-phosphate (G1P) kits.Microbiota composition during 8 mg/ml of XPJYF (H12-8) for 12 h showed the more consistency. Lactococcus is enriched in DD-derived microbiota composition, and Biffdobacterium and Lactobacillus in H12-8 group. GLUCOSE1PMETAB-PWY and PWY-7328 of which biofunctions were dominantly encoded by Biffdobacterium were the top two of altered pathways. XPJYF improved behaviors and repressed astrocyte activation in depression rats. XPJYF elevated 2-DG uptake, ATP, glucose-1-phosphate, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and inhibited cytokines and oxidative stress in LPS-induced astrocyte.XPJYF treatment targets inflammation, activation, and glycometabolim in astrocyte via gut microbiota modulation, thereby improve animal behaviors, HPA axis dysfunction, and neurotransmitter synthesis in depression rats.",CNS neuroscience & therapeutics,2023,Yannan Li; Lixuan Yang; Junnan Li; Wei Gao; Zhonghui Zhao; Kaiqiang Dong; Wenzhe Duan; Baoan Dai; Rongjuan Guo
36334762,Are neuromodulation interventions associated with changes in the gut microbiota? A systematic review.,"The microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) refers to the bidirectional communication between the brain and the gut microbiota and recent studies have linked the MGBA to health and disease. Research has so far investigated this axis mainly from microbiota to brain but less is known about the other direction. One approach to examine the MGBA from brain to microbiota is through understanding if and how neuromodulation might impact microbiota. Neuromodulation encompasses a wide range of stimulation techniques and is used to treat neurological, psychiatric and metabolic disorders, like Parkinson's Disease, depression and obesity. Here, we performed a systematic review to investigate whether neuromodulation is associated with subsequent changes in the gut microbiota. Searches in PsycINFO and MEDLINE were performed up to March 2022. Included studies needed to be clinical or preclinical studies comparing the effects of deep brain stimulation, electroconvulsive therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation or vagal nerve stimulation on the gut microbiota before and after treatment or between active and control groups. Seven studies were identified. Neuromodulation was associated with changes in relative bacterial abundances, but not with (changes in) α-diversity or β-diversity. Summarizing, currently reported findings suggest that neuromodulation interventions are associated with moderate changes in the gut microbiome. However, findings remain inconclusive due to the limited number and varying quality of included studies, as well as the large heterogeneity between studies. More research is required to more conclusively establish whether, and if so, via which mechanism(s) of action neuromodulation interventions might influence the gut microbiota.",Neuropharmacology,2023,Vera Korenblik; Marlies E Brouwer; Aniko Korosi; Damiaan Denys; Claudi L H Bockting; Stanley Brul; Anja Lok
36794003,"High-fiber diet ameliorates gut microbiota, serum metabolism and emotional mood in type 2 diabetes patients.","Previous studies have demonstrated that patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) often had the problems of fecal microbiota dysbiosis, and were usually accompanied with psychiatric comorbidities (such as depression and anxiety). Here, we conducted a randomized clinical study to analyze the changes in gut microbiota, serum metabolism and emotional mood of patients with T2DM after consumption of a high-fiber diet. The glucose homeostasis of participants with T2DM was improved by the high-fiber diet, and the serum metabolome, systemic inflammation and psychiatric comorbidities were also altered. The increased abundances of <i>Lactobacillus</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium</i> and <i>Akkermansias</i> revealed that the proportions of beneficial gut microbes were enriched by the high-fiber diet, while the abundances of <i>Desulfovibrio</i>, <i>Klebsiella</i> and other opportunistic pathogens were decreased. Therefore, the current study demonstrated that the intestinal microbiota alterations which were influenced by the high-fiber diet could improve the serum metabolism and emotional mood of patients with T2DM.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2023,Lihua Chen; Bo Liu; Lixia Ren; Hao Du; Chunhua Fei; Chang Qian; Bin Li; Ruixia Zhang; Haixia Liu; Zongjie Li; Zhiyong Ma
36693863,Data-independent acquisition boosts quantitative metaproteomics for deep characterization of gut microbiota.,"Metaproteomics can provide valuable insights into the functions of human gut microbiota (GM), but is challenging due to the extreme complexity and heterogeneity of GM. Data-independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry (MS) has been an emerging quantitative technique in conventional proteomics, but is still at the early stage of development in the field of metaproteomics. Herein, we applied library-free DIA (directDIA)-based metaproteomics and compared the directDIA with other MS-based quantification techniques for metaproteomics on simulated microbial communities and feces samples spiked with bacteria with known ratios, demonstrating the superior performance of directDIA by a comprehensive consideration of proteome coverage in identification as well as accuracy and precision in quantification. We characterized human GM in two cohorts of clinical fecal samples of pancreatic cancer (PC) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). About 70,000 microbial proteins were quantified in each cohort and annotated to profile the taxonomic and functional characteristics of GM in different diseases. Our work demonstrated the utility of directDIA in quantitative metaproteomics for investigating intestinal microbiota and its related disease pathogenesis.",NPJ biofilms and microbiomes,2023,Jinzhi Zhao; Yi Yang; Hua Xu; Jianxujie Zheng; Chengpin Shen; Tian Chen; Tao Wang; Bing Wang; Jia Yi; Dan Zhao; Enhui Wu; Qin Qin; Li Xia; Liang Qiao
36216056,Effects of urban particulate matter on gut microbiome and partial schizophrenia-like symptoms in mice: Evidence from shotgun metagenomic and metabolomic profiling.,"Epidemiological evidence reported that particulate matter (PM) was associated with increased schizophrenia (SCZ) risk. Disturbance of gut microbiome was involved in SCZ. However, it remains unclear whether PM induces SCZ-like symptoms and how gut microbiome regulates them. Therefore, a multi-omics animal experiment was conducted to verify how urban PM induces SCZ-like behavior and altered gut microbiota and metabolic pathways.Using a completely random design, mice were divided into three groups: PM group, control group and MK801 group, which received daily tracheal instillation of PM solution, sterile PBS solution and intraperitoneal injection of MK801 (establish SCZ model), respectively. After a 14-day intervention, feces were collected for multi-omics testing (shotgun metagenomic sequencing and untargeted metabolomic profiling), followed by open field test, tail suspension test, and passive avoidance test. Besides, fecal microbiome of PM group and control group were transplanted into ""pseudo-sterile"" mice, then behavioral tests were conducted.Similar to MK801 group, mice in PM group showed SCZ-like symptoms, including increased spontaneous activity, excitability, anxiety and decreased learning and spatial memory. PM exposure significantly increased the relative abundance of Verrucomicrobia and decreased that of Fibrobacteres et al. The metabolism pathways of estrogen signaling (estriol, 16-glucuronide-estriol and 21-desoxycortisol) and choline metabolism (phosphocholine) were significantly altered by PM exposure. Verrucomicrobia was negatively correlated with the level of estriol, which was correlated with decreased learning and spatial memory. Fibrobacteres and Deinococcus-Thermus were positively correlated with the level of phosphocholine, which was correlated with increased spontaneous activity, excitability and anxiety. Fecal microbiome transplantation from PM group mice reproduced excitability and anxiety symptoms.Exposure to PM may affect composition of gut microbiome and alterations of estrogen signaling pathway and choline metabolism pathway, which were associated with partial SCZ-like behaviors. But whether gut microbiome regulates these metabolic pathways and behaviors remains to be determined.",The Science of the total environment,2023,Weizhuo Yi; Yifu Ji; Hua Gao; Shengyong Luo; Rubing Pan; Jian Song; Yangyang He; Yuxuan Li; Yudong Wu; Shuangshuang Yan; Yunfeng Liang; Xiaoni Sun; Xiaoyu Jin; Lu Mei; Jian Cheng; Hong Su
36650572,Risk factors for eating disorders: findings from a rapid review.,"Risk factors represent a range of complex variables associated with the onset, development, and course of eating disorders. Understanding these risk factors is vital for the refinement of aetiological models, which may inform the development of targeted, evidence-based prevention, early intervention, and treatment programs. This Rapid Review aimed to identify and summarise research studies conducted within the last 12 years, focusing on risk factors associated with eating disorders.The current review forms part of a series of Rapid Reviews to be published in a special issue in the Journal of Eating Disorders, funded by the Australian Government to inform the development of the National Eating Disorder Research and Translation Strategy 2021-2031. Three databases were searched for studies published between 2009 and 2021, published in English, and comprising high-level evidence studies (meta-analyses, systematic reviews, moderately sized randomised controlled studies, moderately sized controlled-cohort studies, or population studies). Data pertaining to risk factors for eating disorders were synthesised and outlined in the current paper.A total of 284 studies were included. The findings were divided into nine main categories: (1) genetics, (2) gastrointestinal microbiota and autoimmune reactions, (3) childhood and early adolescent exposures, (4) personality traits and comorbid mental health conditions, (5) gender, (6) socio-economic status, (7) ethnic minority, (8) body image and social influence, and (9) elite sports. A substantial amount of research exists supporting the role of inherited genetic risk in the development of eating disorders, with biological risk factors, such as the role of gut microbiota in dysregulation of appetite, an area of emerging evidence. Abuse, trauma and childhood obesity are strongly linked to eating disorders, however less conclusive evidence exists regarding developmental factors such as role of in-utero exposure to hormones. Comorbidities between eating disorders and mental health disorders, including personality and mood disorders, have been found to increase the severity of eating disorder symptomatology. Higher education attainment, body image-related factors, and use of appearance-focused social media are also associated with increased risk of eating disorder symptoms.Eating disorders are associated with multiple risk factors. An extensive amount of research has been conducted in the field; however, further studies are required to assess the causal nature of the risk factors identified in the current review. This will assist in understanding the sequelae of eating disorder development and in turn allow for enhancement of existing interventions and ultimately improved outcomes for individuals.",Journal of eating disorders,2023,Sarah Barakat; Siân A McLean; Emma Bryant; Anvi Le; Peta Marks; ; Stephen Touyz; Sarah Maguire
36191806,A role of gut-microbiota-brain axis via subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve in depression-like phenotypes in Chrna7 knock-out mice.,"The α7 subtype of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7 nAChR: coded by Chrna7) is known to regulate the cholinergic ascending anti-inflammatory pathway. We previously reported that Chrna7 knock-out (KO) mice show depression-like behaviors through abnormal composition of gut microbiota and systemic inflammation. Given the role of subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve in gut-microbiota-brain axis, we investigated whether subdiaphragmatic vagotomy (SDV) could affect depression-like behaviors, abnormal composition of gut microbiota, and microbes-derived metabolites in Chrna7 KO mice. SDV blocked depression-like behaviors and reduced expression of synaptic proteins in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of Chrna7 KO mice. LEfSe (linear discriminant analysis effect size) analysis revealed that the species Lactobacillus sp. BL302, the species Lactobacillus hominis, and the species Lactobacillus reuteri, were identified as potential microbial markers in the KO + SDV group. There were several genus and species altered among the three groups [wild-type (WT) + sham group, KO + sham group, KO + SDV group]. Furthermore, there were several plasma metabolites altered among the three groups. Moreover, there were correlations between relative abundance of several microbiome and behavioral data (or synaptic proteins). Network analysis showed correlations between relative abundance of several microbiome and plasma metabolites (or behavioral data). These data suggest that Chrna7 KO mice produce depression-like behaviors and reduced expression of synaptic proteins in the mPFC through gut-microbiota-brain axis via subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve.",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,2023,Yong Yang; Akifumi Eguchi; Xiayun Wan; Lijia Chang; Xingming Wang; Youge Qu; Chisato Mori; Kenji Hashimoto
36699448,The host genetics affects gut microbiome diversity in Chinese depressed patients.,"The gut microbiome and host genetics are both associated with major depressive disorder (MDD); however, the molecular mechanisms among the associations are poorly understood, especially in the Asian, Chinese group. Our study applied linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) and genome-wide association analysis in the cohort with both gut sequencing data and genomics data. We reported the different gut microbiota characteristics between MDD and control groups in the Chinese group and further constructed the association between host genetics and the gut microbiome. <i>Actinobacteria</i> and <i>Pseudomonades</i> were found more in the MDD group. We found significant differences in the ACE and Chao indexes of alpha diversity while no discrepancy in beta diversity. We found three associations between host genetics with microbiome features: beta diversity and rs6108 (<i>p</i> = 8.65 × 10<sup>-9</sup>), <i>Actinobacteria</i> and rs77379751 (<i>p</i> = 8.56 × 10<sup>-9</sup>), and PWY-5913 and rs1775633082 (<i>p</i> = 4.54 × 10<sup>-8</sup>). A species of the <i>Romboutsia</i> genus was co-associated with the species of <i>Ruminococcus gnavus</i> in an internetwork through four genes: <i>METTL8</i>, <i>ITGB2</i>, <i>OTULIN</i>, and <i>PROSER3</i>, with a strict threshold (<i>p</i> < 5 × 10<sup>-4</sup>). Furthermore, our findings suggested that the gut microbiome diversity might affect microRNA expression in the brain and influenced <i>SERPINA5</i> and other spatially close genes afterward. These findings suggest new linkages between depression and gut microbiome in Asian, Chinese people, which might be mediated by genes and microRNA regulation in space distance.",Frontiers in genetics,2022,Ke Han; Lei Ji; Chenliu Wang; Yang Shao; Changfeng Chen; Liangjie Liu; Mofan Feng; Fengping Yang; Xi Wu; Xingwang Li; Qinglian Xie; Lin He; Yi Shi; Guang He; Zaiquan Dong; Tao Yu
36698474,"The different trends in the burden of neurological and mental disorders following dietary transition in China, the USA, and the world: An extension analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019.","The highly processed western diet is substituting the low-processed traditional diet in the last decades globally. Increasing research found that a diet with poor quality such as western diet disrupts gut microbiota and increases the susceptibility to various neurological and mental disorders, while a balanced diet regulates gut microbiota and prevents and alleviates the neurological and mental disorders. Yet, there is limited research on the association between the disease burden expanding of neurological and mental disorders with a dietary transition.We compared the disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) trend by age for neurological and mental disorders in China, in the United States of America (USA), and across the world from 1990 to 2019, evaluated the dietary transition in the past 60 years, and analyzed the association between the burden trend of the two disorders with the changes in diet composition and food production.We identified an age-related upward pattern in disease burden in China. Compared with the USA and the world, the Chinese neurological and mental disorders DALY percent was least in the generation over 75 but rapidly increased in younger generations and surpassed the USA and/or the world in the last decades. The age-related upward pattern in Chinese disease burdens had not only shown in the presence of cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms, and diabetes mellitus but also appeared in the presence of depressive disorders, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, schizophrenia, headache disorders, anxiety disorders, conduct disorders, autism spectrum disorders, and eating disorders, successively. Additionally, the upward trend was associated with the dramatic dietary transition including a reduction in dietary quality and food production sustainability, during which the younger generation is more affected than the older. Following the increase in total calorie intake, alcohol intake, ratios of animal to vegetal foods, and poultry meat to pulses, the burdens of the above diseases continuously rose. Then, following the rise of the ratios of meat to pulses, eggs to pulses, and pork to pulses, the usage of fertilizers, the farming density of pigs, and the burdens of the above disease except diabetes mellitus were also ever-increasing. Even the usage of pesticides was positively correlated with the burdens of Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, cardiovascular diseases, and neoplasms. Contrary to China, the corresponding burdens of the USA trended to reduce with the improvements in diet quality and food production sustainability.Our results suggest that improving diet quality and food production sustainability might be a promising way to stop the expanding burdens of neurological and mental disorders.",Frontiers in nutrition,2022,Shan Liang; Li Wang; Xiaoli Wu; Xu Hu; Tao Wang; Feng Jin
36624505,Safety and feasibility of faecal microbiota transplant for major depressive disorder: study protocol for a pilot randomised controlled trial.,"Mental disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD), are a leading cause of non-fatal burden of disease globally. Current conventional treatments for depression have significant limitations, and there have been few new treatments in decades. The microbiota-gut-brain-axis is now recognised as playing a role in mental and brain health, and promising preclinical and clinical data suggest Faecal Microbiota Transplants (FMT) may be efficacious for treating a range of mental illnesses. However, there are no existing published studies in humans evaluating the efficacy of FMT for MDD.This protocol describes an 8-week, triple-blind, 2:1 parallel group, randomised controlled pilot trial (n = 15), of enema-delivered FMT treatment (n = 10) compared with a placebo enema (n = 5) in adults with moderate-to-severe MDD. There will be a further 26-week follow-up to monitor longer-term safety. Participants will receive four FMT or placebo enemas over four consecutive days. The primary aims of the study are to evaluate feasibility and safety of FMT as an adjunctive treatment for MDD in adults. Changes in gut microbiota will be assessed as a secondary outcome. Other data will be collected, including changes in depression and anxiety symptoms, and safety parameters.Modification of the microbiota-gut-brain axis via FMT is a promising potential treatment for MDD, but there are no published rigorous clinical trials evaluating its use. If this study finds that our FMT strategy is safe and feasible, a larger fully powered RCT is planned.

36760344,Alteration of faecal microbiota balance related to long-term deep meditation.,"Advancements in research have confirmed that gut microbiota can influence health through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Meditation, as an inner mental exercise, can positively impact the regulation of an individual's physical and mental health. However, few studies have comprehensively investigated faecal microbiota following long-term (several years) deep meditation. Therefore, we propose that long-term meditation may regulate gut microbiota homeostasis and, in turn, affect physical and mental health.To investigate the effects of long-term deep meditation on the gut microbiome structure.To examine the intestinal flora, 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed on faecal samples of 56 Tibetan Buddhist monks and neighbouring residents. Based on the sequencing data, linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) was employed to identify differential intestinal microbial communities between the two groups. Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) analysis was used to predict the function of faecal microbiota. In addition, we evaluated biochemical indices in the plasma.The α-diversity indices of the meditation and control groups differed significantly. At the genus level, <i>Prevotella</i> and <i>Bacteroides</i> were significantly enriched in the meditation group. According to the LEfSe analysis, two beneficial bacterial genera (<i>Megamonas</i> and <i>Faecalibacterium</i>) were significantly enriched in the meditation group. Functional predictive analysis further showed that several pathways-including glycan biosynthesis, metabolism and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis-were significantly enriched in the meditation group. Moreover, plasma levels of clinical risk factors were significantly decreased in the meditation group, including total cholesterol and apolipoprotein B.Long-term traditional Tibetan Buddhist meditation may positively impact physical and mental health. We confirmed that the gut microbiota composition differed between the monks and control subjects. The microbiota enriched in monks was associated with a reduced risk of anxiety, depression and cardiovascular disease and could enhance immune function. Overall, these results suggest that meditation plays a positive role in psychosomatic conditions and well-being.",General psychiatry,2023,Ying Sun; Peijun Ju; Ting Xue; Usman Ali; Donghong Cui; Jinghong Chen
37994886,[The regulatory role of gut microbiota in inflammation in depression and anxiety].,"Numerous studies have identified the important role of the gut microbiota in maintaining of the CNS normal functioning and in the pathogenesis of mental disorders as one of the systems regulating the bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain. The microbiota has been found to be involved in the modulation of inflammation as well as in the development and function of the immune and nervous systems. It is assumed that in multicellular organisms, the nervous and immune systems have evolved together with the microbiota, being in interaction with it, in order to optimize the body's ability to adapt to a wide range of environmental stresses in order to maintain the constancy of its homeostasis. Normally, microbes live in stable communities, while under conditions of even mild or chronic social stress, significant shifts in the composition of the microbiota occur, which lead to the development of dysbiosis associated with changes in microbiota metabolites, which can lead to the formation of physiology and behavior characteristic of stress and depression. Microbes influence the activation of peripheral immune cells that regulate the response to neuroinflammation, brain damage, autoimmune responses, and neurogenesis. The review provides a brief overview of the normal gut microbiota, describes the factors influencing the state of the microbiota, and also discusses recent discoveries concerning the regulatory effect of the gut microbiota on CNS functions, the immune system, and inflammation in the pathogenesis of depression and anxiety.",Zhurnal nevrologii i psikhiatrii imeni S.S.

37414494,Neuroinflammation through the vagus nerve-dependent gut-microbiota-brain axis in treatment-resistant depression.,"Neuroinflammation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder (MDD), including treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Patients with TRD have higher levels of inflammatory biomarkers compared with responders to antidepressants. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the gut-microbiota-brain axis via the vagus nerve plays a key role in neuroinflammation. Preclinical and clinical data suggest that fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from MDD patients or rodents with depression-like behaviors cause depression-like behaviors in rodents through systemic inflammation. Importantly, subdiaphragmatic vagotomy blocked these depression-like phenotypes and systemic inflammation in rodents after FMT of depression-related microbes. Subdiaphragmatic vagotomy also blocked the antidepressant-like effects of serotonergic antidepressants in rodents. Preclinical findings suggest that the new antidepressant, (R)-ketamine (or arketamine), may restore the altered composition of gut microbiota in rodents with depression-like behaviors, contributing to the beneficial effects of arketamine. In this chapter, the author reviews the role of the vagus nerve-dependent gut-microbiota-brain axis in depression (including TRD), and also discuss the potential of FMT, vagus nerve stimulation, and arketamine for the treatment of TRD.",Progress in brain research,2023,Kenji Hashimoto
37400971,Maternal microbiome disturbance induces deficits in the offspring's behaviors: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Recent evidence has suggested that changes in maternal gut microbiota in early life may generate neurobiological consequences associated with psychiatric-related abnormalities. However, the number of studies on humans investigating this problem is limited, and preclinical findings sometimes conflict. Therefore, we run a meta-analysis to examine whether maternal microbiota disturbance (MMD) during neurodevelopment might affect the offspring during adulthood. We found thirteen studies, from a set of 459 records selected by strategy registered on PROSPERO (#289224), to target preclinical studies that evaluated the behavioral outcomes of the rodents generated by dams submitted to perinatal enteric microbiota perturbation. The analysis revealed a significant effect size (SMD = -0.51, 95% CI = -0.79 to -0.22, <i>p</i> < .001, T2 = 0.54, I2 = 79.85%), indicating that MMD might provoke behavioral impairments in the adult offspring. The MMD also induces a significant effect size for the reduction of the sociability behavior (SMD = -0.63, 95% CI = -1.18 to -0.07, <i>p</i> = 0.011, T2 = 0.30, I2 = 76.11%) and obsessive-compulsive-like behavior (SMD = -0.68, 95% CI = -0.01 to -1.36, <i>p</i> = 0.009, T2 = 0.25, I2 = 62.82%) parameters. The effect size was not significant or inconclusive for memory and anxiety-like behavior, or inconclusive for schizophrenia-like and depressive-like behavior. Therefore, experimental perinatal MMD is vertically transmitted to the offspring, negatively impacting behavioral parameters related to psychiatric disorders.",Gut microbes,2023,Lucas Hassib; Cilene Lino de Oliveira; Guilherme Araujo Rouvier; Alexandre Kanashiro; Francisco Silveira Guimarães; Frederico Rogério Ferreira
36651663,"The gut-microbiota-brain axis in a Spanish population in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic: microbiota composition linked to anxiety, trauma, and depression profiles.","The prevalence of anxiety and depression soared following the COVID-19 pandemic. To effectively treat these conditions, a comprehensive understanding of all etiological factors is needed. This study investigated fecal microbial features associated with mental health outcomes (symptoms of anxiety, depression, or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)) in a Spanish cohort in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. Microbial communities from stool samples were profiled in 198 individuals who completed validated, self-report questionnaires. 16S ribosomal RNA gene V3-4 amplicon sequencing was performed. Microbial diversity and community structure were analyzed, together with relative taxonomic abundance. In our cohort of N=198, 17.17% reported depressive symptoms, 37.37% state anxiety symptoms, 40.90% trait anxiety symptoms, and 8.08% PTSD symptoms, with high levels of comorbidity. Individuals with trait anxiety had lower Simpson's diversity. <i>Fusicatenibacter saccharivorans</i> was reduced in individuals with comorbid PTSD + depression + state and trait anxiety symptoms, whilst an expansion of Proteobacteria and depletion of Synergistetes phyla were noted in individuals with depressive symptoms. The relative abundance of <i>Anaerostipes</i> was positively correlated with childhood trauma, and higher levels of <i>Turicibacter sanguinis</i> and lower levels of Lentisphaerae were found in individuals who experienced life-threatening traumas. COVID-19 infection and vaccination influenced the overall microbial composition and were associated with distinct relative taxonomic abundance profiles. These findings will help lay the foundation for future studies to identify microbial role players in symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD and provide future therapeutic targets to improve mental health outcomes.",Gut microbes,2023,Stefanie Malan-Müller; Mireia Valles-Colomer; Tomás Palomo; Juan C Leza
36502554,Antibiotic use and the development of depression: A systematic review.,"Increasingly, disruption of the gastrointestinal ecosystem is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of several medical conditions, including depression. Antibiotics can induce substantial changes in the gastrointestinal microbiota and several lines of evidence suggest that antibiotics exposure may increase the risk of developing depression. This systematic review examined this potential association.PubMed, Ovid EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsychINFO databases, as well as unpublished resources, were searched for studies in humans published from 2000 onwards. The studies needed to consider the connection between antibiotic exposure (either alone or in combination with other antibiotics and medications) and the development of depressive symptoms and/or disorders (in isolation to other psychological conditions).Nine studies met the eligibility criteria. All were observational in nature. The studies were conducted in different age groups with various indications for receiving antibiotics. Together, these relatively low-quality studies suggest a potential association between antibiotic exposure and subsequent development of depression symptoms. Specifically, studies from the United Kingdom and Sweden indicate that the risk of depression is increased by at least 20%, with the former (over 1 million participants) reporting an increased risk with the number of courses and agents used, that persists with a slow decline over the ten years following exposure.The inherent limitations associated with the studies' methodologies make a reliable conclusion difficult. While the risk of antimicrobial resistance may prohibit large randomised clinical trials in healthy individuals, future placebo-controlled trials with antibiotics-based protocols (e.g. for acne) should explore their effect on mental health.",Journal of psychosomatic research,2023,Mahsa Pouranayatihosseinabad; Yihienew Bezabih; Jason Hawrelak; Gregory M Peterson; Felicity Veal; Corinne Mirkazemi
36493975,Key role of the gut-microbiota-brain axis via the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve in demyelination of the cuprizone-treated mouse brain.,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common demyelinating disease that attacks the central nervous system. Dietary intake of cuprizone (CPZ) produces demyelination resembling that of patients with MS. Given the role of the vagus nerve in gut-microbiota-brain axis in development of MS, we performed this study to investigate whether subdiaphragmatic vagotomy (SDV) affects demyelination in CPZ-treated mice. SDV significantly ameliorated demyelination and microglial activation in the brain compared with sham-operated CPZ-treated mice. Furthermore, 16S ribosomal RNA analysis revealed that SDV significantly improved the abnormal gut microbiota composition of CPZ-treated mice. An untargeted metabolomic analysis demonstrated that SDV significantly improved abnormal blood levels of metabolites in CPZ-treated mice compared with sham-operated CPZ-treated mice. Notably, there were correlations between demyelination or microglial activation in the brain and the relative abundance of several microbiome populations, suggesting a link between gut microbiota and the brain. There were also correlations between demyelination or microglial activation in the brain and blood levels of metabolites. Together, these data suggest that CPZ produces demyelination in the brain through the gut-microbiota-brain axis via the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve.",Neurobiology of disease,2023,Xingming Wang; Akifumi Eguchi; Yong Yang; Lijia Chang; Xiayun Wan; Jiajing Shan; Youge Qu; Li Ma; Chisato Mori; Jianjun Yang; Kenji Hashimoto
36244525,Combined oral contraceptives and mental health: Are adolescence and the gut-brain axis the missing links?,"Combined oral contraceptives (containing synthetic forms of estradiol and progestins) are one of the most commonly used drugs among females. However, their effects on the gut-brain axis have not been investigated to a great extent despite clear evidence that suggest bi-directional interactions between the gut microbiome and endogenous sex hormones. Moreover, oral contraceptives are prescribed during adolescence, a critical period of development during which several brain structures and systems, such as hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, undergo maturation. Considering that oral contraceptives could impact the developing adolescent brain and that these effects may be mediated by the gut-brain axis, further research investigating the effects of oral contraceptives on the gut-brain axis is imperative. This article briefly reviews evidence from animal and human studies on the effects of combined oral contraceptives on the brain and the gut microbiota particularly during adolescence.",Frontiers in neuroendocrinology,2023,Sarah Kheloui; Andra Smith; Nafissa Ismail

These samples were analysed using the Illumina 16S Metagenomics sequencing protocol in which the sequencing primers target the V3 and V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene. Participants also completed mental health questionnaires to assess severity of depression (BDI-II), generalized anxiety (GAD-7), and stress (PSS).There were no significant group differences in α-diversity (Shannon's diversity Index; Simpson Index), richness (ACE; Chao1), (Pielou's) evenness, or beta diversity (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index and weighted UniFrac distance) of gut bacteria. Significant group differences in the relative abundance of gut microbiota however were observed at each taxonomical level, including across 15 genera and 18 species.This was an exploratory study that needs to be replicated across larger samples and compared with a healthy control group.The research contributes to knowledge of the depressive gut microbial profile unique to the anxious distress subtype of MDD.",Journal of affective disorders,2023,Gabrielle Ritchie; Esben Strodl; Sophie Parham; Matthew Bambling; Susanna Cramb; Luis Vitetta
36056574,A Pilot Study of the Gut Microbiota Associated With Depressive Symptoms and Sleep Disturbance Among Chinese and Korean Immigrants in the United States.,"Depression is prevalent among Asian Americans (AsA) during the COVID-19 pandemic, and depression often leads to sleep disturbance in this population. The gut microbiota (GM) plays a critical role in mental health and sleep quality, and the composition of the GM is largely unknown among AsA.Examine associations of the GM with depressive symptoms and sleep disturbance among Chinese and Korean American immigrants.Depressive symptoms (PROMIS Short Form-Depression) and sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI]) were collected via surveys. PROMIS measure T-score > 55 indicates positive depressive symptoms, and a total PSQI score > 5 indicates sleep disturbance. 16S rRNA V3-V4 gene regions were sequenced from fecal specimens to measure GM. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance and linear discriminant analysis effect size were applied to examine associations of the GM with symptoms.Among 20 participants, 55% (<i>n</i> = 11) reported depressive symptoms and 35% (<i>n</i> = 7) reported sleep disturbance. A higher α-diversity was marginally associated with lower depressive symptoms: Chao1 (r = -0.39, <i>p</i> = 0.09) and Shannon index (r = -0.41, <i>p</i> = 0.08); β-diversity distinguished participants between categories of depressive symptoms (weighted UniFrac, <i>p</i>=0.04) or sleep disturbance (Jaccard, <i>p</i>=0.05). Those with depressive symptoms showed a higher abundance of <i>Actinobacteria,</i> while those without depressive symptoms had a higher abundance of <i>Bacteroidetes</i>. No significant taxa were identified for sleep disturbance.Gut microbial diversity showed promising associations with depressive symptoms and sleep disturbance among Chinese and Korean immigrants. Specific taxa were identified as associated with depressive symptoms. Future studies with a larger sample size are warranted to confirm our findings.",Biological research for nursing,2023,Chloe Hope; Natalie Shen; Wenhui Zhang; Hye In Noh; Vicki S Hertzberg; Sangmi Kim; Jinbing Bai
36017855,Gut-Brain Axis and Neurological Disorders-How Microbiomes Affect our Mental Health.,"The gut microbiota is an essential part of the gastrointestinal tract and recent research, including clinical and preclinical studies, shed light on the interaction between the gut and the brain. A rising amount of evidence strongly proves the involvement of gut microbes in brain function and their contribution in altering behavior, mood, and ultimately in the pathogenesis of certain neurological conditions. The gut microbiota produces and modulates neurotransmitters such as GABA, serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, etc. Furthermore, there is a presence of a biological link between the microbiota, immune signaling, and CNS suggesting that microbial metabolites could regulate both neurological and immunological activities in the brain. Thus, this review focuses on the bidirectional communication between the gut and brain, its impact and role in the modulation of various neurological disorders, such as schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, etc., and attempts to explore the underlying mechanism for the same. The article also discusses studies involving germ-free mice, studies on the effects of faeces transfer of microbiota, and research involving gut microbiota composition in animal models. The effects of probiotics and prebiotics on neurological disorders are also discussed, along with the clinical studies for each of them. In a nutshell, extensive studies are required to explore this bidirectional communication between the gut and brain, which might help researchers develop new therapeutic targets in treating neurological disorders and increase our understanding of the gut-brain axis.",CNS & neurological disorders drug targets,2023,Nirav Yogesh Bhatia; Manjiri Prabhakar Jalgaonkar; Anuja Balu Hargude; Atul P Sherje; Manisha Jignesh Oza; Gaurav Mahesh Doshi
35711028,The Immune System and Depression: From Epidemiological to Clinical Evidence.,"Depression is a frequent mental disorder with a substantial contribution to years lived with disability worldwide. In the search for new treatment targets, the immune system's contribution to the pathogenesis of depression has received increased attention as immune activation has been associated with depression in various epidemiological and case-control studies. Epidemiological studies have shown that immune exposures such as severe infections and autoimmune disorders increase the risk of depression. Furthermore, immune system activation has been indicated in case-control studies of depression revealing higher levels of key pro-inflammatory cytokines among patients with depression than healthy controls, particularly in blood and to some extent in the cerebrospinal fluid. Moreover, brain imaging studies indicate increased microglial activity during depression, and gut microbiota studies have documented alterations of gut microbiota composition to be associated with depression. Based on findings from animal and human studies, several immune-mediated molecular mechanisms have been suggested to underlie the association between increased immunological activity and depression. However, the research is challenged by the heterogeneity of the depression diagnosis and - to some extent - the precision of currently available technology for immune biomarker quantification, particularly regarding the assessment of low-grade neuroinflammation. Nonetheless, an enhanced understanding of the complex interactions between the immune system and the brain in the context of depression could pave the way for precision medicine approaches with immune-modulating treatment as a promising additional option in the treatment of depression.",Current topics in behavioral neurosciences,2023,Nina Vindegaard Sørensen; Michael Eriksen Benros
38663221,Effects of antipsychotics on the gastrointestinal microbiota: A systematic review.,"Antipsychotics (APs) have been increasingly prescribed for psychiatric disorders from schizophrenia to disruptive behavioral conditions. These drugs have been associated with considerable side effects, such as weight gain, and increasing evidence has also indicated that its use impacts gut microbiota (GM), although this connection is still little understood. To assess APs effects on the GM of patients starting or ongoing treatment, a systematic review was carried out in PubMed and Scopus databases. Twelve articles were considered eligible for the review, which investigated the effects of risperidone (5 studies), quetiapine (3), amilsupride (1), olanzapine (1), and unspecified atypical drugs (2). Eleven reported changes in GM in response to APs, and associations between the abundance of bacterial groups and different metabolic parameters were described by most of them. However, the studies were noticeably heterogeneous considering design, methods, and results. In this way, the effects of APs on GM composition and diversity were inconclusive. Despite the uncertain interactions, a more comprehensive understanding on how microbiota is affected by APs may help to optimize treatment, potentially minimizing side effects and improving adherence to treatment.",Psychiatry research,2024,Marcela França Dias; Yago Jean de Almeida Nogueira; Marco Aurélio Romano-Silva; Débora Marques de Miranda
38422755,Gut microbiota disturbances in hospitalized older adults with malnutrition and clinical outcomes.,"Malnutrition is one of the most threatening conditions in geriatric populations. The gut microbiota has an important role in the host's metabolic and muscular health: however, its interplay with disease-related malnutrition is not well understood. We aimed to identify the association of malnutrition with the gut microbiota and predict clinical outcomes in hospitalized acutely ill older adults.We performed a secondary longitudinal analysis in 108 geriatric patients from a prospective cohort evaluated at admission and 72 h of hospitalization. We collected clinical, demographic, nutritional, and 16S rRNA gene-sequenced gut microbiota data. Microbiota diversity, overall composition, and differential abundance were calculated and compared between patients with and without malnutrition. Microbiota features associated with malnutrition were used to predict clinical outcomes.Patients with malnutrition (51%) had a different microbiota composition compared to those who were well-nourished during hospitalization (ANOSIM R = 0.079, P = 0.003). Patients with severe malnutrition showed poorer α-diversity at admission (Shannon P = 0.012, Simpson P = 0.018) and follow-up (Shannon P = 0.023, Chao1 P = 0.008). Differential abundance of Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group, Subdoligranulum, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were significantly lower and inversely associated with malnutrition, while Corynebacterium, Ruminococcaceae Incertae Sedis, and Fusobacterium were significantly increased and positively associated with malnutrition. Corynebacterium, Ruminococcaceae Incertae Sedis, and the overall composition were important predictors of critical care in patients with malnutrition during hospitalization.Older adults with malnutrition, especially in a severe stage, may be subject to substantial gut microbial disturbances during hospitalization. The gut microbiota profile of patients with malnutrition might help us to predict worse clinical outcomes.","Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)",2024,Shirley S Muñoz-Fernandez; Flavia B Garcez; Julio C G Alencar; Amália A Bastos; John E Morley; Tommy Cederholm; Ivan Aprahamian; Heraldo P de Souza; Thiago J Avelino-Silva; Laure B Bindels; Sandra M L Ribeiro
38722169,"Preface: Special issue: ""Ion channels and genetic epilepsy"".","This preface introduces the Journal of Neurochemistry Special Issue on Advances in Epilepsy Research. Epilepsy is a devastating disease characterized by recurrent seizures. Despite the addition of numerous therapeutics over the last few decades epilepsy patients resistant to standard of care treatments remains stubbornly high. This highlights a clear unmet clinical need and the importance of new research into this disease. One major advance over the last two decades has been the recognition that genetic factors play a significant role in the underlying pathogenesis of epilepsy. Much of our insights into the pathogenic mechanisms underlying genetic epilepsy has come from research into genes that encode ion channels. In this issue, there are up-to-date reviews discussing epilepsy caused by variation in HCN channels, voltage-dependent sodium channels, voltage-dependent calcium channels, and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. The reviews highlight our understanding of the genotype-phenotype relationships and the identification of precision medicine approaches. Complimenting this is a review on metabolic aspects modulating ion channels in genetic disease. This issue also has fundamental research manuscripts investigating how currently approved drugs may rescue NMDA receptor dysfunction and how in vitro neuron cultures can be used to probe network scale deficits and drug impacts in SCN2A disease. Other primary data manuscripts include those focusing on metabolic therapies, gut microbiota, and new in vivo screening tools for identifying novel anti-seizure drugs. Collectively, manuscripts published as part of this edition highlight recent research gains, especially in our understanding of genetic causes of epilepsy involving ion channels.",Journal of neurochemistry,2024,Christopher A Reid
38582087,Gut bacteria-driven homovanillic acid alleviates depression by modulating synaptic integrity.,"The gut-brain axis is implicated in depression development, yet its underlying mechanism remains unclear. We observed depleted gut bacterial species, including Bifidobacterium longum and Roseburia intestinalis, and the neurotransmitter homovanillic acid (HVA) in individuals with depression and mouse depression models. Although R. intestinalis does not directly produce HVA, it enhances B. longum abundance, leading to HVA generation. This highlights a synergistic interaction among gut microbiota in regulating intestinal neurotransmitter production. Administering HVA, B. longum, or R. intestinalis to mouse models with chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) and corticosterone (CORT)-induced depression significantly improved depressive symptoms. Mechanistically, HVA inhibited synaptic autophagic death by preventing excessive degradation of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) and SQSTM1/p62 proteins, protecting hippocampal neurons' presynaptic membrane. These findings underscore the role of the gut microbial metabolism in modulating synaptic integrity and provide insights into potential novel treatment strategies for depression.",Cell metabolism,2024,Mingliang Zhao; Zhenxing Ren; Aihua Zhao; Yajun Tang; Junliang Kuang; Mengci Li; Tianlu Chen; Shouli Wang; Jieyi Wang; Huiheng Zhang; Jijun Wang; Tianhong Zhang; Jiahui Zeng; Xiaohua Liu; Guoxiang Xie; Penghong Liu; Ning Sun; Tianhao Bao; Tongtong Nie; Jingchao Lin; Ping Liu; Yuanyi Zheng; Xiaojiao Zheng; Tiemin Liu; Wei Jia
38700338,Association between gut microbiota dysbiosis and poor functional outcomes in acute ischemic stroke patients with COVID-19 infection.,"Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients with active COVID-19 infection often have more severe symptoms and worse recovery. COVID-19 infection can cause gut microbiota dysbiosis, which is also a risk factor for poor outcomes in AIS patients. However, the association between gut microbiota and functional outcomes among AIS patients with COVID-19 infection has not been fully clarified yet. In this study, we performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize the gut microbial community among AIS patients with acute COVID-19 infection, AIS patients with post-acute COVID-19 infection, and AIS patients without COVID-19 infection. We found that AIS patients with acute COVID-19 experienced poorer recovery and significant gut dysbiosis, characterized by higher levels of <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> and lower levels of <i>Ruminococcaceae</i> and <i>Lachnospiraceae</i>. Furthermore, a shorter time window (less than 28 days) between COVID-19 infection and stroke was identified as a risk factor for poor functional outcomes in AIS patients with COVID-19, and the enrichment of <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> was indicated as a mediator in the relationship between infection time window and poor stroke outcomes. Our findings highlight the importance of early intervention after COVID-19 infection, especially by regulating the gut microbiota, which plays a role in the prognosis of AIS patients with COVID-19 infection.IMPORTANCEThe gut microbiota plays an important role in the association between respiratory system and cerebrovascular system through the gut-lung axis and gut-brain axis. However, the specific connection between gut bacteria and the functional outcomes of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients with COVID-19 is not fully understood yet. In our study, we observed a significant decrease in bacterial diversity and shifts in the abundance of key bacterial families in AIS patients with acute COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, we identified that the time window was a critical influence factor for stroke outcomes, and the enrichment of <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> acted as a mediator in the relationship between the infection time window and poor stroke outcomes. Our research provides a new perspective on the complex interplay among AIS, COVID-19 infection, and gut microbiota dysbiosis. Moreover, recognizing <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> as a potential mediator of poor stroke prognosis offers a novel avenue for future exploration and therapeutic interventions.",mSystems,2024,Jiaying Chen; Xuxuan Gao; Jingru Liang; Qiheng Wu; Linlin Shen; Yifeng Zheng; Yu Ma; Yuping Peng; Yan He; Jia Yin
38707924,The influence of the gut-brain axis on anxiety and depression: A review of the literature on the use of probiotics.,"This review aims to argue how using probiotics can improve anxiety and depressive behaviour without adverse effects, also exploring the impact of postbiotics on it. Specifically, probiotics have drawn more attention as effective alternative treatments, considering the rising cost of antidepressant and anti-anxiety drugs and the high risk of side effects. Depression and anxiety disorders are among the most common mental illnesses in the world's population, characterised by low mood, poor general interest, and cognitive or motor dysfunction. Thus, this study analysed published literature on anxiety, depression, and probiotic supplementation from PubMed and Scopus, focusing on the last twenty years. This study focused on the effect of probiotics on mental health as they have drawn more attention because of their extensive clinical applications and positive impact on various diseases. Numerous studies have demonstrated how the gut microbiota might be critical for mood regulation and how probiotics can affect host health by regulating the gut-brain axis. By comparing the different works analysed, it was possible to identify a strategy by which they are selected and employed and, at the same time, to assess how the effect of probiotics can be optimised using postbiotics, an innovation to improve mental well-being in humans.",Journal of traditional and complementary medicine,2024,Sara Ferrari; Simone Mulè; Francesca Parini; Rebecca Galla; Sara Ruga; Giorgia Rosso; Arianna Brovero; Claudio Molinari; Francesca Uberti
38401573,A role of gut-brain axis on prophylactic actions of arketamine in male mice exposed to chronic restrain stress.,"The gut-brain axis, which includes gut microbiota and microbiome-derived metabolites, might be implicated in depression. We reported the sustained prophylactic effects of a new antidepressant arketamine in chronic restrain stress (CRS) model of depression. In this study, we investigated the role of gut-brain axis on the prophylactic effects of arketamine in the CRS (7 days) model. Pretreatment with arketamine (10 mg/kg, 1 day prior to the CRS onset) significantly prevented CRS-induced body weight loss, increased immobility time of forced swimming test, decreased sucrose preference of sucrose preference test, and reduced expressions of synaptic proteins (GluA1 and PSD-95) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in the male mice. Gut microbiota analysis showed that pretreatment with arketamine might restore altered abundance of gut microbiota in CRS-exposed mice. An untargeted metabolomics analysis revealed four metabolites (e.g., L-leucine, N-acetyl-l-glutamine, 2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-[4-(dimethylamino)phenyl]acrylonitrile, L-threonine amide) that were altered between control and CRS group; however, there were found to be altered between the saline + CRS group and the arketamine + CRS group. Network analysis demonstrated correlations among synaptic proteins in the PFC and certain microbiota, and blood metabolites. These findings suggest that gut-brain axis, including its metabolites, might partially contribute to the persistent prophylactic effects of arketamine in the CRS model.","Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior",2024,Li Ma; Akifumi Eguchi; Guilin Liu; Youge Qu; Xiayun Wan; Rumi Murayama; Chisato Mori; Kenji Hashimoto
38693730,Probiotics for Inflammatory Bowel Disease; A Deep Dive into their Impact on Disease Course and Associated Health Risks.,"To date, the underlying pathology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is undetermined. Disturbance of intestinal gut microbiota was implicated in many health diseases, including IBD. Increasing evidence suggests that probiotics play a beneficial role in restoring the balance of the gut ecosystem. This review searched multiple databases for relevant works that examined probiotics' possible benefits in adults with IBD. Probiotic mode of action in ulcerative colitis patients and Crohn's disease were examined with respect to probiotic strain, their benefits, and their advantages in adult cases. Eligible studies for inclusion were assessed and analyzed. They were effective in reducing IBD disease course, inducing and maintaining remission, particularly for ulcerative colitis patients, with good efficacy and safety profile. However, the evidence for Crohn's disease was lacking. Probiotics positively affect IBD-related risks, reducing the risk of gastrointestinal malignancy and optimizing treating them. Additionally, they improved reduced fertility odds for both genders. The osteoporosis risk among IBD patients was also reduced, although the duration of use and dose were still not established. There was an encouraging role for them in reducing IBD -cardiovascular risks among cases with acute myocardial infarction and those with chronic heart failure. Finally, they had novel use in reducing IBD-related depression and improved overall mental health. In conclusion, we recommend probiotics as an adjuvant therapeutic option for IBD therapy for ulcerative colitis; however, their role in Crohn's disease needs further research.",Current medicinal chemistry,2024,Wassan Nori Mohammed Hassan; Methaq Mueen Al-Kaabi; Nabeeha Najatee Akram; Mustafa Ali Kassim Kassim; Alexandru Cosmin Pantazi
38660662,Causal roles of gut microbiota in cholangiocarcinoma etiology suggested by genetic study.,"Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a highly malignant biliary tract cancer with poor prognosis. Previous studies have implicated the gut microbiota in CCA, but evidence for causal mechanisms is lacking.To investigate the causal relationship between gut microbiota and CCA risk.We performed a two-sample mendelian randomization study to evaluate potential causal associations between gut microbiota and CCA risk using genome-wide association study summary statistics for 196 gut microbial taxa and CCA. Genetic variants were used as instrumental variables. Multiple sensitivity analyses assessed result robustness.Fifteen gut microbial taxa showed significant causal associations with CCA risk. Higher genetically predicted abundance of <i>genus Eubacteriumnodatum group</i>, <i>genus Ruminococcustorques group</i>, <i>genus Coprococcus</i>, <i>genus Dorea</i>, and <i>phylum Actinobacteria</i> were associated with reduced risk of gallbladder cancer and extrahepatic CCA. Increased intrahepatic CCA risk was associated with higher abundance of <i>family Veillonellaceae</i>, <i>genus Alistipes</i>, <i>order Enterobacteriales</i>, and <i>phylum Firmicutes.</i> Protective effects against CCA were suggested for <i>genus Collinsella</i>, <i>genus Eisenbergiella</i>, <i>genus Anaerostipes</i>, <i>genus Paraprevotella</i>, <i>genus Parasutterella</i>, and <i>phylum Verrucomicrobia.</i> Sensitivity analyses indicated these findings were reliable without pleiotropy.This pioneering study provides novel evidence that specific gut microbiota may play causal roles in CCA risk.

38606523,"Current iron therapy in the light of regulation, intestinal microbiome, and toxicity: are we prescribing too much iron?","Iron deficiency is a widespread global health concern with varying prevalence rates across different regions. In developing countries, scarcity of food and chronic infections contribute to iron deficiency, while in industrialized nations, reduced food intake and dietary preferences affect iron status. Other causes that can lead to iron deficiency are conditions and diseases that result in reduced intestinal iron absorption and blood loss. In addition, iron absorption and its bioavailability are influenced by the composition of the diet. Individuals with increased iron needs, including infants, adolescents, and athletes, are particularly vulnerable to deficiency. Severe iron deficiency can lead to anemia with performance intolerance or shortness of breath. In addition, even without anemia, iron deficiency leads to mental and physical fatigue, which points to the fundamental biological importance of iron, especially in mitochondrial function and the respiratory chain. Standard oral iron supplementation often results in gastrointestinal side effects and poor compliance. Low-dose iron therapy seems to be a valid and reasonable therapeutic option due to reduced hepatic hepcidin formation, facilitating efficient iron resorption, replenishment of iron storage, and causing significantly fewer side effects. Elevated iron levels influence gut microbiota composition, favoring pathogenic bacteria and potentially disrupting metabolic and immune functions. Protective bacteria, such as bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, are particularly susceptible to increased iron levels. Dysbiosis resulting from iron supplementation may contribute to gastrointestinal disorders, inflammatory bowel disease, and metabolic disturbances. Furthermore, gut microbiota alterations have been linked to mental health issues. Future iron therapy should consider low-dose supplementation to mitigate adverse effects and the impact on the gut microbiome. A comprehensive understanding of the interplay between iron intake, gut microbiota, and human health is crucial for optimizing therapeutic approaches and minimizing potential risks associated with iron supplementation.",Critical reviews in clinical laboratory sciences,2024,Anaëlle L Dentand; Morton G Schubert; Pierre-Alexandre Krayenbuehl

Some researches indicate that abnormalities in the gut microbiota can trigger certain psychiatric diseases. Microbiota-derived extracellular vesicles have the ability to transfer bioactive compounds into host cells, altering signaling and biological processes, ultimately influencing the mental health and illness of the host. This review aims to investigate the emerging roles of microbiota-derived extracellular vesicles in these three major psychiatric disorders and discusses their roles as diagnostic biomarkers and therapies for these psychiatric disorders.",Frontiers in microbiology,2024,Chuang Guo; Yulong Bai; Pengfei Li; Kuanjun He
38589422,Transplantation of gut microbiota derived from patients with schizophrenia induces schizophrenia-like behaviors and dysregulated brain transcript response in mice.,"Schizophrenia (SCZ), as a neurodevelopmental disorder and devastating disease, affects approximately 1% of the world population. Although numerous studies have attempted to elucidate the causes of SCZ occurrence, it is not clearly understood. Recently, the emerging roles of the gut microbiota in a range of brain disorders, including SCZ, have attracted much attention. While the molecular mechanism of gut microbiota in regulating the pathogenesis of SCZ is still lacking. Here, we first confirmed the difference of gut microbiome between SCZ patients and healthy controls, and then, we performed fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to clarify the roles of SCZ patients-derived microbiota in a specific pathogen free (SPF) mice model. 16 S rDNA sequencing confirmed that a significant difference of gut microbiome was present between two groups of FMT mice, which has a similar trend with the above human gut microbiome. Furthermore, we found that transplantation of fecal microbiota from SCZ patients into SPF mice was sufficient to induce schizophrenia-like (SCZ-like) symptoms, such as deficits in sociability and hyperactivity. Furthermore, the brains of mice colonized with SCZ microbiota displayed dysregulated transcript response and alternative splicing of SCZ-relevant genes. Moreover, 10 key genes were identified to be correlated with SCZ by an integrative transcriptome data analysis. Finally, 4 key genes were identified to be correlated with the 12 differential genera between two groups of FMT mice. Our results thus demonstrated that the gut microbiome might modify the transcriptomic profile in the brain, thereby modulating social behavior, and our present study can help better understand the link between gut microbiota and SCZ pathogenesis through the gut-brain axis.","Schizophrenia (Heidelberg, Germany)",2024,Nana Wei; Mingliang Ju; Xichen Su; Yan Zhang; Yonghe Huang; Xinyue Rao; Li Cui; Zhibing Lin; Yi Dong

38613087,The Power of Psychobiotics in Depression: A Modern Approach through the Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis: A Literature Review.,"The microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis is a complex communication network linking the gut, microbiota, and brain, influencing various aspects of health and disease. Dysbiosis, a disturbance in the gut microbiome equilibrium, can significantly impact the MGB axis, leading to alterations in microbial composition and function. Emerging evidence highlights the connection between microbiota alterations and neurological and psychiatric disorders, including depression. This review explores the potential of psychobiotics in managing depressive disorders, emphasizing their role in restoring microbial balance and influencing the MGB axis. Psychobiotics exhibit positive effects on the intestinal barrier, immune response, cortisol levels, and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Studies suggest that probiotics may serve as an adjunct therapy for depression, especially in treatment-resistant cases. This review discusses key findings from studies on psychobiotics interventions, emphasizing their impact on the gut-brain axis and mental health. The increasing acceptance of the expanded concept of the MGB axis underscores the importance of microorganisms in mental well-being. As our understanding of the microbiome's role in health and disease grows, probiotics emerge as promising agents for addressing mental health issues, providing new avenues for therapeutic interventions in depressive disorders.",Nutrients,2024,Angela Dziedzic; Karina Maciak; Katarzyna Bliźniewska-Kowalska; Małgorzata Gałecka; Weronika Kobierecka; Joanna Saluk
38488514,Ginsenoside Rk3 Regulates Tryptophan Metabolism along the Brain-Gut Axis by Targeting Tryptophan Hydroxylase and Remodeling the Intestinal Microenvironment to Alleviate Depressive-Like Behavior in Mice.,"Depression is a neuropsychiatric disease that significantly impacts the physical and mental health of >300 million people worldwide and places a major burden on society. Ginsenosides are the main active ingredient in ginseng and have been proven to have various pharmacological effects on the nervous system. Herein, we investigated the antidepressant effect of ginsenoside Rk3 and its underlying mechanism in a murine model of depression. Rk3 significantly improved depression-like behavior in mice, ameliorated the disturbance of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, and alleviated neuronal damage in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of mice. Additionally, Rk3 improved the abnormal metabolism of tryptophan in brain tissue by targeting tryptophan hydroxylase, thereby reducing neuronal apoptosis and synaptic structural damage in the mouse hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, Rk3 reshaped the composition of the gut microbiota of mice and regulated intestinal tryptophan metabolism, which alleviated intestinal barrier damage. Thus, this study provides valuable insights into the role of Rk3 in the tryptophan metabolic cycle along the brain-gut axis, suggesting that Rk3 may have the potential for treating depression.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2024,Jingjing Shao; Linlin Qu; Yao Liu; Jingjing Zhang; Yannan Liu; Jianjun Deng; Xiaoxuan Ma; Daidi Fan
38565567,Gamma-aminobutyric acid as a potential postbiotic mediator in the gut-brain axis.,"Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) plays a crucial role in the central nervous system as an inhibitory neurotransmitter. Imbalances of this neurotransmitter are associated with neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, and psychological disorders, including anxiety, depression, and stress. Since GABA has long been believed to not cross the blood-brain barrier, the effects of circulating GABA on the brain are neglected. However, emerging evidence has demonstrated that changes in both circulating and brain levels of GABA are associated with changes in gut microbiota composition and that changes in GABA levels and microbiota composition play a role in modulating mental health. This recent research has raised the possibility that GABA may be a potent mediator of the gut-brain axis. This review article will cover up-to-date information about GABA-producing microorganisms isolated from human gut and food sources, explanation why those microorganisms produce GABA, food factors inducing gut-GABA production, evidence suggesting GABA as a mediator linking between gut microbiota and mental health, including anxiety, depression, stress, epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and novel information regarding homocarnosine-a predominant brain peptide that is a putative downstream mediator of GABA in regulating brain functions. This review will help us to understand how the gut microbiota and GABA-homocarnosine metabolism play a significant role in brain functions. Nonetheless, it could support further research on the use of GABA production-inducing microorganisms and food factors as agents to treat neurological and psychological disorders.",NPJ science of food,2024,Jason D Braga; Masubon Thongngam; Thanutchaporn Kumrungsee
38421192,Sleep deprivation-induced anxiety-like behaviors are associated with alterations in the gut microbiota and metabolites.,"The present study aimed to characterize the gut microbiota and serum metabolome changes associated with sleep deprivation (SD) as well as to explore the potential benefits of multi-probiotic supplementation in alleviating SD-related mental health disorders. Rats were subjected to 7 days of SD, followed by 14 days of multi-probiotics or saline administration. Open-field tests were conducted at baseline, end of SD (day 7), and after 14 days of saline or multi-probiotic gavage (day 21). Metagenomic sequencing was conducted on fecal samples, and serum metabolites were measured by untargeted liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry. At day 7, anxiety-like behaviors, including significant decreases in total movement distance (<i>P</i> = 0.0002) and staying time in the central zone (<i>P</i> = 0.021), were observed. In addition, increased levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; <i>P</i> = 0.028) and decreased levels of uridine (<i>P</i> = 0.018) and tryptophan (<i>P</i> = 0.01) were detected in rats after 7 days of SD. After SD, the richness of the gut bacterial community increased, and the levels of <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i>, <i>Muribaculum intestinale</i>, and <i>Bacteroides caecimuris</i> decreased. The changes in the host metabolism and gut microbiota composition were strongly associated with the anxiety-like behaviors caused by SD. In addition, multi-probiotic supplementation for 14 days modestly improved the anxiety-like behaviors in SD rats but significantly reduced the serum level of LPS (<i>P</i> = 0.045). In conclusion, SD induces changes in the gut microbiota and serum metabolites, which may contribute to the development of chronic inflammatory responses and affect the gut-brain axis, causing anxiety-like behaviors. Probiotic supplementation significantly reduces serum LPS, which may alleviate the influence of chronic inflammation.The disturbance in the gut microbiome and serum metabolome induced by SD may be involved in anxiety-like behaviors. Probiotic supplementation decreases serum levels of LPS, but this reduction may be insufficient for alleviating SD-induced anxiety-like behaviors.",Microbiology spectrum,2024,Nana Zhang; Xuefeng Gao; Donghao Li; Lijuan Xu; Guanzhou Zhou; Mengqi Xu; Lihua Peng; Gang Sun; Fei Pan; Yan Li; Rongrong Ren; Ruolan Huang; Yunsheng Yang; Zikai Wang
38508549,Along the microbiota-gut-brain axis: Use of plant polysaccharides to improve mental disorders.,"With the development of gut microbiota-specific interventions for mental disorders, the interactions between plant polysaccharides and microbiota in the intestinal and their consequent effects are becoming increasingly important. In this review, we discussed the role of plant polysaccharides in improving various mental disorders via the microbiota-gut-brain axis. The chemical and structural characteristics and metabolites of these plant polysaccharides were summarised. Plant polysaccharides and their metabolites have great potential for reshaping gut microbiota profiles through gut microbiota-dependent fermentation. Along the microbiota-gut-brain axis, the consequent pharmacological processes that lead to the elimination of the symptoms of mental disorders include 1) regulation of the central monoamine neurotransmitters, amino acid transmitters and cholinergic signalling system; 2) alleviation of central and peripheral inflammation mainly through the NLRP3/NF-κB-related signalling pathway; 3) inhibition of neuronal apoptosis; and 4) enhancement of antioxidant activities. According to this review, monosaccharide glucose and structure -4-α-Glcp-(1→ are the most potent compositions of the most reported plant polysaccharides. However, the causal structure-activity relationship remains to be extensively explored. Moreover, mechanistic elucidation, safety verification, and additional rigorous human studies are expected to advance plant polysaccharide-based product development targeting the microbiota-gut-brain axis for people with mental disorders.",International journal of biological macromolecules,2024,Jiayu Gao; Ying Liang; Pu Liu
38417224,Integrated multi-omics analysis reveals gut microbiota dysbiosis and systemic disturbance in major depressive disorder.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) involves systemic changes in peripheral blood and gut microbiota, but the current understanding is incomplete. Herein, we conducted a multi-omics analysis of fecal and blood samples obtained from an observational cohort including MDD patients (n = 99) and healthy control (HC, n = 50). 16S rRNA sequencing of gut microbiota showed structural alterations in MDD, as characterized by increased Enterococcus. Metagenomics sequencing of gut microbiota showed substantial functional alterations including upregulation in the superpathway of the glyoxylate cycle and fatty acid degradation and downregulation in various metabolic pathways in MDD. Plasma metabolomics revealed decreased amino acids and bile acids, together with increased sphingolipids and cholesterol esters in MDD. Notably, metabolites involved in arginine and proline metabolism were decreased while sphingolipid metabolic pathway were increased. Mass cytometry analysis of blood immune cell subtypes showed rises in proinflammatory immune subsets and declines in anti-inflammatory immune subsets in MDD. Furthermore, our findings revealed disease severity-related factors of MDD. Interestingly, we classified MDD into two immune subtypes that were highly correlated with disease relapse. Moreover, we established discriminative signatures that differentiate MDD from HC. These findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the MDD pathogenesis and provide valuable resources for the discovery of biomarkers.",Psychiatry research,2024,Zuoquan Xie; Jingjing Huang; Guangqiang Sun; Shen He; Zhiyu Luo; Linna Zhang; Liang Li; Min Yao; Chen Du; Wenjuan Yu; Yuan Feng; Dabing Yang; Jing Zhang; Changrong Ge; Huafang Li; Meiyu Geng
38606411,Markers of intestinal barrier damage in patients with chronic insomnia disorder.,"Insomnia disorder stands out as one of the prevalent clinical sleep and psychiatric disorders. Prior research has unequivocally demonstrated variations in the diversity and abundance of gut microbiota among individuals with insomnia disorder. These alterations may play a direct or indirect role in the onset and progression of insomnia disorder by compromising the integrity of the intestinal barrier. This study aims to evaluate the impairment of the intestinal barrier in individuals with insomnia disorder by scrutinizing the serum functionality of this barrier.45 patients with chronic insomnia disorder and 30 matched healthy volunteers were meticulously selected based on inclusion criteria. ELISA technology was employed to measure serum levels of diamine oxidase (DAO), D-lactic acid (D-LA), intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP), and endothelin (ET). Spearman correlation analysis was used to explore the relationship between intestinal mucosal markers and clinical characteristics. Data were analyzed using SPSS 26.0.Compared to the healthy control group, the insomnia disorder group exhibited significantly elevated scores on subjective mood and sleep scales (GAD-7, PHQ-9, HAMA, HAMD, PSQI, and ISI) (P < 0.05). Overnight PSG indicated a notable increase in bed time, total wake time, sleep onset latency, and wake after sleep onset in individuals with insomnia disorder. Additionally, there was a decrease in sleep efficiency and alterations in sleep structure (increased proportion of N1 and N3 stages, prolonged N1 stage) (P < 0.05). The chronic insomnia disorder group displayed significantly reduced concentrations of serum DAO, D-LA, I-FABP, and ET (P < 0.05). Furthermore, significant positive correlations were identified between intestinal epithelial barrier markers and sleep efficiency, while negative correlations were found with wake after sleep onset, total wake time, PSQI, HAMA, and HAMD. Additionally, D-LA levels were significantly positively correlated with ET concentrations.Individuals with chronic insomnia disorder manifest disruptions in sleep structure, heightened susceptibility to anxiety and depressive moods, and impaired intestinal barrier function. These findings suggest that the occurrence and development of insomnia disorder may be linked to the impairment of the intestinal barrier.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2024,Yixian Cai; Di Gong; Ting Xiang; Xiaotao Zhang; Jiyang Pan
38576868,Bipolar disorder and the gut microbiota: a bibliometric analysis.,"Previous studies have explored the relationship between bipolar disorder and gut microbiota. However, there has been no bibliometric analysis to summarize and analyze these publications. Our objective was to perform a bibliometric analysis to investigate the current status and frontiers of the publications in the field of the association between bipolar disorder and the gut microbiota.We retrieved publications concerning the interplay between the gut microbiota and bipolar disorder from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC). The analysis was executed using WoSCC's literature analysis tool and VOSviewer 1.6.16.In total, we identified 177 publications originating from 362 institutions across 39 countries/regions, and these articles were disseminated in 104 different journals. The most productive institutions, authors, countries/regions, and journals were Zhejiang University contributing 18 publications, Shaohua Hu authoring 12 publications, China with 53 publications, and <i>Frontiers in Psychiatry</i> with 11 publications. The first high-cited document was published in the Journal of Psychiatric Research in 2017, and authored by Evans. In this article, they found gut microbiome composition was associated with BD and its illness severity, and they concluded that targeting the gut microbiota may be helpful to develop the effective treatment for bipolar disorder. The top 5 keywords with the highest frequency except for bipolar disorder and gut microbiota were as follows: depression, inflammation, probiotic, gut-brain axis, and anxiety.In conclusion, this is the first bibliometric analysis to explore the publications in the field of the association between bipolar disorder and the gut microbiota. The main research hotspots regarding this field were the characteristics, abundance, and diversity of gut microbiome in bipolar disorder, the role of treatment and gut microbiome in bipolar disorder, microbiome-brain connections in bipolar disorder, and interventions for bipolar disorder based on microbiota composition modification. The number of studies about the association between gut microbiota and bipolar disorder is relatively small, and more studies are needed to expand our understanding the association between gut microbiota and bipolar disorder.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2024,Xiaoxiao Lin; Jinyu Huang; Shuai Wang; Kai Zhang
38479554,Social isolation induces intestinal barrier disorder and imbalances gut microbiota in mice.,"Social isolation, a known stressor, can have detrimental effects on both physical and mental health. Recent scientific attention has been drawn to the gut-brain axis, a bidirectional communication system between the central nervous system and gut microbiota, suggesting that gut microbes may influence brain function. This study aimed to explore the impact of social isolation on the intestinal barrier and gut microbiota. 40 male BALB/c mice were either individually housed or kept in groups for 8 and 15 weeks. Socially isolated mice exhibited increased anxiety-like behavior, with significant differences between the 8-week and 15-week isolation groups (P < 0.05). After 8 weeks of isolation, there was a reduction in tight junction protein expression in the intestinal mechanical barrier. Furthermore, after 15 weeks of isolation, both tight junction protein and mucin expression, key components of the intestinal chemical barrier, decreased. This was accompanied by a substantial increase in inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 mRNA, IL-10, and TNF-α) in colon tissue in the 15-week isolated group (P < 0.05). Additionally, Illumina MiSequencing revealed significant alterations in the gut microbiota of socially isolated mice, including reduced Firmicutes and Bacteroides compared to the control group. Lactobacillus levels also decreased in the socially isolated mice.",Neuroscience letters,2024,Yue Wang; Hidayat Ullah; Ting Deng; Xinxiu Ren; Zinan Zhao; Yi Xin; Juanjuan Qiu
38458803,Multicomponent (bio)markers for obesity risk prediction: a scoping review protocol.,"Despite international efforts, the number of individuals struggling with obesity is still increasing. An important aspect of obesity prevention relates to identifying individuals at risk at early stage, allowing for timely risk stratification and initiation of countermeasures. However, obesity is complex and multifactorial by nature, and one isolated (bio)marker is unlikely to enable an optimal risk stratification and prognosis for the individual; rather, a combined set is required. Such a multicomponent interpretation would integrate biomarkers from various domains, such as classical markers (eg, anthropometrics, blood lipids), multiomics (eg, genetics, proteomics, metabolomics), lifestyle and behavioural attributes (eg, diet, physical activity, sleep patterns), psychological traits (mental health status such as depression) and additional host factors (eg, gut microbiota diversity), also by means of advanced interpretation tools such as machine learning. In this paper, we will present a protocol that will be employed for a scoping review that attempts to summarise and map the state-of-the-art in the area of multicomponent (bio)markers related to obesity, focusing on the usability and effectiveness of such biomarkers.PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL and Embase databases will be searched using predefined key terms to identify peer-reviewed articles published in English until January 2024. Once downloaded into EndNote for deduplication, CADIMA will be employed to review and select abstracts and full-text articles in a two-step procedure, by two independent reviewers. Data extraction will then be carried out by several independent reviewers. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews and Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies guidelines will be followed. Combinations employing at least two biomarkers from different domains will be mapped and discussed.Ethical approval is not required; data will rely on published articles. Findings will be published open access in an international peer-reviewed journal. This review will allow guiding future directions for research and public health strategies on obesity prevention, paving the way towards multicomponent interventions.",BMJ open,2024,Farhad Vahid; Coralie Dessenne; Josep A Tur; Cristina Bouzas; Yvan Devaux; Laurent Malisoux; Margalida Monserrat-Mesquida; Antoni Sureda; Mahesh S Desai; Jonathan D Turner; Elsa Lamy; Maria Perez-Jimenez; Gitte Ravn-Haren; Rikke Andersen; Sarah Forberger; Rajini Nagrani; Yacine Ouzzahra; Michele Filippo Fontefrancesco; Maria Giovanna Onorati; Gino Gabriel Bonetti; Tiziana de-Magistris; Torsten Bohn
38463411,A Possible Role of Akkermansia muciniphila in the Treatment of Olanzapine-Induced Weight Gain.,"Second-generation antipsychotics are mainly used in both acute and long-term treatment of major psychiatric disorders. Although better tolerated than first-generation antipsychotic drugs, they can frequently induce weight gain and metabolic disorders, of these, olanzapine is one of the drugs more likely to induce these side effects. There is consistent evidence of the role of gut microbiota in modulating the gut-brain axis with complex crosstalk with the host involving satiety signaling pathways, food intake behavior, and weight and metabolic regulation. Second-generation antipsychotics induce important gut microbiota modification thus contributing together with the central and peripheral receptors blockade mechanism to weight gain induction and metabolic impairment. These drugs can alter the composition of gut microbiota and induce dysbiosis, often reducing the concentration of <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i>, a bacterium that is also decreased in patients with diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, or chronic inflammatory diseases. Probiotic administration can be a safe and well-tolerated approach to modulate microbiota and offer an integrative strategy in psychiatric patients suffering antipsychotic side effects. Multiple strain probiotics and <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> alone have been administered both in mice models and in clinical populations demonstrating efficacy on antipsychotic-induced metabolic impairment and showing a contribution in reducing induced weight gain. <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> can improve several parameters altered by olanzapine administration, such as weight gain, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, liver function, systemic inflammation, and gut barrier function. Although we do not have jet trials in the psychiatric population, this probiotic may be a complementary approach to treating olanzapine-induced weight gain and metabolic side effects.",Cureus,2024,Francesca Bertossi
38426291,The microbiota-gut-brain axis in Huntington's disease: pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic targets.,"Huntington's disease (HD) is a currently incurable neurogenerative disorder and is typically characterized by progressive movement disorder (including chorea), cognitive deficits (culminating in dementia), psychiatric abnormalities (the most common of which is depression), and peripheral symptoms (including gastrointestinal dysfunction). There are currently no approved disease-modifying therapies available for HD, with death usually occurring approximately 10-25 years after onset, but some therapies hold promising potential. HD subjects are often burdened by chronic diarrhea, constipation, esophageal and gastric inflammation, and a susceptibility to diabetes. Our understanding of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in HD is in its infancy and growing evidence from preclinical and clinical studies suggests a role of gut microbial population imbalance (gut dysbiosis) in HD pathophysiology. The gut and the brain can communicate through the enteric nervous system, immune system, vagus nerve, and microbiota-derived-metabolites including short-chain fatty acids, bile acids, and branched-chain amino acids. This review summarizes supporting evidence demonstrating the alterations in bacterial and fungal composition that may be associated with HD. We focus on mechanisms through which gut dysbiosis may compromise brain and gut health, thus triggering neuroinflammatory responses, and further highlight outcomes of attempts to modulate the gut microbiota as promising therapeutic strategies for HD. Ultimately, we discuss the dearth of data and the need for more longitudinal and translational studies in this nascent field. We suggest future directions to improve our understanding of the association between gut microbes and the pathogenesis of HD, and other 'brain and body disorders'.",The FEBS journal,2024,Millicent N Ekwudo; Carolina Gubert; Anthony J Hannan
38331354,Depression-like phenotypes in mice following common bile duct ligation: Insights into the gut-liver-brain axis via the vagus nerve.,"Depression frequently occurs in patients with liver cirrhosis, yet the reasons for this correlation are not fully understood. Dysbiosis of gut microbiota has been implicated in depression through the gut-brain axis via the vagus nerve. This study explored the potential role of the gut-liver-brain axis via the vagus nerve in depression-like phenotypes in mice with liver cirrhosis. These mice underwent common bile duct ligation (CBDL), a method used to stimulate liver cirrhosis. To assess depression-like behaviors, behavioral tests were conducted 10 days following either sham or CBDL surgeries. The mice with CBDL displayed symptoms such as splenomegaly, elevated plasma levels of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α, depression-like behaviors, decreased levels of synaptic proteins in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), disrupted gut microbiota balance, and changes in blood metabolites (or lipids). Additionally, there were positive or negative correlations between the relative abundance of microbiome and behavioral data or blood metabolites (or lipids). Significantly, these changes were reversed in CBDL mice by performing a subdiaphragmatic vagotomy. Intriguingly, depression-like phenotypes in mice with CBDL were improved after a single injection of arketamine, a new antidepressant. These results suggest that CBDL-induced depression-like phenotypes in mice are mediated through the gut-liver-brain axis via the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve, and that arketamine might offer a new treatment approach for depression in liver cirrhosis patients.",Neurobiology of disease,2024,Yong Yang; Akifumi Eguchi; Chisato Mori; Kenji Hashimoto
38327077,Metagenomic Analysis Reveals Difference of Gut Microbiota in ADHD.,"Although ADHD is highly heritable, some environmental factors contribute to its development. Given the growing evidence that gut microbiota was involved in psychiatric disorders, we aimed to identify the characteristic composition of the gut microbiota in ADHD.We recruited 47 medication-naive children and adolescents with ADHD, and 60 healthy controls (HCs). We used shotgun metagenomics to measure the structure of the gut microbiota and analyzed the difference in bacterial taxa between ADHD and HCs.Significant differences were found between the ADHD and HC groups in both alpha diversity indices (Simpson index, <i>p</i> = .025 and Shannon index, <i>p</i> = .049) and beta diversity indices (Euclidean distance, Bray-Curtis distance, and JSD distance, <i>p</i> < 2.2e-16). Nine representative species best explain the difference.Patients with ADHD showed significant differences in the composition of the gut microbiota compared with HCs. These results may help identify potential biomarkers of ADHD.",Journal of attention disorders,2024,Ning Wang; Haibin Wang; Yu Bai; Yilu Zhao; Xiangyu Zheng; Xuping Gao; Zifeng Zhang; Li Yang
38317780,Gut microbiota regulate stress resistance by influencing microglia-neuron interactions in the hippocampus.,"Communication among the brain, gut and microbiota in the gut is known to affect the susceptibility to stress, but the mechanisms involved are unclear. Here we demonstrated that stress resistance in mice was associated with more abundant <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Akkermansia</i> in the gut, but less abundant <i>Bacteroides, Alloprevotella, Helicobacter, Lachnoclostridium, Blautia, Roseburia, Colidextibacter</i> and <i>Lachnospiraceae NK4A136</i>. Stress-sensitive animals showed higher permeability and stronger immune responses in their colon, as well as higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum. Their hippocampus also showed more extensive microglial activation, abnormal interactions between microglia and neurons, and lower synaptic plasticity. Transplanting fecal microbiota from stress-sensitive mice into naïve ones perturbed microglia-neuron interactions and impaired synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, translating to more depression-like behavior after stress exposure. Conversely, transplanting fecal microbiota from stress-resistant mice into naïve ones protected microglia from activation and preserved synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, leading to less depression-like behavior after stress exposure. These results suggested that gut microbiota may influence resilience to chronic psychological stress by regulating microglia-neuron interactions in the hippocampus.","Brain, behavior, & immunity - health",2024,Haili He; Hui He; Li Mo; Qingsong Yuan; Chenghong Xiao; Qiman Ma; Saini Yi; Tao Zhou; Zili You; Jinqiang Zhang
38278378,Fermented foods: Harnessing their potential to modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis for mental health.,"Over the past two decades, whole food supplementation strategies have been leveraged to target mental health. In addition, there has been increasing attention on the ability of gut microbes, so called psychobiotics, to positively impact behaviour though the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Fermented foods offer themselves as a combined whole food microbiota modulating intervention. Indeed, they contain potentially beneficial microbes, microbial metabolites and other bioactives, which are being harnessed to target the microbiota-gut-brain axis for positive benefits. This review highlights the diverse nature of fermented foods in terms of the raw materials used and type of fermentation employed, and summarises their potential to shape composition of the gut microbiota, the gut to brain communication pathways including the immune system and, ultimately, modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Throughout, we identify knowledge gaps and challenges faced in designing human studies for investigating the mental health-promoting potential of individual fermented foods or components thereof. Importantly, we also suggest solutions that can advance understanding of the therapeutic merit of fermented foods to modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis.",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,2024,Ramya Balasubramanian; Elizabeth Schneider; Eoin Gunnigle; Paul D Cotter; John F Cryan
38421082,Unraveling the gut-brain connection: The association of microbiota-linked structural brain biomarkers with behavior and mental health.,"The gut microbiota can influence human behavior. However, due to the massive multiple-testing problem, research into the relationship between microbiome ecosystems and the human brain faces drawbacks. This problem arises when attempting to correlate thousands of gut bacteria with thousands of brain voxels.We performed brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans on 133 participants and applied machine-learning algorithms (Ridge regressions) combined with permutation tests. Using this approach, we were able to correlate specific gut bacterial families with brain MRI signals, circumventing the difficulties of massive multiple testing while considering sex, age, and body mass index as confounding factors.The relative abundance (RA) of the Selenomonadaceae, Clostridiaceae, and Veillonellaceae families in the gut was associated with altered cerebellar, visual, and frontal T2-mapping and diffusion tensor imaging measures. Conversely, decreased relative abundance of the Eubacteriaceae family was also linked to T2-mapping values in the cerebellum. Significantly, the brain regions associated with the gut microbiome were also correlated with depressive symptoms and attentional deficits.Our analytical strategy offers a promising approach for identifying potential brain biomarkers influenced by gut microbiota. By gathering a deeper understanding of the microbiota-brain connection, we can gain insights into the underlying mechanisms and potentially develop targeted interventions to mitigate the detrimental effects of dysbiosis on brain function and mental health.",Psychiatry and clinical neurosciences,2024,Oren Contreras-Rodriguez; Gerard Blasco; Carles Biarnés; Josep Puig; Maria Arnoriaga-Rodríguez; Clàudia Coll-Martinez; Jordi Gich; Lluís Ramió-Torrentà; Anna Motger-Albertí; Vicente Pérez-Brocal; Andrés Moya; Joaquim Radua; José Manuel Fernández-Real
38409102,"Microbial composition, functionality, and stress resilience or susceptibility: unraveling sex-specific patterns.","Following exposure to traumatic stress, women are twice as likely as men to develop mood disorders. Yet, individual responses to such stress vary, with some people developing stress-induced psychopathologies while others exhibit resilience. The factors influencing sex-related disparities in affective disorders as well as variations in resilience remain unclear; however, emerging evidence suggests differences in the gut microbiota play a role. In this study, using the single prolonged stress (SPS) model of post-traumatic stress disorder, we investigated pre- and post-existing differences in microbial composition, functionality, and metabolites that affect stress susceptibility or resilience in each sex.Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to control or SPS groups. Two weeks following SPS, the animals were exposed to a battery of behavioral tests and decapitated a day later. Based on their anxiety index, they were further categorized as SPS-resilient (SPS-R) or SPS-susceptible (SPS-S). On the day of dissection, cecum, and selected brain tissues were isolated. Stool samples were collected before and after SPS, whereas urine samples were taken before and 30 min into the SPS.Before SPS exposure, the sympathoadrenal axis exhibited alterations within male subgroups only. Expression of tight junction protein claudin-5 was lower in brain of SPS-S males, but higher in SPS-R females following SPS. Across the study, alpha diversity remained consistently lower in males compared to females. Beta diversity revealed distinct separations between male and female susceptible groups before SPS, with this separation becoming evident in the resilient groups following SPS. At the genus level, Lactobacillus, Lachnospiraceae_Incertae_Sedis, and Barnesiella exhibited sex-specific alterations, displaying opposing abundances in each sex. Additionally, sex-specific changes were observed in microbial predictive functionality and targeted functional modules both before and after SPS. Alterations in the microbial short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), were also observed, with major and minor SCFAs being lower in SPS-susceptible males whereas branched-chain SCFAs being higher in SPS-susceptible females.This study highlights distinct pre- and post-trauma differences in microbial composition, functionality, and metabolites, associated with stress resilience in male and female rats. The findings underscore the importance of developing sex-specific therapeutic strategies to effectively address stress-related disorders. Highlights SPS model induces divergent anxiety and social behavioral responses to traumatic stress in both male and female rodents. SPS-resilient females displayed less anxiety-like behavior and initiated more interactions towards a juvenile rat than SPS-resilient males. Sex-specific pre-existing and SPS-induced differences in the gut microbial composition and predictive functionality were observed in susceptible and resilient rats. SPS-resilient males displayed elevated cecal acetate levels, whereas SPS-susceptible females exhibited heightened branched-chain SCFAs.",Biology of sex differences,2024,Arax Tanelian; Bistra Nankova; Mariam Miari; Esther L Sabban
38381349,Adjunctive efficacy of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis XLTG11 for functional constipation in children.,"Functional constipation (FC) can seriously affect the physical and mental health of children. The goal of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis XLTG11 in treating FC in children through a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled approach. Eligible children were randomized into either the intervention group (IG, n = 65, receiving conventional treatment with probiotics) or the control group (CG, n = 66, receiving conventional treatment without probiotics). The primary outcome measure was fecal frequency. Fecal gut microbiota analysis and PICRUSt (Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States) were used to predict gene family abundances based on 16S information. Over the course of treatment, the weekly frequency of feces within each group increased significantly (F = 41.97, p < 0.001). The frequency of feces (times/week (t/w)) in the IG was significantly higher than that in the CG (3.69 ± 2.62 t/w vs.3.18 ± 1.43 t/w, 4.03 ± 2.54 t/w vs. 2.89 ± 1.39 t/w and 3.74 ± 2.36 t/w vs. 2.94 ± 1.18 t/w and 3.45 ± 1.98 vs. 3.17 ± 1.41 t/w for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th week after intervention, respectively) (F = 7.60, p = 0.0067). After the intervention, dominate species shifted to Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium breve, and Escherichia coli in the IG. Additionally, genes related to short-chain fatty acid (SCF) metabolism were upregulated, while methane metabolism was downregulated. Administration of XLTG11 at a dose of 1 × 10<sup>10</sup> CFU/day to children increased fecal frequency, induced beneficial changes in gut microbiota, and regulated SCFs and methane metabolism-related genes.",Brazilian journal of microbiology : [publication of the Brazilian Society for Microbiology],2024,Ke Chen; Zengyuan Zhou; Yang Nie; Yanmei Cao; Ping Yang; Ying Zhang; Ping Xu; Qinghua Yu; Yang Shen; Weiwei Ma; Shanshan Jin; Changqi Liu
38390241,Gut microbiota-derived short-chain fatty acids and depression: deep insight into biological mechanisms and potential applications.,"The gut microbiota is a complex and dynamic ecosystem known as the 'second brain'. Composing the microbiota-gut-brain axis, the gut microbiota and its metabolites regulate the central nervous system through neural, endocrine and immune pathways to ensure the normal functioning of the organism, tuning individuals' health and disease status. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), the main bioactive metabolites of the gut microbiota, are involved in several neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression. SCFAs have essential effects on each component of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in depression. In the present review, the roles of major SCFAs (acetate, propionate and butyrate) in the pathophysiology of depression are summarised with respect to chronic cerebral hypoperfusion, neuroinflammation, host epigenome and neuroendocrine alterations.

38351227,Systematic identification of the role of gut microbiota in mental disorders: a TwinsUK cohort study.,"Mental disorders are complex disorders influenced by multiple genetic, environmental, and biological factors. Specific microbiota imbalances seem to affect mental health status. However, the mechanisms by which microbiota disturbances impact the presence of depression, stress, anxiety, and eating disorders remain poorly understood. Currently, there are no robust biomarkers identified. We proposed a novel pyramid-layer design to accurately identify microbial/metabolomic signatures underlying mental disorders in the TwinsUK registry. Monozygotic and dizygotic twins discordant for mental disorders were screened, in a pairwise manner, for differentially abundant bacterial genera and circulating metabolites. In addition, multivariate analyses were performed, accounting for individual-level confounders. Our pyramid-layer study design allowed us to overcome the limitations of cross-sectional study designs with significant confounder effects and resulted in an association of the abundance of genus Parabacteroides with the diagnosis of mental disorders. Future research should explore the potential role of Parabacteroides as a mediator of mental health status. Our results indicate the potential role of the microbiome as a modifier in mental disorders that might contribute to the development of novel methodologies to assess personal risk and intervention strategies.",Scientific reports,2024,Julie Delanote; Alejandro Correa Rojo; Philippa M Wells; Claire J Steves; Gökhan Ertaylan

Studies have reported conflicting results regarding changes in immune biomarkers and alterations in the abundance of bacterial taxa and microbial diversity in patients with PTSD.The purpose of this meta-analysis is to summarize existing studies examining gut microbiota characteristics and changes in immune biomarkers in patients with PTSD.Relevant studies were systematically searched in PubMed, Scopus, and Embase, published in English between January 1, 1960, and December 1, 2023. The outcomes included changes in abundance and diversity in gut microbiota (gut microbiota part) and changes in immune biomarkers (immune part).The meta-analysis included a total of 15 studies, with 9 focusing on changes in inflammatory biomarkers and 6 focusing on changes in gut microbiota composition in patients with PTSD. No differences were observed between groups for all inflammatory biomarkers (P≥0.05). Two of the six studies found that people with PTSD had less alpha diversity. However, the overall Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) for the Shannon Diversity Index was not significant (SMD 0.27, 95% CI -0.62-0.609, p = 0.110). Regarding changes in abundance, in two of the studies, a significant decrease in Lachnospiraceae bacteria was observed.This meta-analysis provides a comprehensive overview of gut microbiota characteristics in PTSD, suggesting potential associations with immune dysregulation.

38432179,Combination of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> and fructooligosaccharides upregulates colonic vitamin D receptor in C57BL/6J mice and affects anxiety-related behavior in a sex-specific manner.,"Depression and anxiety disorders are among the most common mental health disorders that affect US adults today, frequently related to vitamin D (VD) insufficiency. Along with VD, growing evidence suggests gut microbiota likely play a role in neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we investigated if modulation of gut microbiota would disrupt host VD status and promote behaviors related to depression and anxiety in adult mice. Six-week-old male and female C57BL/6J mice (n = 10/mice/group) were randomly assigned to receive (1) control diet (CTR), control diet treated with antibiotics (AB), control diet with total 5000 IU of VD (VD), VD treated with antibiotics (VD + AB), VD supplemented with 5% w/w fructooligosaccharides (FOS; VF), and VF diet treated with antibiotics (VF + AB), respectively, for 8 weeks. Our study demonstrated that VD status was not affected by antibiotic regimen. VD alone ameliorates anxiety-related behavior in female mice, and that combination with FOS (i.e., VF) did not further improve the outcome. Male mice, in contrast, exhibit greater anxiety with VF, but not VD, when compared with CTR mice. Colonic VD receptor was elevated in VF-treated mice in both sexes, compared with CTR, which was positively correlated to colonic TPH1, a rate-limiting enzyme for serotonin synthesis. Taken together, our data indicate that the effect of VF on anxiety-related behavior is sex-specific, which may partially be attributed to the activation of colonic VD signaling and subsequent serotonin synthesis. The synergistic or additive effect of VD and FOS on mood disorders remained to be investigated.","Nutrition research (New York, N.Y.)",2024,Karisa M Renteria; Ethan Constantine; Chin May Teoh; Analynn Cooper; Nissi Lozano; Spenser Bauer; Gar Yee Koh

Emerging evidence highlights that insufficient or inadequate nutrition is linked to an increased risk of brain health, mental health, and psychological functioning compromise. A core component of this relationship includes the intricate dynamics of the brain-gut-microbiota (BGM) system, which is a progressively recognized factor in the sphere of mental/brain health. The bidirectional relationship between the brain, gut, and gut microbiota along the BGM system not only affects nutrient absorption and utilization, but also it exerts substantial influence on cognitive processes, mood regulation, neuroplasticity, and other indices of mental/brain health. Neuroplasticity is the brain's capacity for adaptation and neural regeneration in response to stimuli. Understanding neuroplasticity and considering interventions that enhance the remarkable ability of the brain to change through experience constitutes a burgeoning area of research that has substantial potential for improving well-being, resilience, and overall brain health through optimal nutrition and lifestyle interventions. The nexus of lifestyle interventions and both academic and clinical perspectives of nutritional neuroscience emerges as a potent tool to enhance patient outcomes, proactively mitigate mental/brain health challenges, and improve the management and treatment of existing mental/brain health conditions by championing health-promoting dietary patterns, rectifying nutritional deficiencies, and seamlessly integrating nutrition-centered strategies into clinical care.",Frontiers in nutrition,2024,Gia Merlo; Gabrielle Bachtel; Steven G Sugden
38302874,Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction: associations with gut microbiota and genes expression of intestinal serotonergic pathway.,"Pediatric chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (PIPO) is a rare disease characterized by symptoms and radiological signs suggestive of intestinal obstruction, in the absence of lumen-occluding lesions. It results from an extremely severe impairment of propulsive motility. The intestinal endocrine system (IES) jointly with the enteric nervous system (ENS) regulates secreto-motor functions via different hormones and bioactive messengers/neurotransmitters. The neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) (or serotonin) is linked to intestinal peristalsis and secretory reflexes. Gut microbiota and its interplay with ENS affect 5-HT synthesis, release, and the subsequent serotonin receptor activation. To date, the interplay between 5-HT and gut microbiota in PIPO remains largely unclear. This study aimed to assess correlations between mucosa associated microbiota (MAM), intestinal serotonin-related genes expression in PIPO. To this purpose, biopsies of the colon, ileum and duodenum have been collected from 7 PIPO patients, and 7 age-/sex-matched healthy controls. After DNA extraction, the MAM was assessed by next generation sequencing (NGS) of the V3-V4 region of the bacterial RNA 16 S, on an Illumina Miseq platform. The expression of genes implicated in serotoninergic pathway (TPH1, SLC6A4, 5-HTR3 and 5-HTR4) was established by qPCR, and correlations with MAM and clinical parameters of PIPO have been evaluated.Our results revealed that PIPO patients exhibit a MAM with a different composition and with dysbiosis, i.e. with a lower biodiversity and fewer less connected species with a greater number of non-synergistic relationships, compared to controls. qPCR results revealed modifications in the expression of serotonin-related intestinal genes in PIPO patients, when compared to controls. Correlation analysis do not reveal any kind of connection.For the first time, we report in PIPO patients a specific MAM associated to underlying pathology and an altered intestinal serotonin pathway. A possible dysfunction of the serotonin pathway, possibly related to or triggered by an altered microbiota, may contribute to dysmotility in PIPO patients. The results of our pilot study provide the basis for new biomarkers and innovative therapies targeting the microbiota or serotonin pathways in PIPO patients.",BMC microbiology,2024,Giulia Radocchia; Massimiliano Marazzato; Karim Ben Harbi; Elena Capuzzo; Fabrizio Pantanella; Roberto De Giorgio; Matteo Guarino; Anna Costanzini; Letizia Zenzeri; Pasquale Parisi; Alessandro Ferretti; Enrico Felici; Anna Teresa Palamara; Giovanni Di Nardo; Serena Schippa
37307822,Brain-Gut-Microbiota Axis in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A Historical Overview and Future Directions.,"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease which is strongly associated with age. The incidence of ALS increases from the age of 40 and peaks between the ages of 65 and 70. Most patients die of respiratory muscle paralysis or lung infections within three to five years of the appearance of symptoms, dealing a huge blow to patients and their families. With aging populations, improved diagnostic methods and changes in reporting criteria, the incidence of ALS is likely to show an upward trend in the coming decades. Despite extensive researches have been done, the cause and pathogenesis of ALS remains unclear. In recent decades, large quantities of studies focusing on gut microbiota have shown that gut microbiota and its metabolites seem to change the evolvement of ALS through the brain-gut-microbiota axis, and in turn, the progression of ALS will exacerbate the imbalance of gut microbiota, thereby forming a vicious cycle. This suggests that further exploration and identification of the function of gut microbiota in ALS may be crucial to break the bottleneck in the diagnosis and treatment of this disease. Hence, the current review summarizes and discusses the latest research advancement and future directions of ALS and brain-gut-microbiota axis, so as to help relevant researchers gain correlative information instantly.",Aging and disease,2024,Shilan Chen; Xinhong Cai; Lin Lao; Yuxuan Wang; Huanxing Su; Haitao Sun
38273106,Human microbiota from drug-naive patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder drives behavioral symptoms and neuroinflammation via succinic acid in mice.,"Emerging evidence suggests that the gut microbiota is closely related to psychiatric disorders. However, little is known about the role of the gut microbiota in the development of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Here, to investigate the contribution of gut microbiota to the pathogenesis of OCD, we transplanted fecal microbiota from first-episode, drug-naive OCD patients or demographically matched healthy individuals into antibiotic-treated specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice and showed that colonization with OCD microbiota is sufficient to induce core behavioral deficits, including abnormal anxiety-like and compulsive-like behaviors. The fecal microbiota was analyzed using 16 S rRNA full-length sequencing, and the results demonstrated a clear separation of the fecal microbiota of mice colonized with OCD and control microbiota. Notably, microbiota from OCD-colonized mice resulted in injured neuronal morphology and function in the mPFC, with inflammation in the mPFC and colon. Unbiased metabolomic analyses of the serum and mPFC region revealed the accumulation of succinic acid (SA) in OCD-colonized mice. SA impeded neuronal activity and induced an inflammatory response in both the colon and mPFC, impacting intestinal permeability and brain function, which act as vital signal mediators in gut microbiota-brain-immune crosstalk. Manipulations of dimethyl malonate (DM) have been reported to exert neuroprotective effects by suppressing the oxidation of accumulated succinic acid, attenuating the downstream inflammatory response and neuronal damage, and can help to partly improve abnormal behavior and reduce neuroinflammation and intestinal inflammation in OCD-colonized mice. We propose that the gut microbiota likely regulates brain function and behaviors in mice via succinic acid signaling, which contributes to the pathophysiology of OCD through gut-brain crosstalk and may provide new insights into the treatment of this disorder.",Molecular psychiatry,2024,Ying-Dan Zhang; Dong-Dong Shi; Bing-Bing Liao; Yi Li; Sen Zhang; Jian Gao; Liang-Jun Lin; Zhen Wang
38278499,Alcohol use-associated alterations in the circulating metabolite profile in the general population and in individuals with major depressive disorder.,"Our aim was to evaluate whether alcohol use is associated with changes in the circulating metabolite profile similar to those present in persons with depression. If so, these findings could partially explain the link between alcohol use and depression. We applied a targeted liquid chromatography mass spectrometry method to evaluate correlates between concentrations of 86 circulating metabolites and self-reported alcohol use in a cohort of the non-depressed general population (GP) (n = 247) and a cohort of individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) (n = 99). Alcohol use was associated with alterations in circulating concentrations of metabolites in both cohorts. Our main finding was that self-reported alcohol use was negatively correlated with serum concentrations of hippuric acid in the GP cohort. In the GP cohort, consumption of six or more doses per week was associated with low hippuric acid concentrations, similar to those observed in the MDD cohort, but in these individuals it was regardless of their level of alcohol use. Reduced serum concentrations of hippuric acid suggest that already-moderate alcohol use is associated with depression-like changes in the serum levels of metabolites associated with gut microbiota and liver function; this may be one possible molecular level link between alcohol use and depression.","Alcohol (Fayetteville, N.Y.)",2024,Olli Kärkkäinen; Tommi Tolmunen; Petri Kivimäki; Karoliina Kurkinen; Toni Ali-Sisto; Pekka Mäntyselkä; Minna Valkonen-Korhonen; Heli Koivumaa-Honkanen; Kirsi Honkalampi; Anu Ruusunen; Vidya Velagapudi; Soili M Lehto
38292207,Gut-Brain Axis Impact on Canine Anxiety Disorders: New Challenges for Behavioral Veterinary Medicine.,"Anxiety disorders in dogs are ever-growing and represent an important concern in the veterinary behavior field. These disorders are often disregarded in veterinary clinical practice, negatively impacting the animal's and owner's quality of life. Moreover, these anxiety disorders can potentially result in the abandonment or euthanasia of dogs. Growing evidence shows that the gut microbiota is a central player in the gut-brain axis. A variety of microorganisms inhabit the intestines of dogs, which are essential in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. These microbes can impact mental health through several mechanisms, including metabolic, neural, endocrine, and immune-mediated pathways. The disruption of a balanced composition of resident commensal communities, or dysbiosis, is implicated in several pathological conditions, including mental disorders such as anxiety. Studies carried out in rodent models and humans demonstrate that the intestinal microbiota can influence mental health through these mechanisms, including anxiety disorders. Furthermore, novel therapeutic strategies using prebiotics and probiotics have been shown to ameliorate anxiety-related symptoms. However, regarding the canine veterinary behavior field, there is still a lack of insightful research on this topic. In this review, we explore the few but relevant studies performed on canine anxiety disorders. We agree that innovative bacterial therapeutical approaches for canine anxiety disorders will become a promising field of investigation and certainly pave the way for new approaches to these behavioral conditions.",Veterinary medicine international,2024,Carina Sacoor; John D Marugg; Nuno R Lima; Nuno Empadinhas; Liliana Montezinho
38318337,"Exploring the interplay between running exercises, microbial diversity, and tryptophan metabolism along the microbiota-gut-brain axis.","The emergent recognition of the gut-brain axis connection has shed light on the role of the microbiota in modulating the gut-brain axis's functions. Several microbial metabolites, such as serotonin, kynurenine, tryptamine, indole, and their derivatives originating from tryptophan metabolism have been implicated in influencing this axis. In our study, we aimed to investigate the impact of running exercises on microbial tryptophan metabolism using a mouse model. We conducted a multi-omics analysis to obtain a comprehensive insight into the changes in tryptophan metabolism along the microbiota-gut-brain axis induced by running exercises. The analyses integrated multiple components, such as tryptophan changes and metabolite levels in the gut, blood, hippocampus, and brainstem. Fecal microbiota analysis aimed to examine the composition and diversity of the gut microbiota, and taxon-function analysis explored the associations between specific microbial taxa and functional activities in tryptophan metabolism. Our findings revealed significant alterations in tryptophan metabolism across multiple sites, including the gut, blood, hippocampus, and brainstem. The outcomes indicate a shift in microbiota diversity and tryptophan metabolizing capabilities within the running group, linked to increased tryptophan transportation to the hippocampus and brainstem through circulation. Moreover, the symbiotic association between <i>Romboutsia</i> and <i>A. muciniphila</i> indicated their potential contribution to modifying the gut microenvironment and influencing tryptophan transport to the hippocampus and brainstem. These findings have potential applications for developing microbiota-based approaches in the context of exercise for neurological diseases, especially on mental health and overall well-being.",Frontiers in microbiology,2024,Alejandra Vazquez-Medina; Nicole Rodriguez-Trujillo; Kiara Ayuso-Rodriguez; Fabiana Marini-Martinez; Roberto Angeli-Morales; Gerardo Caussade-Silvestrini; Filipa Godoy-Vitorino; Nataliya Chorna
38247868,Psychiatric Comorbidities of Inflammatory Bowel Disease: It Is a Matter of Microglia's Gut Feeling.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a common term for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is a chronic, relapse-remitting condition of the gastrointestinal tract that is increasing worldwide. Psychiatric comorbidities, including depression and anxiety, are more prevalent in IBD patients than in healthy individuals. Evidence suggests that varying levels of neuroinflammation might underlie these states in IBD patients. Within this context, microglia are the crucial non-neural cells in the brain responsible for innate immune responses following inflammatory insults. Alterations in microglia's functions, such as secretory profile, phagocytic activity, and synaptic pruning, might play significant roles in mediating psychiatric manifestations of IBD. In this review, we discuss the role played by microglia in IBD-associated comorbidities.",Cells,2024,Gohar Fakhfouri; Nataša R Mijailović; Reza Rahimian
38248533,Long-Term Impact of Childhood Adversity on the Gut Microbiome of Nursing Students.,"Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) encompass negative, stressful, and potentially traumatic events during childhood, impacting physical and mental health outcomes in adulthood. Limited studies suggest ACEs can have short-term effects on children's gut microbiomes and adult cognitive performance under stress. Nevertheless, the long-term effects of ACEs experienced during adulthood remain unexplored. Thus, this study aimed to assess the long-term effects of ACEs on the gut microbiota of adult nursing students. We employed a multidimensional approach, combining 16S rRNA sequencing, bioinformatics tools, and machine learning to predict functional capabilities. High-ACE individuals had an increased abundance of <i>Butyricimonas</i> spp. and <i>Prevotella</i> spp. and decreased levels of Clostridiales, and <i>Lachnospira</i> spp. <i>Prevotella</i> abundance correlated negatively with L-glutamate and L-glutamine biosynthesis, potentially impacting intestinal tissue integrity. While nursing students with high ACE reported increased depression, evidence for a direct gut microbiota-depression relationship was inconclusive. High-ACE individuals also experienced a higher prevalence of diarrhea. These findings highlight the long-lasting impact of ACEs on the gut microbiota and its functions in adulthood, particularly among nursing students. Further research is warranted to develop targeted interventions and strategies for healthcare professionals, optimizing overall health outcomes.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2024,Negin Kazemian; Tony Zhou; Naveen Chalasani; Apurva Narayan; Jose Guillermo Cedeño Laurent; Hector A Olvera Alvarez; Sepideh Pakpour
38350463,Gut production of GABA by a probiotic formula: an in vitro study.,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of a probiotic formula on the production of neuroactive compounds in different parts of the colon in batch culture and in vitro gut simulator experiments. Thirteen lactic acid bacterial strains, belonging to the species Levilactobacillus brevis, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei, Ligilactobacillus salivarius, Streptococcus thermophilus, were characterised for their in vitro ability to produce neurotransmitters. L. brevis P30021 and L. plantarum P30025 were selected based on their capability to produce γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and acetylcholine in vitro. A probiotic formulation with potential psychobiotic activity was prepared and tested in a batch culture of human microbiota monitoring the formation of GABA and acetylcholine. Samples of the three colonic tracts were taken from the Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbiota (SHIME®) evaluating the production of GABA and other neurotransmitters by LC-MS. Short chain fatty acids (SCFA) by GC and microbiota composition by 16S rRNA gene sequencing were also determined. Probiotic supplementation led to the formation of GABA and acetylcholine with a decrease in glutamate concentrations in the in vitro batch fermentation. Production of GABA after the treatment with probiotics was confirmed in the SHIME® short-term experiment. No differences in short-chain fatty acids were observed up to 72 h of fermentation. Different microbiota composition was found in the three different parts of the colon, with a higher abundance of Veillonellaceae in the ascending colon vessels. The probiotic-exposed microbiota showed higher levels of Bacteroides, a gut microbe associated with anti-inflammatory activities and a potential GABA producer. Results demonstrate the impact of the tested probiotic formula on gut microbiota structure and GABA production. In conclusion, the probiotic treatment changed the microbiota composition and increased neuroactive metabolites production, indicating promising potential as psychobiotics, even if further clinical evidence is needed to confirm the effectiveness of these probiotics in improving mental health.",Beneficial microbes,2024,M Casertano; C Fryganas; V Valentino; A D Troise; P Vitaglione; V Fogliano; D Ercolini
38166669,"Effectiveness of a socioecological model-guided, smart device-based, self-management-oriented lifestyle intervention in community residents: protocol for a cluster-randomized controlled trial.","Healthy lifestyles are crucial for preventing chronic diseases. Nonetheless, approximately 90% of Chinese community residents regularly engage in at least one unhealthy lifestyle. Mobile smart devices-based health interventions (mHealth) that incorporate theoretical frameworks regarding behavioral change in interaction with the environment may provide an appealing and cost-effective approach for promoting sustainable adaptations of healthier lifestyles. We designed a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effectiveness of a socioecological model-guided, smart device-based, and self-management-oriented lifestyles (3SLIFE) intervention, to promote healthy lifestyles among Chinese community residents.This two-arm, parallel, cluster-RCT with a 6-month intervention and 6-month follow-up period foresees to randomize a total of 20 communities/villages from 4 townships in a 1:1 ratio to either intervention or control. Within these communities, a total of at least 256 community residents will be enrolled. The experimental group will receive a multi-level intervention based on the socioecological model supplemented with a multi-dimensional empowerment approach. The control group will receive information only. The primary outcome is the reduction of modifiable unhealthy lifestyles at six months, including smoking, excess alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, unbalanced diet, and overweight/obesity. A reduction by one unhealthy behavior measured with the Healthy Lifestyle Index Score (HLIS) will be considered favorable. Secondary outcomes include reduction of specific unhealthy lifestyles at 3 months, 9 months, and 12 months, and mental health outcomes such as depression measured with PHQ-9, social outcomes such as social support measured with the modified Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, clinical outcomes such as obesity, and biomedical outcomes such as the development of gut microbiota. Data will be analyzed with mixed effects generalized linear models with family and link function determined by outcome distribution and accounting for clustering of participants in communities.This study will provide evidence concerning the effect of a mHealth intervention that incorporates a behavioral change theoretical framework on cultivating and maintaining healthy lifestyles in community residents. The study will provide insights into research on and application of similar mHealth intervention strategies to promote healthy lifestyles in community populations and settings.ChiCTR2300070575.

38405047,Depression and the Aberrant Intestinal Microbiome.,"Depression is one of the most common mental health disorders affecting adults in the United States. The current treatment is the combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. Recently, the evidence linking gut microbiome dysregulation to the development of depression has grown. The pathophysiology is currently poorly understood, although leading hypotheses include involvement of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, a bidirectional relationship between the gut microbiome and the central nervous system, and production of signaling molecules by the gut microbiome. Available and emerging treatments of the aberrant microbiome include antidepressants, antibiotics, diet modification, probiotics, and fecal microbiota transplant. This article explores the interconnectivity of gut microbiota and depression and treatments targeted toward the gut, reviews the gastroenterologist's potential role in managing gut dysbiosis in patients with depression, and highlights research topics to be addressed to create evidence-based guidelines.",Gastroenterology & hepatology,2024,Ann F Kopera; Yii Chun Khiew; Mohd Amer Alsamman; Mark C Mattar; Raena S Olsen; David B Doman
38332676,Repeated (<i>S</i>)-ketamine administration ameliorates the spatial working memory impairment in mice with chronic pain: role of the gut microbiota-brain axis.,"Chronic pain is commonly linked with diminished working memory. This study explores the impact of the anesthetic (<i>S</i>)-ketamine on spatial working memory in a chronic constriction injury (CCI) mouse model, focusing on gut microbiome. We found that multiple doses of (<i>S</i>)-ketamine, unlike a single dose, counteracted the reduced spontaneous alteration percentage (%SA) in the Y-maze spatial working memory test, without affecting mechanical or thermal pain sensitivity. Additionally, repeated (<i>S</i>)-ketamine treatments improved the abnormal composition of the gut microbiome (β-diversity), as indicated by fecal 16S rRNA analysis, and increased levels of butyrate, a key gut - brain axis mediator. Protein analysis showed that these treatments also corrected the upregulated histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) and downregulated brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampi of CCI mice. Remarkably, fecal microbiota transplantation from mice treated repeatedly with (<i>S</i>)-ketamine to CCI mice restored %SA and hippocampal BDNF levels in CCI mice. Butyrate supplementation alone also improved %SA, BDNF, and HDAC2 levels in CCI mice. Furthermore, the TrkB receptor antagonist ANA-12 negated the beneficial effects of repeated (<i>S</i>)-ketamine on spatial working memory impairment in CCI mice. These results indicate that repeated (<i>S</i>)-ketamine administration ameliorates spatial working memory impairment in CCI mice, mediated by a gut microbiota - brain axis, primarily through the enhancement of hippocampal BDNF - TrkB signaling by butyrate.",Gut microbes,2024,Yubin Jiang; Xingming Wang; Jiawei Chen; Yibao Zhang; Kenji Hashimoto; Jian-Jun Yang; Zhiqiang Zhou
38226944,Gut microbiota composition may be an indicator of erectile dysfunction.,"Erectile Dysfunction (ED) is considered a physical and mental illness. A variety of potential associations between gut microbiota and health or disease have been found. By comparing the gut microbiota of healthy controls and ED patients, our study investigated the relationship between ED and gut microbiota. The results revealed that the ED group exhibited a significantly higher relative abundance of Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Lachnoclostridium, Escherichia-Shigella and Megamonas, while showing a significantly lower relative abundance of Bifidobacterium compared to the control group. The dysbiosis of gut microbiota played a role in the onset and progression of ED by influencing the gut barrier, cardiovascular system and mental health, which provided a novel perspective on understanding the pathophysiology of ED. What is more, we had identified several key gut microbiota. By combining 16S rRNA sequencing with machine learning techniques, we were able to uncover the significant value and impact of gut microbiota in the early detection of ED.",Microbial biotechnology,2024,Yu Qiao; Jianhuai Chen; Yongsheng Jiang; Ziheng Zhang; Heng Wang; Tao Liu; Zhaoxu Yang; Guangbo Fu; Yun Chen
36271691,Unveiling of dietary and gut-microbiota derived B vitamins: Metabolism patterns and their synergistic functions in gut-brain homeostasis.,"Nutrition-gut cross-talk holds a vital position in sustaining intestinal function, and micronutrient metabolism has emerged as the foremost metabolic pathway to preserve gut homeostasis. Among micronutrients, B vitamins have evolved prior to DNA/RNA and are known for their vital roles for major evolutionary transitions in extant organisms. Despite their universal requirement and critical role, not all the three domains of life are endowed with a natural ability for <i>de novo</i> B vitamins synthesis. The human gut microbiome constitutes prototrophs and auxotroph which are entirely dependent on dietary intake and gut microbial production of B vitamins. The syntrophic metabolism involving cross-feeding of B vitamins and community-wide exchange between commensal bacteria elicit important changes in the diversity and composition of the human gut microbiome. Hereto, we discuss the B-vitamins sharing among prototrophic and auxotrophic gut bacteria, their absorption in small intestine and transport in distal gut, functional role in relation to the gut homeostasis and symptoms linked to their deficiency. We also briefly explore their potential involvement as psychobiotics in brain energetic metabolism (kynurenines/tryptophan pathway) for neurological functions and highlight their deficiency related malfunctioning.",Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2024,Qi Zhan; Rui Wang; Kiran Thakur; Jing-Yu Feng; Yun-Yang Zhu; Jian-Guo Zhang; Zhao-Jun Wei
