35151796,Brain-gut-microbiota axis in depression: A historical overview and future directions.,"Depression is the most common mental disorder and a leading cause of disability worldwide. Despite abundant research, the precise mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of depression remain elusive. Accumulating evidence from preclinical and clinical studies suggests that alterations in the gut microbiota, microbe-derived short-chain fatty acids, D-amino acids and metabolites play a key role in the pathophysiology of depression via the brain-gut-microbiota axis, including the neural and immune systems. Notably, the brain-gut-microbiota axis might play a crucial role in susceptibility versus resilience in rodents exposed to stress. Vagotomy is reported to block depression-like phenotypes in rodents after fecal microbiota transplantation of ""depression-related"" microbiome, suggesting that the vagus nerve influences depression through the brain-gut-microbiota axis. In this article, we review recent findings regarding the brain-gut-microbiota axis in depression and discuss its potential as a therapeutic target for depression.",Brain research bulletin,2022,Lijia Chang; Yan Wei; Kenji Hashimoto
35044528,"The microbiota-gut-brain axis: pathways to better brain health. Perspectives on what we know, what we need to investigate and how to put knowledge into practice.","The gut and brain link via various metabolic and signalling pathways, each with the potential to influence mental, brain and cognitive health. Over the past decade, the involvement of the gut microbiota in gut-brain communication has become the focus of increased scientific interest, establishing the microbiota-gut-brain axis as a field of research. There is a growing number of association studies exploring the gut microbiota's possible role in memory, learning, anxiety, stress, neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Consequently, attention is now turning to how the microbiota can become the target of nutritional and therapeutic strategies for improved brain health and well-being. However, while such strategies that target the gut microbiota to influence brain health and function are currently under development with varying levels of success, still very little is yet known about the triggers and mechanisms underlying the gut microbiota's apparent influence on cognitive or brain function and most evidence comes from pre-clinical studies rather than well controlled clinical trials/investigations. Filling the knowledge gaps requires establishing a standardised methodology for human studies, including strong guidance for specific focus areas of the microbiota-gut-brain axis, the need for more extensive biological sample analyses, and identification of relevant biomarkers. Other urgent requirements are new advanced models for in vitro and in vivo studies of relevant mechanisms, and a greater focus on omics technologies with supporting bioinformatics resources (training, tools) to efficiently translate study findings, as well as the identification of relevant targets in study populations. The key to building a validated evidence base rely on increasing knowledge sharing and multi-disciplinary collaborations, along with continued public-private funding support. This will allow microbiota-gut-brain axis research to move to its next phase so we can identify realistic opportunities to modulate the microbiota for better brain health.",Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,2022,Anirikh Chakrabarti; Lucie Geurts; Lesley Hoyles; Patricia Iozzo; Aletta D Kraneveld; Giorgio La Fata; Michela Miani; Elaine Patterson; Bruno Pot; Colette Shortt; David Vauzour
36099873,The microbiota-gut-brain axis in sleep disorders.,"Sleep is a complex physiological process and is a critical determinant of physical and mental health. In the past decades, significant progress has been made in understanding the neural mechanisms of sleep and awakening. However, the initiation and maintenance of the sleep-wake cycle is regulated not only by the central system but is also affected by signals from peripheral tissues. Growing evidence shows that the microbiota-gut-brain axis contributes to the regulation of sleep behavior both directly and indirectly and may play a critical role in the etiology and pathogenesis of sleep disorders. Sleep deprivation leads to dysfunction of gut microbiota and sleep disorders are accompanied by altered gut microbiota composition. In this review, we describe the bidirectional relationships between sleep and gut microbiota and summarize the abnormal characteristics of gut bacteria in distinct conditions including sleep disturbances, sleep disorders and sleep disorders comorbid with neuropsychiatric disorders. We also examine the potential routes of microbiota-gut-brain axis in sleep and gut microbiome interactions, including metabolic, immune, and neural pathways, and propose microbiota-targeted interventions for improving sleep. Manipulating gut microbiota may be a promising avenue for the development of novel interventions for sleep disorders.",Sleep medicine reviews,2022,Zhe Wang; Zhong Wang; Tangsheng Lu; Wenhao Chen; Wei Yan; Kai Yuan; Le Shi; Xiaoxing Liu; Xinyu Zhou; Jie Shi; Michael V Vitiello; Ying Han; Lin Lu
35194166,"A systematic review of gut microbiota composition in observational studies of major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.","The emerging understanding of gut microbiota as 'metabolic machinery' influencing many aspects of physiology has gained substantial attention in the field of psychiatry. This is largely due to the many overlapping pathophysiological mechanisms associated with both the potential functionality of the gut microbiota and the biological mechanisms thought to be underpinning mental disorders. In this systematic review, we synthesised the current literature investigating differences in gut microbiota composition in people with the major psychiatric disorders, major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SZ), compared to 'healthy' controls. We also explored gut microbiota composition across disorders in an attempt to elucidate potential commonalities in the microbial signatures associated with these mental disorders. Following the PRISMA guidelines, databases were searched from inception through to December 2021. We identified 44 studies (including a total of 2510 psychiatric cases and 2407 controls) that met inclusion criteria, of which 24 investigated gut microbiota composition in MDD, seven investigated gut microbiota composition in BD, and 15 investigated gut microbiota composition in SZ. Our syntheses provide no strong evidence for a difference in the number or distribution (α-diversity) of bacteria in those with a mental disorder compared to controls. However, studies were relatively consistent in reporting differences in overall community composition (β-diversity) in people with and without mental disorders. Our syntheses also identified specific bacterial taxa commonly associated with mental disorders, including lower levels of bacterial genera that produce short-chain fatty acids (e.g. butyrate), higher levels of lactic acid-producing bacteria, and higher levels of bacteria associated with glutamate and GABA metabolism. We also observed substantial heterogeneity across studies with regards to methodologies and reporting. Further prospective and experimental research using new tools and robust guidelines hold promise for improving our understanding of the role of the gut microbiota in mental and brain health and the development of interventions based on modification of gut microbiota.",Molecular psychiatry,2022,A J McGuinness; J A Davis; S L Dawson; A Loughman; F Collier; M O'Hely; C A Simpson; J Green; W Marx; C Hair; G Guest; M Mohebbi; M Berk; D Stupart; D Watters; F N Jacka
36093196,Gut microbiota: Linking nutrition and perinatal depression.,"Perinatal depression is a mood disorder that is reported in women during pregnancy (prenatal) and after childbirth (postnatal). The onset of perinatal depression is associated with changes in reproductive hormones, stress hormones and neurosteroids. These chemical compounds can be modulated by the gut microbiota, which may affect maternal mental health during the perinatal period <i>via</i> the gut-brain-axis. Recent studies suggest that nutritional and dietary interventions (vitamin D, ω-3 fatty acids, iron, and fiber) effectively prevent or mitigate maternal depression and anxiety, but their efficacy is confounded by various factors, including the gut microbiota. Probiotics are efficacious in maintaining microbiota homeostasis, and thus, have the potential to modulate the development of perinatal mood disorders, despite no evidence in human. Therefore, clinical trials are warranted to investigate the role of probiotic supplementation in perinatal depression and behavioral changes. This article reviews the interplay between nutrition, gut microbiota and mood and cognition, and the evidence suggesting that probiotics affect the onset and development of perinatal depression.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2022,Jia Song; Bi Zhou; Juntao Kan; Guangya Liu; Sheng Zhang; Liang Si; Xianping Zhang; Xue Yang; Junhua Ma; Junrui Cheng; Yongde Yang; Xiaobo Liu
35631252,Medicinal Plants and Their Impact on the Gut Microbiome in Mental Health: A Systematic Review.,"Various neurocognitive and mental health-related conditions have been associated with the gut microbiome, implicating a microbiome-gut-brain axis (MGBA). The aim of this systematic review was to identify, categorize, and review clinical evidence supporting medicinal plants for the treatment of mental disorders and studies on their interactions with the gut microbiota.This review included medicinal plants for which clinical studies on depression, sleeping disorders, anxiety, or cognitive dysfunction as well as scientific evidence of interaction with the gut microbiome were available. The studies were reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement.Eighty-five studies met the inclusion criteria and covered thirty mental health-related medicinal plants with data on interaction with the gut microbiome.Only a few studies have been specifically designed to assess how herbal preparations affect MGBA-related targets or pathways. However, many studies provide hints of a possible interaction with the MGBA, such as an increased abundance of health-beneficial microorganisms, anti-inflammatory effects, or MGBA-related pathway effects by gut microbial metabolites. Data for <i>Panax ginseng</i>, <i>Schisandra chinensis</i>, and <i>Salvia rosmarinus</i> indicate that the interaction of their constituents with the gut microbiota could mediate mental health benefits. Studies specifically assessing the effects on MGBA-related pathways are still required for most medicinal plants.",Nutrients,2022,Eva-Maria Pferschy-Wenzig; Manuela R Pausan; Karin Ardjomand-Woelkart; Stefanie Röck; Ramy M Ammar; Olaf Kelber; Christine Moissl-Eichinger; Rudolf Bauer
35444255,"Multi-omics analyses of serum metabolome, gut microbiome and brain function reveal dysregulated microbiota-gut-brain axis in bipolar depression.","The intricate processes of microbiota-gut-brain communication in modulating human cognition and emotion, especially in the context of mood disorders, have remained elusive. Here we performed faecal metagenomic, serum metabolomics and neuroimaging studies on a cohort of 109 unmedicated patients with depressed bipolar disorder (BD) patients and 40 healthy controls (HCs) to characterise the microbial-gut-brain axis in BD. Across over 12,000 measured metabolic features, we observed a large discrepancy (73.54%) in the serum metabolome between BD patients and HCs, spotting differentially abundant microbial-derived neuroactive metabolites including multiple B-vitamins, kynurenic acid, gamma-aminobutyric acid and short-chain fatty acids. These metabolites could be linked to the abundance of gut microbiota presented with corresponding biosynthetic potentials, including Akkermansia muciniphila, Citrobacter spp. (Citrobacter freundii and Citrobacter werkmanii), Phascolarctobacterium spp., Yersinia spp. (Yersinia frederiksenii and Yersinia aleksiciae), Enterobacter spp. (Enterobacter cloacae and Enterobacter kobei) and Flavobacterium spp. Based on functional neuroimaging, BD-related neuroactive microbes and metabolites were discovered as potential markers associated with BD-typical features of functional connectivity of brain networks, hinting at aberrant cognitive function, emotion regulation, and interoception. Our study combines gut microbiota and neuroactive metabolites with brain functional connectivity, thereby revealing potential signalling pathways from the microbiota to the gut and the brain, which may have a role in the pathophysiology of BD.",Molecular psychiatry,2022,Zhiming Li; Jianbo Lai; Peifen Zhang; Jiahong Ding; Jiajun Jiang; Chuanfa Liu; Huimin Huang; Hefu Zhen; Caixi Xi; Yuzhe Sun; Lingling Wu; Lifang Wang; Xingle Gao; Yan Li; Yaoyang Fu; Zhuye Jie; Shenghui Li; Danhua Zhang; Yiqing Chen; Yiyi Zhu; Shaojia Lu; Jing Lu; Dandan Wang; Hetong Zhou; Xiuxia Yuan; Xue Li; Lijuan Pang; Manli Huang; Huanming Yang; Wenwei Zhang; Susanne Brix; Karsten Kristiansen; Xueqin Song; Chao Nie; Shaohua Hu
35819136,"Antibiotics and mental health: The good, the bad and the ugly.","Antibiotics are recognised as, on occasion, producing psychiatric side effects, most notably depression and anxiety. Apart from antimicrobial activity, antibiotics have multiple off-target effects. The brain-gut-microbiota axis has multiple sites for off-target activity, which may produce either positive or negative antibiotic effects. Here we review how antibiotics impact mental health by acting through the brain-gut-microbiota axis. Microbes in the gut influence brain function by acting through the vagus nerve or by altering the production of short-chain fatty acids or the amino acid tryptophan, the building block of serotonin. Not all antimicrobial actions of antibiotics have a negative impact. The first antidepressant discovered was actually an antibiotic: isoniazid is an antibacterial drug developed for treating tuberculosis. Minocycline, which enters the brain and mediates its effects through microglia, shows antidepressant activity. Some antibiotics bring about a significant decrease in gut microbial diversity, and this is viewed as a risk factor for depression. Other risk factors induced by antibiotics include altered gut barrier function, activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, reducing levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor or oxytocin and alteration of vagal tone. Although most patients taking antibiotics do not suffer from an iatrogenic psychiatric disorder, some do. As clinicians, we need to keep this in mind. The development of new antibiotics is primarily focused on antibiotic resistance, but efforts should be made to reduce off-target brain-gut-microbiota effects resulting in mental health problems.",Journal of internal medicine,2022,Katherine Dinan; Timothy Dinan
36145184,The Burden of Carbohydrates in Health and Disease.,"Foods high in carbohydrates are an important part of a healthy diet, since they provide the body with glucose to support bodily functions and physical activity. However, the abusive consumption of refined, simple, and low-quality carbohydrates has a direct implication on the physical and mental pathophysiology. Then, carbohydrate consumption is postulated as a crucial factor in the development of the main Western diseases of the 21st century. We conducted this narrative critical review using MedLine (Pubmed), Cochrane (Wiley), Embase, and CinAhl databases with the MeSH-compliant keywords: carbohydrates and evolution, development, phylogenetic, GUT, microbiota, stress, metabolic health, consumption behaviors, metabolic disease, cardiovascular disease, mental disease, anxiety, depression, cancer, chronic kidney failure, allergies, and asthma in order to analyze the impact of carbohydrates on health. Evidence suggests that carbohydrates, especially fiber, are beneficial for the well-being and growth of gut microorganisms and consequently for the host in this symbiotic relationship, producing microbial alterations a negative effect on mental health and different organic systems. In addition, evidence suggests a negative impact of simple carbohydrates and refined carbohydrates on mood categories, including alertness and tiredness, reinforcing a vicious circle. Regarding physical health, sugar intake can affect the development and prognosis of metabolic disease, as an uncontrolled intake of refined carbohydrates puts individuals at risk of developing metabolic syndrome and subsequently developing metabolic disease.",Nutrients,2022,Vicente Javier Clemente-Suárez; Juan Mielgo-Ayuso; Alexandra Martín-Rodríguez; Domingo Jesús Ramos-Campo; Laura Redondo-Flórez; Jose Francisco Tornero-Aguilera

We conducted a systematic review of 24 observational studies (n = 2817), and 19 interventional trials (n = 1119). We assessed alpha diversity, beta diversity, and taxa abundance changes in patients with MDD relative to HC, as well as the effect of prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics on depressive symptoms in individuals with clinical or subclinical depression. We observed no significant differences in alpha diversity but a significant difference in beta diversity between patients with MDD and HC. There were fluctuations in the abundance of specific taxa in patients with MDD relative to HC. Probiotic and synbiotic, but not prebiotic, treatment showed a modest benefit in reducing depressive symptoms in patients with MDD over four to nine weeks. The GMB profiles of patients with MDD differ significantly from HC, but further studies are needed to elucidate the benefits of prebiotic, probiotic and synbiotic treatments relative to antidepressants and over longer follow-up before these therapies are implemented into clinical practice.",International journal of molecular sciences,2022,Sauliha R Alli; Ilona Gorbovskaya; Jonathan C W Liu; Nathan J Kolla; Lisa Brown; Daniel J Müller
35743087,"Drugs, Guts, Brains, but Not Rock and Roll: The Need to Consider the Role of Gut Microbiota in Contemporary Mental Health and Wellness of Emerging Adults.","Emerging adulthood (ages 18-25) is a critical period for neurobiological development and the maturation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Recent findings also suggest that a natural perturbation of the gut microbiota (GM), combined with other factors, may create a unique vulnerability during this period of life. The GM of emerging adults is thought to be simpler, less diverse, and more unstable than either younger or older people. We postulate that this plasticity in the GM suggests a role in the rising mental health issues seen in westernized societies today via the gut-brain-microbiota axis. Studies have paid particular attention to the diversity of the microbiota, the specific function and abundance of bacteria, and the production of metabolites. In this narrative review, we focus specifically on diet, physical activity/exercise, substance use, and sleep in the context of the emerging adult. We propose that this is a crucial period for establishing a stable and more resilient microbiome for optimal health into adulthood. Recommendations will be made about future research into possible behavioral adjustments that may be beneficial to endorse during this critical period to reduce the probability of a ""dysbiotic"" GM and the emergence and severity of mental health concerns.",International journal of molecular sciences,2022,Ju Eun Lee; David Walton; Colleen P O'Connor; Michael Wammes; Jeremy P Burton; Elizabeth A Osuch
35831877,The gut-liver axis in sepsis: interaction mechanisms and therapeutic potential.,"Sepsis is a potentially fatal condition caused by dysregulation of the body's immune response to an infection. Sepsis-induced liver injury is considered a strong independent prognosticator of death in the critical care unit, and there is anatomic and accumulating epidemiologic evidence that demonstrates intimate cross talk between the gut and the liver. Intestinal barrier disruption and gut microbiota dysbiosis during sepsis result in translocation of intestinal pathogen-associated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular patterns into the liver and systemic circulation. The liver is essential for regulating immune defense during systemic infections via mechanisms such as bacterial clearance, lipopolysaccharide detoxification, cytokine and acute-phase protein release, and inflammation metabolic regulation. When an inappropriate immune response or overwhelming inflammation occurs in the liver, the impaired capacity for pathogen clearance and hepatic metabolic disturbance can result in further impairment of the intestinal barrier and increased disruption of the composition and diversity of the gut microbiota. Therefore, interaction between the gut and liver is a potential therapeutic target. This review outlines the intimate gut-liver cross talk (gut-liver axis) in sepsis.","Critical care (London, England)",2022,Xue Zhang; Hong Liu; Kenji Hashimoto; Shiying Yuan; Jiancheng Zhang
36458229,"Gut-Brain Axis, Neurodegeneration and Mental Health: A Personalized Medicine Perspective.","Neurological conditions such as neurodegenerative diseases and mental health disorders are a result of multifactorial underpinnings, leading to individual-based complex phenotypes. Demystification of these multifactorial connections will promote disease diagnosis and treatment. Personalized treatment rather than a one-size-fits-all approach would enable us to cater to the unmet healthcare needs based on protein-protein and gene-environment interactions. Gut-brain axis, as the name suggests, is a two-way biochemical communication pathway between the central nervous system (CNS) and enteric nervous system (ENS), enabling a mutual influence between brain and peripheral intestinal functions. The gut microbiota is a major component of this bidirectional communication, the composition of which is varied depending on the age, and disease conditions, among other factors. Gut microbiota profile is typically unique and personalized therapeutic intervention can aid in treating or delaying neurodegeneration and mental health conditions. Besides, research on the gut microbial influence on these conditions is gaining attention, and a better understanding of this concept can lead to identification of novel targeted therapies.",Indian journal of microbiology,2022,Alisha Chunduri; S Deepak Mohan Reddy; M Jahanavi; C Nagendranatha Reddy
35508109,Microbiota alterations in proline metabolism impact depression.,"The microbiota-gut-brain axis has emerged as a novel target in depression, a disorder with low treatment efficacy. However, the field is dominated by underpowered studies focusing on major depression not addressing microbiome functionality, compositional nature, or confounding factors. We applied a multi-omics approach combining pre-clinical models with three human cohorts including patients with mild depression. Microbial functions and metabolites converging onto glutamate/GABA metabolism, particularly proline, were linked to depression. High proline consumption was the dietary factor with the strongest impact on depression. Whole-brain dynamics revealed rich club network disruptions associated with depression and circulating proline. Proline supplementation in mice exacerbated depression along with microbial translocation. Human microbiota transplantation induced an emotionally impaired phenotype in mice and alterations in GABA-, proline-, and extracellular matrix-related prefrontal cortex genes. RNAi-mediated knockdown of proline and GABA transporters in Drosophila and mono-association with L. plantarum, a high GABA producer, conferred protection against depression-like states.

35157987,Brain-spleen axis in health and diseases: A review and future perspective.,"The spleen, an important tissue for the immune system, acts as a filter for blood within the immune system. Accumulating evidence suggests that the spleen affects a number of brain functions in health and diseases via immune modulation. Systemic inflammation or chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) can cause splenomegaly in rodents. Interestingly, the new antidepressant arketamine could normalize splenomegaly and depression-like behaviors in CSDS-susceptible mice. A recent study strongly supports the direct connection pathway between the brain and spleen, whereby the spleen can regulate the humoral immune defense by the two brain regions, such as corticotropin-related neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA). Furthermore, afferent and efferent vagus nerve signaling may contribute to brain and spleen communication.

36479494,Dietary supplements in neurological diseases and brain aging.,"A healthy diet shapes a healthy mind. Diet quality has a strong association with brain health. Diet influences the onset and consequences of neurological diseases, and dietary factors may influence mental health at individual and population level. The link between unhealthy diet, impaired cognitive function and neurodegenerative diseases indicates that adopting a healthy diet would ultimately afford prevention and management of neurological diseases and brain aging. Neurodegenerative diseases are of multifactorial origin and result in progressive loss of neuronal function in the brain, leading to cognitive impairment and motoneuron disorders. The so-called Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) with its healthy ingredients rich in antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immune, neuroprotective, antidepressant, antistress and senolytic activity plays an essential role in the prevention and management of neurological diseases and inhibits cognitive decline in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. The MedDiet also modulates the gut-brain axis by promoting a diversity of gut microbiota. In view of the importance of diet in neurological diseases management, this review focuses on the dietary components, natural compounds and medicinal plants that have proven beneficial in neurological diseases and for brain health. Among them, polyphenols, omega-3 fatty acids, B vitamins and several ayurvedic herbs have promising beneficial effects.",Journal of preventive medicine and hygiene,2022,Zakira Naureen; Kristjana Dhuli; Maria Chiara Medori; Paola Caruso; Paolo Manganotti; Pietro Chiurazzi; Matteo Bertelli

Psychobiotics are microbiota-targeted interventions that can result in mental health benefits and protect the aging brain. This study investigated the gut microbiome composition and predicted microbial functional pathways of middle-aged and older adults that met criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI), compared to neurologically healthy individuals, and investigated the impact of probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial. A total of 169 community-dwelling middle-aged (52-59 years) and older adults (60-75 years) received a three-month intervention and were randomized to probiotic and placebo groups. Participants were further subdivided based on cognitive status into groups with intact or impaired cognition and samples were collected at baseline and post supplementation.Microbiome analysis identified Prevotella ruminicola, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, and Bacteroides xylanisolvens as taxa correlated with MCI. Differential abundance analysis at baseline identified Prevotella as significantly more prevalent in MCI subjects compared to cognitively intact subjects (ALDEx2 P = 0.0017, ANCOM-BC P = 0.0004). A decrease in the relative abundance of the genus Prevotella and Dehalobacterium in response to LGG supplementation in the MCI group was correlated with an improved cognitive score.Our study points to specific members of the gut microbiota correlated with cognitive performance in middle-aged and older adults. Should findings be replicated, these taxa could be used as key early indicators of MCI and manipulated by probiotics, prebiotics, and symbiotics to promote successful cognitive aging.

35565888,The Role of the Microbiome-Brain-Gut Axis in the Pathogenesis of Depressive Disorder.,"The role of gut microbiota and its association with the central nervous system via the microbiome-brain-gut axis has been widely discussed in the literature. The aim of this review is to investigate the impact of gut microbiota on the development of depression and underlying molecular mechanisms. There are two possible pathways in which this interaction might occur. The first one suggests that depressive disorder could lead to dysbiosis and one of the causes may be the influence on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The second one considers if changes in the composition of gut microbiota might cause depressive disorder. The mechanisms that could be responsible for this interaction include the secretion of neurotransmitters, gut peptides and the activation of the immune system. However, current knowledge on this topic does not allow for us to state an unambiguous conclusion, and future studies that take into consideration more precise stress-measurement methods are needed to further explore direct mechanisms of the interaction between gut microbiota and mental health.",Nutrients,2022,Ewelina Młynarska; Joanna Gadzinowska; Julita Tokarek; Joanna Forycka; Aleksandra Szuman; Beata Franczyk; Jacek Rysz

Among these approaches, probiotic supplementation has been investigated most prominently, providing promising evidence for its use in improving mood and anxiety. There is also growing interest in the use of multistrain probiotics, whole dietary interventions or combined approaches, with encouraging results emerging from recent studies.Although the current literature preliminarily supports targeting the microbiota to manage mental health and use as adjuvant therapies for certain brain disorders, large gaps remain and especially data including clinical cohorts remains scarce.

36039924,The anti-inflammatory effects of a Mediterranean diet: a review.,"Chronic noncommunicable diseases remain the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and the majority are preventable with a healthy diet and lifestyle, but controversy remains as to the best approach. Greater adherence to a traditional Mediterranean diet has consistently been associated with lower morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease, diabetes and many cancers, and lower all-cause mortality. Despite the well known benefits on chronic disease risk there remains some scepticism as to the effects of this dietary pattern across populations outside the Mediterranean and the mechanisms of action of this traditional plant-based dietary pattern.This narrative review aims to summarize the latest evidence on the health protective effects of a traditional Mediterranean diet on chronic noncommunicable diseases, specifically focussing on the anti-inflammatory effects of this highly published dietary pattern.Recent high-quality evidence now supports a Mediterranean diet in secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease with impacts on atherosclerosis progression, likely through reduction of systemic inflammation and irrespective of changes in cholesterol or weight. The Mediterranean diet has a low Dietary Inflammatory Index illustrating its anti-inflammatory potential. This dietary pattern beneficially modulates the gut microbiota and immune system, including emerging evidence for efficacy against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (coronavirus disease 2019). Emerging evidence shows clinicians are not routinely recommending a Mediterranean diet despite well known evidence due to barriers such as lack of training, patient materials and concerns about potential patient adherence.The physiological mechanisms of action of this healthy diet pattern are becoming better understood to be multisystem and involving the gut. Larger controlled trials investigating mechanistic effects in broader non-Mediterranean populations are warranted.

A three-day food diary, rating scales for mental health, and multiple questionnaires will be completed. Biosamples (fecal-, urine-, saliva-, blood samples, and buccal swab) will be collected and used for 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of the oral and gut microbiome, measurements of serum factors, quantification of urine metabolites and host genotype, respectively. For longitudinal follow-up, data collection will be repeated after three years in the same groups. Integrative analysis of diet, gut microbiota, intestinal permeability, serum metabolites, and mental health will be conducted applying bioinformatics and systems biology approaches. Extensive population-based data of this quality has not been collected before, with collection repeated in three years' time, contributing to the high scientific value. The MMM-study follows the ""Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology"" (STROBE) guidelines. Approval has been obtained from the Icelandic National Bioethics Committee, and the study is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov. The study will contribute to an improved understanding of the links between diet, gut microbiota and mental health in children through good quality study design by collecting information on multiple components, and a longitudinal approach. Furthermore, the study creates knowledge on possibilities for targeted and more personalized dietary and lifestyle interventions in subgroups.

35276981,Effect of Probiotics on Psychiatric Symptoms and Central Nervous System Functions in Human Health and Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"The gut microbiota impacts on central nervous system (CNS) function via the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Thus, therapeutics targeting the gut microbiota such as probiotics have the potential for improving mental health. This meta-analysis synthesizes the evidence regarding the impacts of probiotics on psychological well-being, psychiatric symptoms and CNS functioning.The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were applied for executing this review using the databases PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane Library. The data were summarized at qualitative and quantitative level.Fifty-four randomized placebo-controlled studies were included, of which 30 were eligible for meta-analysis. If investigated, the probiotics mostly exerted effects on CNS function. Most probiotics did not affect mood, stress, anxiety, depression and psychiatric distress when compared to placebo at the qualitative level. At quantitative level, depression and psychiatric distress improved slightly in the probiotic condition (depression: mean difference -0.37 (95% CI: -0.55, -0.20); <i>p</i> ≤ 0.0001; psychiatric distress: mean difference -0.33 (95% CI: -0.53, -0.13); <i>p</i> = 0.001).To date it is unclear to which extent and in which specific areas next generation probiotics selected and developed for their ability to improve psychiatric condition and potentially other CNS functions are promising.",Nutrients,2022,Charlotte Le Morvan de Sequeira; Charlotte Hengstberger; Paul Enck; Isabelle Mack
36466655,"Gut microbiota, pathogenic proteins and neurodegenerative diseases.","As the world's population ages, neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) have brought a great burden to the world. However, effective treatment measures have not been found to alleviate the occurrence and development of NDs. Abnormal accumulation of pathogenic proteins is an important cause of NDs. Therefore, effective inhibition of the accumulation of pathogenic proteins has become a priority. As the second brain of human, the gut plays an important role in regulate emotion and cognition functions. Recent studies have reported that the disturbance of gut microbiota (GM) is closely related to accumulation of pathogenic proteins in NDs. On the one hand, pathogenic proteins directly produced by GM are transmitted from the gut to the central center <i>via</i> vagus nerve. On the other hand, The harmful substances produced by GM enter the peripheral circulation through intestinal barrier and cause inflammation, or cross the blood-brain barrier into the central center to cause inflammation, and cytokines produced by the central center cause the production of pathogenic proteins. These pathogenic proteins can produced by the above two aspects can cause the activation of central microglia and further lead to NDs development. In addition, certain GM and metabolites have been shown to have neuroprotective effects. Therefore, modulating GM may be a potential clinical therapeutic approach for NDs. In this review, we summarized the possible mechanism of NDs caused by abnormal accumulation of pathogenic proteins mediated by GM to induce the activation of central microglia, cause central inflammation and explore the therapeutic potential of dietary therapy and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in NDs.",Frontiers in microbiology,2022,Wei Wei; Shixu Wang; Chongchong Xu; Xuemei Zhou; Xinqing Lian; Lin He; Kuan Li
35889175,Impact of Environmental Pollutants on Gut Microbiome and Mental Health via the Gut-Brain Axis.,"Over the last few years, the microbiome has emerged as a high-priority research area to discover missing links between brain health and gut dysbiosis. Emerging evidence suggests that the commensal gut microbiome is an important regulator of the gut-brain axis and plays a critical role in brain physiology. Engaging microbiome-generated metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids, the immune system, the enteric nervous system, the endocrine system (including the HPA axis), tryptophan metabolism or the vagus nerve plays a crucial role in communication between the gut microbes and the brain. Humans are exposed to a wide range of pollutants in everyday life that impact our intestinal microbiota and manipulate the bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain, resulting in predisposition to psychiatric or neurological disorders. However, the interaction between xenobiotics, microbiota and neurotoxicity has yet to be completely investigated. Although research into the precise processes of the microbiota-gut-brain axis is growing rapidly, comprehending the implications of environmental contaminants remains challenging. In these milieus, we herein discuss how various environmental pollutants such as phthalates, heavy metals, Bisphenol A and particulate matter may alter the intricate microbiota-gut-brain axis thereby impacting our neurological and overall mental health.",Microorganisms,2022,Samradhi Singh; Poonam Sharma; Namrata Pal; Manoj Kumawat; Swasti Shubham; Devojit Kumar Sarma; Rajnarayan R Tiwari; Manoj Kumar; Ravinder Nagpal
36432461,"The Effects of Walnuts and Academic Stress on Mental Health, General Well-Being and the Gut Microbiota in a Sample of University Students: A Randomised Clinical Trial.","Poorer mental health is common in undergraduate students due to academic stress. An interplay between stress and diet exists, with stress influencing food choices. Nutritional interventions may be effective in preventing mental health decline due to complex bidirectional interactions between the brain, the gut and the gut microbiota. Previous studies have shown walnut consumption has a positive effect on mental health. Here, using a randomized clinical trial (Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, #ACTRN12619000972123), we aimed to investigate the effects of academic stress and daily walnut consumption in university students on mental health, biochemical markers of general health, and the gut microbiota. We found academic stress had a negative impact on self-reported mood and mental health status, while daily walnut consumption improved mental health indicators and protected against some of the negative effects of academic stress on metabolic and stress biomarkers. Academic stress was associated with lower gut microbial diversity in females, which was improved by walnut consumption. The effects of academic stress or walnut consumption in male participants could not be established due to small numbers of participants. Thus, walnut consumption may have a protective effect against some of the negative impacts of academic stress, however sex-dependent mechanisms require further study.",Nutrients,2022,Mauritz F Herselman; Sheree Bailey; Permal Deo; Xin-Fu Zhou; Kate M Gunn; Larisa Bobrovskaya
35849305,Psychobiotics: the Influence of Gut Microbiota on the Gut-Brain Axis in Neurological Disorders.,"Nervous system disorders are one of the common problems that affect many people around the world every year. Regarding the beneficial effects of the probiotics on the gut and the gut-brain axis, their application along with current medications has been the subject of intense interest. Psychobiotics are a probiotic strain capable to affect the gut-brain axis. The effective role of Psychobiotics in several neurological disorders is documented. Consumption of the Psychobiotics containing nutrients has positive effects on the improvement of microbiota as well as alleviation of some symptoms of central nervous system (CNS) disorders. In the present study, the effects of probiotic strains on some CNS disorders in terms of controlling the disease symptoms were reviewed. Finding suggests that Psychobiotics can efficiently alleviate the symptoms of several CNS disorders such as autism spectrum disorders, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, insomnia, depression, diabetic neuropathy, and anorexia nervosa.

35892042,Marked shifts in gut microbial structure and neurotransmitter metabolism in fresh inmates revealed a close link between gut microbiota and mental health: A case-controlled study.,"The gut microbiota plays a pivotal role in psychological health, but the mechanistic perspective between gut microbiome and mental health remains poorly understood.The present case-controlled study recruited 30 unimprisoned subjects and 31 inmates that had been detained in jail for no more than a month. The mental health status, gut microbiota and blood NH3, H2S, 5-hydroxy trptamine and dopamine levels were measured.Compared with unimprisoned controls, the fresh inmates exhibited significantly higher scores on anxiety and depression. Both phylogenetic structure and functional genes of the gut microbiota markedly shifted in inmates. Inmates was more <i>Bacteroides</i>-dominated, while unimprisoned subjects were more <i>Prevotella</i>-dominated. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producing genera were largely decreased in inmates and were negatively related to mental disorder scores, while Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria were positive to anxiety and depression scores. Simultaneously, the inmates possessed reduced genes that participate in amino acids, carbohydrates and vitamin cofactors metabolism, but enriched genes that involved in the neurotransmitter-producing Shikimate pathway. Correlation analysis revealed that <i>Anaerotruncus</i> and <i>Prevotella</i> were negative to depression score, and <i>Enterococcus</i> was negative to anxiety score.Our results revealed potential link between gut microbiota and mental health, leading further support to the microbiota-gut-brain axis theory.",International journal of clinical and health psychology : IJCHP,2022,Yunfeng Duan; Xiaoli Wu; Yanan Yang; Liuqi Gu; Li Liu; Yunfeng Yang; Jizhong Zhou; Chongming Wu; Feng Jin
35345829,Curcumin Alleviates DSS-Induced Anxiety-Like Behaviors via the Microbial-Brain-Gut Axis.,"The anxiety and depression caused by inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are known to greatly affect the mental health of patients. The mechanism of psychiatric disorders caused by IBD is not fully understood. Previous research has suggested that the gut microbiome plays a key role in IBD. Curcumin is a yellow polyphenol extracted from the rhizome of the ginger plant, which has been shown to have effects against both depression and anxiety. Research has indicated that curcumin affects the gut microbiome and exerts antianxiety and neuroprotective effects through the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGB). However, whether curcumin can alleviate the psychiatric disorders caused by IBD and how curcumin affects the MGB axis through the gut microbiota have not been fully understood. Therefore, this study was aimed at determining the metabolic parameters and microbiological environment in the peripheral and central nervous system to determine the effects of curcumin against anxiety induced by dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS) in mice. To elaborate on the link between the gut microbiota and how curcumin alleviates anxiety-like behaviors, we performed a fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiment. The results suggested that curcumin can effectively relieve anxiety-like behaviors caused by DSS in mice. Further, curcumin treatment can alleviate disturbances in the gut microbiota and systemic disorders of lipid metabolism caused by DSS. Finally, through FMT, we verified that curcumin increased phosphatidylcholine in the prefrontal cortex of the mice and alleviated DSS-induced anxiety-like behaviors by modulating specific gut microbiota. We also revealed that <i>Muribaculaceae</i> may be a key part of the gut microbiota for curcumin to alleviate DSS-induced anxiety-like behaviors through the MGB axis.",Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,2022,Fan Zhang; Yanlin Zhou; Haitao Chen; Hao Jiang; Feini Zhou; Bin Lv; Maosheng Xu

These studies highlight the role of gut microbiota on regulating brain function and behavior through immune, metabolic, and neuronal pathways. In this review we provide an overview of the gut microbiota axis pathways to lay the groundwork for upcoming sessions on the links between the gut microbiota and neurogenerative disorders. We also discuss how the gut microbiota may act as an intermediate factor between the host and the environment to mediate disease onset and neuropathology.

36231182,Biodiversity Effects on Human Mental Health via Microbiota Alterations.,"The biodiversity hypothesis postulates that the natural environment positively affects human physical and mental health. We evaluate the latest evidence and propose new tools to examine the halobiont environment. We chose to target our review at neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety, autism, dementia, multiple sclerosis, etc. because a green prescription (exposure to green spaces) was shown to benefit patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. Specifically, our review consists of three mini reviews on the associations exploring: (1) ecological biodiversity and human microbiota; (2) human microbiota and neuropsychiatric disorders; (3) ecological biodiversity and neuropsychiatric disorders. We conclude that the environment could directly transfer microbes to humans and that human studies support the gut microbiota as part of the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. Overall, the results from the three mini reviews consistently support the biodiversity hypothesis. These findings demonstrated the plausibility of biodiversity exerting mental health effects through biophysiological mechanisms instead of psychological mechanisms alone. The idea can be further tested with novel biodiversity measurements and research on the effects of a green prescription.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2022,Yee Sang Wong; Nicholas John Osborne

35966709,Gut microbiota dysbiosis: The potential mechanisms by which alcohol disrupts gut and brain functions.,"Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a high-risk psychiatric disorder and a key cause of death and disability in individuals. In the development of AUD, there is a connection known as the microbiota-gut-brain axis, where alcohol use disrupts the gut barrier, resulting in changes in intestinal permeability as well as the gut microbiota composition, which in turn impairs brain function and worsens the patient's mental status and gut activity. Potential mechanisms are explored by which alcohol alters gut and brain function through the effects of the gut microbiota and their metabolites on immune and inflammatory pathways. Alcohol and microbiota dysregulation regulating neurotransmitter release, including DA, 5-HT, and GABA, are also discussed. Thus, based on the above discussion, it is possible to speculate on the gut microbiota as an underlying target for the treatment of diseases associated with alcohol addiction. This review will focus more on how alcohol and gut microbiota affect the structure and function of the gut and brain, specific changes in the composition of the gut microbiota, and some measures to mitigate the changes caused by alcohol exposure. This leads to a potential intervention for alcohol addiction through fecal microbiota transplantation, which could normalize the disruption of gut microbiota after AUD.",Frontiers in microbiology,2022,Ganggang Chen; Fenglei Shi; Wei Yin; Yao Guo; Anru Liu; Jiacheng Shuai; Jinhao Sun
34654024,Associations Between the Gut Microbiota and Internalizing Behaviors in Preschool Children.,"Emerging evidence points toward a connection between mental health and the gut microbiota and its metabolites (e.g., short-chain fatty acids). It is unknown whether the gut microbiota is associated with the development of mental health problems (e.g., internalizing or externalizing behaviors) in preschool children. The objective of this study was to evaluate associations between the gut microbiota and internalizing and externalizing behaviors in preschool-aged children.A community sample of 248 typically developing children (3-5 years of age) provided a stool sample for gut microbiota and SCFA analysis. Parents reported child internalizing and externalizing behaviors using the Child Behavior Checklist. Associations between child behaviors and gut microbiota measures were analyzed using Spearman correlations followed by an adjustment for multiple testing, with subanalysis conducted in children clinically ""at risk"" for behavioral problems compared with those who were not.There was a correlation between Shannon alpha diversity with internalizing behaviors (rs = -0.134, p = .035) and its subscale somatic complaints (rs = -0.144, p = .023). In addition, children clinically ""at risk"" for internalizing problems had decreased alpha diversity (U = 551, p = .017). Internalizing behaviors correlated with valerate and isobutyrate (rs = -0.147, p = .021; rs = -0.140, p = .028, respectively). Furthermore the somatic complaints subscale additionally correlated with acetate and butyrate (rs = -0.219, p = .001; rs = -0.241, p < .001, respectively). These findings were also present in children ""at risk"" for internalizing problems (U = 569, p = .026; U = 571, p = .028) and somatic complaints (U = 164, p = .004; U = 145, p = .001).These analyses reveal novel associations between internalizing behaviors and the gut microbiota in preschool children. Furthermore, a relationship between somatic complaints and acetate and butyrate was identified, indicating that interventions that increase SCFA production warrant future investigation.",Psychosomatic medicine,2022,Marcel van de Wouw; Yanan Wang; Matthew L Workentine; Elnaz Vaghef-Mehrabani; Deborah Dewey; Raylene A Reimer; Lianne Tomfohr-Madsen; Gerald F Giesbrecht
36211431,Maternal gut microbiota during pregnancy and the composition of immune cells in infancy.,"Preclinical studies have shown that maternal gut microbiota during pregnancy play a key role in prenatal immune development but the relevance of these findings to humans is unknown. The aim of this prebirth cohort study was to investigate the association between the maternal gut microbiota in pregnancy and the composition of the infant's cord and peripheral blood immune cells over the first year of life.The Barwon Infant Study cohort (<i>n</i>=1074 infants) was recruited using an unselected sampling frame. Maternal fecal samples were collected at 36 weeks of pregnancy and flow cytometry was conducted on cord/peripheral blood collected at birth, 6 and 12 months of age. Among a randomly selected sub-cohort with available samples (<i>n</i>=293), maternal gut microbiota was characterized by sequencing the 16S rRNA V4 region. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were clustered based on their abundance. Associations between maternal fecal microbiota clusters and infant granulocyte, monocyte and lymphocyte subsets were explored using compositional data analysis. Partial least squares (PLS) and regression models were used to investigate the relationships/associations between environmental, maternal and infant factors, and OTU clusters.We identified six clusters of co-occurring OTUs. The first two components in the PLS regression explained 39% and 33% of the covariance between the maternal prenatal OTU clusters and immune cell populations in offspring at birth. A cluster in which <i>Dialister, Escherichia</i>, and <i>Ruminococcus</i> were predominant was associated with a lower proportion of granulocytes (<i>p</i>=0.002), and higher proportions of both central naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD45RA<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>-</sup>) (<i>p</i><0.001) and naïve regulatory T cells (Treg) (CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD45RA<sup>+</sup>/FoxP3<sup>low</sup>) (<i>p</i>=0.02) in cord blood. The association with central naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells persisted to 12 months of age.This birth cohort study provides evidence consistent with past preclinical models that the maternal gut microbiota during pregnancy plays a role in shaping the composition of innate and adaptive elements of the infant's immune system following birth.",Frontiers in immunology,2022,Yuan Gao; Martin O'Hely; Thomas P Quinn; Anne-Louise Ponsonby; Leonard C Harrison; Hanne Frøkiær; Mimi L K Tang; Susanne Brix; Karsten Kristiansen; Dave Burgner; Richard Saffery; Sarath Ranganathan; Fiona Collier; Peter Vuillermin

36139496,Multi-Strain Probiotic Mixture Affects Brain Morphology and Resting State Brain Function in Healthy Subjects: An RCT.,"Probiotics can alter brain function via the gut-brain axis. We investigated the effect of a probiotic mixture containing <i>Bifidobacterium longum</i>, <i>Lactobacillus helveticus</i> and <i>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</i>. In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded crossover design, 22 healthy subjects (6 m/16 f; 24.2 ± 3.4 years) underwent four-week intervention periods with probiotics and placebo, separated by a four-week washout period. Voxel-based morphometry indicated that the probiotic intervention affected the gray matter volume of a cluster covering the left supramarginal gyrus and superior parietal lobule (<i>p</i> < 0.0001), two regions that were also among those with an altered resting state functional connectivity. Probiotic intervention resulted in significant (FDR < 0.05) functional connectivity changes between regions within the default mode, salience, frontoparietal as well as the language network and several regions located outside these networks. Psychological symptoms trended towards improvement after probiotic intervention, i.e., the total score of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (<i>p</i> = 0.056) and its depression sub-score (<i>p</i> = 0.093), as well as sleep patterns (<i>p</i> = 0.058). The probiotic intervention evoked distinct changes in brain morphology and resting state brain function alongside slight improvements of psycho(bio)logical markers of the gut-brain axis. The combination of those parameters may provide new insights into the modes of action by which gut microbiota can affect gut-brain communication and hence brain function.",Cells,2022,Julia Rode; Hanna M T Edebol Carlman; Julia König; Ashley N Hutchinson; Per Thunberg; Jonas Persson; Robert J Brummer
35050172,Gut Microbiota Metabolites in Major Depressive Disorder-Deep Insights into Their Pathophysiological Role and Potential Translational Applications.,"The gut microbiota is a complex and dynamic ecosystem essential for the proper functioning of the organism, affecting the health and disease status of the individuals. There is continuous and bidirectional communication between gut microbiota and the host, conforming to a unique entity known as ""holobiont"". Among these crosstalk mechanisms, the gut microbiota synthesizes a broad spectrum of bioactive compounds or metabolites which exert pleiotropic effects on the human organism. Many of these microbial metabolites can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) or have significant effects on the brain, playing a key role in the so-called microbiota-gut-brain axis. An altered microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis is a major characteristic of many neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD). Significative differences between gut eubiosis and dysbiosis in mental disorders like MDD with their different metabolite composition and concentrations are being discussed. In the present review, the main microbial metabolites (short-chain fatty acids -SCFAs-, bile acids, amino acids, tryptophan -trp- derivatives, and more), their signaling pathways and functions will be summarized to explain part of MDD pathophysiology. Conclusions from promising translational approaches related to microbial metabolome will be addressed in more depth to discuss their possible clinical value in the management of MDD patients.",Metabolites,2022,Miguel A Ortega; Miguel Angel Alvarez-Mon; Cielo García-Montero; Oscar Fraile-Martinez; Luis G Guijarro; Guillermo Lahera; Jorge Monserrat; Paula Valls; Fernando Mora; Roberto Rodríguez-Jiménez; Javier Quintero; Melchor Álvarez-Mon
36570854,Reviewing the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of depression and exploring new therapeutic options.,"The relationship between gut microbiota (GM) and mental health is one of the focuses of psychobiology research. In recent years, the microbial-gut-brain axis (MGBA) concept has gradually formed about this bidirectional communication between gut and brain. But how the GM is involved in regulating brain function and how they affect emotional disorders these mechanisms are tenuous and limited to animal research, and often controversial. Therefore, in this review, we attempt to summarize and categorize the latest advances in current research on the mechanisms of GM and depression to provide valid information for future diagnoses and therapy of mental disorders. Finally, we introduced some antidepressant regimens that can help restore gut dysbiosis, including classic antidepressants, Chinese materia medica (CMM), diet, and exogenous strains. These studies provide further insight into GM's role and potential pathways in emotion-related diseases, which holds essential possible clinical outcomes for people with depression or related psychiatric disorders. Future research should focus on clarifying the causal role of GM in disease and developing microbial targets, applying these findings to the prevention and treatment of depression.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2022,Wenjie Han; Na Wang; Mengzhen Han; Meng Ban; Tao Sun; Junnan Xu
37118092,Intermittent fasting protects against Alzheimer's disease in mice by altering metabolism through remodeling of the gut microbiota.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia without effective clinical treatment. Here, we show that intermittent fasting (IF) improves cognitive functions and AD-like pathology in a transgenic AD mouse model (5XFAD). IF alters gut microbial composition with a significant enrichment in probiotics such as Lactobacillus. The changes in the composition of the gut microbiota affect metabolic activities and metabolite production. Metabolomic profiling analysis of cecal contents revealed IF leads to a decreased carbohydrate metabolism (for example, glucose) and an increased abundance in amino acids (for example, sarcosine and dimethylglycine). Interestingly, we found that the administration of IF-elevated sarcosine or dimethylglycine mimics the protective effects of IF in 5XFAD mice, including the amelioration of cognitive decline, amyloid-β (Aβ) burden and glial overactivation. Our findings thus demonstrate an IF regimen is a potential approach to prevent AD progression, at least through the gut-microbiota-metabolites-brain axis, and constitutes an innovative AD therapeutic avenue.",Nature aging,2022,Rui-Yuan Pan; Jing Zhang; Jinlei Wang; Yingyi Wang; Zhihui Li; Yang Liao; Yajin Liao; Chenggang Zhang; Zhiqiang Liu; Lijuan Song; Jiezhong Yu; Zengqiang Yuan

35299696,The Role of MicroRNA and Microbiota in Depression and Anxiety.,"Depression and anxiety are devastating disorders. Understanding the mechanisms that underlie the development of depression and anxiety can provide new hints on novel treatments and preventive strategies. Here, we summarize the latest findings reporting the novel roles of gut microbiota and microRNAs (miRNAs) in the pathophysiology of depression and anxiety. The crosstalk between gut microbiota and the brain has been reported to contribute to these pathologies. It is currently known that some miRNAs can regulate bacterial growth and gene transcription while also modulate the gut microbiota composition, suggesting the importance of miRNAs in gut and brain health. Treatment and prevention strategies for neuropsychiatric diseases, such as physical exercise, diet, and probiotics, can modulate the gut microbiota composition and miRNAs expressions. Nonetheless, there are critical questions to be addressed to understand further the mechanisms involved in the interaction between the gut microbiota and miRNAs in the brain. This review summarizes the recent findings of the potential roles of microbiota and miRNA on the neuropathology of depression and anxiety, and its potential as treatment strategies.",Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience,2022,Julia M Rosa; Douglas A Formolo; Jiasui Yu; Thomas H Lee; Suk-Yu Yau
36440396,A genetic association study reveals the relationship between the oral microbiome and anxiety and depression symptoms.,"Growing evidence supports that alterations in the gut microbiota play an essential role in the etiology of anxiety, depression, and other psychiatric disorders. However, the potential effect of oral microbiota on mental health has received little attention.Using the latest genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data of the oral microbiome, polygenic risk scores (PRSs) of 285 salivary microbiomes and 309 tongue dorsum microbiomes were conducted. Logistic and linear regression models were applied to evaluate the relationship between salivary-tongue dorsum microbiome interactions with anxiety and depression. Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was utilized to compute the causal effects between the oral microbiome, anxiety, and depression.We observed significant salivary-tongue dorsum microbiome interactions related to anxiety and depression traits. Significantly, one common interaction was observed to be associated with both anxiety score and depression score, <i>Centipeda periodontii SGB 224</i> × <i>Granulicatella uSGB 3289</i> (P <sub>depressionscore</sub> = 1.41 × 10<sup>-8</sup>, P <sub>anxietyscore</sub> = 5.10 × 10<sup>-8</sup>). Furthermore, we detected causal effects between the oral microbiome and anxiety and depression. Importantly, we identified one salivary microbiome associated with both anxiety and depression in both the UKB database and the Finngen public database, <i>Eggerthia</i> (P <sub>IVW - majordepression - UKB</sub> = 2.99 × 10<sup>-6</sup>, P <sub>IVW - Self - reportedanxiety/panicattacks - UKB</sub> = 3.06 × 10<sup>-59</sup>, P <sub>IVW - depression - Finngen</sub> = 3.16 × 10 <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><msubsup><mrow></mrow> <mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow> <mrow><mo>-</mo> <mn>16</mn></mrow> </msubsup> </math> P <sub>IVW - anxiety - Finngen</sub> = 1.14 × 10<sup>-115</sup>).This study systematically explored the relationship between the oral microbiome and anxiety and depression, which could help improve our understanding of disease pathogenesis and propose new diagnostic targets and early intervention strategies.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2022,Chun'e Li; Yujing Chen; Yan Wen; Yumeng Jia; Shiqiang Cheng; Li Liu; Huijie Zhang; Chuyu Pan; Jingxi Zhang; Zhen Zhang; Xuena Yang; Peilin Meng; Yao Yao; Feng Zhang
35445772,Abnormal gut microbiota and bile acids in patients with first-episode major depressive disorder and correlation analysis.,"Gut microbiota and its metabolite bile acids may play a significant role in the occurrence and development of major depressive disorder (MDD). Therefore, this study analyzes gut microbiota and bile acids, as well as their correlation in patients.Thirty-one patients with MDD and 29 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled in this study. We collected their both blood and feces. Plasma bile acid content was determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and gut microbiota was detected by 16SrRNA gene sequencing and subsequently analyzed. We also analyzed the correlation between different gut microbiota, bile acids, and Hamilton Depression (HAMD) score.The α-diversity analysis found that Simpson and Pielou evenness index was much higher in HCs than in the patients with MDD. The β-diversity of the two groups were differences by nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis. Linear discriminant analysis effect size analysis identified 16 different strains. Bile acids detection showed that 23-nordeoxycholic acid in patients with MDD was significantly higher than in HCs, whereas taurolithocholic acid (TLCA), glycolithocholic acid (GLCA), and lithocholic acid 3-sulfate were significantly lower.

36014798,The Effects of Physical Activity on the Gut Microbiota and the Gut-Brain Axis in Preclinical and Human Models: A Narrative Review.,"Increasing evidence supports the importance of the gut microbiota (GM) in regulating multiple functions related to host physical health and, more recently, through the gut-brain axis (GBA), mental health. Similarly, the literature on the impact of physical activity (PA), including exercise, on GM and GBA is growing. Therefore, this narrative review summarizes and critically appraises the existing literature that delves into the benefits or adverse effects produced by PA on physical and mental health status through modifications of the GM, highlighting differences and similarities between preclinical and human studies. The same exercise in animal models, whether performed voluntarily or forced, has different effects on the GM, just as, in humans, intense endurance exercise can have a negative influence. In humans and animals, only aerobic PA seems able to modify the composition of the GM, whereas cardiovascular fitness appears related to specific microbial taxa or metabolites that promote a state of physical health. The PA favors bacterial strains that can promote physical performance and that can induce beneficial changes in the brain. Currently, it seems useful to prioritize aerobic activities at a moderate and not prolonged intensity. There may be greater benefits if PA is undertaken from a young age and the effects on the GM seem to gradually disappear when the activity is stopped. The PA produces modifications in the GM that can mediate and induce mental health benefits.",Nutrients,2022,Stefania Cataldi; Luca Poli; Fatma Neşe Şahin; Antonino Patti; Luigi Santacroce; Antonino Bianco; Gianpiero Greco; Barbara Ghinassi; Angela Di Baldassarre; Francesco Fischetti
35370947,Composition of the Gut Microbiota in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"The latest research accumulates information to explore the correlation between gut microbiota and neurodevelopmental disorders, which may lead to new approaches to treat diseases such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, the conclusions of previous studies are not completely consistent. The objective of the systematic review and meta-analysis was to identify evidence on the dysbiosis of gut microbiota in ADHD and find potential distinctive traits compared to healthy controls.Electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO, were searched up to August 24, 2021, using predetermined terms. Meta-analysis was performed to estimate the comparison of microbiota profiles (alpha and beta diversity) and the relative abundance of gut microbiota in ADHD patients and healthy controls.A total of eight studies were included in the meta-analysis, containing 316 ADHD patients and 359 healthy controls. There was a higher Shannon index in ADHD patients than in healthy controls (SMD = 0.97; 95% CI, 0.13 to 1.82; <i>P</i> = 0.02; <i>I<sup>2</sup></i>  = 96%), but the significance vanished after sensitivity analysis because of high heterogeneity. No significant differences in other alpha diversity indexes were found. Regarding the relative abundance of gut microbiota, the genus <i>Blautia</i> was significantly elevated in ADHD patients compared with controls (SMD = 0.34; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.63; <i>P</i> = 0.02; <i>I<sup>2</sup></i>  = 0%).Patients with ADHD had gut microbiome alterations compared to healthy controls. Though more studies with strict methodology are warranted due to the high heterogeneity, further studies to translate the findings of gut microbiota dysbiosis to clinical application in ADHD patients are needed and may guide targeted therapies.[https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.php?RecordID=273993], identifier PROSPERO (CRD42021273993).",Frontiers in endocrinology,2022,Ning Wang; Xuping Gao; Zifeng Zhang; Li Yang
35115853,Alterations of the Gut Microbiota in Response to Total Sleep Deprivation and Recovery Sleep in Rats.,"Accumulating evidence suggests that both sleep loss and gut dysbiosis can lead to metabolic disorders. However, less is known about the impact of total sleep deprivation (SD) and sleep recovery on the composition, function, and metabolic dynamics of the gut microbiota.Specific-pathogen free Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 48 h of SD with gentle handling and then allowed to recover for 1 week. Taxonomic profiles of fecal microbiota were obtained at baseline, 24 h of SD, 48 h of SD, and 1 week of recovery. We used 16<i>S</i> rRNA gene sequencing to analyze the gut microbial composition and function and further characterize microbiota-derived metabolites in rats.The microbiota composition analysis revealed that gut microbial composition and metabolites did not change in the rats after 24 h of SD but were significantly altered after 48 h of SD. These changes were reversible after 1 week of sleep recovery. A functional analysis was performed based on Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) annotations, indicating that 19 KEGG pathways were significantly altered in the gut microbiota in SD rats. These functional changes occurred within 24 h of SD, were more apparent after 48 h of SD, and did not fully recover after 1 week of sleep recovery.These results indicate that acute total SD leads to significant compositional and functional changes in the gut microbiota, and these changes are reversible.",Nature and science of sleep,2022,Zhong Wang; Kai Yuan; Yan-Bin Ji; Su-Xia Li; Le Shi; Zhe Wang; Xin-Yu Zhou; Yan-Ping Bao; Wen Xie; Ying Han; Jie Shi; Lin Lu; Wei Yan; Wen-Hao Chen
35433746,Guts Imbalance Imbalances the Brain: A Review of Gut Microbiota Association With Neurological and Psychiatric Disorders.,"Over the last 10 years, there has been a growing interest in the relationship between gut microbiota, the brain, and neurologic-associated affections. As multiple preclinical and clinical research studies highlight gut microbiota's potential to modulate the general state of health state, it goes without saying that gut microbiota plays a significant role in neurogenesis, mental and cognitive development, emotions, and behaviors, and in the progression of neuropsychiatric illnesses. Gut microbiota produces important biologic products that, through the gut-brain axis, are directly connected with the appearance and evolution of neurological and psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, autism, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy. This study reviews recent research on the link between gut microbiota and the brain, and microbiome's role in shaping the development of the most common neurological and psychiatric illnesses. Moreover, special attention is paid to the use of probiotic formulations as a potential non-invasive therapeutic opportunity for prevention and management of neuropsychiatric-associated affections.",Frontiers in medicine,2022,Laura Mitrea; Silvia-Amalia Nemeş; Katalin Szabo; Bernadette-Emőke Teleky; Dan-Cristian Vodnar

This review concentrates relevant literature from Scopus, PubMed, and Google Scholar analyzed with the aim of rescuing knowledge that promotes mental health. In this context, it is important to highlight those flowers, seeds, herbaceous plants, fungi, leaves, and tree barks, among other ancestral matrices, that have been historically part of the eating habits of human beings and have also been a consequence of the adaptation of collectors, consuming the ethnoflora present in different ecosystems. Likewise, it is important to note that this knowledge has been progressively lost in the new generations. Therefore, this review concentrates an important number of matrices used particularly for food and medicinal purposes, recognized for their anxiolytic and antidepressant effects, establishing the importance of metabolism and biotransformation mainly of bioactive compounds such as polyphenols by the action of the gut microbiota.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2022,Saúl Alberto Álvarez; Nuria Elizabeth Rocha-Guzmán; Rubén Francisco González-Laredo; José Alberto Gallegos-Infante; Martha Rocío Moreno-Jiménez; Marely Bravo-Muñoz
35634468,The Microbiome and Gut Endocannabinoid System in the Regulation of Stress Responses and Metabolism.,"The endocannabinoid system, with its receptors and ligands, is present in the gut epithelium and enteroendocrine cells, and is able to modulate brain functions, both indirectly through circulating gut-derived factors and directly through the vagus nerve, finally acting on the brain's mechanisms regarding metabolism and behavior. The gut endocannabinoid system also regulates gut motility, permeability, and inflammatory responses. Furthermore, microbiota composition has been shown to influence the activity of the endocannabinoid system. This review examines the interaction between microbiota, intestinal endocannabinoid system, metabolism, and stress responses. We hypothesize that the crosstalk between microbiota and intestinal endocannabinoid system has a prominent role in stress-induced changes in the gut-brain axis affecting metabolic and mental health. Inter-individual differences are commonly observed in stress responses, but mechanisms underlying resilience and vulnerability to stress are far from understood. Both gut microbiota and the endocannabinoid system have been implicated in stress resilience. We also discuss interventions targeting the microbiota and the endocannabinoid system to mitigate metabolic and stress-related disorders.",Frontiers in cellular neuroscience,2022,Raj Kamal Srivastava; Beat Lutz; Inigo Ruiz de Azua
36160716,A Minireview Exploring the Interplay of the Muscle-Gut-Brain (MGB) Axis to Improve Knowledge on Mental Disorders: Implications for Clinical Neuroscience Research and Therapeutics.,"What benefit might emerge from connecting clinical neuroscience with microbiology and exercise science? What about the influence of the muscle-gut-brain (MGB) axis on mental health? The gut microbiota colonizes the intestinal tract and plays a pivotal role in digestion, production of vitamins and immune system development, but it is also able to exert a particular effect on psychological well-being and appears to play a critical role in regulating several muscle metabolic pathways. Endogenous and exogenous factors may cause dysbiosis, with relevant consequences on the composition and function of the gut microbiota that may also modulate muscle responses to exercise. The capacity of specific psychobiotics in ameliorating mental health as complementary strategies has been recently suggested as a novel treatment for some neuropsychiatric diseases. Moreover, physical exercise can modify qualitative and quantitative composition of the gut microbiota and alleviate certain psychopathological symptoms. In this minireview, we documented evidence about the impact of the MGB axis on mental health, which currently appears to be a possible target in the context of a multidimensional intervention mainly including pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments, especially for depressive mood.",Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,2022,Davide Maria Cammisuli; Jonathan Fusi; Giorgia Scarfò; Simona Daniele; Gianluca Castelnuovo; Ferdinando Franzoni
35157946,Stressful events induce long-term gut microbiota dysbiosis and associated post-traumatic stress symptoms in healthcare workers fighting against COVID-19.,"The microbiota-gut-brain axis is a key pathway perturbed by prolonged stressors to produce brain and behavioral disorders. Frontline healthcare workers (FHWs) fighting against COVID-19 typically experience stressful event sequences and manifest some mental symptoms; however, the role of gut microbiota in such stress-induced mental problems remains unclear. We investigated the association between the psychological stress of FHW and gut microbiota.We used full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize the longitudinal changes in gut microbiota and investigated the impact of microbial changes on FHWs' mental status.Stressful events induced significant depression, anxiety, and stress in FHWs and disrupted the gut microbiome; gut dysbiosis persisted for at least half a year. Different microbes followed discrete trajectories during the half-year of follow-up. Microbes associated with mental health were mainly Faecalibacterium spp. and [Eubacterium] eligens group spp. with anti-inflammatory effects. Of note, the prediction model indicated that low abundance of [Eubacterium] hallii group uncultured bacterium and high abundance of Bacteroides eggerthii at Day 0 (immediately after the two-month frontline work) were significant determinants of the reappearance of post-traumatic stress symptoms in FHWs.The lack of metabolomic evidence and animal experiments result in the unclear mechanism of gut dysbiosis-related stress symptoms.The stressful event sequences of fighting against COVID-19 induce characteristic longitudinal changes in gut microbiota, which underlies dynamic mental state changes.",Journal of affective disorders,2022,Fengjie Gao; Ruijin Guo; Qingyan Ma; Yening Li; Wei Wang; Yajuan Fan; Yanmei Ju; Binbin Zhao; Yuan Gao; Li Qian; Zai Yang; Xiaoyan He; Xiaoying Jin; Yixin Liu; Yuan Peng; Ce Chen; Yunchun Chen; Chengge Gao; Feng Zhu; Xiancang Ma
35276927,One Giant Leap from Mouse to Man: The Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis in Mood Disorders and Translational Challenges Moving towards Human Clinical Trials.,"The microbiota-gut-brain axis is a bidirectional communication pathway that enables the gut microbiota to communicate with the brain through direct and indirect signaling pathways to influence brain physiology, function, and even behavior. Research has shown that probiotics can improve several aspects of health by changing the environment within the gut, and several lines of evidence now indicate a beneficial effect of probiotics on mental and brain health. Such evidence has prompted the arrival of a new term to the world of biotics research: psychobiotics, defined as any exogenous influence whose effect on mental health is bacterially mediated. Several taxonomic changes in the gut microbiota have been reported in neurodevelopmental disorders, mood disorders such as anxiety and depression, and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. While clinical evidence supporting the role of the gut microbiota in mental and brain health, and indeed demonstrating the beneficial effects of probiotics is rapidly accumulating, most of the evidence to date has emerged from preclinical studies employing different animal models. The purpose of this review is to focus on the role of probiotics and the microbiota-gut-brain axis in relation to mood disorders and to review the current translational challenges from preclinical to clinical research.",Nutrients,2022,Sofia D Forssten; Arthur C Ouwehand; Síle M Griffin; Elaine Patterson
35303781,Anorexia nervosa and gut microbiome: implications for weight change and novel treatments.,"Host-microbiota interactions may be involved in many physical and psychological functions ranging from the digestion of food, maintenance of immune homeostasis, to the regulation of mood and cognition. Microbiome dysbiosis has been consistently described in many diseases. The pathogenesis and weight regulation mechanism in anorexia nervosa (AN) also seem to be implicated in the dynamic bidirectional adjustment of the microbiota-gut-brain axis. This review aims at elucidating this relationship.This review starts with a description of pathogenic gut-brain pathways. Next, we focus on the latest research on the associations between gut microbiota and weight change in the condition of AN. The strategies to alter the intestinal microbiome for the treatment of this disorder are discussed, including dietary, probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation.Gut microbiome is inextricably linked to AN. It may regulate weight gain in the process of refeeding via the microbiota-gut-brain axis, while the specific mechanism has yet to be clearly established. In the future, a better understanding of gut microbiome could have implications for developing microbiome-based prevention, diagnostics and therapies.",Expert review of gastroenterology & hepatology,2022,Yaohui Wei; Sufang Peng; Cheng Lian; Qing Kang; Jue Chen
35085752,(R)-ketamine ameliorates demyelination and facilitates remyelination in cuprizone-treated mice: A role of gut-microbiota-brain axis.,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common demyelinating disease that attacks the central nervous system. We recently reported that the new antidepressant (R)-ketamine could ameliorate the disease progression in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model of MS. Cuprizone (CPZ) has been used to produce demyelination which resembles demyelination in MS patients. This study was undertaken to investigate whether (R)-ketamine could affect demyelination in CPZ-treated mice and remyelination after CPZ withdrawal. Repeated treatment with (R)-ketamine (10 mg/kg/day, twice weekly, for 6 weeks) significantly ameliorated demyelination and activated microglia in the brain compared with saline-treated mice. Furthermore, pretreatment with ANA-12 (TrkB antagonist) significantly blocked the beneficial effects of (R)-ketamine on the demyelination and activated microglia in the brain of CPZ-treated mice. The 16S rRNA analysis showed that (R)-ketamine significantly improved abnormal composition of gut-microbiota and decreased levels of lactic acid of CPZ-treated mice. In addition, there were significant correlations between demyelination (or microglial activation) in the brain and the relative abundance of several microbiome, suggesting a link between gut microbiota and brain. Interestingly, (R)-ketamine could facilitate remyelination in the brain after CPZ withdrawal. In conclusion, the study suggests that (R)-ketamine could ameliorate demyelination in the brain of CPZ-treated mice through TrkB activation, and that gut-microbiota-microglia crosstalk may play a role in the demyelination of CPZ-treated mice. Therefore, it is likely that (R)-ketamine could be a new therapeutic drug for MS.",Neurobiology of disease,2022,Xingming Wang; Lijia Chang; Xiayun Wan; Yunfei Tan; Youge Qu; Jiajing Shan; Yong Yang; Li Ma; Kenji Hashimoto
35279596,"Targeting NLRP3 inflammasome modulates gut microbiota, attenuates corticospinal tract injury and ameliorates neurobehavioral deficits after intracerebral hemorrhage in mice.","Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) has a high mortality and disability rate. Fewer studies focus on white matter injury (WMI) after ICH, especially the corticospinal tract (CST) injury located in the spinal cord, which correlates with motor impairments. Recent studies have shown that gut microbiota dysbiosis occurs after ICH. Furthermore, NLRP3 inflammasome can be activated after ICH, resulting in inflammatory cascade reactions and aggravating brain injury. However, no direct and causal correlation among NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition, altered gut microbiota, and CST injury following ICH has been reported. This study aimed to investigate the effect of MCC950, a selective NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor, on the gut microbiota and CST injury after ICH. We observed that compared with the sham group, the members of Firmicutes, such as Faecalibaculum and Dubosiella, were depleted in the ICH + Vehicle group, whereas the members of Proteobacteria and Campilobacterota were enriched, such as Enterobacter and Helicobacter. After treatment with MCC950, the Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium and Paenibacillus were relatively abundant in the gut flora of mice. Moreover, we observed CST injury located in cervical enlargement of the spinal cord, and MCC950 alleviated it. Furthermore, treatment with MCC950 decreased the mNSS score and brain water content in ICH. Taken together, the present study showed that MCC950 modulated gut microbiota, effectively attenuated CST injury located in cervical enlargement of the spinal cord, and ameliorated neurological deficits after ICH. This study provided a novel report that links NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition, gut microbiota alteration and CST injury following ICH and profound implications for ICH treatment.",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2022,Linglong Xiao; Huaping Zheng; Jing Li; Meiqin Zeng; Dian He; Jianhao Liang; Kaijian Sun; Yunhao Luo; Feng Li; Baohong Ping; Wen Yuan; Hongwei Zhou; Qinghua Wang; Haitao Sun
36140263,Alterations of the Composition and Neurometabolic Profile of Human Gut Microbiota in Major Depressive Disorder.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is among the most prevalent mental disorders worldwide. Factors causing the pathogenesis of MDD include gut microbiota (GM), which interacts with the host through the gut-brain axis. In previous studies of GM in MDD patients, 16S rRNA sequencing was used, which provided information about composition but not about function. In our study, we analyzed whole metagenome sequencing data to assess changes in both the composition and functional profile of GM. We looked at the GM of 36 MDD patients, compared with that of 38 healthy volunteers. Comparative taxonomic analysis showed decreased abundances of <i>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</i>, <i>Roseburia hominis</i>, and <i>Roseburia intestinalis</i>, and elevated abundances of <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Ruthenibacterium lactatiformans</i> in the GM of MDD patients. We observed decreased levels of bacterial genes encoding key enzymes involved in the production of arginine, asparagine, glutamate, glutamine, melatonin, acetic, butyric and conjugated linoleic acids, and spermidine in MDD patients. These genes produced signature pairs with <i>Faecalibacterium prausntizii</i> and correlated with decreased levels of this species in the GM of MDD patients. These results show the potential impact of the identified biomarker bacteria and their metabolites on the pathogenesis of MDD, and should be confirmed in future metabolomic studies.",Biomedicines,2022,Alexey S Kovtun; Olga V Averina; Irina Y Angelova; Roman A Yunes; Yana A Zorkina; Anna Y Morozova; Alexey V Pavlichenko; Timur S Syunyakov; Olga A Karpenko; George P Kostyuk; Valery N Danilenko
35631301,Anthocyanins in Chronic Diseases: The Power of Purple.,"Anthocyanins are mainly purple-coloured phenolic compounds of plant origin that as secondary metabolites are important in plant survival. Understanding their health benefits in humans requires sourcing these unstable compounds in sufficient quantities at a reasonable cost, which has led to improved methods of extraction. Dark-coloured fruits, cereals and vegetables are current sources of these compounds. The range of potential sustainable sources is much larger and includes non-commercialised native plants from around the world and agri-waste containing anthocyanins. In the last 5 years, there have been significant advances in developing the therapeutic potential of anthocyanins in chronic human diseases. Anthocyanins exert their beneficial effects through improvements in gut microbiota, oxidative stress and inflammation, and modulation of neuropeptides such as insulin-like growth factor-1. Their health benefits in humans include reduced cognitive decline; protection of organs such as the liver, as well as the cardiovascular system, gastrointestinal tract and kidneys; improvements in bone health and obesity; and regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism.

36648872,Obesity and Its Multiple Clinical Implications between Inflammatory States and Gut Microbiotic Alterations.,"Obesity is a chronic multifactorial disease that has become a serious health problem and is currently widespread over the world. It is, in fact, strongly associated with many other conditions, including insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, the onset of different types of malignant tumors and alterations in reproductive function. According to the literature, obesity is characterized by a state of low-grade chronic inflammation, with a substantial increase in immune cells, specifically macrophage infiltrates in the adipose tissue which, in turn, secrete a succession of pro-inflammatory mediators. Furthermore, recent studies on microbiota have postulated new possible mechanisms of interaction between obesity and unbalanced nutrition with inflammation. This intestinal ""superorganism"" complex seems to influence not only the metabolic balance of the host but also the immune response, favoring a state of systemic inflammation and insulin resistance. This review summarizes the major evidence on the interactions between the gut microbiota, energetic metabolism and host immune system, all leading to a convergence of the fields of immunology, nutrients physiology and microbiota in the context of obesity and its possible clinical complications. Finally, possible therapeutic approaches aiming to rebalance the intestinal microbial ecosystem are evaluated to improve the alteration of inflammatory and metabolic states in obesity and related diseases.","Diseases (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,Walter Milano; Francesca Carizzone; Mariagabriella Foia; Magda Marchese; Mariafrancesca Milano; Biancamaria Saetta; Anna Capasso
35600753,Gut microbiome in schizophrenia and antipsychotic-induced metabolic alterations: a scoping review.,"Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a severe mental disorder with high morbidity and lifetime disability rates. Patients with SCZ have a higher risk of developing metabolic comorbidities such as obesity and diabetes mellitus, leading to increased mortality. Antipsychotics (APs), which are the mainstay in the treatment of SCZ, increase the risk of these metabolic perturbations. Despite extensive research, the mechanism underlying SCZ pathophysiology and associated metabolic comorbidities remains unclear. In recent years, gut microbiota (GMB) has been regarded as a 'chamber of secrets', particularly in the context of severe mental illnesses such as SCZ, depression, and bipolar disorder. In this scoping review, we aimed to investigate the underlying role of GMB in the pathophysiology of SCZ and metabolic alterations associated with APs. Furthermore, we also explored the therapeutic benefits of prebiotic and probiotic formulations in managing SCZ and AP-induced metabolic alterations. A systematic literature search yielded 46 studies from both preclinical and clinical settings that met inclusion criteria for qualitative synthesis. Preliminary evidence from preclinical and clinical studies indicates that GMB composition changes are associated with SCZ pathogenesis and AP-induced metabolic perturbations. Fecal microbiota transplantation from SCZ patients to mice has been shown to induce SCZ-like behavioral phenotypes, further supporting the plausible role of GMB in SCZ pathogenesis. This scoping review recapitulates the preclinical and clinical evidence suggesting the role of GMB in SCZ symptomatology and metabolic adverse effects associated with APs. Moreover, this scoping review also discusses the therapeutic potentials of prebiotic/probiotic formulations in improving SCZ symptoms and attenuating metabolic alterations related to APs.",Therapeutic advances in psychopharmacology,2022,Raghunath Singh; Nicolette Stogios; Emily Smith; Jiwon Lee; Kateryna Maksyutynsk; Emily Au; David C Wright; Giada De Palma; Ariel Graff-Guerrero; Philip Gerretsen; Daniel J Müller; Gary Remington; Margaret Hahn; Sri Mahavir Agarwal
35526743,The gut microbiome and adult hippocampal neurogenesis: A new focal point for epilepsy?,"Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a neurological disorder affecting millions of people worldwide and currently represents the most common form of focal epilepsy. Thus, the search for aetiological and pathophysiological parameters of TLE is ongoing. Preclinical work and post-mortem human studies suggest adult hippocampal neurogenesis as a potentially relevant factor in TLE pathogenesis. Although progress has been made in elucidating the molecular links between TLE and hippocampal neurogenesis, recent evidence suggests that additional peripheral mediators may be involved. The microbiota-gut-brain axis mediates bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain and could comprise a link between neurogenesis and TLE. In this review, we discuss emerging evidence highlighting a potential role for the gut microbiome in connecting TLE pathogenesis and hippocampal neurogenesis. We focus in particular on mechanisms associated with neuronal excitability, neuroinflammation and gut microbial metabolites. As the evidence does not yet support a direct link between gut microbiota-regulated hippocampal neurogenesis and TLE aetiology or pathophysiology, future studies are needed to establish whether current findings comprise circumstantial links or a potentially novel avenue for clinically relevant research.",Neurobiology of disease,2022,Sebastian Dohm-Hansen; Francisco Donoso; Paul J Lucassen; Gerard Clarke; Yvonne M Nolan
35207483,Novel Pharmacological Approaches to the Treatment of Depression.,"Major depressive disorder is one of the most prevalent mental health disorders. Monoamine-based antidepressants were the first drugs developed to treat major depressive disorder. More recently, ketamine and other analogues were introduced as fast-acting antidepressants. Unfortunately, currently available therapeutics are inadequate; lack of efficacy, adverse effects, and risks leave patients with limited treatment options. Efforts are now focused on understanding the etiology of depression and identifying novel targets for pharmacological treatment. In this review, we discuss promising novel pharmacological targets for the treatment of major depressive disorder. Targeting receptors including N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, G-protein-coupled receptor 39, metabotropic glutamate receptors, galanin and opioid receptors has potential antidepressant effects. Compounds targeting biological processes: inflammation, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, and gut microbiota have also shown therapeutic potential. Additionally, natural products including plants, herbs, and fatty acids improved depressive symptoms and behaviors. In this review, a brief history of clinically available antidepressants will be provided, with a primary focus on novel pharmaceutical approaches with promising antidepressant effects in preclinical and clinical studies.","Life (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,Elias Elias; Ariel Y Zhang; Melissa T Manners
35453597,Gut Microbiota-Brain Axis as a Potential Modulator of Psychological Stress after Spinal Cord Injury.,"A growing body of evidence from preclinical and clinical studies has associated alterations of the gut microbiota-brain axis with the progression and development of a number of pathological conditions that also affect cognitive functions. Spinal cord injuries (SCIs) can be produced from traumatic and non-traumatic causes. It has been reported that SCIs are commonly associated with anxiety and depression-like symptoms, showing an incidence range between 11 and 30% after the injury. These psychological stress-related symptoms are associated with worse prognoses in SCIs and have been attributed to psychosocial stressors and losses of independence. Nevertheless, emotional and mental modifications after SCI could be related to changes in the volume of specific brain areas associated with information processing and emotions. Additionally, physiological modifications have been recognized as a predisposing factor for mental health depletion, including the development of gut dysbiosis. This condition of imbalance in microbiota composition has been shown to be associated with depression in clinical and pre-clinical models. Therefore, the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the relationship between SCIs, gut dysbiosis and psychological stress could contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies to improve SCI patients' quality of life.",Biomedicines,2022,Samir Musleh-Vega; Jorge Ojeda; Pia M Vidal
35135531,Enhanced intestinal protein fermentation in schizophrenia.,"Emerging findings highlighted the associations of mental illness to nutrition and dysbiosis in the intestinal microbiota, but the underlying mechanisms, especially in schizophrenia (SZ), remain unclarified.We conducted a case-control study of SZ patients (case to control=100:52) by performing sequencing of the gut metagenome; measurement of fecal and plasma non-targeted metabolome; including short-, medium-, and long-chain fatty acids; and targeted metabolites, along with recorded details of daily intakes of food.The metagenome analysis uncovered enrichment of asaccharolytic species and reduced abundance of carbohydrate catabolism pathways and enzymes in the gut of SZ patients, but increased abundance of peptidases in contrast to their significantly reduced protein intake. Fecal metabolome analysis identified increased concentrations of many protein catabolism products, including amino acids (AAs), urea, branched short-chain fatty acids, and various nitrogenous derivates of aromatic AAs in SZ patients. Protein synthesis, represented by the abundance of AA-biosynthesis pathways and aminoacyl-tRNA transferases in metagenome, was significantly decreased. The AUCs (area under the curve) of the diagnostic random forest models based on their abundance achieved 85% and 91%, respectively. The fecal levels of AA-fermentative enzymes and products uniformly showed positive correlations with the severity of psychiatric symptoms.Our findings revealed apparent dysbiosis in the intestinal microbiome of SZ patients, where microbial metabolism is dominated by protein fermentation and shift from carbohydrate fermentation and protein synthesis in healthy conditions. The aberrant macronutrient metabolism by gut microbes highlights the importance of nutrition care and the potential for developing microbiota-targeted therapeutics in SZ.",BMC medicine,2022,Ying Liang; Xing Shi; Yang Shen; Zhuoran Huang; Jian Wang; Changjun Shao; Yanan Chu; Jing Chen; Jun Yu; Yu Kang
36363733,"Psycho-Microbiology, a New Frontier for Probiotics: An Exploratory Overview.","Probiotics are gradually gaining importance in the field of psychiatry in the form of psychobiotics. Psychobiotics' studies examine the existing relationship between gut microbiota and mental phenomena; the intake of certain strains of probiotics, such as <i>Bifidobacterium</i> and <i>Lactobacillus</i>, for example, allow the gut microbial system to be modified in order to provide benefits at the psychic, immune, hormonal, and mental levels. Those who suffer from forms of depression, anxiety disorders, chronic stress, low mood, but also people who do not suffer from such disorders, can therefore benefit from the use of psychobiotics. Thanks to probiotics, neurochemicals can in fact be produced within the gut microbiota and interact with receptors of the enteric nervous system that innervate the entire gastrointestinal tract. Once they enter the portal circulation, these substances go on to influence components of the nervous system and ultimately the brain, through what is called the gut-brain axis. This article proposes an exploratory overview of the proven effects of probiotics on brain activity and psycho-related diseases, focusing on clinical studies and measurable outcomes.

As it becomes apparent that overweight and obesity have ripple effects through generations, understanding of the processes involved is required, in both maternal and paternal epigenetic inheritance. We focused on the patrilineal effects of a Western-style high-fat (21%) and high-sugar (34%) diet (WD) compared to control diet (CD) during adolescence and investigated F0 and F1 mice for physiological and behavioral changes. F0 males (fathers) showed increased body weight, impaired glycemic control, and decreased attractiveness to females. Paternal WD caused significant phenotypic changes in F1 offspring, including higher body weights of pups, increased Actinobacteria abundance in the gut microbiota (ascertained using 16S microbiome profiling), a food preference for WD pellets, increased male dominance and attractiveness to females, as well as decreased behavioral despair. These results collectively demonstrate the long-term intergenerational effects of a Western-style diet during paternal adolescence. The behavioral and physiological alterations in F1 offspring provide evidence of adaptive paternal programming via epigenetic inheritance. These findings have important implications for understanding paternally mediated intergenerational inheritance, and its relevance to offspring health and disease susceptibility.",FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,2022,Carina Bodden; Terence Y Pang; Yingshi Feng; Faria Mridha; Geraldine Kong; Shanshan Li; Matthew J Watt; Amy C Reichelt; Anthony J Hannan
36478577,Meals and movies: making our microbiota merry.,"To investigate the impact of festive cinematic diets on the gut microbiota.Observational (watching films) and creative review. Sadly, we couldn't incorporate any snowball sampling.In front of a television, by a blazing log fire.Everyone: you don't need to be on the nice list!Microbiota INdex of Comparative Evaluation for Pictorial Infographic Evidence (MINCE PIE) scores (difference between the numbers of microbiota-enhancing and microbiota-detrimental food groups) for foods depicted in twelve festive films.Most festive films featured meals or foods from a typical Western diet, with high sugar and fat content, with overall negative effects on the microbiota. However, some films promoted options containing fibre, beneficial proteins, or polyphenols. These are gifts under the Christmas tree for our microbiota.Good balance is needed for our microbiota, and consequently our mental health. Many festive films portray a Western diet that can lead to dysbiosis. Through their action on the gut-brain axis and the influence of media on dietary choices, the festive foods consumed in these films (maybe an extra chocolate biscuit during Love Actually) can be stressful for our microbiota.",The Medical journal of Australia,2022,Olivia Yousef; Stephen De Souza
36037991,"Effects of spleen nerve denervation on depression-like phenotype, systemic inflammation, and abnormal composition of gut microbiota in mice after administration of lipopolysaccharide: A role of brain-spleen axis.","Accumulating evidence suggests the role of brain-spleen axis as well as brain-gut-microbiota axis in inflammation-related depression. The spleen mediates anti-inflammatory effects of the vagus nerve which plays a role in depression. However, the role of spleen nerve in inflammation-related depression remains unclear.The effects of the splenic nerve denervation (SND) in the depression-like phenotype, systemic inflammation, and abnormal composition of gut microbiota in adult mice after administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were examined.LPS (0.5 mg/kg) caused depression-like phenotype, systemic inflammation, splenomegaly, increased expression of Iba1 (ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1) and decreased expression of postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95) in the hippocampus in the sham-operated mice. In contrast, LPS did not produce depression-like phenotype, and abnormal expressions of Iba1 and PSD-95 in the hippocampus in the SND-operated mice. Furthermore, SND significantly blocked LPS-induced increased plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 although SND did not affect LPS-induced splenomegaly and increased plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor-α in mice. There were significant changes in several microbiota among the four groups. Interestingly, there were correlations between the relative abundance of several microbiota and Iba1 (or PSD-95) expression in the hippocampus. In addition, expression of Iba1 in the hippocampus was correlated with the relative abundance of several microbiota.Detailed mechanisms are unclear.These results suggest that the splenic nerve plays a role in inflammation-related depression, microglial activation in the hippocampus, and that gut microbiota may regulate microglial function in the brain via gut-microbiota-brain axis.",Journal of affective disorders,2022,Li Ma; Jiancheng Zhang; Yuko Fujita; Hiroyo Shinno-Hashimoto; Jiajing Shan; Xiayun Wan; Youge Qu; Lijia Chang; Xingming Wang; Kenji Hashimoto
35715396,Experiencing social exclusion changes gut microbiota composition.,"Gut microbiota is suggested to regulate the host's mental health via the gut-brain axis. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the microbiome and psychological pain due to social exclusion. Adult individuals with (n = 14) and without (n = 25) social exclusion experience were assessed for the psychological status using self-reported questionnaires: Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Beck Depression Inventory, and the UCLA Loneliness Scale. The gut microbiota was analyzed by 16 S rRNA gene sequencing and bioinformatics. The exclusion group had a 1.70-fold higher total BAI score and 2.16-fold higher levels of anxiety-related physical symptoms (p < 0.05). The gut microbial profiles also differed between the two groups. The exclusion group showed higher probability of having Prevotella-enriched microbiome (odds ratio, 2.29; 95% confidence interval, 1.65-2.75; p < 0.05), a significantly reduced Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, and decreased abundance of Faecalibacterium spp. (p < 0.05) which was associated with the duration and intensity of social exclusion (p < 0.05). Our results indicate that the psychological pain due to social exclusion is correlated with the gut microbiota composition, suggesting that targeting social exclusion-related microorganisms can be a new approach to solving psychological problems and related social issues.",Translational psychiatry,2022,Chong-Su Kim; Go-Eun Shin; Yunju Cheong; Ji-Hee Shin; Dong-Mi Shin; Woo Young Chun
36421473,New Insights into the Gut Microbiota in Neurodegenerative Diseases from the Perspective of Redox Homeostasis.,"An imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants in the body can lead to oxidative stress, which is one of the major causes of neurodegenerative diseases. The gut microbiota contains trillions of beneficial bacteria that play an important role in maintaining redox homeostasis. In the last decade, the microbiota-gut-brain axis has emerged as a new field that has revolutionized the study of the pathology, diagnosis, and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Indeed, a growing number of studies have found that communication between the brain and the gut microbiota can be accomplished through the endocrine, immune, and nervous systems. Importantly, dysregulation of the gut microbiota has been strongly associated with the development of oxidative stress-mediated neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, a deeper understanding of the relationship between the gut microbiota and redox homeostasis will help explain the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases from a new perspective and provide a theoretical basis for proposing new therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we will describe the role of oxidative stress and the gut microbiota in neurodegenerative diseases and the underlying mechanisms by which the gut microbiota affects redox homeostasis in the brain, leading to neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, we will discuss the potential applications of maintaining redox homeostasis by modulating the gut microbiota to treat neurodegenerative diseases, which could open the door for new therapeutic approaches to combat neurodegenerative diseases.","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,Yu Wang; Zhe Zhang; Bowen Li; Bo He; Lei Li; Edouard C Nice; Wei Zhang; Jia Xu
36437014,Assessment and Treatment of Eating Disorders.,"Eating disorders are serious psychiatric conditions in terms of chronicity and have the highest mortality rate among psychiatric disorders. The assessment and treatment of eating disorders are also challenging, due to patients' denial of their illness and reluctance for change. Despite a large number of previous assessment and treatment studies, new strategies to overcome these difficulties are still needed. This study casts light on four aspects; involvement of the brain's reward system, stages of change in relationship with motivation, refeeding syndrome during renourishment, and gut microbiota changes relating to chronicity. Further studies relating to these aspects are encouraged.",Journal of nutritional science and vitaminology,2022,Kazuhiro Yoshiuchi; Hisashi Yamada; Shu Takakura; Masanori Isobe; Koutatsu Maruyama; Toshihiko Nagata
35432038,The Oral-Microbiome-Brain Axis and Neuropsychiatric Disorders: An Anthropological Perspective.,"In the 21st century, neuropsychiatric disorders (NPDs) are on the rise, yet the causal mechanisms behind this global epidemic remain poorly understood. A key to these unknowns may lie within the vast communities of bacteria, fungi, and viruses in the body (microbiota), which are intimately linked with health and disease. NPDs were recently shown to be connected to gut microbiota, which can communicate with and influence the brain through the Gut-Brain-Axis (GBA). Parallel studies examining oral microbiota and their connections to the brain also suggest that microbes in the mouth can similarly influence NPD outcomes. However, the mechanisms and pathways that illuminate how oral microbiota and brain communicate in NPDs remain unknown. Here, we review identified mechanisms and pathways that oral microbiota use to engage the brain, and we lay the theoretical foundation for an oral-microbiota-brain axis (OMBA). Specifically, we examine established neuroinflammatory and immune system activation responses that underpin interactions between the oral microbiota and the central nervous system (CNS), detailing four specific mechanisms: (1) microbial and metabolite escape, (2) neuroinflammation, (3) CNS signaling, and (4) response to neurohormones. We then scrutinize why including the OMBA, in addition to the GBA, is critically needed to elucidate specific causal relationships between microbial dysbiosis and observed NPD development and progression. Furthermore, we argue for comprehensive, interdisciplinary approaches that integrate lab-based microbiome research and population-level studies that examine the OMBA to improve NPDs. We specifically identify key anthropological perspectives that integrate sociocultural, epidemiological, genetic, and environmental factors that shape the oral microbiome and its interactions with NPDs. Together, future studies of the OMBA in conjunction with interdisciplinary approaches can be used to identify NPD risks and improve outcomes, as well as develop novel intervention and treatment strategies.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2022,Grace B Bowland; Laura S Weyrich
36120376,Neferine alleviates chronic stress-induced depression by regulating monoamine neurotransmitter secretion and gut microbiota structure.,"Neferine (Nef) might possess anti-depressive properties; however, its therapeutic effects are yet to be elucidated. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to explore the anti-depressant property of Nef using a mouse model of chronic stress-induced depression. Fifteen depression-prone mice were randomly selected and divided into three groups, namely, the model, Nef, and fluoxetine (Flu) groups. We observed that in tail suspension and forced swimming tests, the Nef and Flu treatments significantly decreased the immobility time of the depressed mice, and increased their sucrose preference indices. Moreover, both Nef and Flu treatments induced significant increases in the levels of anti-depressant neurotransmitters, including dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT), and norepinephrine (NE), and also reduced pathological damage to the hippocampus of the depressed mice. Incidentally, Illumina MiSeq sequencing analysis demonstrated that the relative abundance of <i>Lactobacillus</i> in the intestinal microbiota of depressed mice was restored after Nef/Flu treatment. Moreover, colonic <i>Lactobacillus</i> abundance was positively correlated with the levels of DA, 5-HT, and NE in the hippocampus of the mice. In conclusion, Nef improved monoamine neurotransmitter secretion and modulated the intestinal flora structure, particularly the abundance of <i>Lactobacillus</i>. Hence, it showed considerable anti-depressant potential, and might be a prospective anti-depressant therapeutic agent.",Frontiers in pharmacology,2022,Zaiquan Dong; Qinglian Xie; Feiyu Xu; Xiaoling Shen; Yanni Hao; Jin Li; Haizhen Xu; Qiang Peng; Weihong Kuang
35286767,Potential of Probiotics as an Adjunct for Patients with Major Depressive Disorder.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is an enfeebling disease with a lifetime incidence of 20%. While accumulating studies implicate a correlation between the disease and gut microbiota, data show that not every patient responded to probiotic treatments. To comprehensively assess the potential role of probiotics in MDD, this study first summarizes the current pathological hypothesis of the disease from a life-stage perspective, focuses on the potential role of ""depression gut microbiota."" Currently available managements are then briefly summarized and novel bio-materials having potential therapeutic effects on MDD are also evaluated. To harness the positive effect of probiotics, prebiotics, and postbiotics, clinical evidence and their applications on MDD patients are listed. Factors that may counteract the pre/probiotic applications, such as diet, physiology, gender difference, and use of antibiotics and antidepressants are also discussed. The endocannabinoid (eCBs) system may be promising targets for probiotic therapy. More evidence is needed to demonstrate the hierarchical factors in the complex network driving the disease, and probiotic can be one promising adjunct for patients with MDD.",Molecular nutrition & food research,2022,Weihe Cang; Junrui Wu; Ruixue Ding; Weiming Wang; Na Li; Haisu Shi; Lin Shi; Yuankun Lee; Rina Wu
36078738,The Role of Psychobiotics to Ensure Mental Health during the COVID-19 Pandemic-A Current State of Knowledge.,"Psychobiotics are defined as probiotics, mainly of the genus <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, that confer mental health benefits to the host when consumed in a particular quantity through the interaction with commensal gut microbiota. The gut microbiota, which means a diverse and dynamic population of microorganisms harboring the gastrointestinal tract, communicates with the brain and vice versa through the brain-gut axis. The mechanisms of action of psychobiotics may be divided into four groups: synthesis of neurotransmitters and neurochemicals, regulation of the HPA axis, influence on the immune system, and synthesis of metabolites. Recent years showed that the COVID-19 pandemic affected not only physical, but also mental health. Social isolation, fear of infection, the lack of adequate vaccine, disinformation, increased number of deaths, financial loss, quarantine, and lockdown are all factors can cause psychiatric problems. The aim of this review was to discuss the potential role of psychobiotic in light of the current problems, based on <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies, meta-analyses, clinical trials evidence, and registered studies assessing probiotics' therapeutic administration in the prevention or treatment of symptoms or side effects of COVID-19.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2022,Dorota Zielińska; Marcelina Karbowiak; Aneta Brzezicka
35840611,The effects of probiotics on risk and time preferences.,"Animal models, human neuroimaging and lesion studies revealed that the gut microbiota can influence the interaction between the central and the enteric nervous systems via the gut-brain axis (GBA) and can affect brain regions linked to basic emotional and cognitive processes. The role of the gut microbiota in decision-making in healthy humans thus far remains largely unknown. Our study establishes a functional relationship between the gut microbiota and healthy humans' decisions that involve risk and time. We conducted a between subjects' placebo-controlled double-blinded design, with two groups and two sessions separated by 28 days, during which participants received daily doses of probiotics or a placebo. We investigated whether the prolonged and controlled intake of probiotics affects risk-taking behavior and intertemporal choices using incentivized economic tasks. We found a significant decrease in risk-taking behavior and an increase in future-oriented choices in the probiotics group as compared to the placebo group. These findings provide the first direct experimental evidence suggesting a potential functional role on the part of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in decision-making, creating a path for potential clinical applications and allowing for a better understanding of the underlying neural mechanisms of risk-taking behavior and intertemporal choices.",Scientific reports,2022,Aline M Dantas; Alexander T Sack; Elisabeth Bruggen; Peiran Jiao; Teresa Schuhmann
36329546,A critical analysis of eating disorders and the gut microbiome.,"The gut microbiota, also known as our ""second brain"" is an exciting frontier of research across a multitude of health domains. Gut microbes have been implicated in feeding behaviour and obesity, as well as mental health disorders including anxiety and depression, however their role in the development and maintenance of eating disorders (EDs) has only recently been considered. EDs are complex mental health conditions, shaped by a complicated interplay of factors. Perhaps due to an incomplete understanding of the etiology of EDs, treatment remains inadequate with affected individuals likely to face many relapses. The gut microbiota may be a missing piece in understanding the etiology of eating disorders, however more robust scientific inquiry is needed in the field before concrete conclusions can be made. In this spotlight paper, we critically evaluate what is known about the bi-directional relationship between gut microbes and biological processes that are implicated in the development and maintenance of EDs, including physiological functioning, hormones, neurotransmitters, the central nervous system, and the immune system. We outline limitations of current research, propose concrete steps to move the field forward and, hypothesize potential clinical implications of this research. Our gut is inhabited by millions of bacteria which have more recently been referred to as ""our second brain"". In fact, these microbes are thought to play a role in ED behaviour, associated anxiety and depression, and even affect our weight. Recent research has dove into this field with promising findings that have the potential to be applied clinically to improve ED recovery. The present paper discusses what is known about the gut microbiome in relation to EDs and the promising implications that leveraging this knowledge, through fecal microbiome transplants, probiotics, and microbiome-directed supplemental foods, could have on ED treatment.",Journal of eating disorders,2022,Sydney M Terry; Jacqueline A Barnett; Deanna L Gibson
36959989,Emerging Role and Place of Probiotics in the Management of Pediatric Neurodevelopmental Disorders.,"The current decade has witnessed significant developments with the latest therapeutic agents for managing various infectious diseases to complex hemato-oncological conditions, leading to a decrease in morbidity and mortality, while improving the quality of life (QoL), and increasing the life span. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), which are on the rise across all age-groups, are being driven by unhealthy lifestyles and improved mental health issues. The current therapeutic agents were found to offer only symptomatic relief of varying efficacy and significant adverse effects, leading clinicians to evaluate other options for the management of both neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. The role of gut microbiota has emerged as a potential target for the treatment of both neurodegenerative diseases and neurodevelopmental disorders like attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)/autism spectrum disorders (ASD) as a result of the decoding of the human genome and advances in our understanding of the human gut microbiome, including its interactions with the human brain. This review has been undertaken to understand on date level of understanding of human microbiota and towards identifying probiotic strains with proven efficacy and safety. According to recent investigations, several <i>lactobacillus</i> strains, including <i>L.</i> <i>Paracasei 37</i>, <i>L. Planetarium 128, L. reuteri DSM 17938</i>, and <i>Bifidobacterium longum</i>, have been effective in treating children's neurodevelopmental disorders such as ASD and ADHD.

The shared and specific BA profiles were explored and potential markers associated with disease development and progression were summarized. The mechanistic roles of BAs were reviewed with focuses on inflammation, gut-brain-microbiota axis, cellular apoptosis. We also discussed future perspectives for the prevention and treatment of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders by targeting BAs and related molecules and gut microbiota.

35779628,(R)-ketamine as prophylactic and therapeutic drug for neurological disorders: Beyond depression.,"Neurological disorders are the leading cause of disability and the second leading cause of death worldwide. The increasing social and economic burdens of neurological disorders are driven by global population growth and aging. Depression is a common psychiatric symptom in numerous neurological disorders. It is also a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias, Parkinson's disease (PD), and stroke. The rapid-acting and sustained antidepressant actions of (R,S)-ketamine for severe depression was accidentally discovered. Interestingly, (R)-ketamine has greater potency and longer-lasting antidepressant-like effects than (S)-ketamine in rodents. Importantly, its side effects in rodents and humans are lower than those of (R,S)-ketamine and (S)-ketamine. Furthermore, (R)-ketamine could elicit beneficial actions in various rodent models of neurological disorders, including PD, multiple sclerosis (MS), and stroke. In this article, we review the potential of (R)-ketamine as a prophylactic or therapeutic drug for neurological disorders including AD and other dementias, PD, MS, and stroke.",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,2022,Xingming Wang; Jianjun Yang; Kenji Hashimoto
36104346,"Maternal immune activation induces autism-like changes in behavior, neuroinflammatory profile and gut microbiota in mouse offspring of both sexes.","Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a sex-biased neurodevelopmental disorder with a male to female prevalence of 4:1, characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and interaction and restricted-repetitive patterns of behavior, interests or activities. Microbiota alterations as well as signs of neuroinflammation have been also reported in ASD. The involvement of immune dysregulation in ASD is further supported by evidence suggesting that maternal immune activation (MIA), especially during early pregnancy, may be a risk factor for ASD. The present study was aimed at characterizing the effects of MIA on behavior, gut microbiota and neuroinflammation in the mouse offspring also considering the impact of MIA in the two sexes. MIA offspring exhibited significant ASD-like behavioral alterations (i.e., deficits in sociability and sensorimotor gating, perseverative behaviors). The analysis of microbiota revealed changes in specific microbial taxa that recapitulated those seen in ASD children. In addition, molecular analyses indicated sex-related differences in the neuroinflammatory responses triggered by MIA, with a more prominent effect in the cerebellum. Our data suggest that both sexes should be included in the experimental designs of preclinical studies in order to identify those mechanisms that confer different vulnerability to ASD to males and females.",Translational psychiatry,2022,Anna Maria Tartaglione; Annacandida Villani; Maria Antonietta Ajmone-Cat; Luisa Minghetti; Laura Ricceri; Valerio Pazienza; Roberta De Simone; Gemma Calamandrei
36191590,Features of gut microbiota in patients with anorexia nervosa.,"Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a psychological disorder, which is characterized by the misunderstanding of body image, food restriction, and low body weight. An increasing number of studies have reported that the pathophysiological mechanism of AN might be associated with the dysbiosis of gut microbiota. The purpose of our study was to explore the features of gut microbiota in patients with AN, hoping to provide valuable information on its pathogenesis and treatment.In this cross-sectional study, from August 2020 to June 2021, patients with AN who were admitted into Peking University Third Hospital and Peking University Sixth Hospital ( n   =  30) were recruited as the AN group, and healthy controls (HC) were recruited from a middle school and a university in Beijing ( n   =  30). Demographic data, Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) scores of the two groups, and length of stay of the AN group were recorded. Microbial diversity analysis of gut microbiota in stool samples from the two groups was analyzed by 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing.The weight (AN vs. HC, [39.31 ± 7.90] kg vs. [56.47 ± 8.88] kg, P  < 0.001) and body mass index (BMI, AN vs. HC, [14.92 ± 2.54] kg/m 2vs. [20.89 ± 2.14] kg/m 2 , P  < 0.001) of patients with AN were statistically significantly lower than those of HC, and HAMD scores in AN group were statistically significantly higher than those of HC. For alpha diversity, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups; for beta diversity, the two groups differed obviously regarding community composition. Compared to HC, the proportion of Lachnospiraceae in patients with AN was statistically significantly higher (AN vs. HC, 40.50% vs. 31.21%, Z  = -1.981, P  = 0.048), while that of Ruminococcaceae was lower (AN vs. HC, 12.17% vs. 19.15%, Z  = -2.728, P  = 0.007); the proportion of Faecalibacterium (AN vs. HC, 3.97% vs. 9.40%, Z  = -3.638, P  < 0.001) and Subdoligranulum (AN vs. HC, 4.60% vs. 7.02%, Z  = -2.369, P  = 0.018) were statistically significantly lower, while that of Eubacterium_hallii_group was significantly higher (AN vs. HC, 7.63% vs. 3.43%, Z  = -2.115, P  = 0.035). Linear discriminant effect (LEfSe) analysis (LDA score >3.5) showed that o_Lachnospirales, f_Lachnospiraceae, and g_Eubacterium_hallii_group (o, f and g represents order, family and genus respectively) were enriched in patients with AN. Microbial function of nutrient transport and metabolism in AN group were more abundant ( P  > 0.05). In AN group, weight and BMI were significantly negatively correlated with the abundance of Bacteroidota and Bacteroides , while positively correlated with Subdoligranulum . BMI was significantly positively correlated with Firmicutes; HAMD scores were significantly negatively correlated with Faecalibacterium.The composition of gut microbiota in patients with AN was different from that of healthy people.

35711580,Schizophrenia Patients With Prevotella-Enterotype Have a Higher Risk of Obesity.,"Recent studies have indicated the critical influence of gut microbiota on the occurrence of obesity. There is a significant risk of obesity in people with schizophrenia. This work proposed that the disorder of gut microbiota in patients with schizophrenia was based on microbial enterotypes. Ninety-seven patients with schizophrenia and 69 matched health controls were eligible. The fresh feces of all the subjects were collected and used to complete 16S rRNA sequence. Statistical analysis was performed to identify the intestinal type of gut microbiota and analyze their potential effects on metabolic function. The patients with enterotype-P had a higher BMI than that of the others. Several differences in the gut microbes of enterotype-P were found between the patients and the controls. Proteobacteria and Firmicutes had significantly higher abundance in the patients' group with enterotype-P. The Bacteroidetes had higher abundance in health controls with enterotype-P. Different metabolic pathways of the microbiota with the enterotype-P were identified in the subjects categorized in different BMI intervals. The schizophrenia patients had a significantly higher BMI than that of health controls. The patients with enterotype-P had a higher BMI. Therefore, the enterotype-P might have a critical influence on a variety of metabolic pathways to disturb the metabolism of glucose and lipid in human body.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2022,Ying Liang; Yang Shen; Gaofei Li; Ye Yuan; Meng Zhang; Jiayu Gao
35956395,Positive Effects of α-Lactalbumin in the Management of Symptoms of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.,"To date, the involvement of α-Lactalbumin (α-LA) in the management of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) refers to its ability to improve intestinal absorption of natural molecules like inositols, overcoming the inositol resistance. However, due to its own aminoacidic building blocks, α-LA is involved in various biological processes that can open new additional applications. A great portion of women with PCOS exhibit gastrointestinal dysbiosis, which is in turn one of the triggering mechanisms of the syndrome. Due to its prebiotic effect, α-LA can recover dysbiosis, also improving the insulin resistance, obesity and intestinal inflammation frequently associated with PCOS. Further observations suggest that altered gut microbiota negatively influence mental wellbeing. Depressive mood and low serotonin levels are indeed common features of women with PCOS. Thanks to its content of tryptophan, which is the precursor of serotonin, and considering the strict link between gut and brain, using α-LA contributes to preserving mental well-being by maintaining high levels of serotonin. In addition, considering women with PCOS seeking pregnancy, both altered microbiota and serotonin levels can induce later consequences in the offspring. Therefore, a deeper knowledge of potential applications of α-LA is required to transition to preclinical and clinical studies extending its therapeutic advantages in PCOS.",Nutrients,2022,Vincenzo Cardinale; Elisa Lepore; Sabrina Basciani; Salvatore Artale; Maurizio Nordio; Mariano Bizzarri; Vittorio Unfer
36558556,The Effect of Breast Milk Microbiota on the Composition of Infant Gut Microbiota: A Cohort Study.,"Evidence shows that breast milk microbiota and an infant’s gut microbiota are related. This study aimed to compare the effects of breast milk microbiota on the construction and colonization of gut microbiota in newborns. In this study, 23 healthy infants were selected and divided into a breastfeeding group (13) and a mixed feeding group (10) based on the feeding method within one month of age. Infant fecal and breast milk samples were collected on the day of birth (0 day) and 30 days after birth (30 days) for 16S rRNA second-generation sequencing and SCFA detection. The results showed that Firmicutes and Actinobacteriota on day 0 and Firmicutes and Proteobacteria on 30 d dominated breast milk gut microbiota. There were correlations between the breast milk microbiota and the infant gut microbiota in each group (p < 0.05). Additionally, breast milk microbiota correlated more significantly with infants’ SCFAs in the breastfeeding group than in the mixed feeding group. This study showed that breast milk microbiota partially influences the construction of infant gut microbiota, with some key strains having a crucial influence, such as Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Enterobacter. However, the effect of breast milk microbiota on infant gut microbiota is not through direct strain transmission but has been indirectly influenced, which may be related to the cross-feeding effect mediated by SCFAs.",Nutrients,2022,Yapeng Li; Lei Ren; Yunyi Wang; Jinxing Li; Qingqing Zhou; Chenrui Peng; Yuchen Li; Ruyue Cheng; Fang He; Xi Shen
35312049,Can gut microbiota throughout the first 10 years of life predict executive functioning in childhood?,"Animal models suggest that the gut microbiota can influence cognitive development and functioning via various pathways. In line with that, a first human study found associations between infant fecal microbiota composition and cognition at 2 years of age. This longitudinal study investigated whether fecal microbiota composition in infancy and childhood is associated with executive functioning in childhood. We followed healthy individuals from birth to their 10th year of life. Executive functioning was assessed using the Digit Span working memory test at 10 years of age and the ecologically valid Behavior Rating Inventory for executive functioning at 8 and 10 years. Stool samples were collected at month 1, 3 and 4 as well as at 6 and 10 years. The V4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA was analyzed to determine microbial composition at the genus level. Using established statistical techniques for microbiota analysis, we did not find associations between fecal microbiota composition and executive functioning after accounting for breastfeeding, maternal education, child sex and age. Our study results are most compatible with the absence or only a weak relationship between infant and childhood fecal microbiota composition and executive functioning in childhood in healthy community children.",Developmental psychobiology,2022,Henrik Andreas Eckermann; Yangwenshan Ou; Leo Lahti; Carolina de Weerth
35666299,Gut-microbiota-brain axis in the vulnerability to psychosis in adulthood after repeated cannabis exposure during adolescence.,"Increasing epidemiological evidence shows that the use of cannabis during adolescence could increase the risk for psychosis in adulthood. However, the precise mechanisms underlying long-lasting cannabis-induced risk for psychosis remain unclear. Accumulating evidence suggests the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders. Here, we examined whether gut microbiota plays a role in the risk for psychosis of adult after exposure of cannabinoid (CB) receptor agonist WIN55,212-2 during adolescence. Repeated administration of WIN55,212-2 (2 mg/kg/day) during adolescence (P35-P45) significantly increased the expression of Iba1 (ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) of adult mice after administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS: 0.5 mg/kg). In contrast, there were no changes in blood levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines between the two groups. Although alpha-diversity and beta-diversity of gut microbiota were no differences between the two groups, there were several microbes altered between the two groups. Interestingly, there were significant correlations between the relative abundance of microbiota and Iba1 expression in the mPFC and NAc. Furthermore, there were also significant correlations between the relative abundance of microbiota and several metabolites in the blood. These findings suggest that gut microbiota may play a role in the microglial activation in the mPFC and NAc of adult mice after repeated WIN55,212-2 exposure during adolescence. Therefore, it is likely that gut-microbiota-microglia crosstalk might play a role in increased risk for psychosis in adults with cannabis use during adolescence.",European archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience,2022,Xiayun Wan; Akifumi Eguchi; Youge Qu; Yong Yang; Lijia Chang; Jiajing Shan; Chisato Mori; Kenji Hashimoto
35799798,Association Between Non-Suicidal Self-Injury and Gut Microbial Characteristics in Chinese Adolescent.,"By exploring the gut-related microbiota differences of adolescents with non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and depression (without NSSI) and healthy volunteers, we provide a theoretical basis for the prevention and control of NSSI in adolescents through intestinal microecological regulation.A total of 99 subjects were recruited in Guangdong Province, China, including 51 adolescents with NSSI (KD), 24 healthy adolescents (NOR1), and 24 depression adolescents without NSSI (NOR2). General clinical data and fecal samples were collected from all subjects, who were assessed using the NSSI Behavioral Questionnaire and the 24-item Hamilton Depression Scale. The taxonomic composition of the gut microbiota was determined using the 16S rDNA gene sequencing method.There were significant differences in diversity between the KD and NOR1, and the species uniformity index of the KD according to the Shannon and Simpson indices was significantly reduced compared with that of the NOR1 (4.81 vs 5.21, p<0.01; 0.02 vs 0.01, p<0.05). The relative abundances were different among the KD, NOR1 and NOR2, as reflected at the taxonomic levels of class, order, family, genus, and species. Bacteroides were the dominant flora of the KD and NOR2, while Mitsuokella was the dominant flora that distinguished the KD from the NOR2.We found that gut microbiota diversity was decreased in adolescents with NSSI, and the relative abundance was altered at different taxonomic levels. These results enrich the understanding of the relationship between NSSI and depression and the gut microbiota, Supporting that NSSI and depression are not homologous disorders. What is more, it establishes the basis for exploring the mechanisms of flora action in NSSI, providing a possible direction for NSSI to achieve a better prognosis and prevent relapse.",Neuropsychiatric disease and treatment,2022,Li-Fei Cai; Shi-Bin Wang; Cai-Lan Hou; Ze-Bin Li; Yi-Jun Liao; Fu-Jun Jia
36370535,"Gut mycobiota dysbiosis in drug-naïve, first-episode schizophrenia.","Bacterial dysbiosis has been demonstrated in patients with schizophrenia (SCH). The aim of the present study was to investigate alterations in mycobiota composition and fungi-bacteria correlation network in drug-naïve, first episode SCH. We recruited 205 SCH patients and 125 healthy controls (HCs), whose gut bacterial and fungal compositions were characterized by 16S and 18S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing, respectively. Fungal-bacterial relative correlation network analysis was performed using the Spearman's test and distance correlation. We also computed relative networks connectedness, which represents the ratio of significant interactions (edges) and taxa (nodes) in the network. SCH patients showed lower fungal α-diversity compared with that of HCs. Furthermore, we identified 29 differential fungal markers at multiple taxonomies between SCH patients and HCs. SCH patients also showed a significantly lower fungi-to-bacteria α-diversity ratio compared with that of HCs (p = 1.81 × 10<sup>-8</sup>). In risk prediction models, we observed that combining bacterial and fungal markers achieved higher accuracy than that of bacterial markers alone (AUC = 0.847 vs AUC = 0.739; p = 0.043). Fungal-bacterial correlation network was denser in HCs than in SCH patients and was characterized by a high number of neighbors (p < 0.05). In addition, an increased abundance of Purpureocillium was associated with more severe psychiatric symptoms and poorer cognitive function in SCH patients (p < 0.05). Our study demonstrated a disrupted and weakened fungi-bacteria network in SCH patients, which might be associated with their clinical manifestations. Future research on fungal-bacterial correlation network is warranted to advance our understanding about the role of mycobiota in the etiology of SCH and to explore novel intervention approaches.",Schizophrenia research,2022,Xiuxia Yuan; Xue Li; Yulin Kang; Lijuan Pang; Gangrui Hei; Xiaoyun Zhang; Shuying Wang; Xinyi Zhao; Siwei Zhang; Qi Tao; Liyuan Zhang; Qiyue Zhu; Luxian Lv; Xiaoduo Fan; Shaohua Hu; Xueqin Song

35399732,Gut-Thyroid axis: How gut microbial dysbiosis associated with euthyroid thyroid cancer.,"Thyroid cancer in humans has a fast-growing prevalence, with the most common lethal endocrine malignancy for unknown reasons<b>.</b> The current study was aimed to perform qualitative and quantitative investigation and characterization of the gut bacterial composition of euthyroid thyroid cancer patients. The fecal samples were collected from sixteen euthyroid thyroid cancer patients and ten from healthy subjects. The PCR-DGGE was conducted by targetting the V3 region of 16S rRNA gene, as well as real-time PCR for <i>Bacteroides vulgatus, E.coli Bifidobacterium, Clostridium leptum</i> and <i>Lactobacillus</i> were carried. High-throughput sequencing of V3+V4 region of 16S rRNA gene was performed on Hiseq 2500 platform on 20 (10 healthy & 10 diseased subjects) randomly selected fecal samples. The richness indices and comparative diversity analysis showed significant gut microbial modification in euthyroid thyroid cancer than control. At phylum level, there was significant enrichment of Firmicutes, Verrucomicrobia, while a significant decrease in Bacteroidetes was detected in the experimental group. At family statistics, significant high levels of Ruminococcaceae and Verrucomicrobiaceae, while the significant lower abundance of Bacteroidaceae, Prevotellaceae, Porphyromonadaceae, and Alcaligenaceae was after observed. It also found that the significantly raised level of <i>Escherichia-Shigella, Akkermansia</i> [Eubacterium]_coprostanoligenes<i>, Dorea, Subdoligranulum,</i> and <i>Ruminococcus_2 genera,</i> while significantly lowered genera of the patient group were <i>Prevotella_9</i>, <i>Bacteroides</i> and <i>Klebsiella</i>. The species-level gut microbial composition showed a significantly raised level of <i>Escherichia coli in</i> euthyroid thyroid cancer. Thus, this study reveals that euthyroid thyroid cancer patients have significant gut microbial dysbiosis. Moreover, Statistics (P<0.05) of each gut microbial taxa were significantly changed in euthyroid thyroid cancer patients. Therefore, the current study may propose new approaches to understanding thyroid cancer patients' disease pathways, mechanisms, and treatment.",Journal of Cancer,2022,Hafiz Muhammad Ishaq; Imran Shair Mohammad; Riaz Hussain; Rashida Parveen; Jafir Hussain Shirazi; Yang Fan; Muhammad Shahzad; Khezar Hayat; Huan Li; Ayesha Ihsan; Kiran Sher Muhammad; Muhammad Usman; Siruo Zhang; Lu Yuan; Shakir Ullah; Ana Cláudia Paiva-Santos; Jiru Xu
35967810,The Potential of Honey as a Prebiotic Food to Re-engineer the Gut Microbiome Toward a Healthy State.,"Honey has a long history of use for the treatment of digestive ailments. Certain honey types have well-established bioactive properties including antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities. In addition, honey contains non-digestible carbohydrates in the form of oligosaccharides, and there is increasing evidence from <i>in vitro</i>, animal, and pilot human studies that some kinds of honey have prebiotic activity. Prebiotics are foods or compounds, such as non-digestible carbohydrates, that are used to promote specific, favorable changes in the composition and function of the gut microbiota. The gut microbiota plays a critical role in human health and well-being, with disturbances to the balance of these organisms linked to gut inflammation and the development and progression of numerous conditions, such as colon cancer, irritable bowel syndrome, obesity, and mental health issues. Consequently, there is increasing interest in manipulating the gut microbiota to a more favorable balance as a way of improving health by dietary means. Current research suggests that certain kinds of honey can reduce the presence of infection-causing bacteria in the gut including <i>Salmonella</i>, <i>Escherichia coli</i>, and <i>Clostridiodes difficile</i>, while simultaneously stimulating the growth of potentially beneficial species, such as <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Bifidobacteria.</i> In this paper, we review the current and growing evidence that shows the prebiotic potential of honey to promote healthy gut function, regulate the microbial communities in the gut, and reduce infection and inflammation. We outline gaps in knowledge and explore the potential of honey as a viable option to promote or re-engineer a healthy gut microbiome.",Frontiers in nutrition,2022,Kathleen R Schell; Kenya E Fernandes; Erin Shanahan; Isabella Wilson; Shona E Blair; Dee A Carter; Nural N Cokcetin
36058421,Altered gut microbiota correlates with behavioral problems but not gastrointestinal symptoms in individuals with autism.,"Despite inconsistent results across studies, emerging evidence suggests that the microbial micro-environment may be associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Geographical and cultural factors highly impact microbial profiles, and there is a shortage of data from East Asian populations. This study aimed to comprehensively characterize microbial profiles in an East Asian sample and explore whether gut microbiota contributes to clinical symptoms, emotional/behavioral problems, and GI symptoms in ASD.We assessed 82 boys and young men with ASD and 31 typically developing controls (TDC), aged 6-25 years. We analyzed the stool sample of all participants with 16S V3-V4 rRNA sequencing and correlated its profile with GI symptoms, autistic symptoms, and emotional/behavioral problems.Autistic individuals, compared to TDC, had worse GI symptoms. There were no group differences in alpha diversity of species richness estimates (Shannon-wiener and Simpson diversity indices). Participants with ASD had an increased relative abundance of Fusobacterium, Ruminococcus torques group (at the genus level), and Bacteroides plebeius DSM 17135 (at the species level), while a decreased relative abundance of Ruminococcaceae UCG 013, Ervsipelotrichaceae UCG 003, Parasutterella, Clostridium sensu stricto 1, Turicibacter (at the genus level), and Clostridium spiroforme DSM 1552 and Intestinimonas butyriciproducens (at the species level). Altered taxonomic diversity in ASD significantly correlated with autistic symptoms, thought problems, delinquent behaviors, self dysregulation, and somatic complaints. We did not find an association between gut symptoms and gut microbial dysbiosis.Our findings suggest that altered microbiota are associated with behavioral phenotypes but not GI symptoms in ASD. The function of the identified microbial profiles mainly involves the immune pathway, supporting the hypothesis of a complex relationship between altered microbiome, immune dysregulation, and ASD that may advance the discovery of molecular biomarkers for ASD.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2022,Yu-Chieh Chen; Hsiang-Yuan Lin; Yiling Chien; Yu-Hung Tung; Yen-Hsuan Ni; Susan Shur-Fen Gau
35981685,Depression-like behaviors in mouse model of Sjögren's syndrome: A role of gut-microbiota-brain axis.,"Depression is a common psychiatric symptom in patients with Sjögren's syndrome (SS). Prevalence of depression in SS patients is significantly higher than that in the general population. Increasing evidence suggests a crucial role of gut-microbiota-brain axis in depression. In this study, we investigated whether non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, a widely used animal model of SS, exhibit depression-like phenotypes and abnormal composition of gut microbiota. Eleven-week-old NOD mice spontaneously exhibited SS-related symptoms without pancreatic destruction. NOD mice displayed depression-like behaviors, decreased expression of synaptic proteins in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and abnormal composition of gut microbiota. Interestingly, SS-related proinflammatory factors in the submandibular gland (SMG) and autoantibodies (anti-SSA and anti-SSB) in the plasma were correlated with the expression of synaptic proteins in the PFC or depression-like behaviors. In addition, there were correlations between the relative abundance of microbiota and SS-related symptoms (or depression-related phenotypes). These data suggest that SS-related symptoms and abnormal composition of gut microbiota may play a role in depression-like phenotypes in NOD mice through gut-microbiota-brain axis.","Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior",2022,Yaoyu Pu; Yangyang He; Xueting Zhao; Qiuping Zhang; Ji Wen; Kenji Hashimoto; Yi Liu
35309241,Consensus on potential biomarkers developed for use in clinical tests for schizophrenia.,"Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness affecting approximately 20 million individuals globally. Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the illness. If left undiagnosed and untreated, schizophrenia results in impaired social function, repeated hospital admissions, reduced quality of life and decreased life expectancy. Clinical diagnosis largely relies on subjective evidence, including self-reported experiences, and reported behavioural abnormalities followed by psychiatric evaluation. In addition, psychoses may occur along with other conditions, and the symptoms are often episodic and transient, posing a significant challenge to the precision of diagnosis. Therefore, objective, specific tests using biomarkers are urgently needed for differential diagnosis of schizophrenia in clinical practice.We aimed to provide evidence-based and consensus-based recommendations, with a summary of laboratory measurements that could potentially be used as biomarkers for schizophrenia, and to discuss directions for future research.We searched publications within the last 10 years with the following keywords: 'schizophrenia', 'gene', 'inflammation', 'neurotransmitter', 'protein marker', 'gut microbiota', 'pharmacogenomics' and 'biomarker'. A draft of the consensus was discussed and agreed on by all authors at a round table session.We summarised the characteristics of candidate diagnostic markers for schizophrenia, including genetic, inflammatory, neurotransmitter, peripheral protein, pharmacogenomic and gut microbiota markers. We also proposed a novel laboratory process for diagnosing schizophrenia in clinical practice based on the evidence summarised in this paper.Further efforts are needed to identify schizophrenia-specific genetic and epigenetic markers for precise diagnosis, differential diagnosis and ethnicity-specific markers for the Chinese population. The development of novel laboratory techniques is making it possible to use these biomarkers clinically to diagnose disease.",General psychiatry,2022,Ping Lin; Junyu Sun; Xiaoyan Lou; Dan Li; Yun Shi; Zhenhua Li; Peijun Ma; Ping Li; Shuzi Chen; Weifeng Jin; Shuai Liu; Qing Chen; Qiong Gao; Lili Zhu; Jie Xu; Mengyuan Zhu; Mengxia Wang; Kangyi Liang; Ling Zhao; Huabin Xu; Ke Dong; Qingtian Li; Xunjia Cheng; Jinghong Chen; Xiaokui Guo
36365032,The Role of the Microbiome in the Metabolic Health of People with Schizophrenia and Related Psychoses: Cross-Sectional and Pre-Post Lifestyle Intervention Analyses.,"The microbiome has been implicated in the development of metabolic conditions which occur at high rates in people with schizophrenia and related psychoses. This exploratory proof-of-concept study aimed to: (i) characterize the gut microbiota in antipsychotic naïve or quasi-naïve people with first-episode psychosis, and people with established schizophrenia receiving clozapine therapy; (ii) test for microbiome changes following a lifestyle intervention which included diet and exercise education and physical activity. Participants were recruited from the Eastern Suburbs Mental Health Service, Sydney, Australia. Anthropometric, lifestyle and gut microbiota data were collected at baseline and following a 12-week lifestyle intervention. Stool samples underwent 16S rRNA sequencing to analyse microbiota diversity and composition. Seventeen people with established schizophrenia and five people with first-episode psychosis were recruited and matched with 22 age-sex, BMI and ethnicity matched controls from a concurrent study for baseline comparisons. There was no difference in α-diversity between groups at baseline, but microbial composition differed by 21 taxa between the established schizophrenia group and controls. In people with established illness pre-post comparison of α-diversity showed significant increases after the 12-week lifestyle intervention. This pilot study adds to the current literature that detail compositional differences in the gut microbiota of people with schizophrenia compared to those without mental illness and suggests that lifestyle interventions may increase gut microbial diversity in patients with established illness. These results show that microbiome studies are feasible in patients with established schizophrenia and larger studies are warranted to validate microbial signatures and understand the relevance of lifestyle change in the development of metabolic conditions in this population.","Pathogens (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,Maryanne O'Donnell; Scott B Teasdale; Xin-Yi Chua; Jamie Hardman; Nan Wu; Jackie Curtis; Katherine Samaras; Patrick Bolton; Margaret J Morris; Cyndi Shannon Weickert; Tertia Purves-Tyson; Fatima El-Assaad; Xiao-Tao Jiang; Georgina L Hold; Emad El-Omar
35937875,Gut microbiome: A potential indicator for predicting treatment outcomes in major depressive disorder.,"The therapeutic outcomes in major depressive disorder (MDD), one of the most common and heterogeneous mental illnesses, are affected by factors that remain unclear and often yield unsatisfactory results. Herein, we characterized the composition and metabolic function of the gut microbiota of patients with MDD during antidepressant treatment, based on 16S rRNA sequencing and metabolomics. The microbial signatures at baseline differed significantly between responder and non-responder groups. The gut microbiota of the non-responder group was mainly characterized by increased relative abundances of the phylum Actinobacteria, families Christensenellaceae and Eggerthellaceae, and genera <i>Adlercreutzia</i> and <i>Christensenellaceae R7 group</i> compared to that of the responder group. Additionally, the gut microbiota composition of the responder and non-responder groups differed significantly before and after treatment, especially at the genus level. Moreover, 20 differential metabolites between the responder and non-responder groups were identified that were mainly involved in lipid metabolism (cholestane steroids and steroid esters). Eggerthellaceae and <i>Adlercreutzia</i> displayed strong co-occurrence relationships with certain metabolites, suggesting alternations in the gut microbiome, and associated metabolites may be potential mediators of successful antidepressant treatment. Overall, our study demonstrates that alterations in gut microbiota composition and metabolic function might be relevant to the response to antidepressants, thereby providing insight into mechanisms responsible for their efficacy.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2022,Zaiquan Dong; Xiaoling Shen; Yanni Hao; Jin Li; Haizhen Xu; Li Yin; Weihong Kuang
36088985,A role of microRNA-149 in the prefrontal cortex for prophylactic actions of (R)-ketamine in inflammation model.,"MicroRNAs (or miRNAs) are short, regulatory RNAs that act as post-transcriptional repressors of gene expression. Recently, we reported that the nuclear factor of activated T cells 4 (NFATc4) signaling might contribute to sustained prophylactic effects of new antidepressant (R)-ketamine in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated inflammation model of depression. In this study, we examined the role of miRNAs (miR-149 and miR-7688-5p) which can regulate NFATc4 in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of male mice after administration of LPS (1.0 mg/kg). There was a positive correlation between the expression of Nfatc4 and the expression of miR-149 in the PFC. There was also a negative correlation between gene expression of Nfatc4 and gene expression of miR-7688-5p in the PFC. Gut microbiota analysis showed that pretreatment with (R)-ketamine (10 mg/kg) could restore altered composition of gut microbiota in LPS-treated mice. A network analysis showed that gut microbiota may regulate gene expression of Nfatc4 and miR-149 (or miR-7688-5p) in the PFC. Finally, inhibition of miR-149 by antagomiR-149 blocked LPS-induced depression-like behavior by attenuating LPS-induced expression of NFATc4 in the PFC. These findings suggest that the regulation of NFATc4 signaling by miR-149 might play a role in persistent prophylactic effects of (R)-ketamine, and that gut microbiota may regulate the gene expression of miRNAs in the PFC through gut-microbiota-brain axis.",Neuropharmacology,2022,Li Ma; Long Wang; Lijia Chang; Jiajing Shan; Youge Qu; Xingming Wang; Yuko Fujita; Kenji Hashimoto
36358286,The Effect of Long-Term Moderate Static Magnetic Field Exposure on Adult Female Mice.,"Because of the high cost and safety of ultra-high magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), its application has certain limitations. Whereas 0.5−3 T MRI has been widely applied in hospitals, static magnetic fields (SMFs) have been shown to improve mice mental health and have anti-tumor potentials. Here, we compared the effects of the upward and downward 150 mT SMF groups with the sham group on C57BL/6J adult female mice. Locomotor and exploratory activity were also measured by behavioral tests, including the open field and elevated plus test. Additionally, physiology, pathology indicators and gut microbiota were examined. We found that 150 mT SMFs long-term exposure enhanced locomotive and exploratory activity of mice, especially the downward 150 mT SMF. Compared with the downward 150 mT SMF group, the movement speed and distance in the center area of the sham group were increased by 65.99% (p < 0.0001) and 68.58% (p = 0.0038), respectively. Moreover, compared to the sham group, downward 150 mT SMF increased the number of entrances to the center area by 67.0% (p = 0.0082) and time in the center area by 77.12% (p = 0.0054). Additionally, we observed that upward 150 mT SMF improved the number of follicles (~2.5 times, p = 0.0325) and uterine glands through increasing the total antioxidant capacity and reducing lipid peroxidation level in mice. Gut microbiome analysis showed that 150 mT SMFs long-term exposure improved the microbiota abundance (Clostridium, Bifidobacterium, Ralstonia and Yaniella) in the genus level, which may affect metabolism, anxiety and behavior in adult female mice. Our results demonstrated that 150 mT SMFs long-term exposure not only had good biosafety, but also improved athletic performance, emotion and the function of ovarian, uterine and gut microbiota abundance in adult female mice, which unraveled the potential of moderate long-term SMF exposure in clinical applications.",Biology,2022,Xingxing Yang; Biao Yu; Chao Song; Chuanlin Feng; Jing Zhang; Xinyu Wang; Guofeng Cheng; Rui Yang; Wei Wang; Yong Zhu
35352107,Psychobiotics in diet: significance and applications of neuroactive and psychoactive microbial metabolites.,"The brain governs psychiatric behavior of an individual by regulating certain neuroactive compounds produced within the body. These might also be produced by the microbes present in the gut, along with certain probiotic strains: the psychobiotics. A healthy diet including psychobiotics plays an important role in neurological functioning by producing a number of psychoactive compounds. Health benefits of probiotic microorganisms to the host and their psychoactive metabolites involved in the alternation of brain functioning are summarized in this article. The effect of diet on gut microbiota is highlighted, along with the possibility of probiotic bacteria as psychobiotics in the treatment or prevention of mental health-related disorders.

36158270,Associations of gut microbiota with dyslipidemia based on sex differences in subjects from Northwestern China.,"The gut microbiota (GM) has been proven to play a role in the regulation of host lipid metabolism, which provides a new theory about the pathogenesis of dyslipidemia. However, the associations of GM with dyslipidemia based on sex differences remain unclear and warrant elucidation.To investigate the associations of GM features with serum lipid profiles based on sex differences in a Chinese population.This study ultimately recruited 142 participants (73 females and 69 males) at Honghui Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University. The anthropometric and blood metabolic parameters of all participants were measured. According to their serum lipid levels, female and male participants were classified into a high triglyceride (H_TG) group, a high total cholesterol (H_CHO) group, a low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (L_HDL-C) group, and a control (CON) group with normal serum lipid levels. Fresh fecal samples were collected for 16S rRNA gene sequencing. UPARSE software, QIIME software, the RDP classifier and the FAPROTAX database were used for sequencing analyses.The GM composition at the phylum level included Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes as the core GM. Different GM features were identified between females and males, and the associations between GM and serum lipid profiles were different in females and males. The GM features in different dyslipidemia subgroups changed in both female patients and male patients. Proteobacteria, Lactobacillaceae, <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Lactobacillus_salivarius</i> were enriched in H_CHO females compared with CON females, while Coriobacteriia were enriched in L_HDL-C females. In the comparison among the three dyslipidemia subgroups in females, <i>Lactobacillus_salivarius</i> were enriched in H_CHO females, and Prevotellaceae were enriched in L_HDL-C females. Compared with CON or H_TG males, Prevotellaceae, <i>unidentified_Ruminococcaceae</i>, <i>Roseburia</i> and <i>Roseburia_inulinivorans</i> were decreased in L_HDL-C males (<i>P</i> value < 0.05), and linear discriminant analysis effect size analysis indicated an enrichment of the above GM taxa in H_TG males compared with other male subgroups. Additionally, <i>Roseburia_inulinivorans</i> abundance was positively correlated with serum TG and total cholesterol levels, and <i>Roseburia</i> were positively correlated with serum TG level. Furthermore, Proteobacteria (0.724, 95%CI: 0.567-0.849), Lactobacillaceae (0.703, 95%CI: 0.544-0.832), <i>Lactobacillus</i> (0.705, 95%CI: 0.547-0.834) and <i>Lactobacillus_salivarius</i> (0.706, 95%CI: 0.548-0.835) could distinguish H_CHO females from CON females, while Coriobacteriia (0.710, 95%CI: 0.547-0.841), Coriobacteriales (0.710, 95%CI: 0.547-0.841), Prevotellaceae (0.697, 95%CI: 0.534-0.830), <i>Roseburia</i> (0.697, 95%CI: 0.534-0.830) and <i>Roseburia_inulinivorans</i> (0.684, 95%CI: 0.520-0.820) could discriminate H_TG males from CON males. Based on the predictions of GM metabolic capabilities with the FAPROTAX database, a total of 51 functional assignments were obtained in females, while 38 were obtained in males. This functional prediction suggested that cellulolysis increased in L_HDL-C females compared with CON females, but decreased in L_HDL-C males compared with CON males.This study indicates associations of GM with serum lipid profiles, supporting the notion that GM dysbiosis may participate in the pathogenesis of dyslipidemia, and sex differences should be considered.",World journal of gastroenterology,2022,Lei Guo; Yang-Yang Wang; Ji-Han Wang; He-Ping Zhao; Yan Yu; Guo-Dong Wang; Kun Dai; Yu-Zhu Yan; Yan-Jie Yang; Jing Lv
36244970,Depression and fatigue in active IBD from a microbiome perspective-a Bayesian approach to faecal metagenomics.,"Extraintestinal symptoms are common in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and include depression and fatigue. These are highly prevalent especially in active disease, potentially due to inflammation-mediated changes in the microbiota-gut-brain axis. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between structural and functional microbiota characteristics and severity of fatigue and depressive symptoms in patients with active IBD.We included clinical data of 62 prospectively enrolled patients with IBD in an active disease state. Patients supplied stool samples and completed the questionnaires regarding depression and fatigue symptoms. Based on taxonomic and functional metagenomic profiles of faecal gut microbiota, we used Bayesian statistics to investigate the associative networks and triangle motifs between bacterial genera, functional modules and symptom severity of self-reported fatigue and depression.Associations with moderate to strong evidence were found for 3 genera (Odoribacter, Anaerotruncus and Alistipes) and 3 functional modules (pectin, glycosaminoglycan and central carbohydrate metabolism) with regard to depression and for 4 genera (Intestinimonas, Anaerotruncus, Eubacterium and Clostridiales g.i.s) and 2 functional modules implicating amino acid and central carbohydrate metabolism with regard to fatigue.This study provides the first evidence of association triplets between microbiota composition, function and extraintestinal symptoms in active IBD. Depression and fatigue were associated with lower abundances of short-chain fatty acid producers and distinct pathways implicating glycan, carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. Our results suggest that microbiota-directed therapeutic approaches may reduce fatigue and depression in IBD and should be investigated in future research.",BMC medicine,2022,Anne Kerstin Thomann; Torsten Wüstenberg; Jakob Wirbel; Laura-Louise Knoedler; Philipp Arthur Thomann; Georg Zeller; Matthias Philip Ebert; Stefanie Lis; Wolfgang Reindl
35788394,Long-lasting beneficial effects of maternal intake of sulforaphane glucosinolate on gut microbiota in adult offspring.,"Mounting evidence suggests the impact of maternal diet on the health of offspring. We reported that maternal diet of sulforaphane glucosinolate (SGS) could prevent behavioral abnormalities in offspring after maternal immune activation. The present study was designed to investigate whether the dietary intake of SGS during pregnancy and lactation influences the composition of gut microbiota in the offspring. The dietary intake of SGS during pregnancy and lactation caused significant changes in the α-diversity and β-diversity of gut microbiota in 3-week-old offspring (SGS-3W group) and 10-week-old offspring (SGS-10W group). The LEfSe algorithm identified several microbes as important phylotypes in the SGS-3W or SGS-10W groups. Predictive functional metagenomes showed that the maternal intake of SGS caused several KEGG pathways alterations with respect to the genetic information processing and metabolism. Furthermore, the plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in the SGS-10W group after the injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS: 0.5 mg/kg) were significantly lower than those of the CON-10W group. It is noteworthy that there were positive correlations between the relative abundance of the genus Blautia and IL-6 (or TNF-α) in adult offspring. Moreover, there were sex differences of gut microbiota composition in offspring. In conclusion, these data suggest that the dietary intake of SGS during pregnancy and lactation might produce long-lasting beneficial effects in adult offspring through the persistent modulation of gut microbiota. It is likely that the modulation of gut microbiota by maternal nutrition may confer resilience versus vulnerability to stress-related psychiatric disorders in the offspring.",The Journal of nutritional biochemistry,2022,Yan Wei; Lijia Chang; Guoqi Liu; Xingming Wang; Yong Yang; Kenji Hashimoto
36558405,Plasma Concentrations of Short-Chain Fatty Acids in Active and Recovered Anorexia Nervosa.,"Anorexia nervosa (AN) is one of the most lethal psychiatric disorders. To date, we lack adequate knowledge about the (neuro)biological mechanisms of this disorder to inform evidence-based pharmacological treatment. Gut dysbiosis is a trending topic in mental health, including AN. Communication between the gut microbiota and the brain is partly mediated by metabolites produced by the gut microbiota such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). Previous research has suggested a role of SCFA in weight regulation (e.g., correlations between specific SCFA-producing bacteria and BMI have been demonstrated). Moreover, fecal SCFA concentrations are reported to be altered in active AN. However, data concerning SCFA concentrations in individuals who have recovered from AN are limited. In the present study, we analyzed and compared the plasma concentrations of seven SCFA (acetic-, butyric-, formic-, isobutyric-, isovaleric-, propionic-, and succinic acid) in females with active AN (<i>n</i> = 109), recovered from AN (AN-REC, <i>n</i> = 108), and healthy-weight age-matched controls (CTRL, <i>n</i> = 110), and explored correlations between SCFA concentrations and BMI. Significantly lower plasma concentrations of butyric, isobutyric-, and isovaleric acid were detected in AN as well as AN-REC compared with CTRL. We also show significant correlations between plasma concentrations of SCFA and BMI. These results encourage studies evaluating whether interventions directed toward altering gut microbiota and SCFA could support weight restoration in AN.",Nutrients,2022,Jingjing Xu; Rikard Landberg; Catharina Lavebratt; Cynthia M Bulik; Mikael Landén; Ida A K Nilsson
35650202,Fecal microbiota transplantation from patients with rheumatoid arthritis causes depression-like behaviors in mice through abnormal T cells activation.,"Depression is common in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA); however, the precise mechanisms underlying a link between depression and RA remain unclear. Accumulating evidence suggests the role of gut-microbiota-brain axis in depression. In this study, we investigated whether collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice produce depression-like behaviors and abnormal composition of gut microbiota. Furthermore, we investigated whether fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from RA patients causes depression-like phenotypes in antibiotic cocktail (ABX)-treated mice. CIA mice displayed depression-like behaviors, increased blood levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), decreased expression of synaptic proteins in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and abnormal composition of gut microbiota. Furthermore, FMT from RA patients caused depression-like phenotypes, alterations of gut microbiota composition, increased levels of IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and downregulation of synaptic proteins in the PFC compared to FMT from healthy controls. There were correlations between relative abundance of microbiota and plasma cytokines, expression of synaptic proteins in the PFC or depression-like behaviors. Interestingly, FMT from RA patients induced T cells differentiation in Peyer's patches and spleen. Reduced percentage of Treg cells with an increase of Th1/Th2 index was observed in the mice after FMT from RA patients. These findings suggest that CIA mice exhibit depression-like behaviors, systemic inflammation, and abnormal composition of gut microbiota, and that FMT from RA patients produces depression-like behaviors in ABX-treated mice via T cells differentiation. Therefore, abnormalities in gut microbiota in RA patients may contribute to depression via gut-microbiota-brain axis.",Translational psychiatry,2022,Yaoyu Pu; Qiuping Zhang; Zhigang Tang; Chenyang Lu; Liang Wu; Yutong Zhong; Yuehong Chen; Kenji Hashimoto; Yubin Luo; Yi Liu
35981631,Antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion improves LPS-induced acute lung injury via gut-lung axis.,"Acute lung injury (ALI) is an acute inflammatory disorder. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the pathology of ALI remain elusive. An increasing evidence suggests the role of the gut-microbiota axis in the pathology of lung injury. This study aimed to investigate whether antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion could affect ALI in mice after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration.The effects of antibiotic cocktail (ABX) on ALI in the mice after intratracheally administration of LPS (5 mg/kg) were examined. Furthermore, 16s rRNA analysis and measurement of short-chain fatty acids in feces samples and metabolomics analysis of blood samples were performed.LPS significantly increased the interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of water-treated mice. Interestingly, an ABX significantly attenuated the LPS-induced increase in IL-6 in BALF and lung injury scores. Furthermore, ABX and/or LPS treatment markedly altered the α- and β-diversity of the gut microbiota. There were significant differences in the α- and β-diversity of the water + LPS group and ABX + LPS group. LEfSe analysis identified Enterococusfaecalis, Clostriumtertium, and Bacteroidescaecimyris as potential microbial markers for ABX + LPS group. Untargeted metabolomics analysis identified several plasma metabolites responsible for discriminating water + LPS group from ABX + LPS group. There were correlations between the relative abundance of the microbiome and plasma metabolites. Integrative network analysis showed correlations between IL-6 levels in BALF and several gut microbes (or plasma metabolites).These data suggest that ABX-induced microbiome depletion could protect against LPS-induced ALI via the gut-microbiota-lung axis.",Life sciences,2022,Yaeko Hashimoto; Akifumi Eguchi; Yan Wei; Hiroyo Shinno-Hashimoto; Yuko Fujita; Tamaki Ishima; Lijia Chang; Chisato Mori; Takuji Suzuki; Kenji Hashimoto
35956326,Inflammatory Signatures of Maternal Obesity as Risk Factors for Neurodevelopmental Disorders: Role of Maternal Microbiota and Nutritional Intervention Strategies.,"Obesity is a main risk factor for the onset and the precipitation of many non-communicable diseases. This condition, which is associated with low-grade chronic systemic inflammation, is of main concern during pregnancy leading to very serious consequences for the new generations. In addition to the prominent role played by the adipose tissue, dysbiosis of the maternal gut may also sustain the obesity-related inflammatory milieu contributing to create an overall suboptimal intrauterine environment. Such a condition here generically defined as ""inflamed womb"" may hold long-term detrimental effects on fetal brain development, increasing the vulnerability to mental disorders. In this review, we will examine the hypothesis that maternal obesity-related gut dysbiosis and the associated inflammation might specifically target fetal brain microglia, the resident brain immune macrophages, altering neurodevelopmental trajectories in a sex-dependent fashion. We will also review some of the most promising nutritional strategies capable to prevent or counteract the effects of maternal obesity through the modulation of inflammation and oxidative stress or by targeting the maternal microbiota.",Nutrients,2022,Francesca Cirulli; Roberta De Simone; Chiara Musillo; Maria Antonietta Ajmone-Cat; Alessandra Berry
36183483,Possible metabolic interplay between quality of life and fecal microbiota in a presenior population: Preliminary results.,"The number of people aged ≥60 y is increasing worldwide, so establishing a relationship between lifestyle and health-associated factors, such as gut microbiota in an older population, is important. This study aimed to characterize the gut microbiota of a presenior population, and analyze the association between some bacteria and quality of life with the Short Form (SF) 36 questionnaire.Participants were adult men and women ages 50 to 80 y (n = 74). In addition to the SF-36 questionnaire, fecal samples were collected in cryotubes, and 16S RNA gene sequencing was performed to characterize microbial features. Participants were classified into two groups according to SF-36 punctuation. Linear and logistic regression models were performed to assess the possible association between any bacterial bowl and SF-36 score. Receiver operating characteristics curves were fitted to define the relative diagnostic strength of different bacterial taxa for the correct determination of quality of life.A positive relationship was established between SF-36 score and Actinobacteria (P = 0.0310; R = 0.2510) compared with Peptostreptococcaceae (P = 0.0259; R = -0.2589), which increased with decreasing quality of life. Logistic regressions models and receiver operating characteristics curves showed that the relative abundance of Actinobacteria and Peptostreptococcaceae may be useful to predict quality of life in a presenior population (area under the curve: 0.71).Quality of life may be associated with the relative abundance of certain bacteria, especially Actinobacteria and Peptostreptococcaceae, which may have a specific effect on certain markers and health care, which is important to improve quality of life in older populations.","Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)",2022,Begoña de Cuevillas; José I Riezu-Boj; Itziar Abete; M Angeles Zulet; Cristina Galarregui; Carlos J Gonzalez-Navarro; Fermín I Milagro; J Alfredo Martínez; Santiago Navas-Carretero
36191374,Comparison of the chronic unpredictable mild stress and the maternal separation in mice postpartum depression modeling.,"Postpartum depression (PPD) is a serious mental health concern of new mothers worldwide. In view of the particularity of puerpera, the research on pathogenesis and drug development of PPD are highly dependent on animal models. Although both maternal separation (MS) and chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) modeling approaches have been used in PPD studies, the characteristics of the two rodent models have not been compared to explain which is more advantageous in PPD research. In this study, we applied 21-day MS and CUMS paradigms to induce mouse model of PPD and compared their differences in behavior, physiology and gut microbiota. As a result, the two models exhibited significant increases of immobility time in forced swim test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST), whereas sucrose preference index and pup weight were significantly decreased. Both displayed depression-like behaviors, and CUMS was more obvious, which demonstrated by the lower levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and higher hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis related mRNA expression (corticotropin releasing hormone, corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1) in CMUS group than that in MS group. The gut microbiota in MS and CUMS groups were significantly different in terms of the relative abundances of Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria. In conclusion, MS model and CUMS model have different performance in behavior and physiology. The CUMS model showed more obvious parameter changes, which may be more suitable for PPD induced by various social environmental factors.",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2022,Yan Zhang; Li Zhang; Birui Shi; Fulong Huang; Yinhuang Gao; Zhishuo Miao; Ke Ma; Ziyao Zhan; Wei Zou; Menghua Liu
35594949,Effects of (R)-ketamine on reduced bone mineral density in ovariectomized mice: A role of gut microbiota.,"Depression is a high risk for osteoporosis, suggesting an association between depression and low bone mineral density (BMD). We reported that the novel antidepressant (R)-ketamine could ameliorate the reduced BMD in the ovariectomized (OVX) mice which is an animal model of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Given the role of gut microbiota in depression and bone homeostasis, we examined whether gut microbiota plays a role in the beneficial effects of (R)-ketamine in the reduced BMD of OVX mice. OVX or sham was operated for female mice. Subsequently, saline (10 ml/kg/day, twice weekly) or (R)-ketamine (10 mg/kg/day, twice weekly) was administered intraperitoneally into OVX or sham mice for the six weeks. The reduction of cortical BMD and total BMD in the OVX mice was significantly ameliorated after subsequent repeated intermittent administration of (R)-ketamine. Furthermore, there were significant changes in the α- and β-diversity between OVX + saline group and OVX + (R)-ketamine group. There were correlations between several OTUs and cortical (or total) BMD. There were also positive correlations between the genera Turicibacter and cortical (or total) BMD. Moreover, there were correlations between several metabolites in blood and cortical (or total) BMD. These data suggest that (R)-ketamine may ameliorate the reduced cortical BMD and total BMD in OVX mice through anti-inflammatory actions via gut microbiota. Therefore, it is likely that (R)-ketamine would be a therapeutic drug for depressed patients with low BMD or patients with osteoporosis.",Neuropharmacology,2022,Xiayun Wan; Akifumi Eguchi; Yuko Fujita; Li Ma; Xingming Wang; Yong Yang; Youge Qu; Lijia Chang; Jiancheng Zhang; Chisato Mori; Kenji Hashimoto
36579574,The Potential Impact of Age on Gut Microbiota in Patients with Major Depressive Disorder: A Secondary Analysis of the Prospective Observational Study.,"We aimed to investigate the impact of aging on the relationship among the composition of gut microbiota, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, and the course of treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD) by analyzing the datasets from our previous study. Patients with MDD were recruited, and their stools were collected at three time points (baseline, midterm, and endpoint) following the usual antidepressant treatment. Gut microbiota were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Patients were categorized into two groups based on their age: the late-life group over 60 years and the middle-aged group under 60 years. GI symptoms were assessed with scores of item 11 of the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale. One hundred and ninety samples were collected from 32 patients with MDD. Several gut microbes had higher relative abundances in the late-life group than in the middle-aged group. In addition, the late-life group showed significantly higher diversity in the Chao1 index at baseline compared with the middle-aged group. We further found possible microbial taxa related to GI symptoms in patients with late-life depression. The abundance of several bacterial taxa may contribute to GI symptoms in the late-life depression, and our findings suggest that the therapeutic targets for the application of gut microbiota may differ depending on the age group of patients with depression.",Journal of personalized medicine,2022,Katsuma Miyaho; Kenji Sanada; Shunya Kurokawa; Arisa Tanaka; Tomoyuki Tachibana; Chiharu Ishii; Yoshihiro Noda; Shinichiro Nakajima; Shinji Fukuda; Masaru Mimura; Taishiro Kishimoto; Akira Iwanami
36079050,Intestinal Permeability and Depression in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Depression is a global health problem that requires an early and accurate diagnosis to ensure quick access to appropriate treatment. Among multiple psychopathological paths, recent attention has focused on analysing the brain-gut-microbiota axis. The intestinal barrier plays a key role, and dysfunctions occurring at this level have implications for mental health. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of intestinal permeability biomarkers, i.e., calprotectin, zonulin, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) and intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FAB), in relation to depression in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This is the first study of this kind taking place in Romania, Eastern Europe, with an emphasis on patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The correlations identified between depression and calprotectin and depression and LBP have the potential to shed light on the process of rapid diagnosis of depression with the help of biomarkers. Since depression is correlated with a decrease in the quality of life in patients with IBD, the need for access to appropriate treatments must be urgent.",Journal of clinical medicine,2022,Miorita Melina Iordache; Cristina Tocia; Mariana Aschie; Andrei Dumitru; Mihaela Manea; Georgeta Camelia Cozaru; Lucian Petcu; Sabina E Vlad; Eugen Dumitru; Anca Chisoi
35308288,Three Different Types of β-Glucans Enhance Cognition: The Role of the Gut-Brain Axis.,"Dietary fiber is fermented in the lower gastrointestinal tract, potentially impacting the microbial ecosystem and thus may improve elements of cognition and brain function via the gut-brain axis. β-glucans, soluble dietary fiber, have different macrostructures and may exhibit different effects on the gut-brain axis. This study aimed to compare the effects of β-glucans from mushroom, curdlan and oats bran, representing β-(1,3)/(1,6)-glucan, β-(1,3)-glucan or β-(1,3)/(1,4)-glucan, on cognition and the gut-brain axis.C57BL/6J mice were fed with either control diet or diets supplemented with β-glucans from mushroom, curdlan and oats bran for 15 weeks. The cognitive functions were evaluated by using the temporal order memory and Y-maze tests. The parameters of the gut-brain axis were examined, including the synaptic proteins and ultrastructure and microglia status in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC), as well as colonic immune response and mucus thickness and gut microbiota profiles.All three supplementations with β-glucans enhanced the temporal order recognition memory. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the post-synaptic protein 95 (PSD95) increased in the PFC. Furthermore, mushroom β-glucan significantly increased the post-synaptic thickness of synaptic ultrastructure in the PFC whilst the other two β-glucans had no significant effect. Three β-glucan supplementations decreased the microglia number in the PFC and hippocampus, and affected complement C3 and cytokines expression differentially. In the colon, every β-glucan supplementation increased the number of CD206 positive cells and promoted the expression of IL-10 and reduced IL-6 and TNF-α expression. The correlation analysis highlights that degree of cognitive behavior improved by β-glucan supplementations was significantly associated with microglia status in the hippocampus and PFC and the number of colonic M2 macrophages. In addition, only β-glucan from oat bran altered gut microbiota and enhanced intestinal mucus.We firstly demonstrated long-term supplementation of β-glucans enhanced recognition memory. Comparing the effects of β-glucans on the gut-brain axis, we found that β-glucans with different molecular structures exhibit differentia actions on synapses, inflammation in the brain and gut, and gut microbiota. This study may shed light on how to select appropriate β-glucans as supplementation for the prevention of cognitive deficit or improving immune function clinically.",Frontiers in nutrition,2022,Minmin Hu; Peng Zhang; Ruiqi Wang; Menglu Zhou; Ning Pang; Xiaoying Cui; Xing Ge; Xiaomei Liu; Xu-Feng Huang; Yinghua Yu
35013099,A pilot exploration of multi-omics research of gut microbiome in major depressive disorders.,"The pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) remains obscure. Recently, the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis's role in MDD has an increasing attention. However, the specific mechanism of the multi-level effects of gut microbiota on host metabolism, immunity, and brain structure is unclear. Multi-omics approaches based on the analysis of different body fluids and tissues using a variety of analytical platforms have the potential to provide a deeper understanding of MGB axis disorders. Therefore, the data of metagenomics, metabolomic, inflammatory factors, and MRI scanning are collected from the two groups including 24 drug-naïve MDD patients and 26 healthy controls (HCs). Then, the correlation analysis is performed in all omics. The results confirmed that there are many markedly altered differences, such as elevated Actinobacteria abundance, plasma IL-1β concentration, lipid, vitamin, and carbohydrate metabolism disorder, and diminished grey matter volume (GMV) of inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) in the MDD patients. Notably, three kinds of discriminative bacteria, Ruminococcus bromii, Lactococcus chungangensis, and Streptococcus gallolyticus have an extensive correlation with metabolome, immunology, GMV, and clinical symptoms. All three microbiota are closely related to IL-1β and lipids (as an example, phosphoethanolamine (PEA)). Besides, Lactococcus chungangensis is negatively related to the GMV of left IFG. Overall, this study demonstrate that the effects of gut microbiome exert in MDD is multifactorial.",Translational psychiatry,2022,Haoyang Zhao; Kangyu Jin; Chaonan Jiang; Fen Pan; Jing Wu; Honglin Luan; Zhiyong Zhao; Jingkai Chen; Tingting Mou; Zheng Wang; Jing Lu; Shaojia Lu; Shaohua Hu; Yi Xu; Manli Huang
36056826,Microbiome-Based Therapies in Parkinson's Disease: Can Tuning the Microbiota Become a Viable Therapeutic Strategy?,"Progressive neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD) have continued to baffle medical science, despite strides in the understanding of their pathology. The inability of currently available therapies to halt disease progression is a testament to an incomplete understanding of pathways crucial to disease initiation, progression and management. Science has continued to link the activities and equilibrium of the gut microbiome to the health and proper functioning of brain neurons. They also continue to stir interest in the potential applications of technologies that may shift the balance of the gut microbiome towards achieving a favourable outcome in PD management. There have been suggestions that an improved understanding of the roles of the gut microbiota is likely to lead to the emergence of an era where their manipulation becomes a recognized strategy for PD management. This review examines the current state of our journey in the quest to understand how the gut microbiota can influence several aspects of PD. We highlight the relationship between the gut microbiome/microbiota and PD pathogenesis, as well as preclinical and clinical evidence evaluating the effect of postbiotics, probiotics and prebiotics in PD management. This is with a view to ascertaining if we are at the threshold of discovering the application of a usable tool in our quest for disease modifying therapies in PD.",CNS & neurological disorders drug targets,2022,Adejoke Y Onaolapo; Folusho O Ojo; Anthony T Olofinnade; Joshua Falade; Ismail A Lawal; Olakunle J Onaolapo
35466109,Effects of Subdiaphragmatic Vagotomy in the MPTP-induced Neurotoxicity in the Striatum and Colon of Mice.,"Gut-microbiota-brain axis plays a role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). The subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve serves as a major modulatory pathway between the gut microbiota and the brain. However, the role of subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve in PD pathogenesis are unknown. Here, we investigated the effects of subdiaphragmatic vagotomy (SDV) on the neurotoxicity in the mouse striatum and colon after administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6- tetrahydropyridine (MPTP).Sham or SVD was performed. Subsequently, saline or MPTP (10 mg/kg × 3, 2-hour interval) was administered to mice. Western blot analysis of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine transporter (DAT) in the striatum and phosphorylated α-synuclein (p-α-Syn) in the colon was performed.Repeated administration of MPTP significantly caused reduction of TH and DAT in the striatum and increase of p-α-Syn in the colon of mice. However, SDV did not affect the reduction of TH and DAT in the striatum and increases in p-α-Syn in the colon after repeated MPTP administration.These data suggest that subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve doses not play a role in the MPTP-induced neurotoxicity in the brain and colon.",Clinical psychopharmacology and neuroscience : the official scientific journal of the Korean College of Neuropsychopharmacology,2022,Jiajing Shan; Youge Qu; Jiancheng Zhang; Li Ma; Kenji Hashimoto

35432048,The Correlation Between Probiotics and Anxiety and Depression Levels in Cancer Patients: A Retrospective Cohort Study.,"Studies have shown a correlation between gut microbiota and anxiety and depression levels. However, these studies are mainly animal studies or clinical studies of non-cancer patients, there is still a lack of relevant studies in cancer patients. The main objective of this trial was to analyze the correlation between probiotics and anxiety and depression levels in cancer patients.We screened all cancer patients consecutively admitted to the inpatient department of the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine in May 2020. A total of 292 cancer patients met our inclusion criteria. Then, we followed up all patients for 24 weeks. Patients who had incomplete data or loss of follow-up were excluded. In addition, in patients who took probiotics, those did not take probiotics consistently or did not take specific probiotics were excluded. Ultimately, the number of patients enrolled was 82 in probiotics cohort and 100 in non-probiotics cohort. The 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD-17) questionnaire was used to measure the depression levels of the patients, and we also used Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) questionnaire to assess the patients' anxiety levels. A logistic regression model was used to analyze whether the difference in baseline data of two cohorts would affect the final result.Demographic and clinical characteristics of all cancer patients enrolled in probiotics cohort and non-probiotics cohort were similar except the cancer therapy (<i>P</i> = 0.004). According to the HAMA score, we divided cancer patients into non-anxiety group (HAMA score < 14) and anxiety group (HAMA score ≥ 14). Similarly, cancer patients were also divided into non-depression group (HAMD-17 score ≤ 7) and depression group (HAMD-17 score > 7). The results demonstrated that there was no statistical difference in the proportion of patients with anxiety (6.1 and 13.0%, respectively, <i>P</i> = 0.121) and depression (30.5 and 23.0%, respectively, <i>P</i> = 0.254) between probiotics and non-probiotics cohorts. The results of logistic regression model analysis further proved that the baseline difference in cancer therapy did not affect the conclusions.Our results still suggest that there is no significant correlation between probiotics and anxiety and depression levels in cancer patients. Therefore, we do not recommend supplementing probiotics for cancer patients to prevent anxiety and depression. Moreover, high-quality RCTs are also needed to further confirm the conclusions of this study.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2022,Ziqi Ye; Yanfang Zhang; Mengfei Du; Shaojia Lu; Qingwei Zhao; Si Yang

Therefore, we prepared a study protocol for a double-blind, crossover, randomized clinical trial to determine the complex effects of human probiotics on memory, psychological, and biological measures in the elderly.We selected eligible participants using an effective electronic questionnaire containing the inclusion and exclusion criteria and a brief electronic cognitive test. One-third of the respondents with the worst cognitive scores on the electronic test are randomized to group A, starting with a 3-month probiotic intervention, and to group B, starting with a placebo. In a crossover design, both groups change their intervention/placebo status after 3 months for the next 3 months. Participants refusing longer personal assessments due to the COVID-19 pandemic were randomly allocated to one of two subgroups assessed online. Participants in both groups are matched in age, education, gender, and cognitive scores on electronic testing at baseline. At three time points, participants are assessed using a neuropsychological battery, self-report measures of mood, a physical fitness test, blood, urine, and stool samples, and actigraphy. A subset of participants also provided their biological samples and underwent the neuropsychological battery in an extended testing phase 3 months after study termination to find out the long-term effect of the intervention.This is the first trial to address the comprehensive effects of human probiotics on memory and many other measures in the elderly. We assume that the probiotic group will have better outcomes than the placebo group after the first and second trimesters. We expect that the probiotic effect will persist for the next 3 months.

35302147,<i>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</i> zz-1 exerts preventive effects on chronic unpredictable mild stress-induced depression in mice <i>via</i> regulating the intestinal microenvironment.,"Depression remains one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders, and it has been confirmed that it is related to the dysfunction of the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Manipulation of the gut microenvironment by probiotics might improve mental health and prevent stress-related psychiatric disorders. The present study aimed to determine whether <i>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</i> (<i>L. rhamnosus</i>) zz-1 could prevent the occurrence of depression and its potential mechanisms using a mouse model with chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). The results indicated that <i>L. rhamnosus</i> zz-1 intervention ameliorated CUMS-induced depression-like behaviors of mice with reduced body growth rate, lowered sucrose preference, increased immobility time, as well as decreased curiosity and mobility. Moreover, <i>L. rhamnosus</i> zz-1 significantly inhibited hormones released due to hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, alleviated CUMS-induced deficits of monoamine neurotransmitters, and increased the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB). These benefits were partially linked to the regulation of the intestinal microenvironment. <i>L. rhamnosus</i> zz-1 alleviated intestinal damage and reduced intestinal inflammation of the depressed mice. Meanwhile, <i>L. rhamnosus</i> zz-1 effectively adjusted the dysbiosis of mouse gut microbiota induced by CUMS, such as changes in the abundance of the <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> NK4A136 group, <i>Bacteroides</i>, and <i>Muribaculum</i>. Taken together, these results demonstrated that <i>L. rhamnosus</i> zz-1 was effective in preventing depression from chronic stress, adding new evidence to support the mental benefits of probiotics.",Food & function,2022,Jinzhao Xu; Mengqi Tang; Xinyu Wu; Xiangli Kong; Yini Liu; Xiaoxi Xu
36235606,Circulating Levels of Short-Chain Fatty Acids during Pregnancy and Infant Neurodevelopment.,"Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) play a key role in the gut microbiota-brain crosstalk regulating the main neurodevelopmental processes during pregnancy. The aim of this study is to investigate the longitudinal relationship between prenatal levels of the main SCFAs in maternal serum and infant cognitive development and temperament on day 40 postpartum after adjusting for several pre-, peri- and post-natal confounders.A sample of 357 healthy mother-infant pairs were followed from the beginning of pregnancy to 40 days after birth. Serum SCFA concentrations were assessed in the first and third trimester of pregnancy by LC-MS/MS; and socio-demographic, nutritional, and psychological variables were collected. At 40 days, the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-III and the Early Infancy Temperament Questionnaire were administered.Lower serum levels of acetic, butyric and isobutyric acid, mainly during the first trimester, were related to better language and psychomotor development and, in the case of butyric acid, better intensity behavior in infants. Medium levels of propionic acid were related to better scores for development, mood and temperament.These findings suggest that in a community sample of healthy pregnant women from a Mediterranean region of northern Spain, lower serum levels of SCFAs, especially in the first trimester of pregnancy, seem to be related to better infant neurodevelopment.",Nutrients,2022,Carmen Hernández-Martínez; Josefa Canals; Núria Voltas; Francisco Martín-Luján; Victoria Arija
35918353,Investigation of memory-enhancing effects of Streptococcus thermophilus EG007 in mice and elucidating molecular and metagenomic characteristics using nanopore sequencing.,"Over the past decades, accumulating evidences have highlighted the gut microbiota as a key player in the brain functioning via microbiota-gut-brain axis, and accordingly, the beneficial role of several probiotic strains in cognitive ability also have been actively investigated. However, the majority of the research have demonstrated the effects against age-related cognitive decline or neurological disease. To this end, we aimed to investigate lactic acid bacteria strains having beneficial effects on the cognitive function of healthy young mice and elucidate underlying characteristics by carrying out nanopore sequencing-based genomics and metagenomics analysis. 8-week consumption of Streptococcus thermophilus EG007 demonstrated marked enhancements in behavior tests assessing short-term spatial and non-spatial learning and memory. It was revealed that EG007 possessed genes encoding various metabolites beneficial for a health condition in many aspects, including gamma-aminobutyric acid producing system, a neurotransmitter associated with mood and stress response. Also, by utilizing 16S-23S rRNA operon as a taxonomic marker, we identified more accurate species-level compositional changes in gut microbiota, which was increase of certain species, previously reported to have associations with mental health or down-regulation of inflammation or infection-related species. Moreover, correlation analysis revealed that the EG007-mediated altered microbiota had a significant correlation with the memory traits.",Scientific reports,2022,Hyaekang Kim; Soomin Jeon; Jina Kim; Donghyeok Seol; JinChul Jo; Seoae Cho; Heebal Kim
35790976,"The effects of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) administration on the microbiome-gut-brain axis in adolescents with anorexia nervosa (the MiGBAN study): study protocol for a longitudinal, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.","Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe psychiatric disease that often takes a chronic course due to insufficient treatment options. Emerging evidence on the gut-brain axis offers the opportunity to find innovative treatments for patients with psychiatric disorders. The gut microbiome of patients with AN shows profound alterations that do not completely disappear after weight rehabilitation. In previous studies, the administration of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) resulted in effects that might be beneficial in the treatment of AN, affecting the microbiome, body weight and executive functions. Therefore, the MiGBAN study aims to examine the effects of a nutritional supplementation with PUFA on the gut microbiome and body mass index (BMI) in patients with AN.This is a longitudinal, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Within 2 years, 60 adolescent patients aged 12 to 19 years with AN will receive either PUFA or placebo for 6 months additional to treatment as usual. After 1 year, the long-term effect of PUFA on the gut microbiome and consecutively on BMI will be determined. Secondary outcomes include improvement of gastrointestinal symptoms, eating disorder psychopathology, and comorbidities. Additionally, the interaction of the gut microbiome with the brain (microbiome-gut-brain axis) will be studied by conducting MRI measurements to assess functional and morphological changes and neuropsychological assessments to describe cognitive functioning. Anti-inflammatory effects of PUFA in AN will be examined via serum inflammation and gut permeability markers. Our hypothesis is that PUFA administration will have positive effects on the gut microbiota and thus the treatment of AN by leading to a faster weight gain and a reduction of gastrointestinal problems and eating disorder psychopathology.Due to previously heterogeneous results, a systematic and longitudinal investigation of the microbiome-gut-brain axis in AN is essential.

36364950,Exploration of the Gut-Brain Axis through Metabolomics Identifies Serum Propionic Acid Associated with Higher Cognitive Decline in Older Persons.,"The gut microbiome is involved in nutrient metabolism and produces metabolites that, via the gut−brain axis, signal to the brain and influence cognition. Human studies have so far had limited success in identifying early metabolic alterations linked to cognitive aging, likely due to limitations in metabolite coverage or follow-ups. Older persons from the Three-City population-based cohort who had not been diagnosed with dementia at the time of blood sampling were included, and repeated measures of cognition over 12 subsequent years were collected. Using a targeted metabolomics platform, we identified 72 circulating gut-derived metabolites in a case−control study on cognitive decline, nested within the cohort (discovery n = 418; validation n = 420). Higher serum levels of propionic acid, a short-chain fatty acid, were associated with increased odds of cognitive decline (OR for 1 SD = 1.40 (95% CI 1.11, 1.75) for discovery and 1.26 (1.02, 1.55) for validation). Additional analyses suggested mediation by hypercholesterolemia and diabetes. Propionic acid strongly correlated with blood glucose (r = 0.79) and with intakes of meat and cheese (r > 0.15), but not fiber (r = 0.04), suggesting a minor role of prebiotic foods per se, but a possible link to processed foods, in which propionic acid is a common preservative. The adverse impact of propionic acid on metabolism and cognition deserves further investigation.",Nutrients,2022,Jeanne Neuffer; Raúl González-Domínguez; Sophie Lefèvre-Arbogast; Dorrain Y Low; Bénédicte Driollet; Catherine Helmer; Andrea Du Preez; Chiara de Lucia; Silvie R Ruigrok; Barbara Altendorfer; Ludwig Aigner; Paul J Lucassen; Aniko Korosi; Sandrine Thuret; Claudine Manach; Mercè Pallàs; Mireia Urpi-Sardà; Alex Sánchez-Pla; Cristina Andres-Lacueva; Cécilia Samieri
35704960,"Efficacy and safety of a food supplement with standardized menthol, limonene, and gingerol content in patients with irritable bowel syndrome: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.","Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects 9,2% of the global population and places a considerable burden on healthcare systems. Most medications for treating IBS, including spasmolytics, laxatives, and antidiarrheals, have low efficacy. Effective and safe therapeutic treatments have yet to be developed for IBS.This study assessed the efficacy and safety of a food supplement containing standardized menthol, limonene, and gingerol in human participants with IBS or IBS/functional dyspepsia (FD).A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.We randomly assigned 56 patients with IBS or IBS/FD to an intervention group (Group 1) or control group (Group 2) that were given supplement or placebo, respectively, in addition to the standard treatment regimen for 30 d. Three outpatient visits were conducted during the study. Symptom severity was measured at each visit using a 7×7 questionnaire. Qualitative and quantitative composition of the intestinal microbiota were assessed at visits 1 and 3 based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing.At visit 1 (before treatment), the median total 7×7 questionnaire score was in the moderately ill range for both groups, with no difference between the groups (p = 0.1). At visit 2, the total 7×7 score decreased to mildly ill, with no difference between the groups (p = 0.4). At visit 3, the total score for group 1 indicated borderline illness and for group 2 remained indicated mild illness (p = 0.009). Even though we observed some variations in gut microbiota between the groups, we did not find any statistically significant changes.The food supplement with standardized menthol, limonene, and gingerol content increased the efficacy of standard therapy in IBS and FD patients. The use of the supplement did not cause any obvious side effects.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04484467.",PloS one,2022,Vladimir T Ivashkin; Anna V Kudryavtseva; George S Krasnov; Yuri M Poluektov; Margarita A Morozova; Oleg S Shifrin; Allan G Beniashvili; Zarina A Mamieva; Alexandra L Kovaleva; Anatoly I Ulyanin; Elizaveta A Trush; Alexander G Erlykin; Elena A Poluektova

However, commonly consumed fermented and prebiotic-containing foods have not been well-tested. The aim of the present study was to determine whether consumption of fermented food and food-derived prebiotics is associated with cognitive performance, depressive, and anxiety symptoms in psychiatrically healthy medical students under psychological stress.The study protocol with data analysis plan was prospectively registered. Food consumption was evaluated with a 7-day dietary record. Cognitive performance was modeled with academic examination performance in relation to subject knowledge. Pre-exam depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, respectively.In total, 372 medical students (22.7 ± 1.1 years of age, 66% female) completed the study. No relationship was observed between cognitive performance under stress and either fermented food (adjusted β 0.02, 95% CI -0.07-0.11, <i>p</i> = 0.63) or food-derived prebiotics consumption (adjusted β -0.00, 95% CI -0.09-0.09, <i>p</i> = 0.99). High intake of fermented food was associated with more severe depressive (adjusted β 0.11, 95% CI 0.01-0.20, <i>p</i> = 0.032) and anxiety symptoms under stress (adjusted β 0.13, 95% CI 0.04-0.22, <i>p</i> = 0.0065); however, no such link was observed for food-derived prebiotics (adjusted β 0.03, 95% CI -0.07-0.13, <i>p</i> = 0.50 and -0.01, 95% CI -0.11-0.08, <i>p</i> = 0.83, for depression and anxiety, respectively).Under psychological stress in medical students, consumption of fermented food and food-derived prebiotics appears to be not associated with cognitive performance. High intake of fermented food, but not food-derived prebiotics, may be associated with severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms. The safety of fermented food in this regard therefore requires further clarification.",Frontiers in nutrition,2022,Michał Seweryn Karbownik; Łukasz Mokros; Maria Dobielska; Mateusz Kowalczyk; Edward Kowalczyk
38868440,Schizophrenia and obesity: May the gut microbiota serve as a link for the pathogenesis?,"Schizophrenia (SZ) places a tremendous burden on public health as one of the leading causes of disability and death. SZ patients are more prone to developing obesity than the general population from the clinical practice. The development of obesity frequently causes poor psychiatric outcomes in SZ patients. In turn, maternal obesity during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of SZ in offspring, suggesting that these two disorders may have shared neuropathological mechanisms. The gut microbiota is well known to serve as a major regulator of bidirectional interactions between the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. It also plays a critical role in maintaining physical and mental health in humans. Recent studies have shown that the dysbiosis of gut microbiota is intimately associated with the onset of SZ and obesity through shared pathophysiological mechanisms, particularly the stimulation of immune inflammation. Therefore, gut microbiota may serve as a common biological basis for the etiology in both SZ and obesity, and the perturbed gut-brain axis may therefore account for the high prevalence of obesity in patients with SZ. On the basis of these findings, this review provides updated perspectives and intervention approaches on the etiology, prevention, and management of obesity in SZ patients by summarizing the recent findings on the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of SZ and obesity, highlighting the role of gut-derived inflammation.",iMeta,2023,Hui Wu; Yaxi Liu; Jie Wang; Shengyun Chen; Liwei Xie; Xiaoli Wu
39295905,The butyrate-producing and spore-forming bacterial genus <i>Coprococcus</i> as a potential biomarker for neurological disorders.,"The host-intestinal microbiome interaction has gained much scientific attention in the past two decades, boosted by advances in DNA sequencing and cultivation techniques. An accumulating amount of evidence shows that gut microbes play crucial roles in gut homeostasis, immune system education, and are associated with quality-of-life indicators. Beneficial health factors are associated with the digestion of dietary fibres in the colon and the subsequent production of short-chain fatty acids, including acetate, propionate, and butyrate. <i>Coprococcus</i> is a butyrate-producing genus in the phylum Firmicutes, and its abundance is inversely correlated with several neuropsychological and neurodegenerative disorders. Case-control studies provide strong evidence of decreased abundance of <i>Coprococcus</i> spp. in depressed individuals. The species <i>Coprococcus eutactus</i> has the unique capacity to use two separate pathways for butyrate synthesis and has been found to be depleted in children with delayed language development and adults with Parkinson's disease. The combined literature on <i>Coprococcus</i> and the gut microbiota-brain axis points towards enhanced butyrate production and reduced colonisation of pathogenic clades as factors explaining its association with health effects. The genus <i>Coprococcus</i> is a promising candidate for a mental health biomarker and an interesting lead for novel dietary-based preventive therapies for specific neurological disorders.","Gut microbiome (Cambridge, England)",2023,Fleur Notting; Walter Pirovano; Wilbert Sybesma; Remco Kort
38972900,Humid heat environment causes anxiety-like disorder via impairing gut microbiota and bile acid metabolism in mice.,"Climate and environmental changes threaten human mental health, but the impacts of specific environmental conditions on neuropsychiatric disorders remain largely unclear. Here, we show the impact of a humid heat environment on the brain and the gut microbiota using a conditioned housing male mouse model. We demonstrate that a humid heat environment can cause anxiety-like behaviour in male mice. Microbial 16 S rRNA sequencing analysis reveals that a humid heat environment caused gut microbiota dysbiosis (e.g., decreased abundance of Lactobacillus murinus), and metabolomics reveals an increase in serum levels of secondary bile acids (e.g., lithocholic acid). Moreover, increased neuroinflammation is indicated by the elevated expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the serum and cortex, activated PI3K/AKT/NF-κB signalling and a microglial response in the cortex. Strikingly, transplantation of the microbiota from mice reared in a humid heat environment readily recapitulates these abnormalities in germ-free mice, and these abnormalities are markedly reversed by Lactobacillus murinus administration. Human samples collected during the humid heat season also show a decrease in Lactobacillus murinus abundance and an increase in the serum lithocholic acid concentration. In conclusion, gut microbiota dysbiosis induced by a humid heat environment drives the progression of anxiety disorders by impairing bile acid metabolism and enhancing neuroinflammation, and probiotic administration is a potential therapeutic strategy for these disorders.",Nature communications,2024,Huandi Weng; Li Deng; Tianyuan Wang; Huachong Xu; Jialin Wu; Qinji Zhou; Lingtai Yu; Boli Chen; Li'an Huang; Yibo Qu; Libing Zhou; Xiaoyin Chen

Importantly, the role of gut microbiota in the healthy longevity of the host may provide unprecedented opportunities to decipher the plasticity of lifespan on a natural evolutionary scale and shed light on using microbiota-targeted strategies to promote healthy aging and combat age-related diseases. This review investigates how gut microbiota affects healthy longevity, focusing on the mechanisms through which gut microbiota modulates it. Specifically, we focused on the ability of gut microbiota to enhance the intestinal barrier integrity, provide protection from inflammaging, ameliorate nutrientsensing pathways, optimize mitochondrial function, and improve defense against age-related diseases, thus participating in enhancing longevity and healthspan.",Science China.

Accumulating evidence suggests that the gut microbiota modulates intestinal neurotransmitter metabolism and gut-to-brain signaling, shedding light on the crucial role of the gut microbiota in brain function and the pathogenesis of various neuropsychiatric diseases, such as major depression disorder (MDD), anxiety, addiction and Parkinson's disease (PD). Despite the exciting findings, the mechanisms underlying the modulation of neurotransmitter metabolism and function by the gut microbiota are still being elucidated. In this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the existing knowledge about the role of the gut microbiota in neurotransmitter metabolism and function in animal and clinical experiments. Moreover, we will discuss the potential mechanisms through which gut microbiota-derived neurotransmitters contribute to the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric diseases, thus highlighting a novel therapeutic target for these conditions.",Microbiological research,2024,Shiyan Qu; Zijin Yu; Yaxuan Zhou; Shiyi Wang; Minqi Jia; Ti Chen; Xiaojie Zhang
38803488,"Gut microbiota, inflammatory proteins and COVID-19: a Mendelian randomisation study.","The human gut microbiota has been identified as a potentially important factor influencing the development of COVID-19. It is believed that the disease primarily affects the organism through inflammatory pathways. With the aim of improving early diagnosis and targeted therapy, it is crucial to identify the specific gut microbiota associated with COVID-19 and to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying processes. The present study sought to investigate the potential causal relationship between the gut microbiota and COVID-19, and to determine the extent to which inflammatory proteins act as mediators in this relationship.Bidirectional mendelian randomization (MR) and Two-step mediated MR analyses were applied to examine causative associations among 196 gut microbiota, 91 inflammatory proteins and COVID-19. The main analytical method used in the MR was the random effects inverse variance weighted (IVW) method. This was complemented by the Bayesian weighted Mendelian randomization (BWMR) method, which was utilized to test the hypothesis of MR. In order for the results to be deemed reliable, statistical significance was required for both methods. Validation was then carried out using an external dataset, and further meta-analyses were conducted to authenticate that the association was reliable.Results of our research indicated that seven gut microbiota were actively associated to the COVID-19 risk. Five inflammatory proteins were associated with COVID-19 risk, of which three were positively and two were negatively identified with COVID-19. Further validation was carried out using sensitivity analyses. Mediated MR results revealed that CCL2 was a possible mediator of causality of family Bifidobacteriaceae and order Bifidobacteriales with COVID-19, mediating at a ratio of 12.73%.Suggesting a genetic causation between specific gut microbiota and COVID-19, our present research emphasizes the underlying mediating role of CCL2, an inflammatory factor, and contributes to a deeper understanding of the mechanism of action underlying COVID-19.",Frontiers in immunology,2024,Yuling Chen; Chang Chen

It is known that the symbiotic interactions between the gut microbes and the host can affect mental health. The review analyzes the mechanisms and ways of action of the gut microbiota on the pathophysiology of depression. The possibility of using knowledge about the taxonomic composition and metabolic profile of the microbiota of patients with depression to select gene compositions (metagenomic signature) as biomarkers of the disease is evaluated. The use of in silico technologies (machine learning) for the diagnosis of depression based on the biomarkers of the gut microbiota is given. Alternative approaches to the treatment of depression are being considered by balancing the microbial composition through dietary modifications and the use of additives, namely probiotics, postbiotics (including vesicles) and prebiotics as psychobiotics, and fecal transplantation.

Kefir has been shown to have many beneficial health effects; however, its effect on PCOS is unknown. This study aimed to examine the effect of kefir on the intestinal microbiota and health outcomes in PCOS. In this intervention study, 17 women with PCOS consumed 250 mL/day of kefir (containing <i>Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens</i> subsp. <i>kefiranofaciens</i>, <i>Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens</i> subsp. <i>kefirgranum</i>, <i>Lactobacillus kefiri</i>, <i>Lactobacillus acidophilus</i>, <i>Lactobacillus parakefiri</i>, <i>Lactobacillus bulgaricus</i>, <i>Lactobacillus reuteri</i>, <i>Lactobacillus casei</i>, <i>Lactobacillus fermentum</i>, <i>Lactobacillus helveticus</i>, <i>Lactococcus lactis</i>, <i>Leuconostoc mesentereoides</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium bifidum</i>, <i>Streptococcus thermophilus</i>, <i>Kluyveromyces marxianus</i>, <i>Kluyveromyces lactis</i>, <i>Acetobacter pasteurianus</i>, and <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) for 8 weeks. Food consumption and physical activity records, anthropometrical measurements, quality of life, and fecal and blood samples were taken at the study's beginning and end. Quality of life in mental health (58.8 ± 15.08; 64.0 ± 15.23, respectively) and physical function (95.00 and 100.00, respectively) categories showed a significant increase after kefir intervention (<i>p</i> < .05).

38735387,Association of intestinal anti-inflammatory drug target genes with psychiatric Disorders: A Mendelian randomization study.,"Psychiatric disorders present a substantial global public health burden with limited drug options. The gut-brain axis connects inflammatory bowel diseases and psychiatric disorders, which often have comorbidities. While some evidence hints at anti-inflammatory drugs aiding in treating psychiatric conditions, the specific effects of intestinal anti-inflammatory drugs remain unclear.This study investigates the causal effect of intestinal anti-inflammatory drug targets on psychiatric disorders. We hypothesize that these drug targets may offer new insights into the treatment and prevention of such disorders. Additionally, we explore gut microbiota's mediating role between drug target genes and psychiatric disorders.We performed two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) using summary data from existing expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and protein QTL in the brain, along with public genome-wide association studies of disease. We also explored gut microbiota's mediating effect. The statistics encompassed six psychiatric disorders involving 9,725-500,199 individuals. Colocalization analysis enhanced the MR evidence.We uncovered a causal link between TPMT (a target of olsalazine) expression in the amygdala and bipolar disorder (BD) risk (odds ratio [OR] = 1.08; P = 4.29 × 10<sup>-4</sup>). This association was observed even when the sigmoid colon and whole blood eQTL were considered as exposures. Colocalization analysis revealed a shared genetic variant (rs11751561) between TPMT expression and BD, with a posterior probability of 61.6 %. Interestingly, this causal effect was influenced by a decrease in the gut microbiota abundance of the genus Roseburia (effect proportion = 10.05 %). Moreover, elevated ACAT1 expression was associated with higher obsessive-compulsive disorder risk (OR = 1.62; P = 3.64 × 10<sup>-4</sup>; posterior probability = 3.1 %).These findings provide novel targets for the treatment of psychiatric disorders, underscore the potential of repurposing olsalazine, and emphasize the importance of TPMT and ACAT1 in future drug development.",Journal of advanced research,2024,Guorui Zhao; Zhe Lu; Yundan Liao; Yaoyao Sun; Yuyanan Zhang; Zhewei Kang; Xiaoyang Feng; Junyuan Sun; Weihua Yue

Prebiotics, non-digestible food ingredients that beneficially affect the host by selectively stimulating the growth and/or activity of beneficial microorganisms, have emerged as a key modulator of this complex microbial community. This review article explores the evolution of the prebiotic concept, delineates various types of prebiotics, including fructans, galactooligosaccharides, xylooligosaccharides, chitooligosaccharides, lactulose, resistant starch, and polyphenols, and elucidates their impact on the gut microbiota composition. We delve into the mechanisms through which prebiotics exert their effects, particularly focusing on producing short-chain fatty acids and modulating the gut microbiota towards a health-promoting composition. The implications of prebiotics on human health are extensively reviewed, focusing on conditions such as obesity, inflammatory bowel disease, immune function, and mental health. The review further discusses the emerging concept of synbiotics-combinations of prebiotics and probiotics that synergistically enhance gut health-and highlights the market potential of prebiotics in response to a growing demand for functional foods. By consolidating current knowledge and identifying areas for future research, this review aims to enhance understanding of prebiotics' role in health and disease, underscoring their importance in maintaining a healthy gut microbiome and overall well-being.",International journal of molecular sciences,2024,Suyeon Yoo; Suk-Chae Jung; Kihyuck Kwak; Jun-Seob Kim

Thus, targeting the gut microbiota via dietary intake could serve as both a preventative and therapeutic strategy in improving perinatal mental health.Here, we present a protocol for a prospective cohort study that primarily aims to determine if diet quality during pregnancy is protective against postpartum depression severity. Secondary objectives will examine if microbiota- and blood-based inflammatory markers may be associated with the relationship between prenatal diet quality and postpartum depression severity, as well as with associations between additional dietary and mental health outcomes.Dietary patterns and mental health symptoms will be documented in 100 pregnant women at 4 time points during pregnancy and postpartum. Participants will also provide stool and blood samples at the same time points to determine microbiota composition and predicted function and inflammatory factors, respectively. Stool microbiota will be analyzed using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing and bioinformatics tools (QIIME 2/PICRUSt2).

Machine learning algorithms were employed to develop a classifier model, subsequently validated in an independent cohort. Mouse models of IA were established to verify the potential role of the specific metabolite identified.Distinct shifts in taxonomic and functional profiles of gut microbiota and their related metabolites were observed in different IA stages. Notably, tryptophan metabolites, particularly indoxyl sulfate (IS), were significantly higher in plasma of RIA. Meanwhile, upregulated tryptophanase expression and indole-producing microbiota were observed in gut microbiome of RIA. A model harnessing gut-microbiome-derived tryptophan metabolites demonstrated remarkable efficacy in distinguishing RIA from UIA patients in the validation cohort (AUC=0.97). Gut microbiota depletion by antibiotics decreased plasma IS concentration, reduced IA formation and rupture in mice, and downregulated matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression in aneurysmal walls with elastin degradation reduction. Supplement of IS reversed the effect of gut microbiota depletion.Our investigation highlights the potential of gut-microbiome-derived tryptophan metabolites as biomarkers for distinguishing RIA from UIA patients.

The emerging focus on the gut microbiota's role in CKD pathophysiology represents a pivotal area in nephrology; however, the evidence on this topic is limited. This observational prospective study, in the framework of the PREDIMED-Plus trial, investigates associations between gut microbiota composition and the 1-year trajectory of CKD in 343 participants aged 55-75 years with high cardiovascular risk.Kidney function was assessed at baseline and at 1-year of follow-up through the estimated glomerular filtration rate based on cystatin C (eGFR-CysC) and CKD defined by eGFR-CysC <60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. Participants were grouped based on their 1-year CKD trajectory: Group 1 maintained normal status or improved from CKD to normal, while Group 2 maintained CKD or worsened from normal to CKD. Fecal microbiota composition was assessed through 16S sequencing.We observed differences in gut microbiota composition between CKD trajectory groups. Notably, the baseline relative abundance of Lachnoclostridium and Lachnospira, both butyrate-producing genera, was lower in participants maintaining or progressing to CKD. Longitudinally, a decrease in Lachnospira abundance was associated with CKD progression. The improved Chao1 index after 1-year follow-up suggests a link between enhanced microbial richness and stable/better kidney function.The findings underscore the potential of gut microbiota analysis in non-invasively monitoring CKD, especially in older populations, and hint at future interventions targeting gut microbiota to manage CKD progression.

39375584,"Animal and plant protein intake association with mental health, tryptophan metabolites pathways, and gut microbiota in healthy women: a cross-sectional study.","Mental health is affected by tryptophane (TRP) metabolism regulation. Diet-influenced gut microbiome regulates TRP metabolism. Thus, the present study aimed to explore the relationship between type of dietary protein intake, gut microbiota, TRP metabolites homeostasis, and mental well-being in healthy women. 91 healthy females aged 18-50 were recruited based on the study protocol. Validate and reliable questionnaires assessed dietary intake and mental health. Biochemical tests and gut microbiota composition were analyzed following the manufacturer's instructions for each enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA) kit and Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) methods respectively. Regression methods were used to estimate the considered associations. The results show that in the fully adjusted model, plant protein consumption was partially inversely associated with depression risk (OR = 0.27; 95% CI: 0.06, 1.09; P = 0.06). Higher dietary animal protein intake was marginally associated with psychological distress (OR = 2.59; 95% CI: 0.91, 7.34; P = 0.07). KYN to serotonin ratio was inversely associated with animal protein consumption (ß = 1.10; 95% CI: -0.13, 2.33; P = 0.07). Firmicutes/Bacteriodetes ratio (β = -1.27 × 103, SE = 5.99 × 102, P = 0.03) was lower in the top tertile of plant protein. A partially negative correlation was found between dietary animal protein and Prevotella abundance (β = -9.20 × 1018, SE = 5.04 × 1018, P = 0.06). Overall, significant inverse associations were found between a diet high in plant protein with mental disorders, KYN levels, and Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio while adhering to higher animal protein could predispose women to psychological stress.",BMC microbiology,2024,Neda Soveid; Bahareh Barkhidarian; Mahsa Samadi; Mahsa Hatami; Fatemeh Gholami; Mir Saeid Yekaninejad; Ahmad Saedisomeolia; Maryam Karbasian; Seyed Davar Siadat; Khadijeh Mirzaei
39417049,Challenges in integrating traditional Chinese medicine and gut microbiota research for insomnia treatment.,"The gut microbiome is an extensive variety of bacteria with a range of metabolic capabilities that can be pathogenic, beneficial, or opportunistic. Changes in the gut microbiota's composition can affect the link between gut integrity and host health as well as cause disruptions to numerous neurological systems. The second most prevalent mental health problem, insomnia has a negative social and economic impact. Currently, it is becoming increasingly obvious how crucial it is to preserve the delicate balance of gut microbiota to treat illness-related symptoms like insomnia. Although traditional Chinese medicine has proposed an effective strategy against insomnia through gut microbiota alteration in animal models, studies in human models are limited. This decreases the predictive value of the studies in terms of human outcomes. This editorial places an emphasis on cultural sensitivity rather than scientific reasoning that promotes the use of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). We aim to emphasize the concern that promoting TCM could divert resources from conventional medical research, leading to suboptimal care.",World journal of clinical cases,2024,Maham Bilal; Abdulqadir J Nashwan
38975363,"Dissecting the association between gut microbiota, body mass index and specific depressive symptoms: a mediation Mendelian randomisation study.","Observational studies highlight the association between gut microbiota (GM) composition and depression; however, evidence for the causal relationship between GM and specific depressive symptoms remains lacking.We aimed to evaluate the causal relationship between GM and specific depressive symptoms as well as the mediating role of body mass index (BMI).We performed a two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis using genetic variants associated with GM and specific depressive symptoms from genome-wide association studies. The mediating role of BMI was subsequently explored using mediation analysis via two-step MR.MR evidence suggested the <i>Bifidobacterium</i> genus (β=-0.03; 95% CI -0.05 to -0.02; p<0.001 and β=-0.03; 95% CI -0.05 to -0.02; p<0.001) and Actinobacteria phylum (β=-0.04; 95% CI -0.06 to -0.02; p<0.001 and β=-0.03; 95% CI -0.05 to -0.03; p=0.001) had protective effects on both anhedonia and depressed mood. The Actinobacteria phylum also had protective effects on appetite changes (β=-0.04; 95% CI -0.06 to -0.01; p=0.005), while the Family XI had an antiprotective effect (β=0.03; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.04; p<0.001). The Bifidobacteriaceae family (β=-0.01; 95% CI -0.02 to -0.01; p=0.001) and Actinobacteria phylum (β=-0.02; 95% CI -0.03 to -0.01; p=0.001) showed protective effects against suicidality. The two-step MR analysis revealed that BMI also acted as a mediating moderator between the Actinobacteria phylum and appetite changes (mediated proportion, 34.42%) and that BMI partially mediated the effect of the <i>Bifidobacterium</i> genus (14.14% and 8.05%) and Actinobacteria phylum (13.10% and 8.31%) on both anhedonia and depressed mood.These findings suggest a potential therapeutic effect of Actinobacteria and <i>Bifidobacterium</i> on both depression and obesity.

38901183,Diverse mechanisms by which chemical pollutant exposure alters gut microbiota metabolism and inflammation.,"The human gut microbiome, the host, and the environment are inextricably linked across the life course with significant health impacts. Consisting of trillions of bacteria, fungi, viruses, and other micro-organisms, microbiota living within our gut are particularly dynamic and responsible for digestion and metabolism of diverse classes of ingested chemical pollutants. Exposure to chemical pollutants not only in early life but throughout growth and into adulthood can alter human hosts' ability to absorb and metabolize xenobiotics, nutrients, and other components critical to health and longevity. Inflammation is a common mechanism underlying multiple environmentally related chronic conditions, including cardiovascular disease, multiple cancer types, and mental health. While growing research supports complex interactions between pollutants and the gut microbiome, significant gaps exist. Few reviews provide descriptions of the complex mechanisms by which chemical pollutants interact with the host microbiome through either direct or indirect pathways to alter disease risk, with a particular focus on inflammatory pathways. This review focuses on examples of several classes of pollutants commonly ingested by humans, including (i) heavy metals, (ii) persistent organic pollutants (POPs), and (iii) nitrates. Digestive enzymes and gut microbes are the first line of absorption and metabolism of these chemicals, and gut microbes have been shown to alter compounds from a less to more toxic state influencing subsequent distribution and excretion. In addition, chemical pollutants may interact with or alter the selection of more harmful and less commensal microbiota, leading to gut dysbiosis, and changes in receptor-mediated signaling pathways that alter the integrity and function of the gut intestinal tract. Arsenic, cadmium, and lead (heavy metals), influence the microbiome directly by altering different classes of bacteria, and subsequently driving inflammation through metabolite production and different signaling pathways (LPS/TLR4 or proteoglycan/TLR2 pathways). POPs can alter gut microbial composition either directly or indirectly depending on their ability to activate key signaling pathways within the intestine (e.g., PCB-126 and AHR). Nitrates and nitrites' effect on the gut and host may depend on their ability to be transformed to secondary and tertiary metabolites by gut bacteria. Future research should continue to support foundational research both in vitro, in vivo, and longitudinal population-based research to better identify opportunities for prevention, gain additional mechanistic insights into the complex interactions between environmental pollutants and the microbiome and support additional translational science.",Environment international,2024,Menna Teffera; Alex C Veith; Sean Ronnekleiv-Kelly; Christopher A Bradfield; Maria Nikodemova; Lisa Tussing-Humphreys; Kristen Malecki
39375215,Association of the newly proposed dietary index for gut microbiota and depression: the mediation effect of phenotypic age and body mass index.,"Gut microbiota and depression have garnered attention. The dietary index for gut microbiota (DI-GM) is a newly proposed index that reflects the diversity of gut microbiota, yet its association with depression remains unstudied.Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were analyzed. Depression was assessed using Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Dietary recall data were used to calculate the DI-GM (including components beneficial and unfavorable to gut microbiota). Multivariable weighted logistic and linear regression were employed to investigate the association of DI-GM with depression and total PHQ-9 score. The potential mediating role of phenotypic age and body mass index (BMI) was explored. Secondary analyses included subgroup analyses, restricted cubic spline (RCS), and multiple imputation.A higher DI-GM and beneficial gut microbiota score were associated with a lower prevalence of depression (DI-GM: OR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.89, 0.99; beneficial gut microbiota score: OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.82, 0.94) and lower total PHQ-9 score (DI-GM: β=-0.09, 95% CI=-0.14, -0.04; beneficial gut microbiota: β=-0.15, 95% CI=-0.21, -0.08). RCS indicated a non-linear relationship between DI-GM and depression. A significant mediating effect of phenotypic age (proportion of mediation: 19.81%, 95% CI: 12.86-63.00%) and BMI (proportion of mediation: 16.49%, 95% CI: 12.87-62.00%) was observed.The newly proposed DI-GM was negatively associated with the prevalence of depression and total PHQ-9 score. Mediation analyses demonstrated a significant mediating effect of phenotypic age and BMI.",European archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience,2024,Xuan Zhang; Qinglong Yang; Jingtao Huang; Hanyuan Lin; Nan Luo; Haoxian Tang

It may also cause vascular endothelial dysfunction and androgen metabolism disorder by interfering with lipid metabolism, immunity, and endocrine regulation, leading to the occurrence of organic ED.Gut microbiota and its metabolites play an important role in the occurrence and development of ED. As a new influencing factor of ED, gut microbiota disorder is expected to become a target for treatment.",Sexual medicine reviews,2024,Quanxin Su; Qizhen Tang; Chuanyu Ma; Kenan Wang
38582194,Evolution and the critical role of the microbiota in the reduced mental and physical health associated with low socioeconomic status (SES).,"The evolution of the gut-microbiota-brain axis in animals reveals that microbial inputs influence metabolism, the regulation of inflammation and the development of organs, including the brain. Inflammatory, neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders are more prevalent in people of low socioeconomic status (SES). Many aspects of low SES reduce exposure to the microbial inputs on which we are in a state of evolved dependence, whereas the lifestyle of wealthy citizens maintains these exposures. This partially explains the health deficit of low SES, so focussing on our evolutionary history and on environmental and lifestyle factors that distort microbial exposures might help to mitigate that deficit. But the human microbiota is complex and we have poor understanding of its functions at the microbial and mechanistic levels, and in the brain. Perhaps its composition is more flexible than the microbiota of animals that have restricted habitats and less diverse diets? These uncertainties are discussed in relation to the encouraging but frustrating results of attempts to treat psychiatric disorders by modulating the microbiota.",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,2024,Graham A W Rook

39458270,Depressive Symptoms and Gut Microbiota after Bowel Preparation and Colonoscopy: A Pre-Post Intervention Study.,"Mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) is essential for visualisation of the colon during colonoscopy. Previous studies have identified changes in gut microbiota composition after MBP and colonoscopy. Considering the gut microbiota is increasingly implicated in psychiatry, we explored the potential impact of this intervention on mood and the microbiota-gut-brain axis. We conducted a pre-post intervention study in adults, with timepoints of one week before and one month after MBP and colonoscopy. Our primary outcome was change in average Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale depression sub-scores. We examined changes in average anxiety, stress, and quality of life scores and gut microbiota composition using 16S rRNA sequencing. We further explored associations between changes in depressive symptoms and gut microbiota and conducted post hoc analyses to explore potential effect modifiers. Average depressive symptom scores decreased one month post-procedure compared to baseline (n = 59; adjusted β = -0.64; 95%CI: -1.18, -0.11). Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) appeared to moderate this relationship (β = 1.78; 95%CI: 0.292, 3.26); depressive symptoms increased in those with, and decreased in those without, IBS. Reduced alpha diversity, modest effects on beta-diversity, and increases in health-associated genera were observed one month post-procedure. Increases in the CLR-transformed abundances of <i>Ruminococcaceae UCG-009</i> were associated with improvements in depressive symptoms. There is preliminary evidence of a potential mental health effect of MBP and colonoscopy, particularly for those with IBS, which may be associated with changes to the gut microbiota. Further research is required to confirm these findings and their clinical relevance.",Microorganisms,2024,Amelia J McGuinness; Martin O'Hely; Douglas Stupart; David Watters; Samantha L Dawson; Christopher Hair; Michael Berk; Mohammadreza Mohebbi; Amy Loughman; Glenn Guest; Felice N Jacka
38892694,A Cross Talking between the Gut Microbiota and Metabolites of Participants in a Confined Environment.,"Certain workplaces, like deep-sea voyages, subject workers to chronic psychological stress and circadian rhythm disorders due to confined environments and frequent shifts. In this study, participants lived in a strictly controlled confined environment, and we analyzed the effects of a confined environment on gut microbiota and metabolites. The results showed that living in confined environments can significantly alter both the gut microbiota and the gut metabolome, particularly affecting lipid metabolism pathways like glycerophospholipid metabolism. There was a significant reduction in the abundance of <i>Faecalibacterium</i> and <i>Bacteroides</i>, while <i>Blautia</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, and <i>Collinsella</i> showed significant increases. An association analysis revealed a strong correlation between changes in the gut microbiota and the metabolome. Four upregulated lipid metabolites may serve as biomarkers for damage induced by confined environments, and certain gut microbiota alterations, such as those involving <i>Faecalibacterium</i> and <i>Bacteroides</i>, could be potential psychobiotics or therapeutic targets for enhancing mental health in a confined environment.",Nutrients,2024,Xin Song; Ziying Wang; Yongjun Xia; Zheng Chen; Guangqiang Wang; Yijin Yang; Beiwei Zhu; Lianzhong Ai; Haodan Xu; Chuan Wang
39335452,Prior Appendicectomy and Gut Microbiota Re-Establishment in Adults after Bowel Preparation and Colonoscopy.,"Emerging evidence suggests that the human vermiform appendix is not a vestigial organ but rather an immunological organ of biological relevance. It is hypothesised that the appendix acts as a bacterial 'safe house' for commensal gut bacteria and facilitates re-inoculation of the colon after disruption through the release of biofilms. To date, no studies have attempted to explore this potential mechanistic function of the appendix. We conducted a pre-post intervention study in adults (n = 59) exploring re-establishment of the gut microbiota in those with and without an appendix after colonic disruption via bowel preparation and colonoscopy. Gut microbiota composition was measured one week before and one month after bowel preparation and colonoscopy using 16S rRNA sequencing. We observed between group differences in gut microbiota composition between those with (n = 45) and without (n = 13) an appendix at baseline. These differences were no longer evident one-month post-procedure, suggesting that this procedure may have 'reset' any potential appendix-related differences between groups. Both groups experienced reductions in gut microbiota richness and shifts in beta diversity post-procedure, with greater changes in those without an appendix, and there were five bacterial genera whose re-establishment post-procedure appeared to be moderated by appendicectomy status. This small experimental study provides preliminary evidence of a potential differential re-establishment of the gut microbiota after disruption in those with and without an appendix, warranting further investigation into the potential role of the appendix as a microbial safe house.",Biomedicines,2024,Amelia J McGuinness; Martin O'Hely; Douglas Stupart; David Watters; Samantha L Dawson; Christopher Hair; Michael Berk; Mohammadreza Mohebbi; Amy Loughman; Glenn Guest; Felice N Jacka
39260135,Microbiota-gut-brain axis: Natural antidepressants molecular mechanism.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a severe mental health condition characterized by persistent depression, impaired cognition, and reduced activity. Increasing evidence suggests that gut microbiota (GM) imbalance is closely linked to the emergence and advancement of MDD, highlighting the potential significance of regulating the ""Microbiota-Gut-Brain"" (MGB) axis to impact the development of MDD. Natural products (NPs), characterized by broad biological activities, low toxicity, and multi-target characteristics, offer unique advantages in antidepressant treatment by regulating MGB axis.This review was aimed to explore the intricate relationship between the GM and the brain, as well as host responses, and investigated the mechanisms underlying the MGB axis in MDD development. It also explored the pharmacological mechanisms by which NPs modulate MGB axis to exert antidepressant effects and addressed current research limitations. Additionally, it proposed new strategies for future preclinical and clinical applications in the MDD domain.To study the effects and mechanism by which NPs exert antidepressant effects through mediating the MGB axis, data were collected from Web of Science, PubMed, ScienceDirect from initial establishment to March 2024. NPs were classified and summarized by their mechanisms of action.NPs, such as flavonoids,alkaloids,polysaccharides,saponins, terpenoids, can treat MDD by regulating the MGB axis. Its mechanism includes balancing GM, regulating metabolites and neurotransmitters such as SCAFs, 5-HT, BDNF, inhibiting neuroinflammation, improving neural plasticity, and increasing neurogenesis.NPs display good antidepressant effects, and have potential value for clinical application in the prevention and treatment of MDD by regulating the MGB axis. However, in-depth study of the mechanisms by which antidepressant medications affect MGB axis will also require considerable effort in clinical and preclinical research, which is essential for the development of effective antidepressant treatments.",Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,2024,Yitong Lu; Xiaowen Yu; Zhongling Wang; Linghui Kong; Zhenyuan Jiang; Ruirui Shang; Xia Zhong; Shimeng Lv; Guangheng Zhang; Haonan Gao; Ni Yang
39092201,Stress and the gut-brain axis: an inflammatory perspective.,"The gut-brain axis (GBA) plays a dominant role in maintaining homeostasis as well as contributes to mental health maintenance. The pathways that underpin the axis expand from macroscopic interactions with the nervous system, to the molecular signals that include microbial metabolites, tight junction protein expression, or cytokines released during inflammation. The dysfunctional GBA has been repeatedly linked to the occurrence of anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors development. The importance of the inflammatory aspects of the altered GBA has recently been highlighted in the literature. Here we summarize current reports on GBA signaling which involves the immune response within the intestinal and blood-brain barrier (BBB). We also emphasize the effect of stress response on altering barriers' permeability, and the therapeutic potential of microbiota restoration by probiotic administration or microbiota transplantation, based on the latest animal studies. Most research performed on various stress models showed an association between anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors, dysbiosis of gut microbiota, and disruption of intestinal permeability with simultaneous changes in BBB integrity. It could be postulated that under stress conditions impaired communication across BBB may therefore represent a significant mechanism allowing the gut microbiota to affect brain functions.",Frontiers in molecular neuroscience,2024,Julia Morys; Andrzej Małecki; Marta Nowacka-Chmielewska
39339804,Balancing the Oral-Gut-Brain Axis with Diet.,"<b>Background:</b> The oral microbiota is the second largest microbial community in humans. It contributes considerably to microbial diversity and health effects, much like the gut microbiota. Despite physical and chemical barriers separating the oral cavity from the gastrointestinal tract, bidirectional microbial transmission occurs between the two regions, influencing overall host health. <b>Method:</b> This review explores the intricate interplay of the oral-gut-brain axis, highlighting the pivotal role of the oral microbiota in systemic health and ageing, and how it can be influenced by diet. <b>Results:</b> Recent research suggests a relationship between oral diseases, such as periodontitis, and gastrointestinal problems, highlighting the broader significance of the oral-gut axis in systemic diseases, as well as the oral-gut-brain axis in neurological disorders and mental health. Diet influences microbial diversity in the oral cavity and the gut. While certain diets/dietary components improve both gut and oral health, others, such as fermentable carbohydrates, can promote oral pathogens while boosting gut health. <b>Conclusions:</b> Understanding these dynamics is key for promoting a healthy oral-gut-brain axis through dietary interventions that support microbial diversity and mitigate age-related health risks.",Nutrients,2024,Rebecca Kerstens; Yong Zhi Ng; Sven Pettersson; Anusha Jayaraman
38922485,Characterization of Gut Microbiota in Rats and Rhesus Monkeys After Methamphetamine Self-administration.,"Methamphetamine (MA) is one of the most abused drugs globally, but the mechanism of its addiction remains unclear. Several animal studies have shown that the gut microbiota (GM) influences addictive behaviors, but the pattern of GM changes during addiction in animals of different species remains unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the association between dynamic changes in GM and MA self-administration acquisition among two classical mammals, rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) and rats, MA self-administration models. Male Sprague-Dawley rats and male rhesus monkeys were subjected to classical MA self-administration training, and fecal samples were collected before and after MA self-administration training, respectively. 16S rRNA sequencing was used for GM analyses. We found that GM changes were more pronounced in rats than in rhesus monkeys, as evidenced by more GM taxa producing significant differences before and after MA self-administration training in rats than in monkeys. We also found that the expression of the genus Clostridia_vadinBB60_group significantly decreased after MA self-administration training in both rats and rhesus monkeys. Lactobacillus changes were significantly negatively correlated with total MA uptake in rats (Pearson R =  - 0.666, p = 0.035; Spearman R =  - 0.721, p = 0.023), whereas its change was also highly negatively correlated with total MA uptake in rhesus monkeys (Pearson R =  - 0.882, p = 0.118; Spearman R =  - 1.000, p = 0.083), although this was not significant. These findings suggest that MA causes significant alterations in GM in both rhesus monkeys and rats and that the genus Lactobacillus might be a common therapeutic target for MA uptake prevention across the species.",Molecular neurobiology,2024,Li He; Jia-Hui Zhou; Huan Li; Wen-Lei Zhang; Tie-Qiao Liu; Hai-Feng Jiang; Rong-Wei Zhai; Xiao-Jie Zhang
38815661,Gut microbiota composition links to variation in functional domains across psychiatric disorders.,"Changes in microbial composition are observed in various psychiatric disorders, but their specificity to certain symptoms or processes remains unclear. This study explores the associations between the gut microbiota composition and the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) domains of functioning, representing symptom domains, specifically focusing on stress-related and neurodevelopmental disorders in patients with and without psychiatric comorbidity.The gut microbiota was analyzed in 369 participants, comprising 272 individuals diagnosed with a mood disorder, anxiety disorder, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and/or substance use disorder, as well as 97 psychiatrically unaffected individuals. The RDoC domains were estimated using principal component analysis (PCA) with oblique rotation on a range of psychiatric, psychological, and personality measures. Associations between the gut microbiota and the functional domains were assessed using multiple linear regression and permanova, adjusted for age, sex, diet, smoking, medication use and comorbidity status.Four functional domains, aligning with RDoC's negative valence, social processes, cognitive systems, and arousal/regulatory systems domains, were identified. Significant associations were found between these domains and eight microbial genera, including associations of negative valence with the abundance of the genera Sellimonas, CHKCI001, Clostridium sensu stricto 1, Oscillibacter, and Flavonifractor; social processes with Sellimonas; cognitive systems with Sporobacter and Hungatella; and arousal/regulatory systems with Ruminococcus torques (all p<sub>FDR</sub> < 0.05).Our findings demonstrate associations between the gut microbiota and the domains of functioning across patients and unaffected individuals, potentially mediated by immune-related processes. These results open avenues for microbiota-focused personalized interventions, considering psychiatric comorbidity. However, further research is warranted to establish causality and elucidate mechanistic pathways.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2024,Danique Mulder; Babette Jakobi; Yingjie Shi; Peter Mulders; Josina D Kist; Rose M Collard; Janna N Vrijsen; Phillip van Eijndhoven; Indira Tendolkar; Mirjam Bloemendaal; Alejandro Arias Vasquez
38892525,Is the Mediterranean Low Fodmap Diet Effective in Managing Irritable Bowel Syndrome Symptoms and Gut Microbiota? An Innovative Research Protocol.,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms can be effectively managed with the low FODMAP diet. However, its efficacy in reducing inflammation is not yet proven. On the contrary, the Mediterranean diet has anti-inflammatory properties with proven efficacy in treating chronic low-grade inflammation-related diseases.To publicly share our protocol evaluating the efficacy of the Mediterranean low-FODMAP (MED-LFD) versus NICE recommendations (British National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) diet in managing IBS symptoms and quality of life.Participants meeting the Rome IV criteria will be randomly assigned to MED-LFD or NICE recommendations and they will be followed for six months. Efficacy, symptom relief, quality of life and mental health will be assessed using validated questionnaires. In addition, fecal samples will be analyzed to assess gut microbiota, and to measure branched and short-chain fatty acids, and volatile organic compounds (metabolic byproducts from bacteria). Expected results and discussion: By publicly sharing this clinical study protocol, we aim to improve research quality in the field of IBS management by allowing for peer review feedback, preventing data manipulation, reducing redundant research efforts, mitigating publication bias, and empowering patient decision-making. We expect that this protocol will show that MED-LFD can effectively alleviate IBS symptoms and it will provide pathophysiology insights on its efficacy. The new dietary pattern that combines the LFD and the MED approaches allows for the observation of the synergistic action of both diets, with the MED's anti-inflammatory and prebiotic properties enhancing the effects of the LFD while minimizing its limitations.

38869657,"Effects of Bifidobacterium breve 207-1 on regulating lifestyle behaviors and mental wellness in healthy adults based on the microbiome-gut-brain axis: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.","Our study aimed to explore the efficacy of Bifidobacterium breve 207-1 on specific neurotransmitters and hormones and the ability to regulate lifestyle behaviors in healthy adults.In total, 120 healthy adults with high mental stress, overweight, insomnia, and constipation were randomly assigned to receive low-dose B. breve 207-1 (LD, n = 40), high-dose B. breve 207-1 (HD, n = 40), or placebo (n = 40) for 28 days. Fecal and blood samples were collected and questionnaires were answered before and after the trial. Neurotransmitters and serum hormones were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The gut microbiota composition was assessed using 16 S rRNA sequencing. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) concentrations were determined via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).The primary outcome of our study was changes in mental wellness, including neurotransmitters, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrena (HPA) axis hormones, and the psychological scales. The results showed that γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) increased significantly and the HPA axis hormones were suppressed overall in the probiotic groups while 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) did not change significantly. However, there was no significant change in mood scale scores. The secondary outcome focused on the ability of 207-1 to regulate the body and lifestyle of healthy adults (e.g., sleep, diet, exercise, etc.). The PSQI scores in the probiotics groups significantly decreased, indicating improved sleep quality. Meanwhile, the probiotic groups had a slight increase in exercise consumption while dietary intake stabilized. By physical examination, the participants showed weight loss although no statistically significant difference was observed between the groups. Then, validated by gut microbiota, changes in the gut microbiota were observed under the effective intervention of 207-1 while short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) increased in the LD group, particularly acetic and propionic acids. There was a slight decrease in alpha-diversity in the HD group.Bifidobacterium breve 207-1 entered the organism and affected neurotransmitter and the HPA axis hormone levels via the microbiome-gut-brain axis. Meanwhile, 207-1 supplementation improved daily lifestyle behaviors in healthy adults, which may in turn lead to changes in their bodies (e.g. weight and lipid metabolism). However, this study did not find significant mood-modulating efficacy. The mechanism of the overall study is unclear, but we hypothesize that SCFAs may be the key pathway, and more experiments are needed for validation in the future.This trial was retrospectively registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry under the accession number ChiCTR2300069453 on March 16, 2023.",European journal of nutrition,2024,Jinxing Li; Yapeng Li; Jincheng Zhao; Liang Li; Yunyi Wang; Fei Chen; Yuchen Li; Ruyue Cheng; Fang He; Xiaolei Ze; Xi Shen
38889540,Treating chronic stress and chronic pain by manipulating gut microbiota with diet: can we kill two birds with one stone?,"<b>Background:</b> Chronic stress and chronic pain are closely linked by the capacity to exacerbate each other, sharing common roots in the brain and in the gut. The strict intersection between these two neurological diseases makes important to have a therapeutic strategy aimed at preventing both to maintain mental health in patients. Diet is an modifiable lifestyle factor associated with gut-brain axis diseases and there is growing interest in its use as adjuvant to main therapies. Several evidence attest the impact of specific diets or nutrients on chronic stress-related disorders and pain with a good degree of certainty. A daily adequate intake of foods containing micronutrients such as amino acids, minerals and vitamins, as well as the reduction in the consumption of processed food products can have a positive impact on microbiota and gut health. Many nutrients are endowed of prebiotic, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and neuroprotective potential which make them useful tools helping the management of chronic stress and pain in patients. Dietary regimes, as intermittent fasting or caloric restriction, are promising, although further studies are needed to optimize protocols according to patient's medical history, age and sex. Moreover, by supporting gut microbiota health with diet is possible to attenuate comorbidities such as obesity, gastrointestinal dysfunction and mood disorders, thus reducing healthcare costs related to chronic stress or pain.<b>Objective:</b> This review summarize the most recent evidence on the microbiota-mediated beneficial effects of macro- and micronutrients, dietary-related factors, specific nutritional regimens and dietary intervention on these pathological conditions.",Nutritional neuroscience,2024,Alessia Costa; Elena Lucarini
39237483,Temperament in Early Childhood Is Associated With Gut Microbiota Composition and Diversity.,"Temperament is a key predictor of human mental health and cognitive and emotional development. Although human fear behavior is reportedly associated with gut microbiome in infancy, infant gut microbiota changes dramatically during the first 5 years, when the diversity and composition of gut microbiome are established. This period is crucial for the development of the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in emotion regulation. Therefore, this study investigated the relationship between temperament and gut microbiota in 284 preschool children aged 3-4 years. Child temperament was assessed by maternal reports of the Children's Behavior Questionnaire. Gut microbiota (alpha/beta diversity and genera abundance) was evaluated using 16S rRNA sequencing of stool samples. A low abundance of anti-inflammatory bacteria (e.g., Faecalibacterium) and a high abundance of pro-inflammatory bacteria (e.g., Eggerthella, Flavonifractor) were associated with higher negative emotionality and stress response (i.e., negative affectivity, β = -0.17, p = 0.004) and lower positive emotionality and reward-seeking (i.e., surgency/extraversion, β = 0.15, p = 0.013). Additionally, gut microbiota diversity was associated with speed of response initiation (i.e., impulsivity, a specific aspect of surgency/extraversion, β = 0.16, p = 0.008). This study provides insight into the biological mechanisms of temperament and takes important steps toward identifying predictive markers of psychological/emotional risk.",Developmental psychobiology,2024,Eriko Ueda; Michiko Matsunaga; Hideaki Fujihara; Takamasa Kajiwara; Aya K Takeda; Satoshi Watanabe; Keisuke Hagihara; Masako Myowa
38801922,The impact of depression-mediated gut microbiota composition on Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Mendelian study.,"This study uses a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to delineate the causal influence of gut microbiota on the occurrence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), concurrently assessing the potential mediating function of depression within this framework.Several two-sample MR methods were used to assess the causal repercussions of gut microbiota on the onset of both IBS and depression. Following this, gut microbiota and depression, which demonstrated notable causal associations, were integrated as exposure variables in a multivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR) framework to construct a model encompassing gut microbiota, depression, and IBS. Mediation effects were assessed by examining the indirect pathway of gut microbiota → depression → IBS.Two-sample MR analysis unveiled a statistically significant causal association (P < 0.05) between specific bacterial group within the gut microbiota, notably p_Actinobacteria(OR = 0.829225), c_Clostridia(OR = 0.798897), s_Desulfovibrio_piger(OR = 1.163912), g_Streptococcus(OR = 1.132735), c_Actinobacteria(OR = 0.829224), and the onset of IBS. In the MVMR analysis, the relationship between depression and IBS was significant across Model 3, Model 7, Model 8, and Model 13 (P < 0.05). Assessment of mediation effects revealed that c_Clostridia and o_Clostridiales indirectly impacted IBS through depression, with masking effect ratios of 168.46 % and 168.44 %, respectively.These findings underscore a resilient causal association between the composition of gut microbiota and the initiation of IBS. Furthermore, depression serves as a mediator for particular groups of gut bacteria, thereby contributing to the development of IBS. These observations imply that interventions targeting mental health may potentially alleviate the risk of IBS onset attributable to adverse configurations of gut microbiota.",Journal of affective disorders,2024,Yi Huang; Endian Zheng; Mei Hu; Xinxin Yang; Qiaoli Lan; Yingcong Yu; Beibei Xu
38848976,Deciphering the gut microbiota's (Coprococcus and Subdoligranulum) impact on depression: Network pharmacology and molecular dynamics simulation.,"Depression, a prevalent mental health condition, significantly impacts global mental impairment rates. While antidepressants are commonly used, treatment-resistant depression (TRD) poses a challenge. Emerging research highlights the role of the gut microbiota in depression through the gut-brain axis. This study identifies key genes associated with depression influenced by specific gut microbiota, Coprococcus and Subdoligranulum. Using bioinformatics tools, potential targets were elucidated, and molecular docking studies were performed. Furthermore, gene expression analysis identified hub-genes related to depression, intersecting with metabolite targets. Protein-protein interaction analysis revealed pivotal targets such as PTGS2 and MMP9. Molecular docking demonstrated 3-Indolepropionic acid's superior affinity over (R)-3-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)lactate. Physicochemical properties and toxicity profiles were compared, suggesting favorable attributes for 3-Indolepropionic acid. Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed stability and interactions of compounds with target proteins. This comprehensive approach sheds light on the complex interplay between gut microbiota, genes, and depression, emphasizing the potential for microbiota-targeted interventions in mental health management.","Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior",2024,Sarvesh Sabarathinam

Therefore, this study aimed to characterize differences in self-reported symptoms, gut microbiota composition, and wellbeing (i.e., sleep quality, mood, and physical (PHQ) and mental wellbeing) between athletes with and without GI symptoms. In addition, we assessed the potential impact of a 3-week multi-ingredient fermented whey supplement in the GI complaints group, without a control group, on the gut microbiota and self-reported GI symptoms and wellbeing. A total of 50 athletes (24.7 ± 4.5 years) with GI issues (GI group at baseline, GI-B) and 21 athletes (25.4 ± 5.3 years) without GI issues (non-GI group, NGI) were included. At baseline, there was a significant difference in the total gastrointestinal symptom rating scale (GSRS) score (24.1 ± 8.48 vs. 30.3 ± 8.82, <i>p</i> = 0.008) and a trend difference in PHQ (33.9 ± 10.7 vs. 30.3 ± 8.82, <i>p</i> = 0.081), but no differences (<i>p</i> > 0.05) were seen for other outcomes, including gut microbiota metrics, between groups. After 3-week supplementation, the GI group (GI-S) showed increased <i>Bifidobacterium</i> relative abundance (<i>p</i> < 0.05), reported a lower number of severe GI complaints (from 72% to 54%, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and PHQ declined (<i>p</i> = 0.010). In conclusion, well-trained athletes with GI complaints reported more severe GI symptoms than an athletic reference group, without showing clear differences in wellbeing or microbiota composition.

39063241,Opioid Use and Gut Dysbiosis in Cancer Pain Patients.,"Opioids are commonly used for the management of severe chronic cancer pain. Their well-known pharmacological effects on the gastrointestinal system, particularly opioid-induced constipation (OIC), are the most common limiting factors in the optimization of analgesia, and have led to the wide use of laxatives and/or peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonists (PAMORAs). A growing interest has been recently recorded in the possible effects of opioid treatment on the gut microbiota. Preclinical and clinical data, as presented in this review, showed that alterations of the gut microbiota play a role in modulating opioid-mediated analgesia and tolerability, including constipation. Moreover, due to the bidirectional crosstalk between gut bacteria and the central nervous system, gut dysbiosis may be crucial in modulating opioid reward and addictive behavior. The microbiota may also modulate pain regulation and tolerance, by activating microglial cells and inducing the release of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which sustain neuroinflammation. In the subset of cancer patients, the clinical meaning of opioid-induced gut dysbiosis, particularly its possible interference with the efficacy of chemotherapy and immunotherapy, is still unclear. Gut dysbiosis could be a new target for treatment in cancer patients. Restoring the physiological amount of specific gut bacteria may represent a promising therapeutic option for managing gastrointestinal symptoms and optimizing analgesia for cancer patients using opioids.",International journal of molecular sciences,2024,Flaminia Coluzzi; Maria Sole Scerpa; Chiara Loffredo; Marina Borro; Joseph V Pergolizzi; Jo Ann LeQuang; Elisa Alessandri; Maurizio Simmaco; Monica Rocco

The literature search for this review was conducted using PubMed and Scopus, employing keywords and phrases related to maternal stress, ethanol exposure, gut microbiota, microbiome, gut-brain axis, diet, dysbiosis, progesterone, placenta, prenatal development, immunity, inflammation, and depression to identify relevant studies in both preclinical and human research. Only a limited number of reviews were included to support the arguments. The search encompassed studies from the 1990s to the present. This review begins by exploring the role of microbiota in modulating host health and disease. It then examines how disturbances in maternal microbiota can affect the offspring's immune system. The analysis continues by investigating the interplay between stress and dysbiosis, focusing on how prenatal maternal stress influences both maternal and offspring microbiota and its implications for susceptibility to depression. The review also considers the impact of ethanol consumption on gut dysbiosis, with an emphasis on the effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on both maternal and offspring microbiota. Finally, it is suggested that maternal gut microbiota dysbiosis may be significantly exacerbated by the combined effects of stress and ethanol exposure, leading to immune system dysfunction and chronic inflammation, which could increase the risk of depression in the offspring. These interactions underscore the potential for novel mental health interventions that address the gut-brain axis, especially in relation to maternal and offspring health.",International journal of molecular sciences,2024,Rosana Camarini; Priscila Marianno; Maylin Hanampa-Maquera; Samuel Dos Santos Oliveira; Niels Olsen Saraiva Câmara
38776563,Microbiota-brain axis: Exploring the role of gut microbiota in psychiatric disorders - A comprehensive review.,"Mental illness is a hidden epidemic in modern science that has gradually spread worldwide. According to estimates from the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 10% of the world's population suffers from various mental diseases each year. Worldwide, financial and health burdens on society are increasing annually. Therefore, understanding the different factors that can influence mental illness is required to formulate novel and effective treatments and interventions to combat mental illness. Gut microbiota, consisting of diverse microbial communities residing in the gastrointestinal tract, exert profound effects on the central nervous system through the gut-brain axis. The gut-brain axis serves as a conduit for bidirectional communication between the two systems, enabling the gut microbiota to affect emotional and cognitive functions. Dysbiosis, or an imbalance in the gut microbiota, is associated with an increased susceptibility to mental health disorders and psychiatric illnesses. Gut microbiota is one of the most diverse and abundant groups of microbes that have been found to interact with the central nervous system and play important physiological functions in the human gut, thus greatly affecting the development of mental illnesses. The interaction between gut microbiota and mental health-related illnesses is a multifaceted and promising field of study.

39027446,Potential role of gut microbiota in major depressive disorder: A review.,"Interactions between the gut microbiota and host immunity are sophisticated, dynamic, and host-dependent. Scientists have recently conducted research showing that disturbances in the gut bacterial community can lead to a decrease in some metabolites and, consequently, to behaviors such as depression. Exposure to stressors dropped the relative abundance of bacteria in the genus <i>Bacteroides</i> while soaring the relative abundance of bacteria in the genus <i>Clostridium</i>, <i>Coprococcus</i>, <i>Dialister</i>, and Oscillibacter, <i>which</i> were also reduced in people with depression. Microbiota and innate immunity are in a bilateral relationship. The gut microbiota has been shown to induce the synthesis of antimicrobial proteins such as catalysidins, type C lectins, and defensins. Probiotic bacteria can modulate depressive behavior through GABA signaling. The gut microbiome produces essential metabolites such as neurotransmitters, tryptophan metabolites, and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that can act on the CNS. In the case of dysbiosis, due to mucin changes, the ratio of intestinal-derived molecules may change and contribute to depression. Psychotropics, including <i>Bifidobacterium longum</i> NCC3001, <i>Clostridium butyricum</i> CBM588, and <i>Lactobacillus acidophilus,</i> have mental health benefits, and can have a positive effect on the host-brain relationship, and have antidepressant effects. This article reviews current studies on the association between gut microbiota dysbiosis and depression. Comprehensively, these findings could potentially lead to novel approaches to improving depressive symptoms via gut microbiota alterations, including probiotics, prebiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation.",Heliyon,2024,Mansoor Khaledi; Fatemeh Sameni; Abolfazl Gholipour; Shahnaz Shahrjerdi; Reza Golmohammadi; Hadi Esmaeili Gouvarchin Ghaleh; Behnam Poureslamfar; Jaber Hemmati; Niloofar Mobarezpour; Yaser Eshaghi Milasi; Fatemeh Rad; Mahtab Mehboodi; Parviz Owlia

SD status was evaluated using the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Beck Depression Inventory 2nd version (BDI-II), the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scales of Depression (HAMD-17), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Metagenomic sequencing was utilized to identify fecal microbial profiles. Dietary patterns were discerned via factor analysis of a 25-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Logistic regression analysis and mediation analysis were performed to explore the potential links between gut microbiota, dietary patterns, and incident SD.Data on dietary habits were available for 292 participants (mean [SD] age, 22.1 [2.9] years; 216 [73.9 %] female). Logistic regression analysis revealed that dietary patterns Ⅰ (odds ratio [OR], 0.34; 95 % CI, 0.15-0.75) and IV (OR, 0.39; 95 % CI, 0.17-0.86 and OR, 0.39; 95 % CI, 0.18-0.84) were associated with reduced risk of SD. Distinct microbial profiles were observed in young adults with SD, marked by increased microbial diversity and taxonomic alterations.

In the present work, we describe some nutrigenomic effects of dietary fiber, phenolic compounds (plant secondary metabolites), and fatty acids on mental health outcomes, with emphasis on their possible interactions with genetic and epigenetic aspects. Prebiotics, through their effects on the gut microbiota, have been associated with modulation in the neuroendocrine response to stress and the facilitation of the processing of positive emotions. Some of the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms include the serotonin neurotransmitter system (<i>TPH1</i> gene) and the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (inhibition of histone deacetylases). The consumption of phenolic compounds exerts a positive role in neurocognitive domains. The evidence showing the involvement of genetic and epigenetic factors comes mainly from animal models, highlighting the role of epigenetic mechanisms through miRNAs and methyltransferases as well as the effect on the expression of apoptotic-related genes. Long-chain <i>n</i>-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA) have been mainly related to psychotic and mood disorders, but the genetic and epigenetic evidence is scarce. Studies on the genetic and epigenetic basis of these interactions need to be promoted to move towards a precision and personalized approach to medicine.",Nutrients,2024,Mariane Lutz; Pablo R Moya; Sofía Gallorio; Ulises Ríos; Marcelo Arancibia
39029984,Therapeutic potential of CBD in Autism Spectrum Disorder.,"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and interaction, as well as restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior. Despite extensive research, effective pharmacological interventions for ASD remain limited. Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychotomimetic compound of the Cannabis sativa plant, has potential therapeutic effects on several neurological and psychiatric disorders. CBD interacts with the endocannabinoid system, a complex cell-signaling system that plays a crucial role in regulating various physiological processes, maintaining homeostasis, participating in social and behavioral processing, and neuronal development and maturation with great relevance to ASD. Furthermore, preliminary findings from clinical trials indicate that CBD may have a modulatory effect on specific ASD symptoms and comorbidities in humans. Interestingly, emerging evidence suggests that CBD may influence the gut microbiota, with implications for the bidirectional communication between the gut and the central nervous system. CBD is a safe drug with low induction of side effects. As it has a multi-target pharmacological profile, it becomes a candidate compound for treating the central symptoms and comorbidities of ASD.",International review of neurobiology,2024,João F C Pedrazzi; Lucas Hassib; Frederico R Ferreira; Jaime C Hallak; Elaine Del-Bel; José A Crippa
39426041,"Comparative analysis of gut microbiota in major depressive disorder and schizophrenia during hospitalisation - the case-control, post hoc study.","The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between gut microbiota and major depressive disorder (MDD) and schizophrenia (SCZ) by comparing 36 inpatients with these conditions to 29 healthy controls (HC) matched for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI). Individuals with SCZ exhibited greater microbiota richness compared to HC (FDR P(Q)=0.028). Taxonomically, while no significant differences were observed between the microbiota of MDD and SCZ patients in a head-to-head comparison, both patient groups differed significantly when compared to HC. Interestingly, besides common patterns (such as a higher abundance of Erysipelotrichaceae UCG-003 and Streptococcus, and a lower abundance of Lachnospiraceae ND3007 group), unique patterns were exhibited only in MDD (with a higher abundance of Anaerostipes, Q=0.004) or SCZ (with a higher abundance of Sutterella, Q=0.001, and a lower abundance of Clostridium sensu stricto 1, Q=0.002). The Random Forest algorithm identified Ruminococcus torques group, Lachnospiraceae UCG-001, and Erysipelotrichaceae UCG-003 as highly discriminative features for both SCZ and MDD, while Suturella and Holdemania were unique features for SZC, and Lachnospiraceae genus CAG-56 and Anaerostipes for MDD. Additionally, between 50 % and 60 % of the differentially abundant taxa were found among the top 10 influential features in the RF models. In conclusion, while no significant differences were found between the microbiota of MDD and SCZ patients, distinct microbial patterns were found in each group when compared to HC. The study did not confirm universal microbial biomarkers reported in other studies but showed that the observed differences concern the bacteria associated with inflammation, the production of short chain fatty acids (SCFA), and the synthesis of metabolites linked to mental health (lactic acid, gamma-aminobutyric acid - GABA). The application of machine learning holds promise for further understanding the complex relationship between microbiota and these psychiatric disorders. The observed results should be treated with caution due to the limitations of this study (mainly sample size), therefore further researches under standardized environmental conditions with consistent analytical and bioinformatics approaches are warranted.",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2024,Agata Misera; Mariusz Kaczmarczyk; Igor Łoniewski; Paweł Liśkiewicz; Konrad Podsiadło; Błażej Misiak; Karolina Skonieczna-Żydecka; Jerzy Samochowiec
38983862,Current landscape of fecal microbiota transplantation in treating depression.,"Depression, projected to be the predominant contributor to the global disease burden, is a complex condition with diverse symptoms including mood disturbances and cognitive impairments. Traditional treatments such as medication and psychotherapy often fall short, prompting the pursuit of alternative interventions. Recent research has highlighted the significant role of gut microbiota in mental health, influencing emotional and neural regulation. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), the infusion of fecal matter from a healthy donor into the gut of a patient, emerges as a promising strategy to ameliorate depressive symptoms by restoring gut microbial balance. The microbial-gut-brain (MGB) axis represents a critical pathway through which to potentially rectify dysbiosis and modulate neuropsychiatric outcomes. Preclinical studies reveal that FMT can enhance neurochemicals and reduce inflammatory markers, thereby alleviating depressive behaviors. Moreover, FMT has shown promise in clinical settings, improving gastrointestinal symptoms and overall quality of life in patients with depression. The review highlights the role of the gut-brain axis in depression and the need for further research to validate the long-term safety and efficacy of FMT, identify specific therapeutic microbial strains, and develop targeted microbial modulation strategies. Advancing our understanding of FMT could revolutionize depression treatment, shifting the paradigm toward microbiome-targeting therapies.",Frontiers in immunology,2024,Qi Zhang; Yajun Bi; Boyu Zhang; Qiong Jiang; Chao Kam Mou; Lelin Lei; Yibo Deng; Yutong Li; Jing Yu; Wei Liu; Jinzhu Zhao
39015337,Investigations of microbiota composition and neuroactive pathways in association with symptoms of stress and depression in a cohort of healthy women.,"Despite mounting evidence of gut-brain involvement in psychiatric conditions, functional data remain limited, and analyses of other microbial niches, such as the vaginal microbiota, are lacking in relation to mental health. This aim of this study was to investigate if the connections between the gut microbiome and mental health observed in populations with a clinical diagnosis of mental illness extend to healthy women experiencing stress and depressive symptoms. Additionally, this study examined the functional pathways of the gut microbiota according to the levels of psychological symptoms. Furthermore, the study aimed to explore potential correlations between the vaginal microbiome and mental health parameters in young women without psychiatric diagnoses.In this cross-sectional study, 160 healthy Danish women (aged 18-40 years) filled out questionnaires with validated scales measuring symptoms of stress and depression and frequency of dietary intake. Fecal and vaginal microbiota samples were collected at the beginning of the menstrual cycle and vaginal samples were also collected at cycle day 8-12 and 18-22. Shotgun metagenomic profiling of the gut and vaginal microbiome was performed. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) was used for functional profiling and 56 Gut Brain Modules were analyzed in the fecal samples.The relative abundance in the gut of the genera <i>Escherichia</i>, <i>Parabacteroides</i>, and <i>Shigella</i> was higher in women with elevated depressive symptoms. Women with high perceived stress showed a tendency of increased abundance of <i>Escherichia</i>, <i>Shigella</i>, and <i>Blautia</i>. Amongst others, the potentially pathogenic genera, Escherichia and Shigella correlate with alterations in the neuroactive pathways such as the glutamatergic, GABAeric, dopaminergic, and Kynurenine pathways. Vaginosis symptoms were more prevalent in women reporting high levels of stress and depressive symptoms.The findings of this study support the concept of a microbiota-associated effect on the neuroactive pathways even in healthy young women. This suggest, that targeting the gut microbiome could be a promising approach for future psychiatric interventions.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2024,Zahra Bashir; Luisa W Hugerth; Maria Christine Krog; Stefanie Prast-Nielsen; Gabriella Edfeldt; Fredrik Boulund; Simon Rønnow Schacht; Inge Tetens; Lars Engstrand; Ina Schuppe-Koistinen; Emma Fransson; Henriette Svarre Nielsen
39134099,Contrasting the pharmacokinetic performance and gut microbiota effects of an amorphous solid dispersion and lipid nanoemulsion for a poorly water-soluble anti-psychotic.,"Increasing attention is being afforded to understanding the bidirectional relationship that exists between oral drugs and the gut microbiota. Often overlooked, however, is the impact that pharmaceutical excipients exert on the gut microbiota. Subsequently, in this study, we contrasted the pharmacokinetic performance and gut microbiota interactions between two commonly employed formulations for poorly soluble compounds, namely 1) an amorphous solid dispersion (ASD) stabilised by poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) K-30, and 2) a lipid nanoemulsion (LNE) comprised of medium chain glycerides and lecithin. The poorly soluble antipsychotic, lurasidone, was formulated with ASD and LNE due to its rate-limiting dissolution, poor oral bioavailability, and significant food effect. Both the ASD and LNE were shown to facilitate lurasidone supersaturation within in vitro dissolution studies simulating the gastrointestinal environment. This translated into profound improvements in oral pharmacokinetics in rats, with the ASD and LNE exerting comparable ∼ 2.5-fold improvements in lurasidone bioavailability, compared to the pure drug. The oral formulations imparted contrasting effects on the gut microbiota, with the LNE depleting the richness and abundance of the microbial ecosystem, as evidenced through reductions in alpha diversity (Chao1 index) and operational taxonomical units (OTUs). In contrast, the ASD exerted a 'gut neutral' effect, whereby a mild enrichment of alpha diversity and OTUs was observed. Importantly, this suggests that ASDs are effective solubility-enhancing formulations that can be used without comprising the integrity of the gut microbiota - an integral consideration in the treatment of mental health disorders, such as schizophrenia, due to the role of the gut microbiota in regulating mood and cognition.",European journal of pharmaceutics and biopharmaceutics : official journal of Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Pharmazeutische Verfahrenstechnik e.V,2024,Tahlia R Meola; Srinivas Kamath; Aurelia S Elz; Clive A Prestidge; Anthony Wignall; Paul Joyce
39021622,Baseline gut microbiota profiles affect treatment response in patients with depression.,"The role of the gut microbiota in the pathophysiology of depression has been explored in numerous studies, which have confirmed that the baseline gut microbial profiles of patients with depression differ from those of healthy individuals. The gut microbiome affects metabolic activity in the immune and central nervous systems and regulates intestinal ecology through the neuroendocrine system. Additionally, baseline changes in the gut microbiota differed among patients with depression who demonstrated varying treatment response. Currently, probiotics are an emerging treatment for depression; however, the efficacy of modulating the gut microbiota in the treatment of depression remains uncertain. Additionally, the mechanisms by which changes in the gut microbiota affect treatment response in patients with depression remain unclear. In this review, we aimed to summarize the differences in the baseline gut microbiota between the remission and non-remission groups after antidepressant therapy. Additionally, we summarized the possible mechanisms that may contribute to antidepressant resistance through the effects of the gut microbiome on the immune and nervous systems, various enzymes, bioaccumulation, and blood-brain barrier, and provide a basis for treating depression by targeting the gut microbiota.",Frontiers in microbiology,2024,Yingjing Xie; Hanwen Zhu; Yanling Yuan; Xuan Guan; Qinglian Xie; Zaiquan Dong
39203794,Effects of Physical Exercise on the Microbiota in Irritable Bowel Syndrome.,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a prevalent functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, and constipation. Recent studies have underscored the significant role of the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBS. Physical exercise, as a non-pharmacological intervention, has been proposed to alleviate IBS symptoms by modulating the gut microbiota. Aerobic exercise, such as running, swimming, and cycling, has been shown to enhance the diversity and abundance of beneficial gut bacteria, including Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. These bacteria produce short-chain fatty acids that possess anti-inflammatory properties and support gut barrier integrity. Studies involving IBS patients participating in structured aerobic exercise programs have reported significant improvements in their gut microbiota's composition and diversity, alongside an alleviation of symptoms like abdominal pain and bloating. Additionally, exercise positively influences mental health by reducing stress and improving mood, which can further relieve IBS symptoms via the gut-brain axis. Long-term exercise interventions provide sustained benefits, maintaining the gut microbiota's diversity and stability, supporting immune functions, and reducing systemic inflammation. However, exercise programs must be tailored to individual needs to avoid exacerbating IBS symptoms. Personalized exercise plans starting with low-to-moderate intensity and gradually increasing in intensity can maximize the benefits and minimize risks. This review examines the impact of various types and intensities of physical exercise on the gut microbiota in IBS patients, highlighting the need for further studies to explore optimal exercise protocols. Future research should include larger sample sizes, longer follow-up periods, and examine the synergistic effects of exercise and other lifestyle modifications. Integrating physical exercise into comprehensive IBS management plans can enhance symptom control and improve patients' quality of life.",Nutrients,2024,Chunpeng Li; Jianmin Li; Qiaorui Zhou; Can Wang; Jiahui Hu; Chang Liu
39065244,Gut Microbiota Composition Is Causally Linked to Multiple Sclerosis: A Mendelian Randomization Analysis.,"Accumulating evidence links the microbial communities inhabiting the gut to the pathophysiological processes underlying multiple sclerosis (MS). However, most studies on the microbiome in MS are correlative in nature, thus being at risk of confounding and reverse causality. Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses allow the estimation of the causal relationship between a risk factor and an outcome of interest using genetic variants as proxies for environmental exposures. Here, we performed a two-sample MR to assess the causality between the gut microbiome and MS. We extracted genetic instruments from summary statistics from three large genome-wide association studies (GWASs) on the gut microbiome (18,340, 8959, and 7738 subjects). The exposure data were derived from the latest GWAS on MS susceptibility (47,429 patients and 68,374 controls). We pinpointed several microbial strains whose abundance is linked with enhanced MS risk (<i>Actinobacteria</i> class, <i>Bifidobacteriaceae</i> family, <i>Lactobacillus</i> genus) or protection (<i>Prevotella</i> spp., <i>Lachnospiranaceae</i> genus, <i>Negativibacillus</i> genus). The largest risk effect was seen for <i>Ruminococcus Torques</i> (OR, 2.89, 95% C.I. 1.67-5, <i>p</i> = 1.51 × 10<sup>-4</sup>), while <i>Akkermansia municiphila</i> emerged as strongly protective (OR, 0.43, 95% C.I. 0.32-0.57, <i>p</i> = 1.37 × 10<sup>-8</sup>). Our findings support a causal relationship between the gut microbiome and MS susceptibility, reinforcing the relevance of the microbiome-gut-brain axis in disease etiology, opening wider perspectives on host-environmental interactions for MS prevention.",Microorganisms,2024,Valeria Zancan; Martina Nasello; Rachele Bigi; Roberta Reniè; Maria Chiara Buscarinu; Rosella Mechelli; Giovanni Ristori; Marco Salvetti; Gianmarco Bellucci
38903788,"Investigating the effects of radiation, T cell depletion, and bone marrow transplantation on murine gut microbiota.","Microbiome research has gained much attention in recent years as the importance of gut microbiota in regulating host health becomes increasingly evident. However, the impact of radiation on the microbiota in the murine bone marrow transplantation model is still poorly understood. In this paper, we present key findings from our study on how radiation, followed by bone marrow transplantation with or without T cell depletion, impacts the microbiota in the ileum and caecum. Our findings show that radiation has different effects on the microbiota of the two intestinal regions, with the caecum showing increased interindividual variation, suggesting an impaired ability of the host to regulate microbial symbionts, consistent with the Anna Karenina principle. Additionally, we observed changes in the ileum composition, including an increase in bacterial taxa that are important modulators of host health, such as <i>Akkermansia</i> and <i>Faecalibaculum</i>. In contrast, radiation in the caecum was associated with an increased abundance of several common commensal taxa in the gut, including <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> and <i>Bacteroides</i>. Finally, we found that high doses of radiation had more substantial effects on the caecal microbiota of the T-cell-depleted group than that of the non-T-cell-depleted group. Overall, our results contribute to a better understanding of the complex relationship between radiation and the gut microbiota in the context of bone marrow transplantation and highlight the importance of considering different intestinal regions when studying microbiome responses to environmental stressors.",Frontiers in microbiology,2024,Jakub Kreisinger; James Dooley; Kailash Singh; Dagmar Čížková; Lucie Schmiedová; Barbora Bendová; Adrian Liston; Alena Moudra
38875919,Antibiotic exposure and depression incidence: A cohort study of the Korean population.,"Recent research highlights the crucial role of the gut-brain axis in understanding depression etiologies. While burgeoning studies suggest an association between disruptions in gut microbiota and the development of depression, limited longitudinal studies have investigated this link. To address this gap, we conducted a retrospective cohort study using National Health Insurance Service-Health Screening Cohort (NHIS-HEALS) data in South Korea, involving 199,144 individuals aged 40-79. We examined the impact of cumulative antibiotic exposure (2004-2008) on subsequent depression incidence (2009-2013) by conducting Cox proportional hazards regressions. Our findings show an increasing depression risk with extended antibiotic exposure after adjusting for comorbidities and behavioral covariates. A broader antibiotic spectrum was associated with a higher depression risk. These trends persisted after adjusting for the original antibiotic indications. In conclusion, our study highlights the duration-dependent association between antibiotic exposure and increased depression risk, offering insights into depression etiologies and relevant novel therapeutic tools, and advocating for heightened antibiotic stewardship considering their impact on mental health.",Psychiatry research,2024,Jaewon Lee; Sun Jae Park; Seulggie Choi; Jooyoung Chang; Young Jun Park; Seogsong Jeong; Joung Sik Son; Gyeongsil Lee; Joseph C Ahn; Jihoon Andrew Kim; Sang Min Park
39125364,Maternal Fiber Intake and Perinatal Depression and Anxiety.,"(1) Background: Dietary fiber can significantly alter gut microbiota composition. The role of the gut microbiome in the Gut-Brain Axis and modulation of neuropsychiatric disease is increasingly recognized. The role of antenatal diet, particularly fiber intake, in mitigating maternal mental health disorders remains unexplored. The objective of this review is to investigate the association between maternal fiber intake and perinatal depression and anxiety (PDA). (2) Methods: A literature review of PubMed and Google Scholar was conducted using appropriate keyword/MeSH terms for pregnancy, diet, fiber, and mental health. Observational and clinical trials published between 2015 and 2021 were included and data pertaining to dietary patterns (DP), food intake, mental health, and demographic data were extracted. The top three fiber-containing food groups (FG) per study were identified using a sum rank scoring system of fiber per 100 g and fiber per serving size. The consumption of these top three fiber FGs was then ranked for each dietary pattern/group. Mental health outcomes for each study were simplified into three categories of improved, no change, and worsened. The relationship between top three fiber FGs consumed within each DP and mental health outcomes was analyzed using Spearman's correlation. (3) Results: Thirteen of fifty-two studies met the inclusion criteria. Ten (76.9%) studies assessed DPs (seven examined depression only, two examined depression and anxiety, and one examined anxiety only). Seven (53.9%) studies reported at least one significant positive relationship between mental health outcomes and DPs while three reported at least one negative outcome. Three (23.1%) studies compared intake of different food groups between depressed and non-depressed groups. In studies of DPs, the average consumption ranking of the top three fiber FGs bore a significant inverse association with mental health outcomes [r = -0.419 (95%CI: -0.672--0.078)] <i>p</i> = 0.015. In studies comparing the intake of different FGs between depressed and non-depressed groups, the consumption of top-ranking fiber foods was higher in the non-depressed groups, but significantly higher in four of the ten high fiber FGs. (4) Conclusions: This study reframes findings from previously published studies of maternal diet and mental health outcomes to focus on fiber intake specifically, using a fiber ranking system. A significant correlation between lower intake of fiber and poorer mental health outcomes warrants further investigation in future studies.",Nutrients,2024,Neda Ebrahimi; Tiffany Turner; Faith Gallant; Abinaa Chandrakumar; Roshni Kohli; Rebecca Lester; Victoria Forte; Kieran Cooley
38748594,Microbiota transplantation in restoring cesarean-related infant dysbiosis: a new frontier.,"C-section is crucial in reducing maternal and neonatal mortality when medically indicated, but one of its side effects could be the disruption of vertical transmission of maternal-infant microbiota during delivery, potentially leading to gut dysbiosis and increased disease risks in C-section infants. To address such dysbiosis, it seems reasonable to supplement ""what is missing"" during C-section procedure. This idea has prompted several clinical trials, including proof-of-concept, investigating interventions like vaginal microbial seeding, oral administration of maternal vaginal microbes and even oral administration of maternal fecal materials. Hereby, we have summarized these trials to help understand the current state of these researches, highlighting the predominantly pilot nature of most of these studies and emphasizing the need for well-designed studies with larger sample to guide evidence-based medicine in the future.",Gut microbes,2024,Sina Liu; Xiaoxia Luo; Lepeng Zhou; Ri-Hua Xie; Yan He
39187187,Is anxiety and depression transmissible? Depressed mother rats transmit anxiety- and depression-like phenotypes to cohabited rat pups through gut microbiota assimilation.,"This study is to investigate the role of gut microbiota transmission in the development of anxiety/depression in offspring exposed to maternal depression.Offspring rats were cohabitated with their depressed mother or father rats (which exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)) for 2, 4, and 6 months, the anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, and interaction/caring activities between mother/father and their pups were detected. The gut microbiota composition and its relationship with behaviors were analyzed. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) was performed to establish the gut microbiota of depressed/normal mother rats in the offspring rats to further confirm the role of ""depressive gut microbiota"" transmission in mediating the anxiety/depression in the pups.Anxiety and depression phenotypes can be transmitted from depressed mother rats to their cohabited offspring. Frequent interactions and gut microbiota assimilation were observed between rat mothers and their pups. Remodeling of the gut microbiota in pups by FMT could induce or attenuate anxiety- and depression-like phenotypes depending on the origin of the fecal microbiota. By comparison, the pups cohabiting with depressed father rats exhibited milder anxiety and depression.These data together support that depressed mothers can transmit anxiety/depression to their pups through gut microbiota assimilation, which is related to frequent interactions. Our study reinforces the significance of mental health of mothers in preventing the occurrence of childhood anxiety and depression, and pointing out the possibility of remodeling intestinal microbiota as an effective therapeutic approach for treating anxiety/depression in children.",Journal of affective disorders,2024,Huiliang Zhang; Hui Wei; Xuan Qin; Haiyue Song; Mengzhe Yang; Lun Zhang; Yi Liu; Zhuoqun Wang; Yiren Zhang; Yiwen Lai; Jiayu Yang; Yu Chen; Zhongshan Chen; Ji Zeng; Xiaochuan Wang; Rong Liu
39339649,Nutraceutical Capsules LL1 and Silymarin Supplementation Act on Mood and Sleep Quality Perception by Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis: A Pilot Clinical Study.,"Stress, unhealthy lifestyle, and sleep disturbance worsen cognitive function in mood disorders, prompting a rise in the development of integrative health approaches. The recent investigations in the gut-brain axis field highlight the strong interplay among microbiota, inflammation, and mental health. Thus, this study aimed to investigate a new nutraceutical formulation comprising prebiotics, minerals, and silymarin's impact on microbiota, inflammation, mood, and sleep quality. The study evaluated the LL1 + silymarin capsule supplementation over 180 days in overweight adults. We analyzed the fecal gut microbiota using partial 16S rRNA sequences, measured cytokine expression via CBA, collected anthropometric data, quality of life, and sleep questionnaire responses, and obtained plasma samples for metabolic and hormonal analysis at baseline (T0) and 180 days (T180) post-supplementation. Our findings revealed significant reshaping in gut microbiota composition at the phylum, genus, and species levels, especially in the butyrate-producer bacteria post-supplementation. These changes in gut microbiota were linked to enhancements in sleep quality, mood perception, cytokine expression, and anthropometric measures which microbiota-derived short-chain fatty acids might enhance. The supplementation tested in this study seems to be able to improve microbiota composition, reflecting anthropometrics and inflammation, as well as sleep quality and mood improvement.",Nutrients,2024,Aline Boveto Santamarina; Victor Nehmi Filho; Jéssica Alves de Freitas; Lucas Augusto Moysés Franco; Joyce Vanessa Fonseca; Roberta Cristina Martins; José Antônio Orellana Turri; Bruna Fernanda Rio Branco da Silva; Arianne Fagotti Gusmão; Eloísa Helena Ribeiro Olivieri; José Pinhata Otoch; Ana Flávia Marçal Pessoa
39121711,The gut-microbiome in adult Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder - A Meta-analysis.,"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental condition that persists into adulthood in the majority of individuals. While the gut-microbiome seems to be relevant for ADHD, the few publications on gut-microbial alterations in ADHD are inconsistent, in the investigated phenotypes, sequencing method/region, preprocessing, statistical approaches, and findings. To identify gut-microbiome alterations in adult ADHD, robust across studies and statistical approaches, we harmonized bioinformatic pipelines and analyses of raw 16S rRNA sequencing data from four adult ADHD case-control studies (N<sub>ADHD</sub>=312, N<sub>NoADHD</sub>=305). We investigated diversity and differential abundance of selected genera (logistic regression and ANOVA-like Differential Expression tool), corrected for age and sex, and meta-analyzed the study results. Converging results were investigated for association with hyperactive/impulsive and inattentive symptoms across all participants. Beta diversity was associated with ADHD diagnosis but showed significant heterogeneity between cohorts, despite harmonized analyses. Several genera were robustly associated with adult ADHD; e.g., Ruminococcus_torques_group (LogOdds=0.17, p<sub>fdr</sub>=4.42 × 10<sup>-2</sup>), which was more abundant in adults with ADHD, and Eubacterium_xylanophilum_group (LogOdds= -0.12, p<sub>fdr</sub>=6.9 × 10<sup>-3</sup>), which was less abundant in ADHD. Ruminococcus_torques_group was further associated with hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms and Eisenbergiella with inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity (p<sub>fdr</sub><0.05). The literature points towards a role of these genera in inflammatory processes. Irreproducible results in the field of gut-microbiota research, due to between study heterogeneity and small sample sizes, stress the need for meta-analytic approaches and large sample sizes. While we robustly identified genera associated with adult ADHD, that might overall be considered beneficial or risk-conferring, functional studies are needed to shed light on these properties.",European neuropsychopharmacology : the journal of the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology,2024,Babette Jakobi; Priscilla Vlaming; Danique Mulder; Marta Ribases; Vanesa Richarte; Josep Antoni Ramos-Quiroga; Indira Tendolkar; Philip van Eijndhoven; Janna N Vrijsen; Jan Buitelaar; Barbara Franke; Martine Hoogman; Mirjam Bloemendaal; Alejandro Arias-Vasquez
39195546,Alterations in Vagal Tone Are Associated with Changes in the Gut Microbiota of Adults with Anxiety and Depression Symptoms: Analysis of Fecal Metabolite Profiles.,"Accumulating evidence suggests that interactions between the brain and gut microbiota significantly impact brain function and mental health. In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether young, healthy adults without psychiatric diagnoses exhibit differences in metabolic stool and microbiota profiles based on depression/anxiety scores and heart rate variability (HRV) parameters. Untargeted nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabolomics was used to identify fecal metabolic profiles. Results were subjected to multivariate analysis through principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and the metabolites were identified through VIP score. Metabolites separating asymptomatic and symptomatic groups were acetate, valine, and glutamate, followed by sugar regions, glutamine, acetone, valerate, and acetoacetate. The main metabolites identified in high vagal tone (HVT) and low vagal tone (LVT) groups were acetate, valerate, and glutamate, followed by propionate and butyrate. In addition to the metabolites identified by the PLS-DA test, significant differences in aspartate, sarcosine, malate, and methionine were observed between the groups. Levels of acetoacetate were higher in both symptomatic and LVT groups. Valerate levels were significantly increased in the symptomatic group, while isovalerate, propionate, glutamate, and acetone levels were significantly increased in the LVT group. Furthermore, distinct abundance between groups was only confirmed for the Firmicutes phylum. Differences between participants with high and low vagal tone suggest that certain metabolites are involved in communication between the vagus nerve and the brain.",Metabolites,2024,Laura Pasqualette; Tatiana Kelly da Silva Fidalgo; Liana Bastos Freitas-Fernandes; Gabriela Guerra Leal Souza; Luís Aureliano Imbiriba; Leandro Araujo Lobo; Eliane Volchan; Regina Maria Cavalcanti Pilotto Domingues; Ana Paula Valente; Karla Rodrigues Miranda
39247907,Modifications in the Composition of the Gut Microbiota in Rats Induced by Chronic Sleep Deprivation: Potential Relation to Mental Disorders.,"Sleep deprivation(SD) has numerous negative effects on mental health. A growing body of research has confirmed the implication of gut microbiota in mental disorders. However, the specific modifications in mammalian gut microbiota following SD exhibit variations across different studies.Male specific-pathogen-free Wistar rats were given a modified multiple-platform exposure for 7 days of SD. Fecal samples were obtained from the control and SD groups both at baseline and after 7 days of SD. We utilized 16S rDNA gene sequencing to investigate the gut microbial composition and functional pathways in rats.Analysis of the microbiota composition revealed a significant change in gut microbial composition after chronic SD, especially at the phylum level. The relative abundances of <i>p_Firmicutes, g_Romboutsia</i>, and <i>g_Enterococcus</i> increased, whereas those of <i>p_Bacteroidetes, p_Verrucomicrobia, p_Fusobacteria, g_Akkermansia</i>, and <i>g_Cetobacterium</i> decreased in animals after chronic SD compared with controls or animals before SD. The ratio of <i>Firmicutes</i> to <i>Bacteroidetes</i> exhibited an increase following SD. The relative abundance of gut microbiota related to the functional pathways of GABAergic and glutamatergic synapses was observed to be diminished in rats following SD compared to pre-SD.Collectively, these findings suggest that chronic SD causes significant alterations in both the structural composition and functional pathways of the gut microbiome. Further researches are necessary to investigate the chronological and causal connections among SD, the gut microbiota and mental disorders.",Nature and science of sleep,2024,Li-Ming Zheng; Yan Li
38852801,Levilactobacillus brevis SG031 modulates mood-related behaviors and attenuates stress-related sleep disturbance and autonomic dysfunction via gut microbiota modulation in Wistar-Kyoto rats.,"The probiotic bacterium Levilactobacillus brevis (L. brevis) has been proposed as a potential solution to manage mood disorders and alleviate stress-related sleep disturbances. However, the underlying mechanisms of its effects have not been fully elucidated. The aim of this study was to explore the impact and potential mechanisms of L. brevis SG031 supplementation on anxiety/depression-like behaviors and stress-induced changes in sleep patterns and sleep-related autonomic function.Male Wistar-Kyoto rats were administered low, medium, or high doses of L. brevis SG031 or a vehicle for 4 weeks, followed by behavioral tests to evaluate anxiety and depression. After an additional 2 weeks of SG031 or vehicle administration, a cage-exchange paradigm was performed with 24-hour physiological signal measurements under different stress conditions. Fecal samples were collected to construct a 16S rRNA library and assess fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs).High-dose SG031 administration yielded reduced depression-like responses and enhanced social interaction in behavioral tests. It also exhibited a protective effect against stress-induced sleep disturbance characterized by decreased sleep time, increased awake time, and autonomic dysfunction during sleep. Fecal examination indicated that high-dose SG031 administration exerted beneficial effects on gut health by maintaining the gut microbial abundance, preserving stability of the microbial composition, and enriching the gut with SCFAs, which were associated with improvements in sleep and autonomic function.These findings collectively underscore the multifaceted potential of SG031 in addressing mental health and stress-related sleep challenges through the modulation of the gut microbiota.",Life sciences,2024,Chieh-Wen Chen; Hung-Chang Chen; Sheng-Chieh She; Chun-Ting Lai; Wei-Jen Chen; Terry B J Kuo; Cheryl C H Yang
38959253,Perturbations in gut microbiota composition in schizophrenia.,"Schizophrenia is a severe, complex and long-term psychiatric disorder with unclear etiology. Gut microbes influence the central nervous system via the gut-brain axis. Consequently, investigations of the relationship between gut microbes and schizophrenia are warranted. This study involved 29 patients with schizophrenia and 30 age-matched normal controls. After 16S rRNA gene sequencing and whole-genome shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we analyzed microbial diversity, composition, and function. According to 16S rRNA and metagenomic gene sequencing results, patients with schizophrenia had higher abundances of Clostridium and Megasphaera. Functional analysis showed that sphingolipid, phosphonates and phosphinates, as well as glutamine metabolism were associated with the occurrence and development of schizophrenia. Our data suggest that the gut microbiota exerts an effect on patients with schizophrenia, providing valuable insights into the potential regulation of in the context of this disorder.",PloS one,2024,YiMeng Wang; SiGuo Bi; XiaoLong Li; YuTao Zhong; DongDong Qi
39331265,Identification of hsa-miR-193a-5p-SURF4 axis related to the gut microbiota-metabolites- cytokines in lung cancer based on Mendelian randomization study and bioinformatics analysis.,"Lung cancer is a significant disease that affects people's physical and mental health. Currently, the treatment outcomes still do not meet clinical needs, and the causes of the disease are still unclear, therefore further exploration is needed.We analyzed the exposure factors of lung cancer, including gut microbiota, serum metabolites, and cytokines, through Mendelian randomization studies and bioinformatics analysis. We identified common SNPs and performed gene annotation, leading to the discovery of the key gene SURF4, which may affect the onset of lung cancer. We validated the oncogenic function and mechanism of SURF4 through public data analysis using GO and KEGG, and constructed a ceRNA network, revealing the lung cancer oncogenic pathway involving lncRNA/pseudogene-microRNA-SURF4.We first conducted a Mendelian randomization analysis on 418 gut microbiota, 1400 serum metabolites, and 41 cytokines in relation to lung cancer. We found that 16 gut microbiota, 29 serum metabolites, and 2 cytokines were closely associated with lung cancer. Further comparison of all differential SNPs revealed that rs550057 on chromosome 9 was a common SNP among these three exposure factors, indicating its crucial role in lung cancer formation. Through gene functional annotation using R language, we found that the expression of 15 genes, including SURF4, was influenced by rs550057. By querying these 15 genes from public databases for their differential expression and prognosis in lung cancer, we found significant differences in SURF4, MED22, and RPL7A. Furthermore, by querying the expression and correlation coefficients of upstream microRNAs of these three genes through the starBase website, we found that hsa-miR-193a-5p-SURF4 had the most significant effect on lung cancer. Through GO and KEGG analysis of SURF4-related genes, we identified the molecular pathways associated metabolic synthesis and microbial infection related to the promotion of lung cancer by SURF4. This validated the results of the previous Mendelian randomization study. Furthermore, we constructed a ceRNA network for SURF4 and identified two upstream differentially expressed pseudogenes and nine lncRNAs, confirming the functionality of the pseudogene/lncRNA-microRNA-SUFR4 pathway.In summary, we have elucidated the regulatory role of the pseudogene/lncRNA-microRNA-SUFR4 pathway in the progression of lung cancer, combining the research hotspots of gut microbiota-serum metabolites-cytokines. We have also confirmed the pathway and mechanism through SURF4 and its related genes promoting lung cancer formation. This may provide effective therapeutic methods for lung cancer and serve as a potential prognostic marker.",Discover oncology,2024,Jie Yu; Sibo Meng; Tiantian Xuan; Zhanmei Wang; Linli Qu; Fangli Cao; Jiaxin Li
39458509,Gut-Brain Axis and Psychopathology: Exploring the Impact of Diet with a Focus on the Low-FODMAP Approach.,"The gut-brain axis (GBA) is a bidirectional communication network connecting the central nervous system with the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, influencing both mental and physical health. Recent research has underscored the significant role of diet in modulating this axis, with attention to how specific dietary patterns can impact anxiety and depression, particularly when linked to disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBIs), like intestinal bowel syndrome (IBS).This narrative review examines the effects of specific diet regimens on the GBA and its potential role in managing psychopathology, focusing on anxiety and depression, IBS, and the low-FODMAP diet. We conducted a search on PubMed and MEDLINE by combining the following key terms: ""Gut-Brain Axis"", ""Irritable Bowel Syndrome"", ""Low FODMAP diet"", ""Mediterranean Diet"", ""Psychopathology"", ""Anxiety and Depression"", and ""Gut Microbiota"". We applied the following filters: ""Clinical Trials"", ""Randomized Controlled Trials"", ""Reviews"", ""Meta-Analyses"", and ""Systematic Reviews"". In total, 59 papers were included.Low-FODMAP diet, originally developed to alleviate GI symptoms in IBS, may also positively influence mental health by modulating the GBA and improving the gut microbiota (GM) composition. New insights suggest that combining the low-FODMAP diet with the Mediterranean diet could offer a synergistic effect, enhancing both GI and psychological therapeutic outcomes.Understanding the complex interactions between diet, the GM, and mental health opens new avenues for holistic approaches to managing psychopathology, particularly when linked to GI symptoms.",Nutrients,2024,Emanuela Ribichini; Giulia Scalese; Chiara Mocci; Carola Severi
39291634,"A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel trial to test the effect of inulin supplementation on migraine headache characteristics, quality of life and mental health symptoms in women with migraine.","Migraine is a complex neurovascular disorder characterized by recurrent headache attacks that are often accompanied by symptoms such as vomiting, nausea, and sensitivity to sound or light. Preventing migraine attacks is highly important. Recent research has indicated that alterations in gut microbiota may influence the underlying mechanisms of migraines. This study aimed to investigate the effects of inulin supplementation on migraine headache characteristics, quality of life (QOL), and mental health symptoms in women with migraines. In a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial, 80 women with migraines aged 20 to 50 years were randomly assigned to receive 10 g day<sup>-1</sup> of inulin or a placebo supplement for 12 weeks. Severity, frequency, and duration of migraine attacks, as well as depression, anxiety, stress, QOL, and headache impact test (HIT-6) scores, were examined at the start of the study and after 12 weeks of intervention. In this study, the primary outcome focused on the frequency of headache attacks, while secondary outcomes encompassed the duration and severity of headache attacks, QOL, and mental health. There was a significant reduction in severity (-1.95 <i>vs.</i> -0.84, <i>P</i> = 0.004), duration (-6.95 <i>vs.</i> -2.05, <i>P</i> = 0.023), frequency (-2.09 <i>vs.</i> -0.37, <i>P</i> < 0.001), and HIT-6 score (-10.30 <i>vs.</i> -6.52, <i>P</i> < 0.023) in the inulin group compared with the control. Inulin supplementation improved mental health symptoms, including depression (-4.47 <i>vs.</i> -1.45, <i>P</i> < 0.001), anxiety (-4.37 <i>vs.</i> -0.70, <i>P</i> < 0.001), and stress (-4.40 <i>vs.</i> -1.50, <i>P</i> < 0.001). However, no significant difference was observed between the two groups regarding changes in QOL score. This study provides evidence supporting the beneficial effects of inulin supplement on migraine symptoms and mental health status in women with migraines.

Dietary fiber pectins and prebiotics have emerged as key modulators of gut microbiota composition and function, offering potential therapeutic implications for promoting gut health and preventing intestinal inflammatory diseases. In this review, we explore the modulation of gut microbiota by dietary fiber pectins and prebiotics in infants and adults. We begin with an overview of the gut microbiota composition and function in different age groups, highlighting the factors in shaping microbial communities in both age groups, especially the effect of diet. We then delve into the impact of dietary fiber pectins and prebiotics on gut microbiota composition and function, examining their effects on digestive health, intestinal barrier integrity, immune function, metabolic health, and mental health across different life stages. We further compare how aging affects the gut function and immune system, and we discuss the main health outcomes associated with dietary fiber intake and prebiotics, including the impact on digestive health, improvement in immune function, improvement in cholesterol and glucose metabolism, weight management, mental health, and prevention of diseases. Finally, we highlight the challenges and future directions for research. By advancing the understanding of gut microbiota dynamics and translating scientific insights into clinical practice, it could harness the full potential of dietary fiber pectins and prebiotics to optimize gut health, improve overall well-being across the lifespan, and increase longevity.",Food & function,2024,Janaina Lombello Santos Donadio; João Paulo Fabi
38928361,A Narrative Review of Intestinal Microbiota's Impact on Migraine with Psychopathologies.,"Migraine is a common and debilitating neurological disorder characterized by the recurrent attack of pulsating headaches typically localized on one side of the head associated with other disabling symptoms, such as nausea, increased sensitivity to light, sound and smell and mood changes. Various clinical factors, including the excessive use of migraine medication, inadequate acute treatment and stressful events, can contribute to the worsening of the condition, which may evolve to chronic migraine, that is, a headache present on >15 days/month for at least 3 months. Chronic migraine is frequently associated with various comorbidities, including anxiety and mood disorders, particularly depression, which complicate the prognosis, response to treatment and overall clinical outcomes. Emerging research indicates a connection between alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota and mental health conditions, particularly anxiety and depression, which are considered disorders of the gut-brain axis. This underscores the potential of modulating the gut microbiota as a new avenue for managing these conditions. In this context, it is interesting to investigate whether migraine, particularly in its chronic form, exhibits a dysbiosis profile similar to that observed in individuals with anxiety and depression. This could pave the way for interventions aimed at modulating the gut microbiota for treating difficult-to-manage migraines.",International journal of molecular sciences,2024,Miriam Francavilla; Sara Facchetti; Chiara Demartini; Anna Maria Zanaboni; Chiara Amoroso; Sara Bottiroli; Cristina Tassorelli; Rosaria Greco

In addition, we applied the R programming language version 4.0.3 and Stata 15.1 software for data analysis. We also implemented the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), funnel plot analysis, Egger's test, and Begg's test to assess the risk of bias.In this study, a total of 328 studies were identified through the literature search. Among them, 117 duplicate studies were removed, and 202 studies were excluded based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Finally, 9 studies were included in the analysis, involving a total of 216 patients with esophageal carcinoma and 352 healthy controls. Four studies provided Chao1 index for quantitative consolidation (ES = 637.41, 95% CI: 549.16 to 725.66, p = 0.000, I<sup>2</sup> = 98.2%).

Seven studies [26,27,29,30,32] reported the Shannon index for quantitative consolidation (ES = 4.38, 95% CI: 3.95 to 4.81, p = 0.000, I<sup>2</sup> = 99%). At the phylum level, the abundance of Bacteroidetes(ES = 37.8, 95% CI: 25.75 to 49.85, p = 0.000, I2 = 87.2%) and Proteobacteria(ES = 7.48, 95% CI: 5.02 to 8.85, p = 0.04, I<sup>2</sup> = 2.4%) have statistical difference between ESCC and HC. There was no significant difference between ESCC and HC in the abundance of genera(p>0.05).This observational meta-analysis revealed that changes in the GM were correlated with esophageal carcinoma, and variations in some advantageous GM might involve regional differences.

38974216,Vitamin-mediated interaction between the gut microbiome and mitochondria in depression: A systematic review-based integrated perspective.,"Depression is one of the world's most prevalent mental disorders and its treatment remains suboptimal. Depression is a systemic disease with highly complex biological mechanisms. Emerging evidence points towards the involvement of mitochondria, microbiome and vitamins in its pathophysiology. Mitochondrial energy production was shown to be lowered in patients with depression. Mitochondrial energy production depends on vitamins, which are available from food, but are also synthesized by the gut microbiota. Several studies reported altered vitamin levels as well as changes in the gut microbiome composition and its vitamin metabolism in patients with depression. Therefore, the question of a connection between mitochondria and gut microbiome and vitamins influencing the mental health arises. This review aims to systematically investigate a combination of the topics - depression, mitochondria, microbiome, and vitamins - to generate an overview of a novel yet extremely complex and interconnected research field. A systematic literature search yielded 34 articles, and the results were summarized and bundled to develop this new integrative perspective on mitochondrial function mediated by the microbiome and microbiome-derived vitamins in depression. Furthermore, by discussing the research gaps this review aims to encourage innovative research approaches to better understand the biology of depression, which could result in optimized therapeutic approaches.","Brain, behavior, & immunity - health",2024,Ellen Bisle; Suchithra Varadarajan; Iris-Tatjana Kolassa
38756585,The gut-brain-axis: A positive relationship between gut microbial dysbiosis and glioblastoma brain tumour.,"The glioblastoma brain tumour (GBM) stands out as the most aggressive and resistant-to-treatment malignancy. Nevertheless, the gut-brain connection plays a pivotal role in influencing the growth and activation of the central nervous system. In this particular investigation, we aimed to assess and characterize the gut microbial ecosystem in GBM patients, both quantitatively and qualitatively. We collected faecal samples from 15 healthy volunteers and 25 GBM patients. To delve into the microbial content, we employed PCR-DGGE, targeting the V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene, and conducted qPCR to measure the levels of crucial intestinal bacteria. For a more in-depth analysis, high-throughput sequencing was performed on a selection of 20 random faecal samples (10 from healthy individuals and 10 from GBM patients), targeting the V3+V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Our findings from examining the richness and diversity of the gut microbiota unveiled that GBM patients exhibited significantly higher microbial diversity compared to healthy individuals. At the phylum level, Proteobacteria saw a significant increase, while <i>Firmicutes</i> experienced a noteworthy decrease in the GBM group. Moving down to the family level, we observed significantly elevated levels of <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i>, <i>Bacteroidaceae</i>, and <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> in GBM patients, while levels of <i>Veillonellaceae</i>, <i>Rikenellaceae</i>, and <i>Prevotellaceae</i> were notably lower. Delving into genera statistics, we noted a substantial increase in the abundance of <i>Parasutterella</i>, <i>Escherichia-Shigella</i>, and <i>Bacteroides</i>, alongside significantly lower levels of <i>Ruminococcus 2</i>, <i>Faecalibacterium</i>, and <i>Prevotella_9</i> in the GBM group compared to the control group. Furthermore, when examining specific species, we found a significant increase in <i>Bacteroides vulgatus</i> and <i>Escherichia coli</i> in the GBM group. These observations collectively indicate a marked dysbiosis in the gut microbial composition of GBM patients. Additionally, the GBM group exhibited notably higher levels of alpha diversity when compared to the control group. This increase in diversity suggests a significant bacterial overgrowth in the gut of GBM patients in contrast to the controls. As a result, this research opens up potential avenues to gain a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms, pathways, and potential treatments for GBM, stemming from the significant implications of gut microbial dysbiosis in these patients.",Heliyon,2024,Hafiz Muhammad Ishaq; Riffat Yasin; Imran Shair Mohammad; Yang Fan; Huan Li; Muhammad Shahzad; Jiru Xu
38792361,"The Potential Role of the Ketogenic Diet in Serious Mental Illness: Current Evidence, Safety, and Practical Advice.","The ketogenic diet (KD) is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet that mimics the physiological state of fasting. The potential therapeutic effects in many chronic conditions have led to the gaining popularity of the KD. The KD has been demonstrated to alleviate inflammation and oxidative stress, modulate the gut microbiota community, and improve metabolic health markers. The modification of these factors has been a potential therapeutic target in serious mental illness (SMI): bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia. The number of clinical trials assessing the effect of the KD on SMI is still limited. Preliminary research, predominantly case studies, suggests potential therapeutic effects, including weight gain reduction, improved carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, decrease in disease-related symptoms, increased energy and quality of life, and, in some cases, changes in pharmacotherapy (reduction in number or dosage of medication). However, these findings necessitate further investigation through larger-scale clinical trials. Initiation of the KD should occur in a hospital setting and with strict care of a physician and dietitian due to potential side effects of the diet and the possibility of exacerbating adverse effects of pharmacotherapy. An increasing number of ongoing studies examining the KD's effect on mental disorders highlights its potential role in the adjunctive treatment of SMI.",Journal of clinical medicine,2024,Joanna Rog; Zuzanna Wingralek; Katarzyna Nowak; Monika Grudzień; Arkadiusz Grunwald; Agnieszka Banaszek; Hanna Karakula-Juchnowicz
39158758,The Antidepressant- and Anxiolytic-Like Effects of the Phosphodiesterase Type-5 Inhibitor Tadalafil are Associated with the Modulation of the Gut-Brain Axis During CNS Autoimmunity.,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a debilitating disease that severely affects the central nervous system (CNS). Apart from neurological symptoms, it is also characterized by neuropsychiatric comorbidities, such as anxiety and depression. Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE5Is) such as Sildenafil and Tadalafil have been shown to possess antidepressant-like effects, but the mechanisms underpinning such effects are not fully characterized. To address this question, we used the EAE model of MS, behavioral tests, immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, western blot, and 16 S rRNA sequencing. Here, we showed that depressive-like behavior in Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice is due to neuroinflammation, reduced synaptic plasticity, dysfunction in glutamatergic neurotransmission, glucocorticoid receptor (GR) resistance, increased blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and immune cell infiltration to the CNS, as well as inflammation, increased intestinal permeability, and immune cell infiltration in the distal colon. Furthermore, 16 S rRNA sequencing revealed that behavioral dysfunction in EAE mice is associated with changes in the gut microbiota, such as an increased abundance of Firmicutes and Saccharibacteria and a reduction in Proteobacteria, Parabacteroides, and Desulfovibrio. Moreover, we detected an increased abundance of Erysipelotrichaceae and Desulfovibrionaceae and a reduced abundance of Lactobacillus johnsonii. Surprisingly, we showed that Tadalafil likely exerts antidepressant-like effects by targeting all aforementioned disease aspects. In conclusion, our work demonstrated that anxiety- and depressive-like behavior in EAE is associated with a plethora of neuroimmune and gut microbiota-mediated mechanisms and that Tadalafil exerts antidepressant-like effects probably by targeting these mechanisms. Harnessing the knowledge of these mechanisms of action of Tadalafil is important to pave the way for future clinical trials with depressed patients.",Journal of neuroimmune pharmacology : the official journal of the Society on NeuroImmune Pharmacology,2024,Eduardo Duarte-Silva; Alice Chevrollier Oriá; Ingrid Prata Mendonça; Igor Henrique Rodrigues Paiva; Klyvia Leuthier Dos Santos; Amanda Juliana Sales; José Roberto Botelho de Souza; Michael Maes; Sven Guenther Meuth; Christina Alves Peixoto
39303815,Metformin reprograms tryptophan metabolism via gut microbiome-derived bile acid metabolites to ameliorate depression-Like behaviors in mice.,"As an adjunct therapy, metformin enhances the efficacy of conventional antidepressant medications. However, its mode of action remains unclear. Here, metformin was found to ameliorate depression-like behaviors in mice exposed to chronic restraint stress (CRS) by normalizing the dysbiotic gut microbiome. Fecal transplants from metformin-treated mice ameliorated depressive behaviors in stressed mice. Microbiome profiling revealed that Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila), in particular, was markedly increased in the gut by metformin and that oral administration of this species alone was sufficient to reverse CRS-induced depressive behaviors and normalize aberrant stress-induced 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) metabolism in the brain and gut. Untargeted metabolomic profiling further identified the bile acid metabolites taurocholate and deoxycholic acid as direct A. muciniphila-derived molecules that are, individually, sufficient to rescue the CRS-induced impaired 5-HT metabolism and depression-like behaviors. Thus, we report metformin reprograms 5-HT metabolism via microbiome-brain interactions to mitigate depressive syndromes, providing novel insights into gut microbiota-derived bile acids as potential therapeutic candidates for depressive mood disorders from bench to bedside.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2024,Xiaoxian Xie; Wenwen Li; Ze Xiong; Junyu Xu; Tailin Liao; Lei Sun; Haoshen Xu; Mengya Zhang; Jiafeng Zhou; Wenzheng Xiong; Zhengwei Fu; Zezhi Li; Qi Han; Donghong Cui; Daniel C Anthony
38944290,Splenic nerve denervation attenuates depression-like behaviors in Chrna7 knock-out mice via the spleen-gut-brain axis.,"Growing evidence highlights the role of the spleen-brain axis in inflammation-associated depression. The α7-subtype of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7 nAChR, encoded by the Chrna7 gene) is implicated in systemic inflammation, with Chrna7 knock-out (KO) mice displaying depression-like behaviors. Yet, the influence of spleen nerve on depression-like behaviors in these KO mice remains to be elucidated.We investigated the effects of the splenic nerve denervation (SND) on depression-like behaviors, the protein expression in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and the gut microbiota composition in Chrna7 KO mice.SND markedly alleviated depression-like behaviors and the reduced expression of GluA1 and postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95) in the PFC of Chrna7 KO mice. No changes in α-diversity of gut microbiota were noted among the control, KO + sham, and KO + SND groups. However, significant differences in β-diversity of gut microbiota were noted among the groups. Notable alterations in various microbiota (e.g., Fluviimonas_pallidilutea, Maribacter_arcticus, Parvibacter_caecicola) and plasma metabolites (e.g., helicide, N-acetyl-L-aspartic acid, α-D-galactose 1-phosphate, choline, creatine) were observed between KO + sham and KO + SND groups. Interestingly, correlations were found between the relative abundance of specific microbiota and other outcomes, including synaptic proteins, metabolites and behavioral data.The underlying mechanisms remain to be fully understood.Our findings indicate that the splenic nerve contributes to depression-like phenotypes in Chrna7 KO mice via the spleen-gut-brain axis.",Journal of affective disorders,2024,Yong Yang; Akifumi Eguchi; Chisato Mori; Kenji Hashimoto
39199404,The Influence of Cecal Microbiota Transplantation on Chicken Injurious Behavior: Perspective in Human Neuropsychiatric Research.,"Numerous studies have evidenced that neuropsychiatric disorders (mental illness and emotional disturbances) with aggression (or violence) pose a significant challenge to public health and contribute to a substantial economic burden worldwide. Especially, social disorganization (or social inequality) associated with childhood adversity has long-lasting effects on mental health, increasing the risk of developing neuropsychiatric disorders. Intestinal bacteria, functionally as an endocrine organ and a second brain, release various immunomodulators and bioactive compounds directly or indirectly regulating a host's physiological and behavioral homeostasis. Under various social challenges, stress-induced dysbiosis increases gut permeability causes serial reactions: releasing neurotoxic compounds, leading to neuroinflammation and neuronal injury, and eventually neuropsychiatric disorders associated with aggressive, violent, or impulsive behavior in humans and various animals via a complex bidirectional communication of the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis. The dysregulation of the MGB axis has also been recognized as one of the reasons for the prevalence of social stress-induced injurious behaviors (feather pecking, aggression, and cannibalistic pecking) in chickens. However, existing knowledge of preventing and treating these disorders in both humans and chickens is not well understood. In previous studies, we developed a non-mammal model in an abnormal behavioral investigation by rationalizing the effects of gut microbiota on injurious behaviors in chickens. Based on our earlier success, the perspective article outlines the possibility of reducing stress-induced injurious behaviors in chickens through modifying gut microbiota via cecal microbiota transplantation, with the potential for providing a biotherapeutic rationale for preventing injurious behaviors among individuals with mental disorders via restoring gut microbiota diversity and function.",Biomolecules,2024,Yuechi Fu; Heng-Wei Cheng

Several in vitro and human studies were performed to assess their physiological potential, to find strains having psychotropic activity in humans, and to elucidate the metabolic pathways involved. In our previous in vitro study, we identified two strains Levilactobacillus brevis P30021 and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum P30025, able to produce GABA and acetylcholine, being promising candidates to provide an effect on mood and cognitive performance.To investigate the effects of probiotics in the alleviation on the cognitive performance of moderately stressed healthy adults. Secondary outcomes were related to mood improvement, production of GABA, glutamate, acetylcholine, and choline and modification of the microbiota composition.A 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study investigated the effects of a probiotic formulation (Levilactobacillus brevis P30021 and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum P30025) on psychological, memory, and cognition parameters in 44 (Probiotic = 44, Placebo = 43) adults with a mean age of 29 ± 5.7 years old by CogState Battery test. Subjects-inclusion criteria was a mild-moderate (18.7 ± 4.06) stress upon diagnosis using the DASS-42 questionnaire.Probiotic treatment had no effect on subjective stress measures. The probiotic formulation showed a significant beneficial effect on depressive symptoms by reducing cognitive reactivity to sad mood (p = 0.034). Rumination significantly improved after intake of the probiotic (p = 0.006), suggesting a potential benefit in reducing the negative cognitive effects associated with depression and improving overall mental health. When stratifying the treated subjects according to the response, we found an increase in the abundance of the probiotic genera in the gut microbiota of positive responders (p = 0.009 for Lactiplantibacillus and p = 0.004 for L.brevis). No relevant correlations were observed between the neurotransmitter concentration in the faecal sample, scores of LEIDS, DASS-42, and cognitive tests.We highlight the potential of this probiotic preparation to act as psycobiotics for the relief of negative mood feelings. The assessment of the psychotropic effects of dietary interventions in human participants has many challenges. Further interventional studies investigating the effect of these psychobiotic bacteria in populations with stressed-related disorders are required including longer period of intervention and larger sample size in order to verify the effects of the treatment on further stress-related indicators.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2024,Melania Casertano; Matthijs Dekker; Vincenzo Valentino; Francesca De Filippis; Vincenzo Fogliano; Danilo Ercolini
39386896,Unveiling the gut microbiota blueprint of schizophrenia: a multilevel omics approach.,"Schizophrenia is a persistent incurable mental disorder and is characterized by the manifestation of negative emotions and behaviors with anxiety and depression, fear and insecurity, self-harm and social withdrawal. The intricate molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain largely elusive. Accumulating evidence points towards the gut microbiota exerting an influence on brain function via the gut-brain axis, potentially contributing to the development of schizophrenia. Therefore, the objective of this study is to delineate the gut microbial composition and metabolic profile of fecal samples from individuals with schizophrenia.Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene sequencing were employed to analyze fecal metabolites and gut microbiota profiles in a cohort of 29 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and 30 normal controls. The microbial composition of fecal samples was determined through the 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and microbial α-diversity and β-diversity indices were calculated. Principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were performed to analyze the distribution of samples. The metabolites and gut microbiota exhibiting differential expression were identified through the application of biological variance criteria. Co-occurrence analysis of bacteria and metabolites was conducted using the spearman's rank correlation coefficient and visualized in a circular layout with the Cytoscape software.The findings of the study indicated a lack of substantial evidence supporting significant disparities in α-diversity and β-diversity between individuals with schizophrenia and normal controls. In terms of metabolomics, a discernible pattern in sample distribution between the two groups was observed. Our analysis has revealed 30 bacterial species and 45 fecal metabolites that exhibited notable differences in abundance between individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia and normal controls. These alterations in multilevel omics have led to the development of a co-expression network associated with schizophrenia. The perturbed microbial genes and fecal metabolites consistently demonstrated associations with amino acid and lipid metabolism, which play essential roles in regulating the central nervous system.Our results offered profound insights into the impact of imbalanced gut microbiota and metabolism on brain function in individuals with schizophrenia.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2024,DongDong Qi; Peng Liu; YiMeng Wang; XuGuang Tai; ShiFa Ma
39364125,Differences in the human gut microbiota with varying depressive symptom severity scores.,"Depression is a prevalent mental health disorder, and its incidence has increased further because of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The gut microbiome has been suggested as a potential target for mental health treatment because of the bidirectional communication system between the brain and gastrointestinal tract, known as the gut-brain axis. We aimed to investigate the relationship between the human gut microbiome and depression screening by analyzing the abundance and types of microbiomes among individuals living in Japan, where mental health awareness and support may differ from those in other countries owing to cultural factors. We used a data-driven approach to evaluate the gut microbiome of participants who underwent commercial gut microbiota testing services and completed a questionnaire survey that included a test for scoring depressive tendencies. Our data analysis results indicated that no significant differences in gut microbiome composition were found among the groups based on their depression screening scores. However, the results also indicated the potential existence of a few differentially abundant bacterial taxa. Specifically, the detected bacterial changes in abundance suggest that the Bifidobacteriaceae, Streptococcaceae, and Veillonellaceae families are candidates for differentially abundant bacteria. Our findings should contribute to the growing body of research on the relationship between gut microbiome and mental health, highlighting the potential of microbiome-based interventions for depression treatment. The limitations of this study include the lack of clear medical information on the participants' diagnoses. Future research could benefit from a larger sample size and more detailed clinical information.","Bioscience of microbiota, food and health",2024,Yuka Masamura; Ryuichi Kubo; Yuki Midorikawa; Natsuko O Shinozaki; Satoshi Watanabe; Sayumi Maekawa; Aya K Takeda; Tazro Ohta

Results indicated that <i>B. breve</i> BB05 supplementation significantly enriched (<i>p</i> < 0.05) the reduced gut microbial diversity caused by diarrhea. Diarrhea resulted in notable alterations in gut microbiota composition, as exhibited by elevated <i>Collinsella</i> and <i>Streptococcus</i>, alongside substantially decreased <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, <i>Bacteroides</i>, and <i>Prevotella</i>, while <i>B. breve</i> BB05 supplementation partially restored the compromised gut microbiota at both the phylum and genus levels, particularly by increasing <i>Bifidobacterium</i> and <i>Roseburia</i> (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Importantly, questionnaire results suggested that <i>B. breve</i> BB05 administration achieved superior efficacy in relieving diarrhea symptoms and the associated anxiety and depression in college students. An increased fecal concentration of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) was also observed in the probiotic group, while Acetylcholine (ACH), Epinephrine (EPI), and Noradrenaline/Norepinephrine (NANE) reduced, revealing the potential of <i>B. breve</i> BB05 in alleviating anxiety and depression via modulating the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Furthermore, correlation analysis suggested that the altered microbiota and fecal neurotransmitters were closely associated with the mental symptoms. These results endorse <i>B. breve</i> BB05 intervention as a promising and innovative approach to alleviate both diarrhea and mental health conditions among college students.",Nutrients,2024,Yufan Wang; Yufei Wang; Kunpeng Ding; Yuhan Liu; Dingming Liu; Weijun Chen; Xinyi Zhang; Chuanlin Luo; Hongyan Zhang; Tangchang Xu; Tingtao Chen
38963982,Jianpi Jiedu decoction suppresses colorectal cancer growth by inhibiting M2 polarization of TAMs through the tryptophan metabolism-AhR pathway.,"Traditional Chinese medicine, JianpiJiedu decoction (JPJDF), has been utilized in colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment for over forty years. The potential of JPJDF to inhibit CRC through modulation of intestinal microbiota and their metabolites remains uncertain.This study aims to further investigate the therapeutic mechanisms of JPJDF in CRC.CAC mouse models were developed using azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). Intestinal tissues and contents underwent 16S rRNA gene sequencing and untargeted metabolomics analysis. Serum levels of IL-1β and TNF-α were measured using ELISA. Immunohistochemistry was utilized to assess the expression of Ki67, ZO-1, Occludin, CD68, and CD206. Furthermore, western blotting was performed to evaluate the protein expression of AhR and NF-κB.JPJDF inhibited colorectal tumourigenesis in AOM/DSS treated mice, while also suppressing tumor cell proliferation and upregulating the expression of tight junction proteins. The results of 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis revealed that JPJDF altered intestinal microbiota composition by increasing the abundance of beneficial bacteria. Additionally, JPJDF reduced tryptophan metabolites, effectively alleviating inflammation and significantly restoring intestinal barrier function in CAC mice. Molecular biology experiments confirmed that JPJDF suppressed the expression levels of AhR and M2-type tumor-associated macrophages, thereby promoting anti-tumor immunity and exerting inhibitory effects on CAC growth.JPJDF can regulate the tryptophan metabolism-AhR pathway by modulating the gut microbiota, reducing intestinal inflammation, improving intestinal barrier function, enhancing anti-tumor immunity, and effectively inhibiting CAC growth.",International immunopharmacology,2024,Yonglong Chang; Qinling Ou; Xuhui Zhou; Kechao Nie; Piao Zheng; Jinhui Liu; Linzi Chen; Haixia Yan; Duanyang Guo; Sifang Zhang
39201866,Contributions of Artificial Intelligence to Analysis of Gut Microbiota in Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Systematic Review.,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder whose etiology is not known today, but everything indicates that it is multifactorial. For example, genetic and epigenetic factors seem to be involved in the etiology of ASD. In recent years, there has been an increase in studies on the implications of gut microbiota (GM) on the behavior of children with ASD given that dysbiosis in GM may trigger the onset, development and progression of ASD through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. At the same time, significant progress has occurred in the development of artificial intelligence (AI).The aim of the present study was to perform a systematic review of articles using AI to analyze GM in individuals with ASD. In line with the PRISMA model, 12 articles using AI to analyze GM in ASD were selected.Outcomes reveal that the majority of relevant studies on this topic have been conducted in China (33.3%) and Italy (25%), followed by the Netherlands (16.6%), Mexico (16.6%) and South Korea (8.3%).The bacteria <i>Bifidobacterium</i> is the most relevant biomarker with regard to ASD. Although AI provides a very promising approach to data analysis, caution is needed to avoid the over-interpretation of preliminary findings. A first step must be taken to analyze GM in a representative general population and ASD samples in order to obtain a GM standard according to age, sex and country. Thus, more work is required to bridge the gap between AI in mental health research and clinical care in ASD.","Children (Basel, Switzerland)",2024,Pau Climent-Pérez; Agustín Ernesto Martínez-González; Pedro Andreo-Martínez
38857554,Dietary sulforaphane glucosinolate mitigates depression-like behaviors in mice with hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury: A role of the gut-liver-brain axis.,"Nutrition has been increasingly recognized for its use in mental health. Depression is commonly observed in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD). Building on our recent findings of depression-like behaviors in mice with hepatic ischemia/reperfusion (HI/R) injury, mediated by the gut-liver-brain axis, this study explored the potential influence of dietary sulforaphane glucosinolate (SGS) on these behaviors. Behavioral assessments for depression-like behaviors were conducted 7 days post either sham or HI/R injury surgery. Dietary intake of SGS significantly prevented splenomegaly, systemic inflammation, depression-like behaviors, and downregulation of synaptic proteins in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of HI/R-injured mice. Through 16S rRNA analysis and untargeted metabolomic analyses, distinct bacterial profiles and metabolites were identified between control + HI/R group and SGS + HI/R group. Correlations were observed between the relative abundance of gut microbiota and both behavioral outcomes and blood metabolites. These findings suggest that SGS intake could mitigate depression-like phenotypes in mice with HI/R injury, potentially through the gut-liver-brain axis. Additionally, SGS, found in crucial vegetables like broccoli, could offer prophylactic nutritional benefits for depression in patients with CLD.",Journal of psychiatric research,2024,Yong Yang; Akifumi Eguchi; Chisato Mori; Kenji Hashimoto
39078446,Exploring the Potential of Probiotics and Prebiotics in Major Depression: From Molecular Function to Clinical Therapy.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) represents a complex and challenging mental health condition with multifaceted etiology. Recent research exploring the gut-brain axis has shed light on the potential influence of gut microbiota on mental health, offering novel avenues for therapeutic intervention. This paper reviews current evidence on the role of prebiotics and probiotics in the context of MDD treatment. Clinical studies assessing the effects of prebiotic and probiotic interventions have demonstrated promising results, showcasing improvements in depression symptoms and metabolic parameters in certain populations. Notably, prebiotics and probiotics have shown the capacity to modulate inflammatory markers, cortisol levels, and neurotransmitter pathways linked to MDD. However, existing research presents varied outcomes, underscoring the need for further investigation into specific microbial strains, dosage optimization, and long-term effects. Future research should aim at refining personalized interventions, elucidating mechanisms of action, and establishing standardized protocols to integrate these interventions into clinical practice. While prebiotics and probiotics offer potential adjunctive therapies for MDD, continued interdisciplinary efforts are vital to harnessing their full therapeutic potential and reshaping the landscape of depression treatment paradigms.",Probiotics and antimicrobial proteins,2024,Xin Yuan; Jianbo Chai; Wenqiang Xu; Yonghou Zhao
39461950,Microbial biomarker discovery in Parkinson's disease through a network-based approach.,"Associations between the gut microbiota and Parkinson's disease (PD) have been widely investigated. However, the replicable biomarkers for PD diagnosis across multiple populations remain elusive. Herein, we performed a meta-analysis to investigate the pivotal role of the gut microbiome in PD and its potential diagnostic implications. Six 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequence datasets from five independent studies were integrated, encompassing 550 PD and 456 healthy control samples. The analysis revealed significant alterations in microbial composition and alpha and beta diversity, emphasizing altered gut microbiota in PD. Specific microbial taxa, including Faecalibacterium, Roseburia, and Coprococcus_2, known as butyrate producers, were notably diminished in PD, potentially contributing to intestinal inflammation. Conversely, genera such as Akkermansia and Bilophila exhibited increased relative abundances. A network-based algorithm called NetMoss was utilized to identify potential biomarkers of PD. Afterwards, a classification model incorporating 11 optimized genera demonstrated high performance. Further functional analyses indicated enrichment in pathways related to neurodegeneration and metabolic pathways. These findings illuminate the intricate relationship between the gut microbiota and PD, offering insights into potential therapeutic interventions and personalized diagnostic strategies.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2024,Zhe Zhao; Jing Chen; Danhua Zhao; Baoyu Chen; Qi Wang; Yuan Li; Junyi Chen; Chaobo Bai; Xintong Guo; Nan Hu; Bingwei Zhang; Rongsheng Zhao; Junliang Yuan
39200093,Should Pregnant Women Consume Probiotics to Combat Endocrine-Disrupting Chemical-Induced Health Risks to Their Unborn Offspring?,"Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) have become so pervasive in our environment and daily lives that it is impossible to avoid contact with such compounds, including pregnant women seeking to minimize exposures to themselves and their unborn children. Developmental exposure of humans and rodent models to bisphenol A (BPA) and other EDCs is linked to increased anxiogenic behaviors, learning and memory deficits, and decreased socio-sexual behaviors. Prenatal exposure to BPA and other EDCs leads to longstanding and harmful effects on gut microbiota with reductions in beneficial bacteria, i.e., gut dysbiosis, and such microbial changes are linked to host changes in fecal metabolites, including those involved in carbohydrate metabolism and synthesis, and neurobehavioral alterations in adulthood, in particular, social and cognitive deficits. Gut dysbiosis is increasingly being recognized as a key driver of a myriad of diseases, ranging from metabolic, cardiovascular, reproductive, and neurobehavioral disorders via the gut-microbiome-brain axis. Thus, EDCs might induce indirect effects on physical and mental health by acting as microbiome-disrupting chemicals. Findings raise the important question as to whether pregnant women should consume a probiotic supplement to mitigate pernicious effects of EDCs, especially BPA, on themselves and their unborn offspring. Current studies investigating the effects of maternal probiotic supplementation on pregnant women's health and that of their unborn offspring will be reviewed. Data will inform on the potential application of probiotic supplementation to reverse harmful effects of EDCs, especially BPA, in pregnant women unwittingly exposed to these compounds and striving to give their offspring the best start in life.",Biomedicines,2024,Cheryl S Rosenfeld
38959280,Pilot study assessing gut microbial diversity among sexual and gender minority young adults.,"Evidence supports that people identifying as a sexual or gender minority (SGMs) experience minority-related stress resulting from discrimination or expectations of prejudice, and that this is associated with increased mental and physical health problems compared to cisgender heterosexuals. However, the biological mechanisms driving minority-related stress impacts remain unknown, including the role of the gut microbiome. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the relationship between SGM status and gut microbiome health among young adults attending a 4-year university. To this end, a prospective pilot study was completed in the fall and spring semesters of 2021-22. Self-identified SGMs (N = 22) and cisgender-heterosexuals (CIS-HET, N = 43) completed in-person interviews to provide mental health data and demographic information. Nail and saliva samples were collected at the time of interview to quantify chronic and acute cortisol. Stool samples were collected within 48 hours of interview for microbiome analysis. Assessment of the gut microbiota identified a significant reduction in alpha diversity among the SGM group, even when adjusting for mental health outcome. SGM group showed trends for higher abundance of microbes in phylum Bacteroidetes and lower abundance of microbes in phyla Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria compared to the CIS-HET group. These findings support that the gut microbiome could be contributing to negative health effects among the SGM community.",PloS one,2024,Ashley Guy; Shannon McAuliffe; Robbie Cross; Yue Zhang; Richard E Kennedy; Norman R Estes; Samantha Giordano-Mooga; Christine Loyd
39293692,Depletion of the paternal gut microbiome alters sperm small RNAs and impacts offspring physiology and behavior in mice.,"The paternal environment prior to conception has been demonstrated to influence offspring physiology and behavior, with the sperm epigenome (including noncoding RNAs) proposed as a potential facilitator of non-genetic inheritance. Whilst the maternal gut microbiome has been established as an important influence on offspring development, the impact of the paternal gut microbiome on offspring development, health and behavior is largely unknown. Gut microbiota have major influences on immunity, and thus we hypothesized that they may be relevant to paternal immune activation (PIA) modulating epigenetic inheritance in mice. Therefore, male C57BL/6J mice (F0) were orally administered non-absorbable antibiotics via drinking water in order to substantially deplete their gut microbiome. Four weeks after administration of the antibiotics (gut microbiome depletion), F0 male mice were then mated with naïve female mice. The F1 offspring of the microbiome-depleted males had reduced body weight as well as altered gut morphology (shortened colon length). F1 females showed significant alterations in affective behaviors, including measures of anxiety and depressive-like behaviors, indicating altered development. Analysis of small noncoding RNAs in the sperm of F0 mice revealed that gut microbiome depletion is associated with differential expression of 8 different PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), each of which has the potential to modulate the expression of multiple downstream gene targets, and thus influence epigenetic inheritance and offspring development. This study demonstrates that the gut-germline axis influences sperm small RNA profiles and offspring physiology, with specific impacts on offspring affective and/or coping behaviors. These findings may have broader implications for other animal species with comparable gut microbiota, intergenerational epigenetics and developmental biology, including humans.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2024,Bethany A Masson; Pamudika Kiridena; Da Lu; Elizabeth A Kleeman; Sonali N Reisinger; Wendy Qin; William J Davies; Rikeish R Muralitharan; Hamdi A Jama; Simona Antonacci; Francine Z Marques; Carolina Gubert; Anthony J Hannan
39134294,Agmatine modulation of gut-brain axis alleviates dysbiosis-induced depression-like behavior in rats.,"Depression is a global health concern affecting nearly 280 million individuals. It not only imposes a significant burden on economies and healthcare systems but also manifests complex physiological connections and consequences. Agmatine, a putative neuromodulator derived primarily from beneficial gut microbes specially Lactobacillus, has emerged as a potential therapeutic agent for mental health. The microbiota-gut-brain axis is involved in the development of depression through the peripheral nervous system, endocrine system, and immune system and may be a key factor in the effect of agmatine. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the potential mechanism of agmatine in antibiotic-induced dysbiosis and depression-like behavior in rats, focusing on its modulation of the gut-brain axis. Depression-like behavior associated with dysbiosis was induced through a seven-day regimen of the broad-spectrum antibiotic, comprising ampicillin and metronidazole and validated through microbial, biochemical, and behavioral alterations. On day 8, antibiotic-treated rats exhibited loose fecal consistency, altered fecal microbiota, and depression-like behavior in forced swim test. Pro-inflammatory cytokines were elevated, while agmatine and monoamine levels decreased in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Antibiotic administration disrupted tight junction proteins in the ileum, affecting gut architecture. Oral administration of agmatine alone or combined with probiotics significantly reversed antibiotic-induced dysbiosis, restoring gut microbiota and mitigating depression-like behaviors. This intervention also restored neuro-inflammatory markers, increased agmatine and monoamine levels, and preserved gut integrity. The study highlights the regulatory role of endogenous agmatine in the gut-brain axis in broad-spectrum antibiotic induced dysbiosis and associated depression-like behavior.",European journal of pharmacology,2024,Sandip Rahangdale; Pankaj Deshmukh; Shivkumar Sammeta; Manish Aglawe; Mayur Kale; Milind Umekar; Nandkishor Kotagale; Brijesh Taksande
38968876,"A further examination of growth factors, T helper 1 polarization, and the gut microbiome in major depression: Associations with reoccurrence of illness, cognitive functions, suicidal behaviors, and quality of life.","Growth factors, T helper (Th)1 polarization, and the microbiome are involved in the pathophysiology of major depression (MDD). It remains unclear whether the combination of these three pathways could enhance the accuracy of predicting the features of MDD, including recurrence of illness (ROI), suicidal behaviors and the phenome. We measured serum stem cell factor (SCF), stem cell growth factor (SCGF), stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the ratio of serum Th1/Th2 cytokines (zTh1-zTh2), and the abundances of gut microbiome taxa by analyzing stool samples using 16S rDNA sequencing from 32 MDD patients and 37 healthy controls. The results show that serum SCF is significantly lower and VEGF increased in MDD. Adverse childhood experiences (ACE) and ROI are significantly associated with lowered SCF and increasing VEGF. Lifetime and current suicidal behaviors are strongly predicted (63.5%) by an increased VEGF/SCF ratio, Th1 polarization, a gut microbiome enterotype indicating gut dysbiosis, and lowered abundance of Dorea and Faecalobacterium. Around 80.5% of the variance in the phenome's severity is explained by ROI, ACEs, and lowered Parabacteroides distasonis and Clostridium IV abundances. A large part of the variance in health-related quality of life (54.1%) is explained by the VEGF/SCF ratio, Th1 polarization, ACE, and male sex. In conclusion, key features of MDD are largely predicted by the cumulative effects of ACE, Th1 polarization, aberrations in growth factors and the gut microbiome with increased pathobionts but lowered beneficial symbionts.",Journal of psychiatric research,2024,Michael Maes; Bo Zhou; Asara Vasupanrajit; Ketsupar Jirakran; Pavit Klomkliew; Prangwalai Chanchaem; Chavit Tunvirachaisakul; Kitiporn Plaimas; Apichat Suratanee; Jing Li; Abbas F Almulla; Sunchai Payungporn
39316970,Christensenella minuta mitigates behavioral and cardiometabolic hallmarks of social defeat stress.,"Psychological stress during early development and adolescence may increase the risk of psychiatric and cardiometabolic comorbidities in adulthood. The gut microbiota has been associated with mental health problems such as depression and anxiety and with cardiometabolic disease, but the potential role of the gut microbiota in their comorbidity is not well understood. We investigated the effects and mode of action of the intestinal bacterium Christensenella minuta DSM 32891 on stress-induced mental health and cardiometabolic disturbances in a mouse model of social defeat stress. We demonstrate that administered C. minuta alleviates chronic stress-induced depressive, anxiogenic and antisocial behavior. These effects are attributed to the bacterium's ability to modulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which mediates the stress response. This included the oversecretion of corticosterone and the overexpression of its receptors, as well as the metabolism of dopamine (DA) and the expression of its receptors (D1, D2L and D2S). Additionally, C. minuta administration reduced chronically induced inflammation in plasma, spleen and some brain areas, which likely contribute to the recovery of physical and behavioral function. Furthermore, C. minuta administration prevented chronic stress-induced cardiovascular damage by regulating key enzymes mediating liver fibrosis and oxidative stress. Finally, C. minuta increased the abundance of bacteria associated with mental health. Overall, our study highlights the potential of microbiota-directed interventions to alleviate both the physical and mental effects of chronic stress.",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2024,A Agusti; G V Molina-Mendoza; M Tamayo; V Rossini; M C Cenit; C Frances-Cuesta; V Tolosa-Enguis; E M Gómez Del Pulgar; A Flor-Duro; Y Sanz
39422256,A gut-focused perinatal dietary intervention is associated with lower alpha diversity of the infant gut microbiota: results from a randomised controlled trial.,"In experimental models, the prenatal diet influences gut microbiota composition in mothers and offspring; however, it is unclear whether this occurs in humans. We investigated the effects of a gut-focused perinatal dietary intervention on maternal and infant gut microbiota composition four weeks after birth.This randomised controlled trial randomised pregnant women to receive dietary advice as part of standard care, or additionally receive a dietary intervention focused on the Australian Dietary Guidelines and increasing prebiotic and probiotic/fermented food intakes (ACTRN12616000936426). Study assessments occurred from gestation week 26 (baseline) to four weeks postpartum (follow-up). Faecal samples, collected at baseline for mothers, and follow-up for mothers and infants, underwent 16SrRNA sequencing. The primary outcome was a between-group mean difference in infant faecal Shannon index. Secondary outcomes included between-group differences in other microbiota measures, including maternal change from baseline CLR-transformed <i>Prevotella</i> abundance.Forty-four women and 45 infants completed the study. The mean Shannon index of infants in the intervention group was -0.35 (95% CI: -0.64, -0.06, SD: 0.52) units lower than control group infants, corresponding to a medium effect size (Cohen's D: -0.74, 95% CI: -1.34, -0.13). The findings were similar using other metrics of α-diversity. There were no between-group differences in β-diversity, nor any differentially abundant taxa in infants. The intervention increased abundances of the genus <i>Prevotella</i> in mothers compared to controls.This gut-focused perinatal dietary intervention was associated with differences in the maternal and infant gut microbiota composition.

38993577,"Ageing, Cognitive Decline, and Effects of Physical Exercise: Complexities, and Considerations from Animal Models.","In our ageing global population, the cognitive decline associated with dementia and neurodegenerative diseases represents a major healthcare problem. To date, there are no effective treatments for age-related cognitive impairment, thus preventative strategies are urgently required. Physical exercise is gaining traction as a non-pharmacological approach to promote brain health. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN), a unique form of brain plasticity which is necessary for certain cognitive functions declines with age and is enhanced in response to exercise. Accumulating evidence from research in rodents suggests that physical exercise has beneficial effects on cognition through its proneurogenic capabilities. Given ethical and technical limitations in human studies, preclinical research in rodents is crucial for a better understanding of such exercise-induced brain and behavioural changes. In this review, exercise paradigms used in preclinical research are compared. We provide an overview of the effects of different exercise paradigms on age-related cognitive decline from middle-age until older-age. We discuss the relationship between the age-related decrease in AHN and the potential impact of exercise on mitigating this decline. We highlight the emerging literature on the impact of exercise on gut microbiota during ageing and consider the role of the gut-brain axis as a future possible strategy to optimize exercise-enhanced cognitive function. Finally, we propose a guideline for designing optimal exercise protocols in rodent studies, which would inform clinical research and contribute to developing preventative strategies for age-related cognitive decline.","Brain plasticity (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2024,Maria Giovanna Caruso; Sarah Nicolas; Paul J Lucassen; Joram D Mul; Olivia F O'Leary; Yvonne M Nolan
39033825,Core antibiotic resistance genes mediate gut microbiota to intervene in the treatment of major depressive disorder.,"The relationship between depression and gut microbiota remains unclear, but an important role of gut microbiota has been verified. The relationship between gut microbiota and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) may be a potential new explanatory pathway.We collected samples from 63 depressed patients and 30 healthy controls for metagenomic sequencing. The two groups' microbiota characteristics, functional characteristics, and ARG differences were analyzed.We obtained 30 differential KEGG orthologs (KOs) and their producers in 5 genera and 7 species by HUMAnN3. We found 6 KOs from Weissella_cibaria and Lactobacillus_plantaru are potentially coring functional mechanism of gut microbiota. Different metabolites including sphingolipids, pyrans, prenol lipids, and isoflavonoids also showed significance between MDD and HC. We detected 48 significantly different ARGs: 5 ARGs up-regulated and 43 ARGs down-regulated in MDD compared to HC. Based on Cox model results, Three ARGs significantly affected drug efficacy (ARG29, ARG105, and ARG111). Eggerthella, Weissella, and Lactobacillus were correlated with different core ARGs, which indicated different mechanisms in affecting MDD.The present study needs to be replicated in different ethnic groups. At the same time, a larger Chinese cohort study and detailed experimental verification are also the key to further discussion.Our findings suggest that ARGs play a role in the interplay between major depressive disorder and gut microbiota. The role of ARGs should be taken into account when understanding the relationship between depression and gut microbiota.",Journal of affective disorders,2024,Zaiquan Dong; Ke Han; Qinglian Xie; Chunting Lin; Xiaoling Shen; Yanni Hao; Jin Li; Haizhen Xu; Lin He; Tao Yu; Weihong Kuang
39371767,Exploring the Renoprotective Potential of Bioactive Nutraceuticals in Chronic Kidney Disease Progression: A Narrative Review.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a condition that is characterized by progressive loss of kidney function over time. A substantial increase in the burden of CKD is evident globally, attributed to multifactorial conditions like an expanding aging population, rising diabetes and hypertension rates, and more significant exposures to risk factors associated with the environment and lifestyle. Nutraceuticals are substances that are usually considered a food or an active part of a food that provides medical or health benefits, including the prevention and treatment of a disease. The aim is to review the positive role of nutraceuticals in managing CKD. A narrative review is generated, extracting the papers from databases like Web of Science, Scopus, ScienceDirect, ResearchGate, and PubMed. Animal and human trials focusing on the effect of different nutraceuticals on the initial stage of kidney disease, i.e., stages 1, 2, and 3 of CKD, were included. The review's outcome is understanding the effectiveness of nutraceuticals that have shown positive results in CKD conditions. Active compounds include ubiquinone, curcumin, nitrates, nitrites, lycopene, and resveratrol. These bioactive components are also beneficial for other comorbid conditions like diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular conditions that have an eminent adverse effect on CKD. Lycopene, coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), resveratrol, curcumin, and flavonoids have positively impacted CKD complications. Nutraceuticals hold great promise for individuals with CKD in the coming years, offering diverse potential benefits. These include delivering vital antioxidant and anti-inflammatory support to alleviate oxidative stress and inflammation, helping to regulate blood pressure and lipid levels for improved cardiovascular health, promoting optimal renal function to sustain kidney health, assisting in maintaining electrolyte balance, warding off complications, influencing gut microbiota for enhanced digestive well-being, and ultimately elevating the overall quality of life, for those managing CKD.",Cureus,2024,Anindita Ghosh; Arti Muley; Sakshi Bhat; Archana Ainapure
38863592,The effect of prebiotic and probiotic food consumption on anxiety severity: a nationwide study in Korea.,"Over the past decade, research has reported that diet and gut health affect anxiety symptoms through changes in the gut microbiota. Therefore, the introduction of prebiotic and probiotic food favorable for the intestinal microbiota is necessary to improve the mental health of the host. The purpose of this study was to examine the contribution of prebiotic and probiotic foods to lowering anxiety symptoms using a large, nationwide population-based database.The study population included 4,317 individuals 19 to 64 years of age who participated in the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES VII-3, 2019-2021). A food frequency questionnaire was used to evaluate prebiotic and probiotic food consumption. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment 7-item scale (GAD-7) assessed the severity of anxiety symptoms. The effect of prebiotic and probiotic food consumption on anxiety severity was analyzed using multiple logistic regression.Anxiety symptom severity was significantly lower in the highest prebiotic and/or probiotic food consumption tertiles compared to the lowest food consumption tertile. We also found a sex difference in the odds ratio for anxiety symptoms. The consumption of prebiotic food was significantly associated with the highest odds of anxiety among both men and women. However, probiotic food had a significant beneficial effect on lowering anxiety symptoms in men but not in women.Our finding suggests that prebiotic and probiotic food consumption might confer a beneficial influence on anxiety symptoms. Further research is required for a deeper understanding into the mechanisms of the positive effects of prebiotics and probiotics on anxiety.",Frontiers in nutrition,2024,Hyejin Tae; Tae-Suk Kim
38979127,Washed microbiota transplantation improves sleep quality in patients with sleep disorder by the gut-brain axis.,"The clinical impact of washed microbiota transplantation (WMT) from healthy donors in sleep disorder (SD) patients is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effect of WMT in SD patients.The clinical data were collected from patients with different indications receiving 1-3 courses of WMT, divided into two groups by 7 points of PSQI scale. The score of PQSI and SF-36 scale was used to assess the improvement in sleep quality and life quality among patients with sleep disorders following WMT. Finally, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was performed on fecal samples of patients with sleep disorders before and after WMT.WMT significantly improved sleep quality in patients with sleep disorder in the short and medium term. WMT significantly improved sleep latency, sleep time and total score in the short term. WMT significantly improved sleep quality and total score in the medium term. In terms of sleep quality and sleep latency, the improvement value also increased with the increase of treatment course, and the improvement effect of multiple treatment course was better than that of single and double treatment course. In the total score, the improvement effect of double and multiple treatment was better than that of single treatment. WMT also improved quality of life in the sleep disorder group. WMT significantly improved general health, vitality, social function and mental health in the short term. WMT significantly improved role-physical, general health, vitality, and mental health in the medium term. WMT regulated the disturbed gut microbiota in patients with sleep disorders. In the normal sleep group, WMT had no effect on the decline of sleep quality in the short, medium and long term, and had an improving effect on the quality of life.WMT could significantly improve sleep quality and life quality in patients with sleep disorders with no adverse events. The improvement in sleep quality resulting from WMT could lead to an overall enhancement in life quality. WMT could be a potentially effective treatment for patients with sleep disorders by regulating the gut microbiota.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2024,Hongxin He; Manqing Li; Yifan Qiu; Zhiqing Wu; Lei Wu
39360531,The Mechanisms and Quality Markers of Anti-rheumatoid Arthritis of Traditional Chinese Medicine.,"RA is a recurrent autoimmune disease that has significant adverse effects on the physical and mental health of patients. Traditional Chinese medicine has shown significant advantages in the prevention and treatment of RA. Numerous clinical and experimental studies have confirmed that traditional Chinese medicine components have clear therapeutic effects and minimal adverse reactions in treating RA. The research on traditional Chinese medicine for the prevention and treatment of RA has become a hot topic in the field of autoimmune diseases.The related references about the mechanisms and Q-markers of anti-RA of traditional Chinese medicine in this review were collected from Willy, SpringLink, Web of Science, Elsevier, PubMed, SciFinder, Scopus, ACS publications, Baidu Scholar, Google Scholar, and CNKI.The traditional Chinese medicine components such as terpenoids, flavonoids, and alkaloids have significant anti-RA effects, and their mechanisms are mainly to inhibit NF-κB signaling pathway, inhibit the proliferation of RA fibroblasts like synovial cells, and regulate Th1/Th2 cell balance, and so on. Predicting and studying the Q-markers of traditional Chinese medicine anti-RA by plant phylogeny and chemical componentss, traditional medicinal properties, pharmacokinetics, component measurability, correlation between composition and efficacy, and gut microbiota will provide scientific foundations for the research and further development of anti-RA traditional Chinese medicine.The active components of traditional Chinese medicine exhibited the characteristic of multiple mechanisms in the treatment of RA, such as terpenoids had anti-angiogenesis effects, flavonoids had anti-inflammatory and cartilage protective effects, and alkaloids had antiinflammatory and analgesic effects. The proposal of Q-markers for anti-RA provided new research ideas for promoting the development of new drugs for anti-RA and ensuring the safety and effectiveness of clinical medications.",Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening,2024,Mozili Adu; Yongwei Qiu; Qinge Ma; Guoyue Zhong; Jia-Zeng Guo; Rongrui Wei

39126817,"Interplay of yoga, physical activity, and probiotics in irritable bowel syndrome management: A double-blind randomized study.","This study aimed to explore the synergistic impact of online yoga, mindfulness practices, and probiotics on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) by evaluating changes in physical fitness, mental health, and gut microbiota composition.The six-week randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial included 31 IBS patients categorized into three groups: online yoga with probiotics (EP), online yoga with a placebo (EC), and probiotics only (P). Assessments involved physical fitness tests, subjective questionnaires (IBS-QOL, BSRS-5), and gut microbiome analysis.Participants self-collected stool samples and were given a set of questionnaires at baseline and after six weeks of intervention. Their symptoms were measured by changes in the gut microbiota, physical fitness and quality of life, and psychological well-being.The EP group demonstrated improved cardiovascular endurance (P < 0.001) and a significant reduction in Klebsiella bacterial strains (P < 0.05). Both the EP and EC groups exhibited significantly decreased IBS-QOL scores (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively), indicating enhanced quality of life. While BSRS-5 scores decreased in both groups, the reduction was statistically insignificant.Integrating online yoga, mindfulness practices, and probiotics demonstrated comprehensive benefits for IBS patients. This intervention improved physical fitness and mental well-being and positively influenced gut microbiota composition. The study highlights the potential of this multifaceted approach in managing IBS symptoms and enhancing overall health, emphasizing the relevance of the gut-muscle-brain axis in understanding and addressing IBS complexities.Taiwanese Registry of Institutional Review Board IRBHP210009/CH11000259.",Complementary therapies in clinical practice,2024,Wei-Cheng Chao; Jen-Chieh Huang; San-Land Young; Ching-Lin Wu; Jui-Chi Shih; Lun-De Liao; Bill Cheng
38806681,Temperature-dependent differences in mouse gut motility are mediated by stress.,"Researchers have advocated elevating mouse housing temperatures from the conventional ~22 °C to the mouse thermoneutral point of 30 °C to enhance translational research. However, the impact of environmental temperature on mouse gastrointestinal physiology remains largely unexplored. Here we show that mice raised at 22 °C exhibit whole gut transit speed nearly twice as fast as those raised at 30 °C, primarily driven by a threefold increase in colon transit speed. Furthermore, gut microbiota composition differs between the two temperatures but does not dictate temperature-dependent differences in gut motility. Notably, increased stress signals from the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis at 22 °C have a pivotal role in mediating temperature-dependent differences in gut motility. Pharmacological and genetic depletion of the stress hormone corticotropin-releasing hormone slows gut motility in stressed 22 °C mice but has no comparable effect in relatively unstressed 30 °C mice. In conclusion, our findings highlight that colder mouse facility temperatures significantly increase gut motility through hormonal stress pathways.",Lab animal,2024,Alvin Han; Courtney Hudson-Paz; Beatriz G Robinson; Laren Becker; Amanda Jacobson; Julia A Kaltschmidt; Jennifer L Garrison; Ami S Bhatt; Denise M Monack
38931307,Microbiome and Metabolite Analysis Insight into the Potential of Shrimp Head Hydrolysate to Alleviate Depression-like Behaviour in Growth-Period Mice Exposed to Chronic Stress.,"Chronic stress (CS) endangers the physical and mental health of adolescents. Therefore, alleviating and preventing such negative health impacts are a top priority. This study explores the effect of feeding shrimp head hydrolysate (SHH) on gut microbiota, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and neurotransmitters in growing C57BL/6 mice subjected to chronic unpredictable mild stress. Mice in the model group and three SHH groups were exposed to CS for 44 days, distilled water and SHH doses of 0.18, 0.45, 0.90 g/kg·BW were given respectively by gavage daily for 30 days from the 15th day. The results showed that SHH can significantly reverse depression-like behaviour, amino acids degradation, α diversity and β diversity, proportion of Firmicutes and Bacteroidota, abundance of genera such as <i>Muribaculaceae</i>, <i>Bacteroides</i>, <i>Prevotellaceae_UCG-001</i>, <i>Parabacteroides</i> and <i>Alistipes</i>, concentration of five short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), 5-HT and glutamate induced by CS. <i>Muribaculaceae</i> and butyric acid may be a controlled target. This study highlights the potential and broad application of SHH as an active ingredient in food to combat chronic stress damage.",Nutrients,2024,Lianhua Hu; Weichang Ye; Qi Deng; Chen Wang; Jinjin Luo; Ling Huang; Zhijia Fang; Lijun Sun; Ravi Gooneratne
39360283,From gut to brain: unveiling probiotic effects through a neuroimaging perspective-A systematic review of randomized controlled trials.,"The gut-brain axis, a bidirectional communication network between the gastrointestinal system and the brain, significantly influences mental health and behavior. Probiotics, live microorganisms conferring health benefits, have garnered attention for their potential to modulate this axis. However, their effects on brain function through gut microbiota modulation remain controversial. This systematic review examines the effects of probiotics on brain activity and functioning, focusing on randomized controlled trials using both resting-state and task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) methodologies. Studies investigating probiotic effects on brain activity in healthy individuals and clinical populations (i.e., major depressive disorder and irritable bowel syndrome) were identified. In healthy individuals, task-based fMRI studies indicated that probiotics modulate brain activity related to emotional regulation and cognitive processing, particularly in high-order areas such as the amygdala, precuneus, and orbitofrontal cortex. Resting-state fMRI studies revealed changes in connectivity patterns, such as increased activation in the Salience Network and reduced activity in the Default Mode Network. In clinical populations, task-based fMRI studies showed that probiotics could normalize brain function in patients with major depressive disorder and irritable bowel syndrome. Resting-state fMRI studies further suggested improved connectivity in mood-regulating networks, specifically in the subcallosal cortex, amygdala and hippocampus. Despite promising findings, methodological variability and limited sample sizes emphasize the need for rigorous, longitudinal research to clarify the beneficial effects of probiotics on the gut-brain axis and mental health.",Frontiers in nutrition,2024,Annachiara Crocetta; Donato Liloia; Tommaso Costa; Sergio Duca; Franco Cauda; Jordi Manuello
38866914,"Elevated fecal calprotectin is associated with gut microbial dysbiosis, altered serum markers and clinical outcomes in older individuals.","Fecal calprotectin is an established marker of gut inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Elevated levels of fecal calprotectin as well as gut microbial dysbiosis have also been observed in other clinical conditions. However, systemic and multi-omics alterations linked to elevated fecal calprotectin in older individuals remain unclear. This study comprehensively investigated the relationship between fecal calprotectin levels, gut microbiome composition, serum inflammation and targeted metabolomics markers, and relevant lifestyle and medical data in a large sample of older individuals (n = 735; mean age ± SD: 68.7 ± 6.3) from the TREND cohort study. Low (0-50 μg/g; n = 602), moderate (> 50-100 μg/g; n = 64) and high (> 100 μg/g; n = 62) fecal calprotectin groups were stratified. Several pro-inflammatory gut microbial genera were significantly increased and short-chain fatty acid producing genera were decreased in high vs. low calprotectin groups. In serum, IL-17C, CCL19 and the toxic metabolite indoxyl sulfate were increased in high vs. low fecal calprotectin groups. These changes were partially mediated by the gut microbiota. Moreover, the high fecal calprotectin group showed increased BMI and a higher disease prevalence of heart attack and obesity. Our findings contribute to the understanding of fecal calprotectin as a marker of gut dysbiosis and its broader systemic and clinical implications in older individuals.",Scientific reports,2024,Sebastian Heinzel; Jenna Jureczek; Veera Kainulainen; Anni I Nieminen; Ulrike Suenkel; Anna-Katharina von Thaler; Christoph Kaleta; Gerhard W Eschweiler; Kathrin Brockmann; Velma T E Aho; Petri Auvinen; Walter Maetzler; Daniela Berg; Filip Scheperjans
39392025,"Microbiological bases of obsessive‑compulsive disorder - the role of viruses, bacteria, and parasites in the onset and progression of OCD.","Obsessive‑compulsive disorder (OCD) is a current topic of discussion nowadays. OCD presents a variety of different etiologies including environmental, viral, cognitive, or genetic aspects. In this article, we focused on the possible correlation between various infectious diseases as well as generally the relationship between viruses, bacteria, and parasites, and an increased OCD risk. In this narrative review, we analyzed different types of articles found on PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus, as well as the articles of the National Institute of Mental Health. Searching criteria included articles from 1991 till the end of November, research involving human and animal patients (including monkeys and rats), and research published in English. Research showed a relationship between Herpes simplex virus, Rubella virus, Human immunodeficiency virus, Borna disease virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Toxoplasma gondii, streptococcal infections, as well as gut microbiota and increased OCD risk. The possible mechanisms of this relation include neuroinflammation, brain tissue damage, autoimmune processes, and impairments in neurotransmitter levels. Infections caused by Varicella zoster virus, Measles virus, Mumps virus, Epstein‑Barr virus, Cytomegalovirus, or Borrelia Burgdorferi may also contribute to the increased risk of OCD. Reports showed an increased frequency of OCD occurrence in a group of infected people compared to a healthy group. However, there is no evidence of the influence of Influenza virus, Coxsackie virus, Poliovirus, Parvovirus B19, Enterovirus 71, West Nile virus, Treponema Pallidum, or Toxocara infections on the OCD risk. There is a significant relationship between various infectious diseases and an increased OCD risk.

39346901,"Supplementation with <i>Lactobacillus helveticus</i> NS8 alleviated behavioral, neural, endocrine, and microbiota abnormalities in an endogenous rat model of depression.","Major depressive disorder is a condition involving microbiota-gut-brain axis dysfunction. Increasing research aims to improve depression through gut microbiota regulation, including interventions such as probiotics, prebiotics, and fecal microbiota transplants. However, most research focuses on exogenous depression induced by chronic stress or drugs, with less attention given to endogenous depression. Additionally, research on gut mycobiota in depression is significantly less than that on gut bacteria.In the present study, Wistar-Kyoto rats were used as an endogenous depression and treatment-resistant depression model, while Wistar rats served as controls. Differences between the two rat strains in behavior, gut bacteria, gut mycobiota, nervous system, endocrine system, immune system, and gut barrier were evaluated. Additionally, the effects of <i>Lactobacillus helveticus</i> NS8 supplementation were investigated.Wistar-Kyoto rats demonstrated increased depressive-like behaviors in the forced swimming test, reduced sucrose preference in the sucrose preference test, and decreased locomotor activity in the open field test. They also exhibited abnormal gut bacteria and mycobiota, characterized by higher bacterial α-diversity but lower fungal α-diversity, along with increased butyrate, L-tyrosine, and L-phenylalanine biosynthesis from bacteria. Furthermore, these rats showed dysfunction in the microbiota-gut-brain axis, evidenced by a hypo-serotonergic system, hyper-noradrenergic system, defective hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, compromised gut barrier integrity, heightened serum inflammation, and diminished gut immunity. A 1-month <i>L. helveticus</i> NS8 intervention increased the fecal abundance of <i>L. helveticus</i>; reduced the abundance of <i>Bilophila</i> and Debaryomycetaceae; decreased immobility time but increased climbing time in the forced swimming test; reduced hippocampal corticotropin-releasing hormone levels; decreased hypothalamic norepinephrine levels; increased hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor dopamine, and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid content; and improved the gut microbiota, serotonergic, and noradrenergic system.The depressive phenotype of Wistar-Kyoto rats is not only attributed to their genetic context but also closely related to their gut microbiota. Abnormal gut microbiota and a dysfunctional microbiota-gut-brain axis play important roles in endogenous depression, just as they do in exogenous depression. Supplementing with probiotics such as <i>L. helveticus</i> NS8 is likely a promising approach to improve endogenous depression and treatment-resistant depression.",Frontiers in immunology,2024,Husile Alatan; Shan Liang; Yosuke Shimodaira; Xiaoli Wu; Xu Hu; Tao Wang; Jia Luo; Katsunori Iijima; Feng Jin
38896988,Hyperglycemia and cognitive impairments anticipate the onset of an overt type 2 diabetes-like phenotype in TALLYHO/JngJ mice.,"Type 2 Diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disorder characterized by chronic hyperglycemia, resulting from deficits in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. Whilst the role of insulin in the peripheral nervous system has been ascertained in countless studies, its role in the central nervous system (CNS) is emerging only recently. Brain insulin has been lately associated with brain disorders like Alzheimer's disease, obsessive compulsive disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Thus, understanding the role of insulin as a common risk factor for mental and somatic comorbidities may disclose novel preventative and therapeutic approaches. We evaluated general metabolism (glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, energy expenditure, lipid metabolism, and polydipsia) and cognitive capabilities (attention, cognitive flexibility, and memory), in adolescent, young adult, and adult male and female TALLYHO/JngJ mice (TH, previously reported to constitute a valid experimental model of T2DM due to impaired insulin signaling). Adult TH mice have also been studied for alterations in gut microbiota diversity and composition. While TH mice exhibited profound deficits in cognitive flexibility and altered glucose metabolism, we observed that these alterations emerged either much earlier (males) or independent of (females) a comprehensive constellation of symptoms, isomorphic to an overt T2DM-like phenotype (insulin resistance, polydipsia, higher energy expenditure, and altered lipid metabolism). We also observed significant sex-dependent alterations in gut microbiota alpha diversity and taxonomy in adult TH mice. Deficits in insulin signaling may represent a common risk factor for both T2DM and CNS-related deficits, which may stem from (partly) independent mechanisms.",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2024,Martina Presta; Francesca Zoratto; Danique Mulder; Angela Maria Ottomana; Edoardo Pisa; Alejandro Arias Vásquez; David A Slattery; Jeffrey C Glennon; Simone Macrì
39089603,"Enhanced cerebral blood flow similarity of the somatomotor network in chronic insomnia: Transcriptomic decoding, gut microbial signatures and phenotypic roles.","Chronic insomnia (CI) is a complex disease involving multiple factors including genetics, gut microbiota, and brain structure and function. However, there lacks a unified framework to elucidate how these factors interact in CI. By combining data of clinical assessment, sleep behavior recording, cognitive test, multimodal MRI (structural, functional, and perfusion), gene, and gut microbiota, this study demonstrated that enhanced cerebral blood flow (CBF) similarities of the somatomotor network (SMN) acted as a key mediator to link multiple factors in CI. Specifically, we first demonstrated that only CBF but not morphological or functional networks exhibited alterations in patients with CI, characterized by increases within the SMN and between the SMN and higher-order associative networks. Moreover, these findings were highly reproducible and the CBF similarity method was test-retest reliable. Further, we showed that transcriptional profiles explained 60.4 % variance of the pattern of the increased CBF similarities with the most correlated genes enriched in regulation of cellular and protein localization and material transport, and gut microbiota explained 69.7 % inter-individual variance in the increased CBF similarities with the most contributions from Negativicutes and Lactobacillales. Finally, we found that the increased CBF similarities were correlated with clinical variables, accounted for sleep behaviors and cognitive deficits, and contributed the most to the patient-control classification (accuracy = 84.4 %). Altogether, our findings have important implications for understanding the neuropathology of CI and may inform ways of developing new therapeutic strategies for the disease.",NeuroImage,2024,Xiaofen Ma; Junle Li; Yuping Yang; Xiaofan Qiu; Jintao Sheng; Ningke Han; Changwen Wu; Guang Xu; Guihua Jiang; Junzhang Tian; Xuchu Weng; Jinhui Wang
39456245,Altered Gut Microbiota Patterns in Young Children with Recent Maltreatment Exposure.,"The brain and the intestinal microbiota are highly interconnected and especially vulnerable to disruptions in early life. Emerging evidence indicates that psychosocial adversity detrimentally impacts the intestinal microbiota, affecting both physical and mental health. This study aims to investigate the gut microbiome in young children in the immediate aftermath of maltreatment exposure.Maltreatment exposure was assessed in 88 children (ages 3-7) using the Maternal Interview for the Classification of Maltreatment [MICM]. Children were allocated to three groups according to the number of experienced maltreatment categories: no maltreatment, low maltreatment, and high maltreatment exposures. Stool samples were collected and analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing.Children subjected to high maltreatment exposure exhibited lower alpha diversity in comparison to those with both no and low maltreatment exposure (Simpson Index, Tukey post hoc, <i>p</i> = 0.059 and <i>p</i> = 0.007, respectively). No significant distinctions in beta diversity were identified. High maltreatment exposure was associated with the enrichment of several genera from the class Clostridia (<i>Clostridium, Intestinibacter, Howardella</i> and <i>Butyrivibrio</i>) and the depletion of the genus <i>Phocaeicola</i> (class Bacteriodia).Severe maltreatment exposure is associated with alterations in the gut microbiota of young children.

39452233,"Pharmacists' Knowledge, Perception, and Prescribing Practice of Probiotics in the UAE: A Cross-Sectional Study.","The human body is a complex and interconnected system where trillions of microorganisms, collectively known as the gut microbiota, coexist with these cells. Besides maintaining digestive health, this relationship also impacts well-being, including immune function, metabolism, and mental health. As frontline healthcare providers, pharmacists are pivotal in promoting the benefits of probiotics for immune support. This study explored pharmacists' knowledge, perception, and practice behavior in the UAE towards the implication of probiotic application beyond digestive health, such as cardiovascular and mental health impacts and their diverse dosage forms.An online self-administered survey was distributed among pharmacists in the UAE. Data were collected through personal visits to pharmacies, where pharmacists were approached and asked to complete the questionnaire. The sample size included 407 pharmacists, determined using the formula for proportions with a 95% confidence level and a 5% margin of error. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 29. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize demographic characteristics and survey responses. The knowledge levels were categorized into poor, moderate, and good. Chi-square analysis was employed to investigate associations between demographic factors and knowledge levels, with a significance level set at <i>p</i> < 0.05, enhancing the robustness of the study's findings.This study included 407 completed eligible responses. About 63.56% of participants were female, with 52.1% employed in pharmacy chains. While 91.2% of pharmacists recognized probiotics' role in immune support, only 30% were aware of their cardiovascular benefits. Moreover, chewing gum was the least known dosage form of probiotics, recognized by only 16.7% of respondents. Additionally, only 57% of the participants recognized liposomes as a dosage form. In practice, most pharmacists recommended storing probiotics at room temperature, accounting for 66.6%. The most prevalent misconception encountered in the pharmacy setting was the belief that probiotics are primarily intended for gastrointestinal tract problems, at 79.1% of the respondents. Regarding perception, the agreement was observed regarding the safety of probiotics for all ages. Perceived barriers included the high cost of probiotics, with the majority (86.5%) indicating this as a significant obstacle, while lack of demand was identified as the minor barrier by 64.6%. Additionally, an association was found at a significance level of <i>p</i> < 0.05 with knowledge, gender, educational level, type and location of pharmacy, and source of information.The study highlights knowledge gaps in pharmacists' understanding of probiotic applications beyond digestive health, particularly cardiovascular health and depression. Targeted educational interventions are necessary to address these gaps. The findings underscore the importance of ongoing professional development for pharmacists, enhancing their role in patient education and the promotion of probiotics for overall health.","Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)",2024,Maram O Abbas; Hanan Ahmed; Eisha Hamid; Dyshania Padayachee; Menah Talla Abdulbadia; Sohila Khalid; Ahmed Abuelhana; Bazigha K Abdul Rasool
39217732,"Investigating the bacterial profiles of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Actinobacteria, Fusobacterium, Firmicutes, and Bacteroides in stool samples from patients with severe depression and healthy individuals.","Depression is a multifaceted mental health disorder with complex etiology and significant global burden. Recent research indicates that the gut microbiota plays a role in the pathophysiology of depression, highlighting the potential role of specific bacterial species in influencing mood and cognitive function. In this study, we aimed to investigate the presence, copy numbers, and Ct values of selected bacterial species in stool samples from depressed patients (n=50) compared to control subjects (n=50). Our findings revealed significant differences in the abundance of Fusobacterium spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Lactobacillus spp., Bacteroidetes phylum, Firmicutes phylum, and Actinobacteria spp. between the two groups. Dysregulation of the gut microbiota, characterized by decreased presence of beneficial bacteria (e.g., Bifidobacterium spp., Lactobacillus spp.) and altered abundance of potentially pathogenic bacteria (e.g., Fusobacterium spp.), may contribute to the development or exacerbation of depression. These findings support the emerging concept of the gut-brain axis and its role in mental health. However, further research is needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms and explore the therapeutic potential of microbiota-targeted interventions for depression. Understanding the intricate interplay between the gut microbiota and depression could pave the way for novel treatment strategies and personalized approaches in mental health care.",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2024,Fatemeh Arbabi; Reza Shapoury; Fakhri Haghi; Habib Zeighami; Reza Pirzeh

Furthermore, 1 Hz LF-TMS-treatment partially recovered chronic stress induced changes of microbiotas, such as the abundance of <i>Chloroflexi</i>, <i>Actinobacteria</i>.These results manifested that LF-TMS treatment can improve the anhedonic behaviors caused by CUMS in mice, which are connected with regulating the related intestinal microbial community disturbance, including species diversity, structure of gut microbiota, and species composition.",Alpha psychiatry,2024,Linyin Gao; Xiangwei Zhao; Lei Wu; Chuan Liu; Ran Ding; Haitao Wang; Xueliang Shang
38960388,Beneficial effect of GABA-producing Lactiplantibacillus strain LPB145 isolated from cheese starters evaluated in anxiety- and depression-like behaviours in rats.,"In a previous study, we reported the in vitro potential probiotic and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) production, of several strains from a collection of Lactiplantibacillus (Lpb) strains within the community of natural whey starters from the artisanal cheese industry. GABA is a non-protein amino acid widely distributed in nature and produced in animals, plants, and microorganisms. However, the best known role of GABA is its function as the major inhibitory neurotransmitter of the central nervous system. Preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that the GABAergic system has a relevant role in mental health disorders, such as anxiety and major depression. The modulation of the GABAergic system has been suggested as a potential strategy for treatment, one such mechanism of modulation is the influence of the microbiota-gut-brain axis through probiotic treatments. The present study was designed to investigate the in vivo probiotic potential of LPB145, a Lactiplantibacillus strain previously characterised as a GABA-producing potentially probiotic strain. Therefore, we evaluated the behavioural effects of chronic oral administration of LPB145 on rats' anxiety- and depression-like behaviours, using the elevated plus maze, open field, and the forced swimming test. The impact of LPB145 strain treatment on the gut microbiota structure and diversity was assessed to discern a possible mechanism of action of the LPB145 treatment through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Our results showed that LPB145 administration induced an antidepressive-like behaviour without changes in locomotor activity. In contrast, the treatment did not modify the experimental anxiety. The structure and diversity of the intestinal microbiota remained unaffected by the treatment when compared to the control. However, specific clades that could be implicated in the behavioural changes did show differences in their relative abundance. These findings provide evidence regarding the potential of probiotic strains isolated from alimentary sources, to modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis and positively impact mental health.",Beneficial microbes,2024,J Lozano; S Fabius; S Fernández-Ciganda; J Urbanavicius; C Piccini; C Scorza; P Zunino
39313515,Oral administration of astilbin mitigates acetaminophen-induced acute liver injury in mice by modulating the gut microbiota.,"Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose-induced acute liver injury (ALI) is characterized by extensive oxidative stress, and the clinical interventions for this adverse effect remain limited. Astilbin is an active compound found in the rhizome of Smilax glabra Roxb. with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. Due to its low oral bioavailability, astilbin can accumulate in the intestine, which provides a basis for the interaction between astilbin and gut microbiota (GM). In the present study we investigated the protective effects of astilbin against APAP-induced ALI by focusing on the interaction between astilbin and GM. Mice were treated with astilbin (50 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>·d<sup>-1</sup>, i.g.) for 7 days. After the last administration of astilbin for 2 h, the mice received APAP (300 mg/kg, i.g.) to induce ALI. We showed that oral administration of astilbin significantly alleviated APAP-induced ALI by altering the composition of GM and enriching beneficial metabolites including hydroxytyrosol (HT). GM depletion using an ""antibiotics cocktail"" or paraoral administration of astilbin abolished the hepatoprotective effects of astilbin. On the other hand, administration of HT (10 mg/kg, i.g.) caused similar protective effects in APAP-induced ALI mice. Transcriptomic analysis of the liver tissue revealed that HT inhibited reactive oxygen species and inflammation-related signaling in APAP-induced ALI; HT promoted activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway to combat oxidative stress following APAP challenge in a sirtuin-6-dependent manner. These results highlight that oral astilbin ameliorates APAP-induced ALI by manipulating the GM and metabolites towards a more favorable profile, and provide an alternative therapeutic strategy for alleviating APAP-induced ALI.",Acta pharmacologica Sinica,2024,Qin Yang; Wen-Hao He; Li Xie; Tao Chen; Ruo-Fan Liu; Jia-Jia Hu; Jia-Yin Guo; Guo-Zhu Tan; Fu-Ling Wu; Peng Gu; Peng Chen; Yu Chen
38737108,Cucurbitacin E Alleviates Colonic Barrier Function Impairment and Inflammation Response and Improves Microbial Composition on Experimental Colitis Models.,"Cucurbitacins, which are found in a variety of medicinal plants, vegetables and fruits, were known for their diverse pharmacological and biological activities, including anticancer, anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. Cucurbitacin E, one of the major cucurbitacins, was recently proved to inhibit inflammatory response.To explore the therapeutic effects of cucurbitacin E on colitis and the underlying mechanisms, male mice drunk water containing 2.5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) to establish colitis model and administrated with cucurbitacin E during and after DSS treatment. The disease activity index was scored and colonic histological damage was observed. Intestinal tight junction and inflammatory response were determined. 16S rRNA and transcriptome sequencing were performed to analyze gut microbiota composition and gene expression, respectively.We found that cucurbitacin E alleviated DSS-induced body weight loss and impaired colonic morphology. Cucurbitacin E decreased the expression of inflammatory cytokines and cell apoptosis, and maintained barrier function. Additionally, cucurbitacin E retrieved DSS-induced alterations in the bacterial community composition. Furthermore, a variety of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) caused by cucurbitacin E were enriched in several pathways including the NFκB and TNF signaling pathways as well as in Th17 cell differentiation. There was a close relationship between DEGs and bacteria such as <i>Escherichia-Shigella</i> and Muribaculaceae.Our results revealed that cucurbitacin E may exert protective effects on colitis via modulating inflammatory response, microbiota composition and host gene expression. Our study supports the therapeutic potential of cucurbitacin E in colitis and indicates that gut microbes are potentially therapeutic targets.",Journal of inflammation research,2024,Fengxia Zhan; Wei Song; Yong Fan; Fangjian Wang; Qian Wang

However, the complex interplay of various factors underlying the development and progression of MDD poses significant challenges. Our previous study demonstrated improvements in cognitive functions in MDD patients undergoing treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) supplemented with Lactobacillus plantarum 299v (LP299v).To elucidate the biochemical mechanisms underlying cognitive functions improvements, we explored underlying metabolic changes. We employed multi-platform metabolomics, including LC-QTOF-MS and CE-TOF-MS profiling, alongside chiral LC-QqQ-MS analysis for amino acids.Supplementation of SSRI treatment with LP299v intensified the reduction of long-chain acylcarnitines, potentially indicating improved mitochondrial function. LP299v supplementation reduced N-acyl taurines more than four times compared to the placebo, suggesting a substantial impact on restoring biochemical balance. The LP299v-supplemented group showed increased levels of oxidized glycerophosphocholine (oxPC). Additionally, LP299v supplementation led to higher levels of sphingomyelins, L-histidine, D-valine, and p-cresol.This exploratory study suggests potential metabolic pathways influenced by LP299v supplementation. However, the need for further research hinders the ability to draw definitive conclusions.Observed metabolic changes were linked to mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, oxidative stress, and gut microbiota disruption. Despite the subtle nature of this alterations, our research successfully detected these differences and connected them to the metabolic disruptions associated with MDD.

33362788,The Gut-Brain Axis: How Microbiota and Host Inflammasome Influence Brain Physiology and Pathology.,"The human microbiota has a fundamental role in host physiology and pathology. Gut microbial alteration, also known as dysbiosis, is a condition associated not only with gastrointestinal disorders but also with diseases affecting other distal organs. Recently it became evident that the intestinal bacteria can affect the central nervous system (CNS) physiology and inflammation. The nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract are communicating through a bidirectional network of signaling pathways called the gut-brain axis, which consists of multiple connections, including the vagus nerve, the immune system, and bacterial metabolites and products. During dysbiosis, these pathways are dysregulated and associated with altered permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and neuroinflammation. However, numerous mechanisms behind the impact of the gut microbiota in neuro-development and -pathogenesis remain poorly understood. There are several immune pathways involved in CNS homeostasis and inflammation. Among those, the inflammasome pathway has been linked to neuroinflammatory conditions such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, but also anxiety and depressive-like disorders. The inflammasome complex assembles upon cell activation due to exposure to microbes, danger signals, or stress and lead to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1β and interleukin-18) and to pyroptosis. Evidences suggest that there is a reciprocal influence of microbiota and inflammasome activation in the brain. However, how this influence is precisely working is yet to be discovered. Herein, we discuss the status of the knowledge and the open questions in the field focusing on the function of intestinal microbial metabolites or products on CNS cells during healthy and inflammatory conditions, such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and also neuropsychiatric disorders. In particular, we focus on the innate inflammasome pathway as immune mechanism that can be involved in several of these conditions, upon exposure to certain microbes.",Frontiers in immunology,2020,Andrina Rutsch; Johan B Kantsjö; Francesca Ronchi
32934117,Gut Microbiota and Metabolome Alterations Associated with Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of intracellular aggregates of misfolded alpha-synuclein along the cerebral axis. Several studies report the association between intestinal dysbiosis and Parkinson's disease, although a cause-effect relationship remains to be established. Herein, the gut microbiota composition of 64 Italian patients with Parkinson's disease and 51 controls was determined using a next-generation sequencing approach. A real metagenomics shape based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was also investigated. The most significant changes within the Parkinson's disease group highlighted a reduction in bacterial taxa, which are linked to anti-inflammatory/neuroprotective effects, particularly in the <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> family and key members, such as <i>Butyrivibrio, Pseudobutyrivibrio, Coprococcus</i>, and <i>Blautia</i> The direct evaluation of fecal metabolites revealed changes in several classes of metabolites. Changes were seen in lipids (linoleic acid, oleic acid, succinic acid, and sebacic acid), vitamins (pantothenic acid and nicotinic acid), amino acids (isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, glutamic acid, and pyroglutamic acid) and other organic compounds (cadaverine, ethanolamine, and hydroxy propionic acid). Most modified metabolites strongly correlated with the abundance of members belonging to the <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> family, suggesting that these gut bacteria correlate with altered metabolism rates in Parkinson's disease.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> To our knowledge, this is one of the few studies thus far that correlates the composition of the gut microbiota with the direct analysis of fecal metabolites in patients with Parkinson's disease. Overall, our data highlight microbiota modifications correlated with numerous fecal metabolites. This suggests that Parkinson's disease is associated with gut dysregulation that involves a synergistic relationship between gut microbes and several bacterial metabolites favoring altered homeostasis. Interestingly, a reduction of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria influenced the shape of the metabolomics profile, affecting several metabolites with potential protective effects in the Parkinson group. On the other hand, the extensive impact that intestinal dysbiosis has at the level of numerous metabolic pathways could encourage the identification of specific biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of Parkinson's disease, also in light of the effect that specific drugs have on the composition of the intestinal microbiota.",mSystems,2020,Sarah Vascellari; Vanessa Palmas; Marta Melis; Silvia Pisanu; Roberto Cusano; Paolo Uva; Daniela Perra; Veronica Madau; Marianna Sarchioto; Valentina Oppo; Nicola Simola; Micaela Morelli; Maria Laura Santoru; Luigi Atzori; Maurizio Melis; Giovanni Cossu; Aldo Manzin
32357258,Microbiota Composition and Metabolism Are Associated With Gut Function in Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease is characterized by a high burden of gastrointestinal comorbidities, especially constipation and reduced colonic transit time, and by gut microbiota alterations. The diverse metabolites produced by the microbiota are broadly relevant to host health. How microbiota composition and metabolism relate to gastrointestinal function in Parkinson's disease is largely unknown. The objectives of the current study were to assesses associations between microbiota composition, stool consistency, constipation, and systemic microbial metabolites in Parkinson's disease to better understand how intestinal microbes contribute to gastrointestinal disturbances commonly observed in patients.Three hundred participants (197 Parkinson's patients and 103 controls) were recruited for this cross-sectional cohort study. Participants supplied fecal samples for microbiota sequencing (n = 300) and serum for untargeted metabolomics (n = 125). Data were collected on motor and nonmotor Parkinson's symptoms, medications, diet, and demographics.Significant microbiota taxonomic differences were observed in Parkinson's patients, even when controlling for gastrointestinal function. Parkinson's microbiota was characterized by reduced carbohydrate fermentation and butyrate synthesis capacity and increased proteolytic fermentation and production of deleterious amino acid metabolites, including p-cresol and phenylacetylglutamine. Taxonomic shifts and elevated proteolytic metabolites were strongly associated with stool consistency (a proxy for colonic transit time) and constipation among patients.Compositional and metabolic alterations in the Parkinson's microbiota are highly associated with gut function, suggesting plausible mechanistic links between altered bacterial metabolism and reduced gut health in this disease. The systemic detection of elevated deleterious proteolytic microbial metabolites in Parkinson's serum suggests a mechanism whereby microbiota dysbiosis contributes to disease etiology and pathophysiology. © 2020 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society,2020,Mihai S Cirstea; Adam C Yu; Ella Golz; Kristen Sundvick; Daniel Kliger; Nina Radisavljevic; Liam H Foulger; Melissa Mackenzie; Tau Huan; B Brett Finlay; Silke Appel-Cresswell
32103766,"Gut, oral and nasal microbiota and Parkinson's disease.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease, and in an effort to identify novel therapeutic target for this disease in recent years, human microbiota has attracted much interest. This paper briefly summarizes the main findings concerning the differences of human microbiome across several important mucosal interfaces, including nose, mouth, and gut between PD patients and controls as obtained from a total of 13 studies published since 2015, which covered a total of 943 PD patients and 831 matched controls from 6 countries. Overall, these studies supported the differences of gut microbiota between PD patients and matched controls, while significantly altered bacterial taxa among studies were not identical. Due to relatively limited number of available studies and covered patients, the associations between oral and nasal microbiota and PD remain inconclusive. The therapeutic and diagnostic potentials of gut microbiota for PD are discussed. More well-designed clinical studies recruiting large-scale PD patients are encouraged in future.",Microbial cell factories,2020,Liang Shen
32290475,d-glutamate and Gut Microbiota in Alzheimer's Disease.,"An increasing number of studies have shown that the brain-gut-microbiota axis may significantly contribute to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Moreover, impaired memory and learning involve the dysfunction neurotransmission of glutamate, the agonist of the <i>N</i>-methyl-d-aspartate receptor and a major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain. This systematic review aimed to summarize the current cutting-edge research on the gut microbiota and glutamate alterations associated with dementia.PubMed, the Cochrane Collaboration Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials, and Cochrane Systematic Reviews were reviewed for all studies on glutamate and gut microbiota in dementia published up until Feb 2020.Several pilot studies have reported alterations of gut microbiota and metabolites in AD patients and other forms of dementia. Gut microbiota including <i>Bacteroides vulgatus</i> and <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> affect glutamate metabolism and decrease the glutamate metabolite 2-keto-glutaramic acid. Meanwhile, gut bacteria with glutamate racemase including <i>Corynebacterium glutamicum, Brevibacterium lactofermentum</i>, and <i>Brevibacterium avium</i> can convert l-glutamate to d-glutamate. N-methyl-d-aspartate glutamate receptor (NMDAR)-enhancing agents have been found to potentially improve cognition in AD or Parkinson's disease patients. These findings suggest that d-glutamate (d-form glutamate) metabolized by the gut bacteria may influence the glutamate NMDAR and cognitive function in dementia patients.Gut microbiota and glutamate are potential novel interventions to be developed for dementia. Exploring comprehensive cognitive functions in animal and human trials with glutamate-related NMDAR enhancers are warranted to examine d-glutamate signaling efficacy in gut microbiota in patients with AD and other neurodegenerative dementias.",International journal of molecular sciences,2020,Chun-Hung Chang; Chieh-Hsin Lin; Hsien-Yuan Lane

However, the efficacy of many oral drugs is limited to their unsatisfactory bioavailability in the gastrointestinal tract. One of the critical and most overlooked factors is the symbiotic gut microbiota that can modulate the bioavailability of oral drugs by participating in the biotransformation of oral drugs, influencing the drug transport process and altering some gastrointestinal properties. In this review, we summarized the existing research investigating the possible relationship between the gut microbiota and the bioavailability of oral drugs, which may provide great ideas and useful instructions for the design of novel drug delivery systems or the achievement of personalized medicine.",Acta pharmaceutica Sinica.

31837645,Effect of ultra-processed diet on gut microbiota and thus its role in neurodegenerative diseases.,"The current dietary pattern is characterized by high consumption of ultra-processed foods and lower consumption of fiber and vegetables, environmental factors that are associated directly with the current incidence of chronic metabolic diseases. Diet is an environmental factor that influences the diversity and functionality of the gut microbiota, where dietary changes have a direct action on their homeostasis. The environment created in the gut by ultra-processed foods, a hallmark of the Western diet that are recognized as trigger factors for low-grade systemic inflammatory and oxidative changes, favor the development of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). From a systematic search, the present review analyzes the relationship and effect of the current feeding pattern, with the dysregulation of the microbiota and its influence on the development of cognitive decline. Because diagnosis of NDs is usually at late stages, this review highlights the importance of a search for stricter public health strategies regarding access to and development of ultra-processed foods.","Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)",2020,Edwin E Martínez Leo; Maira R Segura Campos
33092396,"Dysfunction of the Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis in Neurodegenerative Disease: The Promise of Therapeutic Modulation With Prebiotics, Medicinal Herbs, Probiotics, and Synbiotics.","Recent data suggest gut microbiota dysbiosis as a contributing factor in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's Disease (PD) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD), and these pathologies may manifest via the microbiota-gut-brain-axis, which comprises bidirectional communication through neuroimmune, neuroendocrine, and direct neural pathways such as the vagus nerve. Preclinical and human clinical trial data reveal exciting potential for novel treatment targets and therapeutic modulation with prebiotics, medicinal herbs, probiotics, and synbiotics in health, aging, and neurodegeneration and are reviewed here. While greater insights and characterization of the microbiota-gut-brain axis have been revealed over the past decade, salient questions related to the pathology, pathogenesis and clinical treatment of the axis in the context of both health and neurodegenerative disease remain and are discussed in this review. Future directions such as additional well-controlled, large scale, longitudinal human clinical trials are urgently needed to further elucidate both mechanism and therapeutic opportunity in health, neurological disease, and disease subpopulations to ensure that the next decade ushers the dawn of targeted therapeutic modulation of the microbiota-gut-brain axis.",Journal of evidence-based integrative medicine,2020,Christine Tara Peterson
32827699,Acupuncture inhibits neuroinflammation and gut microbial dysbiosis in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease.,"Growing evidences show that gut microbiota is associated with the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) and the gut-brain axis can be promising target for the development of the therapeutic strategies for PD. Acupuncture has been used to improve brain functions and inflammation in neurological disorders such as PD, and to recover the gastrointestinal dysfunctions in various gastrointestinal disorders. Thus, we investigated whether acupuncture could improve Parkinsonism and gut microbial dysbiosis induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. First, we observed that acupuncture treatment at acupoints GB34 and ST36 could improve motor functions and comorbid anxiety in PD mice. Next, we found that acupuncture increased the levels of dopaminergic fibers and neurons in the striatum and the substantia nigra, respectively. Acupuncture also restored the overexpression of microglia and astrocyte as well as conversion of Bax and Bcl-2 expression in both the striatum and the substantia nigra, indicating that inflammatory responses and apoptosis were blocked by acupuncture. Additionally, via 16S rRNA sequence analysis, we observed that the relative abundance of 18 genera were changed in acupuncture-treated mice compared to the PD mice. Of them, Butyricimonas, Holdemania, Frisingicoccus, Gracilibacter, Phocea, and Aestuariispira showed significant correlations with anxiety as well as motor functions. Furthermore, the predicted functional analyses showed that acupuncture restored the physiology functions such as glutathione metabolism, methane metabolism, and PD pathway. In conclusion, we suggest that the effects of acupuncture on the enhanced motor function and the protection of the dopaminergic neurons may be associated with the regulation of the gut microbial dysbiosis and thus the inhibition of the neuroinflammation in the PD mice.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2020,Jae-Hwan Jang; Mi-Jung Yeom; Sora Ahn; Ju-Young Oh; Suhwan Ji; Tae-Hong Kim; Hi-Joon Park
32987244,Ketogenic diet and Neuroinflammation.,"The high-fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (KD) is an established treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy with a proven efficacy. The KD is being explored for Febrile Infection-Related Epilepsy Syndrome (FIRES) and epileptic encephalopathies. There is growing evidence that KD works by targeting dysregulated adaptive and innate immunity that occurs in drug-resistant epilepsy and in refractory status epilepticus. Beyond epilepsy, there are yet additional potential uses in neurological disorders because KD appears to have the broad anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. The KD exerts anti-inflammatory action against a variety of experimental models of neurological disorders including multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, pain, and spinal cord injury. Anti-inflammatory action of KD appears to be mediated by multiple mechanisms.

33148438,Probiotic Clostridium butyricum ameliorated motor deficits in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease via gut microbiota-GLP-1 pathway.,"A connection between gut microbiota and Parkinson's disease (PD) indicates that dysbiosis of the gut microbiota might represent a risk factor for PD. Microbiota-targeted interventions, including probiotic Clostridium butyricum (Cb), have been recently shown to have favorable effects in PD by regulating microbiota-gut-brain axis. However, the potential beneficial roles and its mechanisms of Cb on PD were still unknown. Male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to a PD model-induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and were treated intragastrically with Cb for 4 weeks. The motor functions were assessed by a series of behavioral tests including pole test, beam walking teat, forced swimming test and open field test. The dopaminergic neuron loss, synaptic plasticity and microglia activation, as well as the levels of colonic glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), colonic G protein-coupled receptors GPR41/43 and cerebral GLP-1 receptors were assessed. Gut microbial composition was assessed by 16S rRNA sequencing analysis. Our results showed that oral administration of Cb could improve motor deficits, dopaminergic neuron loss, synaptic dysfunction and microglia activation in the MPTP-induced mice. Meanwhile, Cb treatment could reverse the dysbiosis of gut microbiota and the decreased levels of colonic GLP-1, colonic GPR41/43 and cerebral GLP-1 receptor in the MPTP-induced mice. These findings indicated that the neuroprotective mechanism of Cb on PD might be related to the improvement of abnormal gut microbiota-gut-brain axis.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2021,Jing Sun; Haijun Li; Yangjie Jin; Jiaheng Yu; Shiyin Mao; Kuan-Pin Su; Zongxin Ling; Jiaming Liu
32266160,Fecal Microbiota Transplantation in Neurological Disorders.,"<b>Background:</b> Several studies suggested an important role of the gut microbiota in the pathophysiology of neurological disorders, implying that alteration of the gut microbiota might serve as a treatment strategy. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is currently the most effective gut microbiota intervention and an accepted treatment for recurrent <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> infections. To evaluate indications of FMT for patients with neurological disorders, we summarized the available literature on FMT. In addition, we provide suggestions for future directions. <b>Methods:</b> In July 2019, five main databases were searched for studies and case descriptions on FMT in neurological disorders in humans or animal models. In addition, the ClinicalTrials.gov website was consulted for registered planned and ongoing trials. <b>Results:</b> Of 541 identified studies, 34 were included in the analysis. Clinical trials with FMT have been performed in patients with autism spectrum disorder and showed beneficial effects on neurological symptoms. For multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease, several animal studies suggested a positive effect of FMT, supported by some human case reports. For epilepsy, Tourette syndrome, and diabetic neuropathy some studies suggested a beneficial effect of FMT, but evidence was restricted to case reports and limited numbers of animal studies. For stroke, Alzheimer's disease and Guillain-Barré syndrome only studies with animal models were identified. These studies suggested a potential beneficial effect of healthy donor FMT. In contrast, one study with an animal model for stroke showed increased mortality after FMT. For Guillain-Barré only one study was identified. Whether positive findings from animal studies can be confirmed in the treatment of human diseases awaits to be seen. Several trials with FMT as treatment for the above mentioned neurological disorders are planned or ongoing, as well as for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. <b>Conclusions:</b> Preliminary literature suggests that FMT may be a promising treatment option for several neurological disorders. However, available evidence is still scanty and some contrasting results were observed. A limited number of studies in humans have been performed or are ongoing, while for some disorders only animal experiments have been conducted. Large double-blinded randomized controlled trials are needed to further elucidate the effect of FMT in neurological disorders.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2020,Karuna E W Vendrik; Rogier E Ooijevaar; Pieter R C de Jong; Jon D Laman; Bob W van Oosten; Jacobus J van Hilten; Quinten R Ducarmon; Josbert J Keller; Eduard J Kuijper; Maria Fiorella Contarino

Besides, the effect of family environment on gut microbiota dysbiosis remains unclear.We characterized the gut microbial compositions of 63 PD patients, 63 healthy spouses (HS) and 74 healthy people (HP) using 16S rRNA sequencing. Clinical phenotypes and microbial composition were analyzed comprehensively.There were markedly different microbial compositions among PD, HS and HP samples by alpha/beta diversity. We also found differential microbial compositions among Hoehn & Yahr stage/disease duration. Eight inflammation-associated microbial genera shared a continuously increase trend with increased Hoehn & Yahr stage and disease duration, indicating characteristic bacteria associated with deterioration in PD. Additionally, seven bacterial markers were identified for accurately differentiating PD patients from the controls (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.856).Our study shows altered gut microbiota in PD patients. Importantly, inflammation-associated microbial genera may play roles in PD progression. Differential microbial compositions in HS and HP samples demonstrate that the gut microbiota are also affected by family environment.

33185912,Gut microbiota and metabolome distinctive features in Parkinson disease: Focus on levodopa and levodopa-carbidopa intrajejunal gel.,"Recent data suggest that imbalances in the composition of the gut microbiota (GM) could exacerbate the progression of Parkinson disease (PD). The effects of levodopa (LD) have been poorly assessed, and those of LD-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) have not been evaluated so far. The aim of this study was to identify the effect of LD and LCIG, in particular, on the GM and metabolome.Fecal DNA samples from 107 patients with a clinical diagnosis of PD were analyzed by next-generation sequencing of the V3 and V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene. PD patients were classified in different groups: patients on LCIG (LCIG group, n = 38) and on LD (LD group, n = 46). We also included a group of patients (n = 23) without antiparkinsonian medicaments (Naïve group). Fecal metabolic extracts were evaluated by gas chromatography mass spectrometry.The multivariate analysis showed a significantly higher abundance in the LCIG group of Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia, and Serratia compared to the LD group. Compared to the Naïve group, the univariate analysis showed a reduction of Blautia and Lachnospirae in the LD group. Moreover, an increase of Proteobacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, and a reduction of Firmicutes, Lachnospiraceae, and Blautia was found in the LCIG group. No significant difference was found in the multivariate analysis of these comparisons. The LD group and LCIG group were associated with a metabolic profile linked to gut inflammation.Our results suggest that LD, and mostly LCIG, might significantly influence the microbiota composition and host/bacteria metabolism, acting as stressors in precipitating a specific inflammatory intestinal microenvironment, potentially related to the PD state and progression.",European journal of neurology,2021,Marta Melis; Sarah Vascellari; Maria Laura Santoru; Valentina Oppo; Margherita Fabbri; Marianna Sarchioto; Daniela Murgia; Maurizio Zibetti; Leonardo Lopiano; Alessandra Serra; Vanessa Palmas; Silvia Pisanu; Daniela Perra; Veronica Madau; Roberto Cusano; Paolo Uva; Alessandra Mereu; Paolo Contu; Micaela Morelli; Luigi Atzori; Maurizio Melis; Aldo Manzin; Giovanni Cossu

Studies have since observed gut microbiota differences between PD groups and controls, with these alterations potentially relating to PD pathophysiology. However, differences in the studies' methodologies precludes unanimity on the relationships of gut microbiota to PD. Thirteen observational case-control studies investigating gut microbiota in PD and controls were reviewed to assess how microbiota abundance and diversity relates to PD. Nine studies showed butyrate producing gut microbiota had lower abundances in PD compared to controls. Three studies reported α-diversity was higher, with one reporting it was lower, in PD compared to controls. Given most studies show abundance, not diversity, differences of butyrate producing bacteria between groups, we propose abundance differences are more associated with PD than microbiota diversity. As current research is observational, investigating how specific bacteria and their metabolites may alter throughout PD progression is warranted.",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,2020,Nathan D Nuzum; Amy Loughman; Ewa A Szymlek-Gay; Ashlee Hendy; Wei-Peng Teo; Helen Macpherson

However, the therapeutic efficacy of fisetin in Parkinson's disease (PD) is unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that fisetin could markedly alleviate 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration in mice. To confirm the reported correlation between gut microbiota and PD, the bacterial DNA in the fresh feces of mice from each group was subjected to 16S rRNA (V3 and V4 regions) sequencing. The results revealed that fisetin changed the number, diversity, and distribution of gut microbiota in MPTP-induced mice model of PD. The alpha and beta diversity analyses showed that the fisetin intervented MPTP group gut microbiota exhibited a significantly higher abundance of Lachnospiraceae and a significantly lower abundance of uncultured_bacterium_g_Escherichia-Shigella and uncultured_bacterium_g_Bacillus than the MPTP group gut microbiota. These findings indicated that fisetin exerts a neuroprotective effect on neurodegeneration by altering the composition and diversity of gut microbiota.

Suitable animal models are critical for our understanding of the mechanisms underlying disease and the associated prodromal disturbances. The neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated monkey model is commonly seen as a ""gold standard"" model that closely mimics the clinical motor symptoms and the nigrostriatal dopaminergic loss of PD, however MPTP toxicity extends to other nondopaminergic regions. Yet, there are limited reports monitoring the MPTP-induced progressive central and peripheral inflammation as well as other nonmotor symptoms such as gastrointestinal function and microbiota. We report 5 cases of progressive parkinsonism in non-human primates to gain a broader understanding of MPTP-induced central and peripheral inflammatory dysfunction to understand the potential role of inflammation in prodromal/pre-motor features of PD-like degeneration. We measured inflammatory proteins in plasma and CSF and performed [<sup>18</sup>F]FEPPA PET scans to evaluate translocator proteins (TSPO) or microglial activation.

Additionally, monkeys were treated with a novel TNF inhibitor XPro1595 (10 mg/kg, n = 3) or vehicle (n = 2) every three days starting 11 weeks after the initiation of MPTP to determine whether XPro1595 would alter inflammation and microglial behavior in a progressive model of PD. The case studies revealed that earlier and robust [<sup>18</sup>F]FEPPA PET signals resulted in earlier and more severe parkinsonism, which was seen in male cases compared to female cases.

33194809,Gut Microbiota Approach-A New Strategy to Treat Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by neuronal loss and dysfunction of dopaminergic neurons located in the substantia nigra, which contain a variety of misfolded α-synuclein (α-syn). Medications that increase or substitute for dopamine can be used for the treatment of PD. Recently, numerous studies have shown gut microbiota plays a crucial role in regulating and maintaining multiple aspects of host physiology including host metabolism and neurodevelopment. In this review article, the role of gut microbiota in the etiological mechanism of PD will be reviewed. Furthermore, we discussed current pharmaceutical medicine-based methods to prevent and treat PD, followed by describing specific strains that affect the host brain function through the gut-brain axis. We explained in detail how gut microbiota directly produces neurotransmitters or regulate the host biosynthesis of neurotransmitters. The neurotransmitters secreted by the intestinal lumen bacteria may induce epithelial cells to release molecules that, in turn, can regulate neural signaling in the enteric nervous system and subsequently control brain function and behavior through the brain-gut axis. Finally, we proved that the microbial regulation of the host neuronal system.

32112917,The Link between Gut Dysbiosis and Neuroinflammation in Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. Despite its high frequency the etiology is still unclear; several lines of evidence show that an inflammatory process is implicated in the pathogenesis of this disorder; where activation of brain microglia plays a central role in the damage of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra. Such inflammation has been attributed to the toxic effect of aggregated α-synuclein; however, evidence also implicates an altered gut microbiota (dysbiosis) through the systemic release of endotoxins such as lipopolysaccharide and other metabolic products. This exposure may be enhanced by increased permeability of the intestinal (""leaky gut"") and the blood brain barrier; enhancing the entrance of microbiota-produced substances into the central nervous system. In this manuscript, we explore the evidence from clinical and basic science implicating microglia activation by gut dysbiosis and how this phenomenon may impact in the symptomatology and progression of PD.",Neuroscience,2020,José Fidel Baizabal-Carvallo; Marlene Alonso-Juarez

32877215,Parkinson's disease: Are gut microbes involved?,"Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor and gastrointestinal (GI) deficits. Despite its prevalence, the pathophysiology of PD is not well understood. Recent studies highlight the role of gut microbiota in neurological disorders. In this review, we summarize the potential role of gut microbiota in the pathophysiology of PD. We first describe how gut microbiota can be influenced by factors predisposing individuals to PD, such as environmental toxins, aging, and host genetics. We then highlight the effect of gut microbiota on mechanisms implicated in the pathophysiology of PD, including disrupted microbiota gut brain axis (GBA), barrier dysfunction, and immune dysfunction. It is too early to connect the dots between gut microbiota and PD to establish causation, and experiments focused on investigating interrelationship between gut microbiota and associated metabolites on GBA, barrier dysfunction, and immune activation will be crucial to fill in the gaps.",American journal of physiology.

32733812,Human Gut-Microbiota Interaction in Neurodegenerative Disorders and Current Engineered Tools for Its Modeling.,"The steady increase in life-expectancy of world population, coupled to many genetic and environmental factors (for instance, pre- and post-natal exposures to environmental neurotoxins), predispose to the onset of neurodegenerative diseases, whose prevalence is expected to increase dramatically in the next years. Recent studies have proposed links between the gut microbiota and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Human body is a complex structure where bacterial and human cells are almost equal in numbers, and most microbes are metabolically active in the gut, where they potentially influence other target organs, including the brain. The role of gut microbiota in the development and pathophysiology of the human brain is an area of growing interest for the scientific community. Several microbial-derived neurochemicals involved in the gut-microbiota-brain crosstalk seem implicated in the biological and physiological basis of neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration. Evidence supporting these connections has come from model systems, but there are still unsolved issues due to several limitations of available research tools. New technologies are recently born to help understanding the causative role of gut microbes in neurodegeneration. This review aims to make an overview of recent advances in the study of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in the field of neurodegenerative disorders by: (a) identifying specific microbial pathological signaling pathways; (b) characterizing new, advanced engineered tools to study the interactions between human cells and gut bacteria.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2020,Florencia Andrea Ceppa; Luca Izzo; Lorenzo Sardelli; Ilaria Raimondi; Marta Tunesi; Diego Albani; Carmen Giordano
32516966,Gut-Brain Axis and Neurodegeneration: State-of-the-Art of Meta-Omics Sciences for Microbiota Characterization.,"Recent advances in the field of meta-omics sciences and related bioinformatics tools have allowed a comprehensive investigation of human-associated microbiota and its contribution to achieving and maintaining the homeostatic balance. Bioactive compounds from the microbial community harboring the human gut are involved in a finely tuned network of interconnections with the host, orchestrating a wide variety of physiological processes. These includes the bi-directional crosstalk between the central nervous system, the enteric nervous system, and the gastrointestinal tract (i.e., gut-brain axis). The increasing accumulation of evidence suggest a pivotal role of the composition and activity of the gut microbiota in neurodegeneration. In the present review we aim to provide an overview of the state-of-the-art of meta-omics sciences including metagenomics for the study of microbial genomes and taxa strains, metatranscriptomics for gene expression, metaproteomics and metabolomics to identify and/or quantify microbial proteins and metabolites, respectively. The potential and limitations of each discipline were highlighted, as well as the advantages of an integrated approach (multi-omics) to predict microbial functions and molecular mechanisms related to human diseases. Particular emphasis is given to the latest results obtained with these approaches in an attempt to elucidate the link between the gut microbiota and the most common neurodegenerative diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).",International journal of molecular sciences,2020,Bruno Tilocca; Luisa Pieroni; Alessio Soggiu; Domenico Britti; Luigi Bonizzi; Paola Roncada; Viviana Greco

In the current study, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) induced characteristic PD neurobehavior changes accompanied by increased α-synuclein, apoptotic protein Bim, and cleaved caspase-3 and decreased expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Meanwhile, the tryptophan (Trp) and tyrosine (Tyr) neurotransmitter metabolites involving kynurenine (KYN), serotonin (5-HT), and dopamine (DA) pathways were significantly changed in serum. Furthermore, the step-limited enzymes, which are responsible for the key metabolic pathways of these neurotransmitters, were obviously dysregulated. The 16S rRNA gene sequence results indicated that the abundance and diversity of the microbiota were obviously decreased in MPTP-treated mice, the presence of <i>Ruminococcus, Parabacteroides</i> and <i>Parasutterella</i> genera were obviously increased, while Coriobacteriaceae, <i>Flavonifractor</i>, Lachnospiraceae, Lactobacillaceae, and Rikenellaceae abundance was markedly decreased. The connectivity between the gut microbiota and neurotransmitter metabolism revealed that the gut microbiota dysbiosis was associated with disturbance of the DA, KYN, and 5-HT metabolic pathways. Therefore, our results provide evidence that gut-microbiota-brain axis disturbance may play an important role in PD development and targeting this axis might provide a promising therapeutic strategy for PD.",ACS chemical neuroscience,2020,Yuanhui Zhu; Fei Huan; Junfeng Wang; Xuexue Xie; Guoqin Yu; Xi Wang; Lei Jiang; Rong Gao; Hang Xiao; Haixia Ding; Jun Wang
31931152,Regulation of immune-driven pathogenesis in Parkinson's disease by gut microbiota.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most significant medical and social burdens of our time. The prevalence of PD increases with age and the number of individuals diagnosed with PD is expected to double from 6.9 million in 2015 to 14.2 million in 2040. To date, no drugs can stop the ongoing neurodegeneration caused by PD due to its unclear and complex pathogenic mechanisms. It has been wildly recognized that both gut microbiota and neuro-immunity are involved in the pathology of PD. In this review, we intend to provide a comprehensive overview of current knowledge on how gut microbiota involved in immune-driven pathogenesis of PD, and its potential as a new target of dietary and/or therapeutic interventions for PD.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2020,Wenxia Zheng; Rongni He; Zhenxing Yan; Yaowei Huang; Wei Huang; Zhuoyi Cai; Yuying Su; Siqin Liu; Yiting Deng; Qing Wang; Huifang Xie
33390888,Caffeine and Parkinson's Disease: Multiple Benefits and Emerging Mechanisms.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by dopaminergic neurodegeneration, motor impairment and non-motor symptoms. Epidemiological and experimental investigations into potential risk factors have firmly established that dietary factor caffeine, the most-widely consumed psychoactive substance, may exerts not only neuroprotective but a motor and non-motor (cognitive) benefits in PD. These multi-benefits of caffeine in PD are supported by convergence of epidemiological and animal evidence. At least six large prospective epidemiological studies have firmly established a relationship between increased caffeine consumption and decreased risk of developing PD. In addition, animal studies have also demonstrated that caffeine confers neuroprotection against dopaminergic neurodegeneration using PD models of mitochondrial toxins (MPTP, 6-OHDA, and rotenone) and expression of α-synuclein (α-Syn). While caffeine has complex pharmacological profiles, studies with genetic knockout mice have clearly revealed that caffeine's action is largely mediated by the brain adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptor (A<sub>2A</sub>R) and confer neuroprotection by modulating neuroinflammation and excitotoxicity and mitochondrial function. Interestingly, recent studies have highlighted emerging new mechanisms including caffeine modulation of α-Syn degradation with enhanced autophagy and caffeine modulation of gut microbiota and gut-brain axis in PD models. Importantly, since the first clinical trial in 2003, United States FDA has finally approved clinical use of the A<sub>2A</sub>R antagonist istradefylline for the treatment of PD with OFF-time in Sept. 2019. To realize therapeutic potential of caffeine in PD, genetic study of caffeine and risk genes in human population may identify useful pharmacogenetic markers for predicting individual responses to caffeine in PD clinical trials and thus offer a unique opportunity for ""personalized medicine"" in PD.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2020,Xiangpeng Ren; Jiang-Fan Chen
32247371,The gut microbiome in Parkinson's disease: A culprit or a bystander?,"In recent years, large-scale metagenomics projects such as the Human Microbiome Project placed the gut microbiota under the spotlight of research on its role in health and in the pathogenesis several diseases, as it can be a target for novel therapeutical approaches. The emerging concept of a microbiota modulation of the gut-brain axis in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders has been explored in several studies in animal models, as well as in human subjects. Particularly, research on changes in the composition of gut microbiota as a potential trigger for alpha-synuclein (α-syn) pathology in Parkinson's disease (PD) has gained increasing interest. In the present review, we first provide the basis to the understanding of the role of gut microbiota in healthy subjects and the molecular basis of the gut-brain interaction, focusing on metabolic and neuroinflammatory factors that could trigger the alpha-synuclein conformational changes and aggregation. Then, we critically explored preclinical and clinical studies reporting on the changes in gut microbiota in PD, as compared to healthy subjects. Furthermore, we examined the relationship between the gut microbiota and PD clinical features, discussing data consistently reported across studies, as well as the potential sources of inconsistencies. As a further step toward understanding the effects of gut microbiota on PD, we discussed the relationship between dysbiosis and response to dopamine replacement therapy, focusing on Levodopa metabolism. We conclude that further studies are needed to determine whether the gut microbiota changes observed so far in PD patients is the cause or, instead, it is merely a consequence of lifestyle changes associated with the disease. Regardless, studies so far strongly suggest that changes in microbiota appears to be impactful in pathogenesis of neuroinflammation. Thus, dysbiotic microbiota in PD could influence the disease course and response to medication, especially Levodopa. Future research will assess the impact of microbiota-directed therapeutic intervention in PD patients.",Progress in brain research,2020,Ali Keshavarzian; Phillip Engen; Salvatore Bonvegna; Roberto Cilia
32157731,EGCG ameliorates neuronal and behavioral defects by remodeling gut microbiota and TotM expression in Drosophila models of Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. Eigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the major polyphenol in green tea, is known to exert a beneficial effect on PD patients. Although some mechanisms were suggested to underlie this intervention, it remains unknown if the EGCG-mediated protection was achieved by remodeling gut microbiota. In the present study, 0.1 mM or 0.5 mM EGCG was administered to the Drosophila melanogaster with PINK1 (PTEN induced putative kinase 1) mutations, a prototype PD model, and their behavioral performances, as well as neuronal/mitochondrial morphology (only for 0.5 mM EGCG treatment) were determined. According to the results, the mutant PINK1<sup>B9</sup> flies exhibited dopaminergic, survival, and behavioral deficits, which were rescued by EGCG supplementation. Meanwhile, EGCG resulted in profound changes in gut microbial compositions in PINK1<sup>B9</sup> flies, restoring the abundance of a set of bacteria. Notably, EGCG protection was blunted when gut microbiota was disrupted by antibiotics. We further isolated four bacterial strains from fly guts and the supplementation of individual Lactobacillus plantarum or Acetobacter pomorum strain exacerbated the neuronal and behavioral dysfunction of PD flies, which could not be rescued by EGCG. Transcriptomic analysis identified TotM as the central gene responding to EGCG or microbial manipulations. Genetic ablation of TotM blocked the recovery activity of EGCG, suggesting that EGCG-mediated protection warrants TotM. Apart from familial form, EGCG was also potent in improving sporadic PD symptoms induced by rotenone treatment, wherein gut microbiota shared regulatory roles. Together, our results suggest the relevance of the gut microbiota-TotM pathway in EGCG-mediated neuroprotection, providing insight into indirect mechanisms underlying nutritional intervention of Parkinson's disease.",FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,2020,Yi Xu; Mengmeng Xie; Jinsong Xue; Ling Xiang; Yali Li; Jie Xiao; Guiran Xiao; Hui-Li Wang
31843492,Alterations of the gut microbiota with antibiotics protects dopamine neuron loss and improve motor deficits in a pharmacological rodent model of Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating condition resulting in motor and non-motor symptoms affecting approximately 10 million people worldwide. Currently, there are no pharmacological treatments that can cure the condition or effectively halt its progression. The focus of PD research has been primarily on the neurobiological basis and consequences of dopamine (DA) neuron degeneration given that the loss of DA neurons projecting from the substantia nigra to the dorsal striatum results in the development of cardinal PD motor symptoms. Alternatively, gastrointestinal dysfunction is well recognized in PD patients, and often occurs prior to the development of motor symptoms. The gut microbiota, which contains thousands of bacterial species, play important roles in intestinal barrier integrity and function, metabolism, immunity and brain function. Pre-clinical and clinical studies suggest an important link between alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota and psychiatric and neurological conditions, including PD. Several reports have documented gut dysbiosis and alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota in PD patients. Therefore, the goal of this study was to explore the contribution of the gut microbiota to the behavioral and neurochemical alterations in a rodent toxin model of DA depletion that reproduces the motor symptoms associated with PD. We observed that chronic treatment of adult rats with non-absorbable antibiotics ameliorates the neurotoxicity of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in a unilateral lesion model. Specifically, immunohistochemistry against the dopaminergic neuron marker tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) showed an attenuation of the degree of 6-OHDA-induced dopaminergic neuron loss in antibiotic treated animals compared to control animals. In addition, we observed a reduction in the expression of pro-inflammatory markers in the striatum of antibiotic-treated animals. The degree of motor dysfunction after 6-OHDA was also attenuated in antibiotic-treated animals as measured by paw-rearing measurements in the cylinder test, forepaw stepping test, and ipsilateral rotations observed in the amphetamine-induced rotation test. These results implicate the gut microbiota as a potential contributor to pathology in the development of PD. Further studies are necessary to understand the specific mechanisms involved in transducing alterations in the gut microbiota to changes in dopaminergic neuron loss and motor dysfunction.",Experimental neurology,2020,Dimitri N Koutzoumis; Macarena Vergara; Jose Pino; Julia Buddendorff; Habibeh Khoshbouei; Ronald J Mandel; Gonzalo E Torres
33138351,Implications of the Human Gut-Brain and Gut-Cancer Axes for Future Nanomedicine.,"Recent clinical and pathological evidence have implicated the gut microbiota as a nexus for modulating the homeostasis of the human body, impacting conditions from cancer and dementia to obesity and social behavior. The connections between microbiota and human diseases offer numerous opportunities in medicine, most of which have limited or no therapeutic solutions available. In light of this paradigm-setting trend in science, this review aims to provide a comprehensive and timely summary of the mechanistic pathways governing the gut microbiota and their implications for nanomedicines targeting cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Specifically, we discuss in parallel the beneficial and pathogenic relationship of the gut microbiota along the gut-brain and gut-cancer axes, elaborate on the impact of dysbiosis and the gastrointestinal corona on the efficacy of nanomedicines, and highlight a molecular mimicry that manipulates the universal cross-β backbone of bacterial amyloid to accelerate neurological disorders.

32226375,Microbiota and Other Preventive Strategies and Non-genetic Risk Factors in Parkinson's Disease.,"The exact cause of Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease in modern societies, is still unknown. Many scientists point out that PD is caused by a complex interaction between different factors. Although the main risk factor is age, there are other influences, genetic and environmental, that individually or in combination may trigger neurodegenerative changes leading to PD. Nowadays, research remains focused on better understanding which environmental factors are related to the risk of developing PD and why. In line with the knowledge on evidence on exposures that prevent/delay PD onset or that impact on disease progression, the aims of this review were: (i) to comment on the non-genetic risk factors that mainly affect idiopathic PD; and (ii) to comment on seemingly reliable preventive interventions. We discuss both environmental factors that may affect the central nervous system (CNS) or the intestinal tract, and the likely mechanisms underlying noxious or protective actions. Knowledge on risk, protective factors, and mechanisms may help to envisage why nigral dopaminergic neurons are so vulnerable in PD and, eventually, to design new strategies for PD prevention and/or anti-PD therapy. This article reviews the variety of the known and suspected environmental factors, such as lifestyle, gut microbiota or pesticide exposition, and distinguishes between those that are harmful or beneficial for the PD acquisition or progression. In fact, the review covers one of the most novel players in the whole picture, and we address the role of microbiota on keeping a healthy CNS and/or on preventing the ""side-effects"" related to aging.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2020,Rafael Franco; Rafael Rivas-Santisteban; Irene Reyes-Resina; Gemma Navarro; Eva Martínez-Pinilla
32473843,Microbiota-gut-brain axis in health and disease: Is NLRP3 inflammasome at the crossroads of microbiota-gut-brain communications?,"Growing evidence highlights the relevance of microbiota-gut-brain axis in the maintenance of brain homeostasis as well as in the pathophysiology of major neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), multiple sclerosis (MS), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). In particular, changes in gut microbiota can promote enteric and peripheral neurogenic/inflammatory responses, which, in turn, could contribute to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in the central nervous system (CNS). Of note, the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain leucine rich repeat and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome acts as a key player in both coordinating the host physiology and shaping the peripheral and central immune/inflammatory responses in CNS diseases. In this context, there is pioneering evidence supporting the existence of a microbiota-gut-inflammasome-brain axis, in which enteric bacteria modulate, via NLRP3 signaling, inflammatory pathways that, in turn, contribute to influence brain homeostasis. The present review provides an overview of current knowledge on the role of microbiota-gut-inflammasome-brain axis in the major CNS diseases, including PD, AD, MS, ASD and MDD. In particular, though no direct and causal correlation among altered gut microbiota, NLRP3 activation and brain pathology has been demonstrated and in-depth studies are needed in this setting, our purpose was to pave the way to a novel and pioneering perspective on the pathophysiology of CNS disorders. Our intent was also to highlight and discuss whether alterations of microbiota-gut-inflammasome-brain axis support a holistic view of the pathophysiology of CNS diseases, even though each disorder displays a different clinical picture.",Progress in neurobiology,2020,Carolina Pellegrini; Luca Antonioli; Vincenzo Calderone; Rocchina Colucci; Matteo Fornai; Corrado Blandizzi
31854093,"The gut in Parkinson's disease: Bottom-up, top-down, or neither?","The gut-brain axis is a hot topic in Parkinson's disease. In an attempt to decipher its role in the disease pathogenesis, several animal models have been developed. Most of these models tried to reproduce Braak's hypothesis by showing that the pathological process could spread from the gut to the brain (bottom-up scenario). Interestingly, others groups showed that a top-down scenario could also occur and that 6-hydroxydopamine-induced nigrostriatal denervation was sufficient to induce significant changes in the gastrointestinal tract. Aside from this toxic approach, the article by O'Donovan and colleagues in this edition of Neurogastroenterology and Motility showed that bilateral nigral injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-alpha-synuclein in rats was accompanied by changes in the enteric nervous system and the gut microbiota, which occurred without any apparent brain-to-gut spread of human injected alpha-synuclein. Some changes observed in the gastrointestinal tract of animals injected with AAV-alpha-synuclein were in line with previous observations in Parkinson's disease patients, including increased expression of glial markers, swollen tyrosine hydroxylase-positive varicosities in the submucosal plexus, and decreases in Faecalibacterium and Lachnospiraceae. These findings suggest that, in addition to gut-brain pathways, the brain-to-gut communication may also be involved in Parkinson's disease pathophysiology. In this mini-review, we describe the strengths and limitations of the existing studies on the gut-brain axis in experimental models of parkinsonism and discuss an alternative hypothesis in which the central and enteric nervous system would evolve separately during disease progression.",Neurogastroenterology and motility,2020,Laurène Leclair-Visonneau; Michel Neunlist; Pascal Derkinderen; Thibaud Lebouvier
32941730,Gut Microbiota Dynamics in Parkinsonian Mice.,"Peripheral immunity is thought to be dysregulated in Parkinson's disease (PD) and may provide an avenue for novel immunotherapeutic interventions. Gut microbiota is a potential factor for modulating immunotherapy response. Considering the possibly complex role of the gut-brain axis in PD, we used a preclinical model to determine the effects of gut microbiota dynamics in mice receiving an immunotherapeutic intervention compared to controls. A total of 17 M83 heterozygous transgenic mice were used in this study. Mice in the treatment arm (<i>N</i> = 10) received adoptive cellular therapy (ACT) by injection, and control mice (<i>N</i> = 7) were injected with saline at 8 weeks of age. All mice received peripheral α-syn fibrils to hasten parkinsonian symptoms via an intramuscular injection 1 week later (9 weeks of age; baseline). Fecal pellets were collected from all mice at three time points postinjection (baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks). DNA from each stool sample was extracted, and 16S rDNA was amplified, sequenced, and analyzed using QIIME2 and RStudio. Differences in the relative abundance of bacterial taxa were observed over time between groups. No significant differences in alpha diversity were found between groups at any time point. UniFrac measures of phylogenetic distance between samples demonstrated distinct clustering between groups postbaseline (<i>p</i> = 0.002). These differences suggest that the gut microbiome may be capable of influencing immunotherapy outcomes. Conclusively, we observed distinctly different microbiota dynamics in treated mice compared to those in the control group. These results suggest a correlation between the gut-brain axis, PD pathology, and immunotherapy.",ACS chemical neuroscience,2020,Emily Klann; Massimiliano S Tagliamonte; Maria Ukhanova; Volker Mai; Vinata Vedam-Mai
33153085,Do the Bugs in Your Gut Eat Your Memories? Relationship between Gut Microbiota and Alzheimer's Disease.,"The human microbiota is composed of trillions of microbial cells inhabiting the oral cavity, skin, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, airways, and reproductive organs. The gut microbiota is composed of dynamic communities of microorganisms that communicate bidirectionally with the brain via cytokines, neurotransmitters, hormones, and secondary metabolites, known as the gut microbiota-brain axis. The gut microbiota-brain axis is suspected to be involved in the development of neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease, and Autism Spectrum Disorder. AD is an irreversible, neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS), characterized by amyloid-β plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuroinflammation. Microglia and astrocytes, the resident immune cells of the CNS, play an integral role in AD development, as neuroinflammation is a driving factor of disease severity. The gut microbiota-brain axis is a novel target for Alzheimer's disease therapeutics to modulate critical neuroimmune and metabolic pathways. Potential therapeutics include probiotics, prebiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, and dietary intervention. This review summarizes our current understanding of the role of the gut microbiota-brain axis and neuroinflammation in the onset and development of Alzheimer's disease, limitations of current research, and potential for gut microbiota-brain axis targeted therapies.",Brain sciences,2020,Emily M Borsom; Keehoon Lee; Emily K Cope
33418492,Gut microbiota-derived metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide as a biomarker in early Parkinson's disease.,"This study aimed to investigate the potential of using changes in the plasma levels of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a gut microbiota-derived metabolite, as a biomarker in early Parkinson's disease (PD).Plasma TMAO levels were measured in 85 patients with drug-naïve early stage PD and 20 healthy controls. A linear mixed model was used to assess longitudinal changes in levodopa-equivalent dose (LED) during follow-up (>2 y) in three tertile PD groups according to plasma TMAO levels. Additionally, a Cox regression analysis was performed to assess the effect of plasma TMAO levels on dementia conversion.Plasma TMAO levels of patients with PD were lower than those of healthy controls. A linear mixed model demonstrated that patients with PD and lower levels of TMAO (<4.75 μmol/L; i.e., lowest tertile group) exhibited faster increases in LED over time. The Cox regression model did not reveal that plasma TMAO level was associated with the risk for dementia conversion (P = 0.488). However, when we divided patients with PD into two subgroups according to bet cutoff TMAO level to maximize the log-rank statistics, the PD group with a low plasma TMAO level (<6.92 μmol/L) had a higher risk (with borderline statistical significance) for PD-dementia conversion than the group with a high TMAO level (hazard ratio: 7.565; 95% confidence interval, 1.004-57.019; P = 0.050).The results demonstrate that lower baseline plasma TMAO levels are associated with faster increases in LED and tend to increase the risk for PD-dementia conversion, suggesting the prognostic implications of TMAO in early stage PD.","Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)",2021,Seok Jong Chung; John Hoon Rim; Dajeong Ji; Sangwon Lee; Han Soo Yoo; Jin Ho Jung; KyoungWon Baik; Yonghoon Choi; Byoung Seok Ye; Young H Sohn; Mijin Yun; Sang-Guk Lee; Phil Hyu Lee

32161568,Gut Microbiota Altered in Mild Cognitive Impairment Compared With Normal Cognition in Sporadic Parkinson's Disease.,"<b>Background and Aim:</b> Gut bacteria play an important role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the alteration of fecal microbiota in PD with cognitive impairment remains unexplored. This study aimed to explore whether the gut microbiota of patients with PD having mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) were different from those with PD having normal cognition (PD-NC) and from healthy controls (HC). Also, the study probed the association between altered gut microbiota and cognitive ability in patients with PD. <b>Methods:</b> The fecal bacteria composition and short-chain fatty acids of 13 patients with PD-MCI, 14 patients with PD-NC, and 13 healthy spouses were analyzed using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. <b>Results:</b> Compared with HC, the fecal microbial diversities increased in patients with PD-MCI and PD-NC. After adjusting the influence of age, sex, body mass index, education, and constipation using the statistical method, the relative abundances of two families (Rikenellaceae and Ruminococcaceae) and four genera (<i>Alistipes, Barnesiella, Butyricimonas</i>, and <i>Odoribacter</i>) were found to be higher in the feces of the PD-MCI group compared with the other two groups. Moreover, the abundance of genus <i>Blautia</i> and <i>Ruminococcus</i> decreased obviously in the PD-MCI group compared with the PD-NC group. Further, the abundance of genera <i>Butyricimonas, Barnesiella, Alistipes, Odoribacter</i>, and <i>Ruminococcus</i> negatively correlated with cognition ability. <b>Conclusion:</b> Compared with HC and patients with PD-NC, the gut microbiota of patients with PD-MCI was significantly altered, particularly manifesting in enriched genera from Porphyromonadaceae family and decreased the abundance of genera <i>Blautia</i> and <i>Ruminococcus</i>.",Frontiers in neurology,2020,Tengzhu Ren; Yuyuan Gao; Yihui Qiu; Shuolin Jiang; Qingxi Zhang; Jiahui Zhang; Limin Wang; Yuhu Zhang; Lijuan Wang; Kun Nie
33262001,Molecular imaging of microbiota-gut-brain axis: searching for the right targeted probe for the right target and disease.,"The highly bidirectional dialogue between the gut and the brain is markedly stimulated and influenced by the microbiome through integrated neuroendocrine, neurological and immunological processes. Gut microbiota itself communicate with the host producing hormonal intermediates, metabolites, proteins, and toxins responsible for a variety of biochemical and functional inputs, thereby shaping host homeostasis. Indeed, a dysregulated microbiota-gut-brain axis might be the origin of many neuroimmune-mediated disorders, e.g. autism, multiple sclerosis, depression, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, which appear months or even years prior to a diagnosis, corroborating the theory that the pathological process is spread from the gut to the brain. A much deeper comprehension of how commensal microbe can be manipulated to interfere with disease progression is crucial for developing new strategies to diagnose and treat diseases. In recent years, the potential of positron-emission-tomography (PET) in the field of bacteria detection has gained attention. The uptake of several PET tracers has been evaluated to investigate infection pathophysiology, e.g. sterile or pathogen-mediated infection, monitoring of progression, or as a surrogate endpoint in clinical trials. In this minireview, we briefly describe the role of microbiome-gut-brain axis in health and disease and we discuss the imaging modalities and agents that could be applied to study the dynamic interactions between microbiome, gut and brain. These are key aspects in understanding the biochemical lexicon underpinning the microbiome-host crosstalk that would enable the development of diagnostics and therapeutics by targeting the human microbiota.",Nuclear medicine and biology,2021,Maria Cecilia Giron; Ulderico Mazzi
32325848,Can Gut Microbiota Be a Good Predictor for Parkinson's Disease? A Machine Learning Approach.,"The involvement of the gut microbiota in Parkinson's disease (PD), investigated in several studies, identified some common alterations of the microbial community, such as a decrease in <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> and an increase in <i>Verrucomicrobiaceae</i> families in PD patients. However, the results of other bacterial families are often contradictory. Machine learning is a promising tool for building predictive models for the classification of biological data, such as those produced in metagenomic studies. We tested three different machine learning algorithms (random forest, neural networks and support vector machines), analyzing 846 metagenomic samples (472 from PD patients and 374 from healthy controls), including our published data and those downloaded from public databases. Prediction performance was evaluated by the area under curve, accuracy, precision, recall and F-score metrics. The random forest algorithm provided the best results. Bacterial families were sorted according to their importance in the classification, and a subset of 22 families has been identified for the prediction of patient status.

33338469,Gut-Brain axis in Parkinson's disease etiology: The role of lipopolysaccharide.,"Recent studies highlight the initiation of Parkinson's disease (PD) in the gastrointestinal tract, decades before the manifestations in the central nervous system (CNS). This gut-brain axis of neurodegenerative diseases defines the critical role played by the unique microbial composition of the ""second brain"" formed by the enteric nervous system (ENS). Compromise in the enteric wall can result in the translocation of gut-microbiota along with their metabolites into the system that can affect the homeostatic machinery. The released metabolites can associate with protein substrates affecting several biological pathways. Among these, the bacterial endotoxin from Gram-negative bacteria, i.e., Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), has been implicated to play a definite role in progressive neurodegeneration. The molecular interaction of the lipid metabolites can have a direct neuro-modulatory effect on homeostatic protein components that can be transported to the CNS via the vagus nerve. α-synuclein (α-syn) is one such partner protein, the molecular interactions with which modulate its overall fibrillation propensity in the system. LPS interaction has been shown to affect the protein's aggregation kinetics in an alternative inflammatory pathway of PD pathogenesis. Several other lipid contents from the bacterial membranes could also be responsible for the initiation of α-syn amyloidogenesis. The present review will focus on the intermolecular interactions of α-syn with bacterial lipid components, particularly LPS, with a definite clinical manifestation in PD pathogenesis. However, deconvolution of the sequence of interaction events from the ENS to its propagation in the CNS is not easy or obvious. Nevertheless, the characterization of these lipid-mediated structures is a step towards realizing the novel targets in the pre-emptive diagnoses of PD. This comprehensive description should prompt the correlation of potential risk of amyloidogenesis upon detection of specific paradigm shifts in the microbial composition of the gut.",Chemistry and physics of lipids,2021,Dipita Bhattacharyya; Anirban Bhunia
32035595,Polyphenols in the management of brain disorders: Modulation of the microbiota-gut-brain axis.,"The modulation of the microbiota-gut-brain axis with a view to preventing and treating brain disorders became recently a hot topic for the scientific community. Dietary polyphenols are multifaceted compounds that have demonstrated to be highly advantageous to counteract inflammation, oxidative stress, and neurodegeneration, among other pathological conditions, being useful in the prevention and treatment of several chronic disorders. The potential of these compounds to prevent and treat brain disorders has not been only related to their capacity to reach the brain, depending on their chemical structure, and interact directly with brain cells, but also to their ability to modulate the communication between the brain and the gut, interfering with multiple branches of this axis. Preclinical studies have demonstrated the potential of these food bioactive compounds in brain diseases, namely, neurodevelopmental, such as Down's syndrome and Autism spectrum disorder, neurodegenerative, such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, and psychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety. Until now, dietary polyphenols have been recognized as promising nutraceuticals to combat brain disorders. However, the impact of these compounds on the gut-brain interconnection remains poorly elucidated. Also, clinical assays are crucial to further support the beneficial effects of these compounds as demonstrated in preclinical research.",Advances in food and nutrition research,2020,Diana Serra; Leonor M Almeida; Teresa C P Dinis
32819577,Dcf1 deletion presents alterations in gut microbiota of mice similar to Parkinson's disease.,"The gut-brain communication is increasingly being recognized as a profound effector on Parkinson's disease (PD). Gut microbiota changes have become the focus of attention. However, the mechanism leading to changes in the gut microbiota is not clear. In the present study, we found that knockout of Dcf1 (Dcf1<sup>-/-</sup>) caused changes in the gut microbiota in mice. Results indicated that the increased Proteobacteria (phylum-level) and decreased Prevotellaceae (family-level) in the microbiota composition of Dcf1<sup>-/-</sup> (KO) mice, which is consistent with the situation of PD patients. On species-level, Prevotellaceae_UCG-001 and Helicobacter_ganmani were significantly different between KO and WT mice, suggesting glycolipid metabolism disorders and inflammatory lesions in KO mice. In the behavior of Y-maze and Open field test, KO mice showed typical PD symptoms such as memory deficits, slowness of movement and anxiety. Further Nissl staining of brain tissue sections confirmed that the deletion of Dcf1 caused damage to amygdala neurons. These results provide a new mechanism for understanding gut microbiota changes, and provide a new basis for PD treatment from a new perspective of Gut-brain axis.",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2020,Weihao Li; Qinpin Zhao; Jiao Wang; Yajiang Wang; Tieqiao Wen
32557853,Meta-Analysis of Gut Dysbiosis in Parkinson's Disease.,"PD may begin with the intestinal accumulation of α-synuclein fibrils, which can be causally associated with gut dysbiosis. The variability of gut microbiota across countries prevented us from identifying shared gut dysbiosis in PD.To identify gut dysbiosis in PD across countries.We performed 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing analysis of gut microbiota in 223 patients with PD and 137 controls, and meta-analyzed gut dysbiosis by combining our dataset with four previously reported data sets from the United States, Finland, Russia, and Germany. We excluded uncommon taxa from our analyses. For pathway analysis, we developed the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes orthology set enrichment analysis method.After adjusting for confounding factors (body mass index, constipation, sex, age, and catechol-O-methyl transferase inhibitor), genera Akkermansia and Catabacter, as well as families Akkermansiaceae, were increased, whereas genera Roseburia, Faecalibacterium, and Lachnospiraceae ND3007 group were decreased in PD. Catechol-O-methyl transferase inhibitor intake markedly increased family Lactobacillaceae. Inspection of these bacteria in 12 datasets that were not included in the meta-analysis revealed that increased genus Akkermansia and decreased genera Roseburia and Faecalibacterium were frequently observed across countries. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes orthology set enrichment analysis revealed changes in short-chain fatty acid metabolisms in our dataset.We report that intestinal mucin layer-degrading Akkermansia is increased and that short-chain fatty acid-producing Roseburia and Faecalibacterium are decreased in PD across countries. © 2020 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society,2020,Hiroshi Nishiwaki; Mikako Ito; Tomohiro Ishida; Tomonari Hamaguchi; Tetsuya Maeda; Kenichi Kashihara; Yoshio Tsuboi; Jun Ueyama; Teppei Shimamura; Hiroshi Mori; Ken Kurokawa; Masahisa Katsuno; Masaaki Hirayama; Kinji Ohno
31552496,Microbiota: a novel regulator of pain.,"Among the various regulators of the nervous system, the gut microbiota has been recently described to have the potential to modulate neuronal cells activation. While bacteria-derived products can induce aversive responses and influence pain perception, recent work suggests that ""abnormal"" microbiota is associated with neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease or autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Here we review how the gut microbiota modulates afferent sensory neurons function and pain, highlighting the role of the microbiota/gut/brain axis in the control of behaviors and neurological diseases. We outline the changes in gut microbiota, known as dysbiosis, and their influence on painful gastrointestinal disorders. Furthermore, both direct host/microbiota interaction that implicates activation of ""pain-sensing"" neurons by metabolites, or indirect communication via immune activation is discussed. Finally, treatment options targeting the gut microbiota, including pre- or probiotics, will be proposed. Further studies on microbiota/nervous system interaction should lead to the identification of novel microbial ligands and host receptor-targeted drugs, which could ultimately improve chronic pain management and well-being.","Journal of neural transmission (Vienna, Austria : 1996)",2020,Manon Defaye; Sandie Gervason; Christophe Altier; Jean-Yves Berthon; Denis Ardid; Edith Filaire; Frédéric Antonio Carvalho
32710966,Polymannuronic acid prevents dopaminergic neuronal loss via brain-gut-microbiota axis in Parkinson's disease model.,"The study aims to investigate the potentially neuroprotective effects and underlying mechanisms for brown seaweed polysaccharide of polymannuronic acid (PM) against Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis. PD model mice were pretreated with PM via oral gavage once per day for 4 weeks and the preventative effects of PM against neuronal loss together with its modulation on brain-gut-microbiota axis were systematically explored. The results showed PM administration improved motor functions by preventing dopaminergic neuronal loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and enhanced contents of striatal homovanillic acid (HVA), serotonin (5-HT), 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in PD mice. PM significantly alleviated inflammation in gut, brain and systemic circulation as shown by reduced levels or expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines concurrently and inhibited mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling pathway in mice colon. Meanwhile, PM greatly improved integrity of intestinal barrier and blood brain barrier (BBB) as indicated by increased expressions of tight junction associated proteins in both mice colon and SNpc. Further studies indicated PM treatment resulted in changes of gut microbial compositions, together with great alterations of digestion and metabolism of dietary proteins and fats, which led to surge increase of fecal short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the colon of PD mice. In conclusion, pre-administration of PM could provide neuroprotective effects against PD pathogenesis by suppressing inflammation in gut, brain and systemic circulation, and by improving integrity of intestinal barrier and BBB. PM might modulate brain-gut-microbiota axis, at least in part, via gut microbiota derived SCFAs as mediators.",International journal of biological macromolecules,2020,Xiao-Li Dong; Xiong Wang; Fang Liu; Xin Liu; Zhong-Rui Du; Robert W Li; Chang-Hu Xue; Ka-Hing Wong; Wing-Tak Wong; Qing Zhao; Qing-Juan Tang
32844199,Gut metagenomics-derived genes as potential biomarkers of Parkinson's disease.,"Identification of the gut microbiome compositions associated with disease has become a research focus worldwide. Emerging evidence has revealed the presence of gut microbiota dysbiosis in Parkinson's disease. In this study, we aimed to identify the gut microbiome associated with Parkinson's disease and subsequently to screen and to validate potential diagnostic biomarkers of Parkinson's disease. This case-control study investigated gut microbial genes in faeces from 40 volunteer Chinese patients with Parkinson's disease and their healthy spouses using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Furthermore, the identified specific gut microbial gene markers were validated with real-time PCR in an independent Chinese cohort of 78 Parkinson's disease patients, 75 control subjects, 40 patients with multiple system atrophy and 25 patients with Alzheimer's disease. We developed the first gut microbial gene catalogue associated with Parkinson's disease. Twenty-five gene markers were identified that distinguished Parkinson's disease patients from healthy control subjects, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.896 (95% confidence interval: 83.1-96.1%). A highly accurate Parkinson's disease index, which was not influenced by disease severity or Parkinson's disease medications, was created. Testing these gene markers using quantitative PCR distinguished Parkinson's disease patients from healthy controls not only in the 40 couples (AUC = 0.922, 95% confidence interval: 86.4-98.0%), but also in an independent group of 78 patients with Parkinson's disease and 75 healthy control subjects (AUC = 0.905, 95% confidence interval: 86.0-95.1%). This classifier also performed a differential diagnosis power in discriminating these 78 patients with Parkinson's disease from a cohort of 40 patients with multiple system atrophy and 25 patients with Alzheimer's disease based on the panel of 25 biomarkers. Based on our results, the identified Parkinson's disease index based on the gene set from the gut microbiome may be a potential diagnostic biomarker of Parkinson's disease.",Brain : a journal of neurology,2020,Yiwei Qian; Xiaodong Yang; Shaoqing Xu; Pei Huang; Binyin Li; Juanjuan Du; Yixi He; Binghua Su; Li-Ming Xu; Liang Wang; Ruocheng Huang; Shengdi Chen; Qin Xiao

32317956,Microbial BMAA and the Pathway for Parkinson's Disease Neurodegeneration.,"The neurotoxin β-<i>N</i>-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) is a natural non-proteinogenic diamino acid produced by several species of both prokaryotic (cyanobacteria) and eukaryotic (diatoms and dinoflagellates) microorganisms. BMAA has been shown to biomagnify through the food chain in some ecosystems, accumulating for example in seafood such as shellfish and fish, common dietary sources of BMAA whose ingestion may have possible neuronal consequences. In addition to its excitotoxic potential, BMAA has been implicated in protein misfolding and aggregation, inhibition of specific enzymes and neuroinflammation, all hallmark features of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the exact molecular mechanisms of neurotoxicity remain to be elucidated in detail. Although BMAA is commonly detected in its free form, complex BMAA-containing molecules have also been identified such as the paenilamicins, produced by an insect gut bacterial pathogen. On the other hand, production of BMAA or BMAA-containing molecules by members of the human gut microbiota, for example by non-photosynthetic cyanobacteria, the Melainabacteria, remains only hypothetical. In any case, should BMAA reach the gut it may interact with cells of the mucosal immune system and neurons of the enteric nervous system (ENS) and possibly target the mitochondria. Here, we review the available evidence and hint on possible mechanisms by which chronic exposure to dietary sources of this microbial neurotoxin may drive protein misfolding and mitochondrial dysfunction with concomitant activation of innate immune responses, chronic low-grade gut inflammation, and ultimately the neurodegenerative features observed across the gut-brain axis in Parkinson's disease (PD).",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2020,Daniela Nunes-Costa; João Duarte Magalhães; Maria G-Fernandes; Sandra Morais Cardoso; Nuno Empadinhas
32865266,Leveraging sequence-based faecal microbial community survey data to identify alterations in gut microbiota among patients with Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease is a common degenerative disease of the elderly. Although the majority of studies have focused on the central nervous system (CNS) features of Parkinson's disease, recent findings suggest there is a functional link between the gut microbiome and the hallmarks of the disease. PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE and other Chinese and English databases were searched for relevant literature. Studies on changes to intestinal microbiota in Parkinson's patients were retrieved and systematically reviewed. Quality filtering, clustering and species annotation were performed on 16s sequencing raw data from retrieved studies to achieve comparability across studies. Alpha-diversity indices and a random effect model were used to analyse significantly altered microbiota. A total of nine studies were included in this retrospective analysis, four of which contained raw data. Alpha diversity was significantly different between control and Parkinson's disease patients in two of the four studies. Using the raw data from four individual studies, we observed differences in the phlya Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria. Additionally, differences were observed between control and Parkinson's disease patients at the level of family (Prevotellacaea and Lactobacillaceae) and genus (Bifidobacterium and Clostridium). This study confirmed that changes in the microbiome are a consistent feature of Parkinson's disease patients and, therefore, may contribute to the onset of disease.",The European journal of neuroscience,2021,Tianyi Ji; Hongyan Huang; Jiaxuan Liu; Tian Peng; Xiazhu Zhou; Qin Tan; Jiaguo Yuan; Huan Hua; Songtao Ding; Handeng Liu

32768944,The gut microbiota attenuate neuroinflammation in manganese exposure by inhibiting cerebral NLRP3 inflammasome.,"Manganese (Mn) exposure has been reported to cause neurodegenerative disorders. β-Amyloid (Aβ) induced Tau pathology in an NLRP3-dependent manner is at the heart of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in the bidirectional gut-brain axis that integrates the gut and central nervous system (CNS) activities. In this study, we found that Mn exposure increases Aβ<sub>1-40</sub> and Tau production in brain, and causes hippocampal degeneration and necrosis. Meanwhile, Mn exposure can stimulate neurotoxicity by increasing inflammation either in peripheral blood and CNS. Importantly, we found that transplantation of gut microbiota from normal rats into Mn exposure rats reduced Aβ and Tau expression, and the cerebral expression of NLRP3 was downregulated, and the expression of neuroinflammatory factors was also downregulated. Therefore, improving the composition of gut microbiota in Mn exposure rats can attenuate neuroinflammation, which is considered as a novel therapeutic strategy for Mn exposure by remodelling the gut microbiota.",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2020,Hui Wang; Feng Yang; Ruihua Xin; Dongan Cui; Jiongjie He; Shidong Zhang; Yan Sun
33293403,Short-Chain Fatty Acid-Producing Gut Microbiota Is Decreased in Parkinson's Disease but Not in Rapid-Eye-Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder.,"Gut dysbiosis has been repeatedly reported in Parkinson's disease (PD) but only once in idiopathic rapid-eye-movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) from Germany. Abnormal aggregation of α-synuclein fibrils causing PD possibly starts from the intestine, although this is still currently under debate. iRBD patients frequently develop PD. Early-stage gut dysbiosis that is causally associated with PD is thus expected to be observed in iRBD. We analyzed gut microbiota in 26 iRBD patients and 137 controls by 16S rRNA sequencing (16S rRNA-seq). Our iRBD data set was meta-analyzed with the German iRBD data set and was compared with gut microbiota in 223 PD patients. Unsupervised clustering of gut microbiota by LIGER, a topic model-based tool for single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis, revealed four enterotypes in controls, iRBD, and PD. Short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria were conserved in an enterotype observed in controls and iRBD, whereas they were less conserved in enterotypes observed in PD. Genus <i>Akkermansia</i> and family <i>Akkermansiaceae</i> were consistently increased in both iRBD in two countries and PD in five countries. Short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria were not significantly decreased in iRBD in two countries. In contrast, we previously reported that recognized or putative SCFA-producing genera <i>Faecalibacterium</i>, <i>Roseburia</i>, and <i>Lachnospiraceae ND3007 group</i> were consistently decreased in PD in five countries. In α-synucleinopathy, increase of mucin-layer-degrading genus <i>Akkermansia</i> is observed at the stage of iRBD, whereas decrease of SCFA-producing genera becomes obvious with development of PD.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Twenty studies on gut microbiota in PD have been reported, whereas only one study has been reported on iRBD from Germany. iRBD has the highest likelihood ratio to develop PD. Our meta-analysis of iRBD in Japan and Germany revealed increased mucin-layer-degrading genus <i>Akkermansia</i> in iRBD. Genus <i>Akkermansia</i> may increase the intestinal permeability, as we previously observed in PD patients, and may make the intestinal neural plexus exposed to oxidative stress, which can lead to abnormal aggregation of prion-like α-synuclein fibrils in the intestine. In contrast to PD, SCFA-producing bacteria were not decreased in iRBD. As SCFA induces regulatory T (Treg) cells, a decrease of SCFA-producing bacteria may be a prerequisite for the development of PD. We propose that prebiotic and/or probiotic therapeutic strategies to increase the intestinal mucin layer and to increase intestinal SCFA potentially retard the development of iRBD and PD.",mSystems,2020,Hiroshi Nishiwaki; Tomonari Hamaguchi; Mikako Ito; Tomohiro Ishida; Tetsuya Maeda; Kenichi Kashihara; Yoshio Tsuboi; Jun Ueyama; Teppei Shimamura; Hiroshi Mori; Ken Kurokawa; Masahisa Katsuno; Masaaki Hirayama; Kinji Ohno
31737957,Antibiotic exposure and risk of Parkinson's disease in Finland: A nationwide case-control study.,"Gut microbiota alterations have been found in prodromal and established Parkinson's disease (PD). Antibiotic exposure can have long-term effects on the composition of human intestinal microbiota, but a potential connection between antibiotic exposure and risk of PD has not been studied previously.To evaluate the impact of antibiotic exposure on the risk of PD in a nationwide, register-based, case-control study.We identified all patients who were diagnosed with PD in Finland during the years 1998 to 2014. Information was obtained on individual purchases of orally administered antibiotics during the years 1993 to 2014. We assessed the association between prior antibiotic exposure and PD using conditional logistic regression.The study population consisted of 13,976 PD cases and 40,697 controls. The strongest connection with PD risk was found for oral exposure to macrolides and lincosamides (adjusted odds ratio up to 1.416; 95% confidence interval, 1.053-1.904). After correction for multiple comparisons, exposure to antianaerobics and tetracyclines 10 to 15 years before the index date, sulfonamides and trimethoprim 1 to 5 years before the index date, and antifungal medications 1 to 5 years before the index date were positively associated with PD risk. In post hoc analyses, further positive associations were found for broad-spectrum antibiotics.Exposure to certain types of oral antibiotics seems to be associated with an elevated risk of PD with a delay that is consistent with the proposed duration of a prodromal period. The pattern of associations supports the hypothesis that effects on gut microbiota could link antibiotics to PD, but further studies are needed to confirm this. © 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society,2020,Tuomas H Mertsalmi; Eero Pekkonen; Filip Scheperjans
33106549,Increased intestinal permeability and gut dysbiosis in the R6/2 mouse model of Huntington's disease.,"Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive, multifaceted neurodegenerative disease associated with weight loss and gut problems. Under healthy conditions, tight junction (TJ) proteins maintain the intestinal barrier integrity preventing bacterial translocation from the intestinal lumen to the systemic circulation. Reduction of TJs expression in Parkinson's disease patients has been linked with increased intestinal permeability-leaky gut syndrome. The intestine contains microbiota, most dominant phyla being Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes; in pathogenic or disease conditions the balance between these bacteria might be disrupted. The present study investigated whether there is evidence for an increased intestinal permeability and dysbiosis in the R6/2 mouse model of HD. Our data demonstrate that decreased body weight and body length in R6/2 mice is accompanied by a significant decrease in colon length and increased gut permeability compared to wild type littermates, without any significant changes in the protein levels of the tight junction proteins (occludin, zonula occludens). Moreover, we found an altered gut microbiota in R6/2 mice with increased relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and decreased of Firmicutes. Our results indicate an increased intestinal permeability and dysbiosis in R6/2 mice and further studies investigating the clinical relevance of these findings are warranted.",Scientific reports,2020,Tiberiu Loredan Stan; Rana Soylu-Kucharz; Stephen Burleigh; Olena Prykhodko; Ling Cao; Naomi Franke; Marie Sjögren; Caroline Haikal; Frida Hållenius; Maria Björkqvist
31654753,Emerging concepts of mitochondrial dysfunction in Parkinson's disease progression: Pathogenic and therapeutic implications.,"Mitochondria are very dynamic organelle which plays a multifactorial role for a broad range of physiological processes inside the cell to maintain neural circuit integrity. They are required for the generation of cellular energy, regulation of calcium homeostasis and controlling programmed cell death. Defective mitochondrial homeostasis is frequently reported in a broad range of neurological disorders. Many lines of evidence suggest that it plays an essential role in aging and neurodegeneration. Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder and its aetiology is still largely unexplored. Overwhelming evidences indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in PD pathogenesis. Various genes involved in maintaining the mitochondrial homeostasis are also associated with the PD pathophysiology. Alterations in mitochondrial functions such as generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), impaired mitophagy, altered mitochondrial dynamics, impaired mitochondrial biogenesis and Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering may precede the development of PD pathology. In addition, recent studies have also shown the involvement of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases including PD. In this context, mitochondria-targeted therapies that can ameliorate the mitochondrial abnormalities may have great promise in the prevention and treatment of PD. This review aims to discuss the mitochondrial dysfunction associated with PD pathogenesis, influence of microbiome on mitochondrial regulation and various mitochondrial targeted therapies that can improve the mitochondrial function and deplete the severity of the disease.",Mitochondrion,2020,Linchi Rani; Amal Chandra Mondal

Emerging evidence is supporting the use of various strategies that modulate gut microbiota to exert neurological and psychological changes. This includes the utilisation of probiotics as a natural and dietary intervention for brain health. Here, we showed the potential AD-reversal effects of <i>Lactobacillus</i> probiotics through feeding to our <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> AD model. The administration of <i>Lactobacillus</i> strains was able to rescue the rough eye phenotype (REP) seen in AD-induced <i>Drosophila</i>, with a more prominent effect observed upon the administration of <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> DR7 (DR7). Furthermore, we analysed the gut microbiota of the AD-induced <i>Drosophila</i> and found elevated levels of <i>Wolbachia</i>. The administration of DR7 restored the gut microbiota diversity of AD-induced <i>Drosophila</i> with a significant reduction in <i>Wolbachia</i>'s relative abundance, accompanied by an increase of <i>Stenotrophomonas</i> and <i>Acetobacter</i>. Through functional predictive analyses, <i>Wolbachia</i> was predicted to be positively correlated with neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's, Huntington's and Alzheimer's diseases, while <i>Stenotrophomonas</i> was negatively correlated with these neurodegenerative disorders. Altogether, our data exhibited DR7's ability to ameliorate the AD effects in our AD-induced <i>Drosophila</i>.

31576631,Nigral overexpression of α-synuclein in a rat Parkinson's disease model indicates alterations in the enteric nervous system and the gut microbiome.,"A hallmark feature of Parkinson's disease (PD) is the build-up of α-synuclein protein aggregates throughout the brain; however α-synuclein is also expressed in enteric neurons. Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and pathology are frequently reported in PD, including constipation, increased intestinal permeability, glial pathology, and alterations to gut microbiota composition. α-synuclein can propagate through neuronal systems but the site of origin of α-synuclein pathology, whether it be the gut or the brain, is still unknown. Physical exercise is associated with alleviating symptoms of PD and with altering the composition of the gut microbiota.This study investigated the effects of bilateral nigral injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-α-synuclein on enteric neurons, glia and neurochemistry, the gut microbiome, and bile acid metabolism in rats, some of whom were exposed to voluntary exercise.Nigral overexpression of α-synuclein resulted in significant neuronal loss in the ileal submucosal plexus with no change in enteric glia. In contrast, the myenteric plexus showed a significant increase in glial expression, while neuronal numbers were maintained. Concomitant alterations were observed in the gut microbiome and related bile acid metabolism. Voluntary running protected against neuronal loss, increased enteric glial expression, and modified gut microbiome composition in the brain-injected AAV-α-synuclein PD model.These results show that developing nigral α-synuclein pathology in this PD model exerts significant alterations on the enteric nervous system (ENS) and gut microbiome that are receptive to modification by exercise. This highlights brain to gut communication as an important mechanism in PD pathology.",Neurogastroenterology and motility,2020,Sarah M O'Donovan; Erin K Crowley; Jillian R-M Brown; Orla O'Sullivan; Olivia F O'Leary; Suzanne Timmons; Yvonne M Nolan; David J Clarke; Niall P Hyland; Susan A Joyce; Aideen M Sullivan; Cora O'Neill
32105745,Mercury sulfide-containing Hua-Feng-Dan and 70W (Rannasangpei) protect against LPS plus MPTP-induced neurotoxicity and disturbance of gut microbiota in mice.,"Mercury sulfides (HgS) are frequently included in Ayurveda, Tibetan and Chinese medicines to assist the presumed therapeutic effects, but the ethnopharmacology remains elusive. The present study examined the protective effects of α-HgS-containing Hua-Feng-Dan and β-HgS-containing 70 Wei-Zhen-Zhu-Wan (70W, Rannasangpei) against Parkinson's disease mice induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plus 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP).A single injection of LPS (5 mg/kg ip) was given to adult male C57BL/6 mice, and 150 days later, the low dose of MPTP (15 mg/kg, ip, for 4 days) was given to produce the ""two-hit"" Parkinson's disease model. Together with MPTP treatment, mice were fed with clinically-relevant doses of Hua-Feng-Dan (0.6 g/kg) and 70W (0.2 g/kg) for 35 days. Rotarod test was performed to examine muscle coordination capability. At the end of the experiment, brain was transcardially perfused with paraformaldehyde, the substantia nigra was sectioned for microglia (Iba1 staining) and dopaminergic neuron (THir staining) determination. Colon bacterial DNA was extracted and subjected to qPCR analysis with 16S rRNA probes.The low-grade, chronic neuroinflammation produced by LPS aggravated MPTP neurotoxicity, as evidenced by decreased motor activity, intensified microglia activation and loss of dopaminergic neurons. Both Hua-Feng-Dan and 70W increased rotarod activity and ameliorated the pathological lesions in the brain. In gut microbiomes examined, LPS plus MPTP increased Verrucomicrobiaceae, Methanobacteriaceae, Pronicromonosporaceae, and Clostridaceae species were attenuated by Hua-Feng-Dan and 70W.α-HgS-containing Hua-Feng-Dan and β-HgS-containing 70W at clinical doses protected against chronic LPS plus MPTP-induced toxicity to the brain and gut, suggesting HgS-containing traditional medicines could target gut microbiota as a mechanism of their therapeutic effects.",Journal of ethnopharmacology,2020,An-Ling Hu; Sheng Song; Yi Li; Shang-Fu Xu; Feng Zhang; Cen Li; Jie Liu
32871960,Fecal microbiota transplantation therapy for Parkinson's disease: A preliminary study.,"Imbalances in the gut microbiota mediate the progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is currently being explored as a potential therapy for PD. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of FMT on PD. Fifteen PD patients were included, 10 of them received FMT via colonoscopy (colonic FMT group) and 5 received FMT via nasal-jejunal tube (nasointestinal FMT group). The score of PSQI, HAMD, HAMA, PDQ-39, NMSQ and UPDRS-III significantly decreased after FMT treatment (all P < .05). Colonic FMT group showed significant improvement and longer maintenance of efficacy compared with nasointestinal FMT (P = .002). Two patients achieved self-satisfying outcomes that last for more than 24 months. However, nasointestinal FMT group had no significant therapeutic effect, although UPDRS-III score slightly reduced. There were no patients were satisfied with nasointestinal FMT for more than 3 months. Among 15 PD patients, there were 5 cases had adverse events (AEs), including diarrhea (2 cases), abdominal pain (2 cases) and flatulence (1 case). These AEs were mild and self-limiting. We conclude that FMT can relieve the motor and non-motor symptoms with acceptable safety in PD. Compared with nasointestinal FMT, colonic FMT seems better and preferable.",Medicine,2020,Liu-Jun Xue; Xiao-Zhong Yang; Qiang Tong; Peng Shen; Shi-Jie Ma; Shang-Nong Wu; Jin-Long Zheng; Hong-Gang Wang
33070123,A review on preventive role of ketogenic diet (KD) in CNS disorders from the gut microbiota perspective.,"The gut microbiota plays an important role in neurological diseases via the gut-brain axis. Many factors such as diet, antibiotic therapy, stress, metabolism, age, geography and genetics are known to play a critical role in regulating the colonization pattern of the microbiota. Recent studies have shown the role of the low carbohydrate, adequate protein, and high fat ""ketogenic diet"" in remodeling the composition of the gut microbiome and thereby facilitating protective effects in various central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Gut microbes are found to be involved in the pathogenesis of various CNS disorders like epilepsy, Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and stress, anxiety and depression. In vivo studies have shown an intricate link between gut microbes and KD and specific microbes/probiotics proved useful in in vivo CNS disease models. In the present review, we discuss the gut-brain bidirectional axis and the underlying mechanism of KD-based therapy targeting gut microbiome in in vivo animal models and clinical studies in neurological diseases. Also, we tried to infer how KD by altering the microbiota composition contributes towards the protective role in various CNS disorders. This review helps to uncover the mechanisms that are utilized by the KD and gut microbiota to modulate gut-brain axis functions and may provide novel opportunities to target therapies to the gut to treat neurologic disorders.",Reviews in the neurosciences,2021,Kajal Rawat; Neha Singh; Puja Kumari; Lekha Saha
33291597,Adiponectin Role in Neurodegenerative Diseases: Focus on Nutrition Review.,"Adiponectin is an adipokine produced by adipose tissue. It has numerous beneficial effects. In particular, it improves metabolic effects and glucose homeostasis, lipid profile, and is involved in the regulation of cytokine profile and immune cell production, having anti-inflammatory and immune-regulatory effects. Adiponectin's role is already known in immune diseases and also in neurodegenerative diseases. Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, are a set of diseases of the central nervous system, characterized by a chronic and selective process of neuron cell death, which occurs mainly in relation to oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Lifestyle is able to influence the development of these diseases. In particular, unhealthy nutrition on gut microbiota, influences its composition and predisposition to develop many diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases, given the importance of the ""gut-brain"" axis. There is a strong interplay between Adiponectin, gut microbiota, and brain-gut axis. For these reasons, a healthy diet composed of healthy nutrients such as probiotics, prebiotics, polyphenols, can prevent many metabolic and inflammatory diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases and obesity. The special Adiponectin role should be taken into account also, in order to be able to use this component as a therapeutic molecule.",International journal of molecular sciences,2020,Rita Polito; Irene Di Meo; Michelangela Barbieri; Aurora Daniele; Giuseppe Paolisso; Maria Rosaria Rizzo
31606537,Protective role of cinnabar and realgar in Hua-Feng-Dan against LPS plus rotenone-induced neurotoxicity and disturbance of gut microbiota in rats.,"Hua-Feng-Dan (HFD) is a traditional Chinese medicine used for neurological disorders. HFD contains cinnabar (HgS) and realgar (As<sub>4</sub>S<sub>4</sub>). The ethnopharmacological basis of cinnabar and realgar in HFD is not known.To address the role of cinnabar and realgar in HFD-produced neuroprotection against neurodegenerative diseases and disturbance of gut microbiota.Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plus rotenone (ROT)-elicited rat dopaminergic (DA) neuronal damage loss was performed as a Parkinson's disease animal model. Rats were given a single injection of LPS. Four months later, rats were challenged with the threshold dose of ROT. The clinical dose of HFD was administered via feed, starting from ROT administration for 46 days. Behavioral dysfunction was detected by rotarod and Y-maze tests. DA neuron loss and microglial activation were assessed via immunohistochemical staining and western bolt analysis. The colon content was collected to extract bacterial DNA followed by real-time PCR analysis with 16S rRNA primers.LPS plus ROT induced neurotoxicity, as evidenced by DA neuron loss in substantia nigra, impaired behavioral functions and increased microglial activation. HFD-original (containing 10% cinnabar and 10% realgar) rescued loss of DA neurons, improved behavioral dysfunction and attenuated microglial activation. Compared with HFD-original, HFD-reduced (3% cinnabar and 3% realgar) was also effective, but to be a less extent, while HFD-removed (without cinnabar and realgar) was ineffective. In analysis of gut microbiome, the increased Verrucomicrobiaceae and Lactobacteriaceae, and the decreased Enterobacteeriaceae by LPS plus ROT were ameliorated by HFD-original, and to be the less extent by HFD-reduced.Cinnabar and realgar are active ingredients in HFD to exert beneficial effects in a neurodegenerative model and gut microbiota.",Journal of ethnopharmacology,2020,Ce Chen; Bin-Bin Zhang; An-Ling Hu; Huan Li; Jie Liu; Feng Zhang
31790727,"Twice subacute MPTP administrations induced time-dependent dopaminergic neurodegeneration and inflammation in midbrain and ileum, as well as gut microbiota disorders in PD mice.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common progressive neurodegenerative disease. PD produces a pathological state in the intestine and disordered gut microbiota (GM), which may be important for the pathogenesis and progression of PD, but it is not clear. To explore the conditions and characteristics of intestinal pathology and GM disorders when PD-related injuries occur, we used twice 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) subacute administration with an interval of 3 weeks (each was an intraperitoneal injection of 25 mg/kg MPTP for 5 consecutive days). We observed the changes in intestinal and brain immune status, intestinal barrier function and GM in different injury states one day, one week, and three weeks after the first stimulus and one day and one week after the second stimulus. Our study found that two subacute administrations of MPTP induced dopaminergic (DAergic) neuron injury and inflammation in the midbrain and ileum, impaired intestinal barrier function and GM disorders closely related to administration. These changes recovered after the first administration, but after repeated administration, some indicators showed more dramatic changes than during the first administration. Our results suggest that the intestinal tract is sensitive to PD-related injury, and the GM is susceptible to disturbances caused by intestinal function, which may be concerned in local immune disorders of the intestine.",Neurotoxicology,2020,Wenjun Xie; Jieying Gao; Rong Jiang; Xinrong Liu; Feng Lai; Yong Tang; Hong Xiao; Yan Jia; Qunhua Bai
32946938,Genetic variants of TAS2R38 bitter taste receptor associate with distinct gut microbiota traits in Parkinson's disease: A pilot study.,"The non-tasting form of the bitter taste receptor, TAS2R38, has been shown as a genetic risk factor associated with the development of Parkinson's disease (PD). Specific taste receptors that are expressed in the lower gastrointestinal tract may respond to alteration in gut microbiota composition, detecting bacterial molecules, and regulate immune responses. Given the importance of brain-gut-microbiota axis and gene-environment interactions in PD, we investigate the associations between the genetic variants of TAS2R38 and gut microbiota composition in 39 PD patients. The results confirm that the majority of PD patients have reduced sensitivity to 6-n-propylthiouracil (PROP) and are carriers of at least one non-functional TAS2R38 AVI haplotype. Moreover, we found this correlation to be associated with a reduction in bacteria alpha-diversity with a predominant reduction of Clostridium genus. We hypothesised that the high frequency of the non-taster form of TAS2R38 associated with a diminuition of Clostridium bacteria in PD might determine a reduction in the activation of protective signalling-molecules useful in preserving gut homeostasis. This pilot study, by identifying a decrease in specific bacteria associated with a reduced sensitivity to PROP, adds essential information that opens new avenues of research into the association of PD microbiota composition and sensory modification.",International journal of biological macromolecules,2020,Sarah Vascellari; Melania Melis; Giovanni Cossu; Marta Melis; Alessandra Serra; Vanessa Palmas; Daniela Perra; Valentina Oppo; Michele Fiorini; Roberto Cusano; Micaela Morelli; Aldo Manzin; Iole Tomassini Barbarossa
32282304,"Healthy Gut, Healthy Brain: The Gut Microbiome in Neurodegenerative Disorders.","The central nervous system (CNS) known to regulate the physiological conditions of human body, also itself gets dynamically regulated by both the physiological as well as pathological conditions of the body. These conditions get changed quite often, and often involve changes introduced into the gut microbiota which, as studies are revealing, directly modulate the CNS via a crosstalk. This cross-talk between the gut microbiota and CNS, i.e., the gut-brain axis (GBA), plays a major role in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS) and Huntington's disease (HD).We aim to discuss how gut microbiota, through GBA, regulate neurodegenerative disorders such as PD, AD, ALS, MS and HD.In this review, we have discussed the present understanding of the role played by the gut microbiota in neurodegenerative disorders and emphasized the probable therapeutic approaches being explored to treat them.In the first part, we introduce the GBA and its relevance, followed by the changes occurring in the GBA during neurodegenerative disorders and then further discuss its role in the pathogenesis of these diseases. Finally, we discuss its applications in possible therapeutics of these diseases and the current research improvements being made to better investigate this interaction.We concluded that alterations in the intestinal microbiota modulate various activities that could potentially lead to CNS disorders through interactions via the GBA.",Current topics in medicinal chemistry,2020,Sreyashi Chandra; Md Tanjim Alam; Jhilik Dey; Baby C Pulikkaparambil Sasidharan; Upasana Ray; Amit K Srivastava; Sonu Gandhi; Prem P Tripathi
32089785,Oxidative Stress and Gut-Derived Lipopolysaccharides in Neurodegenerative Disease: Role of NOX2.,"Neurodegenerative diseases (ND) as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis represent a growing cause of disability in the developed countries. The underlying physiopathology is still unclear. Several lines of evidence suggest a role for oxidative stress and NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) in the neuropathological pathways that lead to ND. Furthermore, recent studies hypothesized a role for gut microbiota in the neuroinflammation; in particular, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) derived from Gram-negative bacteria in the gut is believed to play a role in causing ND by increase of oxidative stress and inflammation. The aim of this study was to assess NOX2 activity as well as serum 8-iso-prostaglandin F2<i>α</i> (8-iso-PGF2<i>α</i> (8-iso-PGF2.One hundred and twenty-eight consecutive subjects, including 64 ND patients and 64 controls (CT) matched for age and gender, were recruited.

31829756,An overview of the neuroendocrine system in Parkinson's disease: what is the impact on diagnosis and treatment?,"<b>Introduction</b>: A growing body of evidence indicates that neuroendocrine interactions may occur at all levels of the brain-gut-microbiota axis, which is directly involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD).<b>Areas covered</b>: The review presents some current and emerging concepts regarding the organization and functioning of the neuroendocrine system as well as the role of neuroendocrine disturbances in the pathophysiology and symptomatology of PD. The concept of the brain-gut-microbiota triad interactions in the neuroendocrine system and PD is proposed. In PD, dysregulation of the main neuroendocrine axes coordinated by the hypothalamus is accompanied by disruptions at the peripheral level, which involve enteroendocrine cells producing numerous neuropeptides. Moreover, the important role of the gut microbiota as a main coordinator of immune and neuroendocrine interactions is discussed. The potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications in the context of the recent developments in the fields of neuroendocrinology and neurodegeneration are also presented.<b>Expert opinion</b>: Unraveling complex neuroendocrine interactions in the course of PD may provide crucial diagnostic implications and novel therapeutic approaches including the application of gut neuropeptides and gut microbiota modification.",Expert review of neurotherapeutics,2020,Agata Mulak
32733199,Systems Biology Approaches to Understand the Host-Microbiome Interactions in Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) comprise a broad range of progressive neurological disorders with multifactorial etiology contributing to disease pathophysiology. Evidence of the microbiome involvement in the gut-brain axis urges the interest in understanding metabolic interactions between the microbiota and host physiology in NDDs. Systems Biology offers a holistic integrative approach to study the interplay between the different biologic systems as part of a whole, and may elucidate the host-microbiome interactions in NDDs. We reviewed direct and indirect pathways through which the microbiota can modulate the bidirectional communication of the gut-brain axis, and explored the evidence of microbial dysbiosis in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. As the gut microbiota being strongly affected by diet, the potential approaches to targeting the human microbiota through diet for the stimulation of neuroprotective microbial-metabolites secretion were described. We explored the potential of Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) to infer microbe-microbe and host-microbe interactions and to identify the microbiome contribution to disease development or prevention. Finally, a systemic approach based on GEMs and 'omics integration, that would allow the design of sustainable personalized anti-inflammatory diets in NDDs prevention, through the modulation of gut microbiota was described.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2020,Dorines Rosario; Jan Boren; Mathias Uhlen; Gordon Proctor; Dag Aarsland; Adil Mardinoglu; Saeed Shoaie
32088434,Gut microbiota dysbiosis might be responsible to different toxicity caused by Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate exposure in murine rodents.,"Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is widely used as a plasticizer, which can enter the body through a variety of ways and exerted multiple harmful effects, including liver toxicity, reproductive toxicity and even glucose metabolism disorder. Many studies have suggested that changes of gut microbiota are closely related to the occurrence of various diseases, but the effects of DEHP exposure on gut microbiota are still unclear. It was found in this study that the damage to different tissues by DEHP on two strains each from two different species of male rodents before puberty was dose and time of exposure dependent, and also depending on the strain and species of rodent. Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats showed highest sensitivity to DEHP exposure, with most severe organ damage, highest Th1 inflammatory response and most significant body weight gain. Correspondingly, the gut microbiota of SD rats showed most significant changes after DEHP exposure. Only SD rats, but not Wistar rats, BALB/c and C57BL/6J mice showed an increase in Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and Proteobacteria abundance in the fecal samples, which are known to associate with obesity and diabetes. This is consistent with the increasing body weight gain which was only found in SD rats. In addition, the decrease in the level of butyrate, increase in the abundance of potential pathogens and microbial genes linked to colorectal cancer, Parkinson's disease, and type 2 diabetes in the SD rats were associated with issue and functional damages and Th1 inflammatory response caused by DEHP exposure. We postulate that the differential effects of DEHP on gut microbiota may be an important cause of the differences in the toxicity on different strains and species of rodents to DEHP.","Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2020,Gang Wang; Qian Chen; Peijun Tian; Linlin Wang; Xiu Li; Yuan-Kun Lee; Jianxin Zhao; Hao Zhang; Wei Chen
32643435,Progression and survival of patients with motor neuron disease relative to their fecal microbiota.,"Gut microbiota studies have been well-investigated for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, however, fewer studies have comprehensively examined the gut microbiome in Motor Neuron Disease (MND), with none examining its impact on disease prognosis. Here, we investigate MND prognosis and the fecal microbiota, using 16S rRNA case-control data from 100 individuals with extensive medical histories and metabolic measurements. We contrast the composition and diversity of fecal microbiome signatures from 49 MND and 51 healthy controls by combining current gold-standard 16S microbiome pipelines. Using stringent quality control thresholds, we conducted qualitative assessment approaches including; direct comparison of taxa, PICRUSt2 predicted metagenomics, Shannon and Chao1-index and Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio. We show that the fecal microbiome of patients with MND is not significantly different from that of healthy controls that were matched by age, sex, and BMI, however there are distinct differences in Beta-diversity in some patients with MND. Weight, BMI, and metabolic and clinical features of disease in patients with MND were not related to the composition of their fecal microbiome, however, we observe a greater risk for earlier death in patients with MND with increased richness and diversity of the microbiome, and in those with greater Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio. This was independent of anthropometric, metabolic, or clinical features of disease, and warrants support for further gut microbiota studies in MND. Given the disease heterogeneity in MND, and complexity of the gut microbiota, large studies are necessary to determine the detailed role of the gut microbiota and MND prognosis.",Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis & frontotemporal degeneration,2020,Shyuan T Ngo; Restuadi Restuadi; Allan F McCrae; Ruben P Van Eijk; Fleur Garton; Robert D Henderson; Naomi R Wray; Pamela A McCombe; Frederik J Steyn
33154567,Using multi-organ culture systems to study Parkinson's disease.,"In recent years, it has been revealed that Parkinson's disease pathology may begin to manifest in the gastrointestinal track at a much earlier time point than in the brain. This paradigm shift has been suggested following evidence in humans that has been reproduced in animal models. Since rodent models cannot recapitulate many of the human disease features, human induced pluripotent stem cells derived from Parkinson's patients have been used to generate brain organoids, greatly contributing to our understanding of the disease pathophysiology. To understand the multifaced aspects of Parkinson's disease, it may be desirable to expand the complexity of these models, to include different brain regions, vasculature, immune cells as well as additional diverse organ-specific organoids such as gut and intestine. Furthermore, the contribution of gut microbiota to disease progression cannot be underestimated. Recent biotechnological advances propose that such combinations may be feasible. Here we discuss how this need can be met and propose that additional brain diseases can benefit from this approach.",Molecular psychiatry,2021,Orly Reiner; Tamar Sapir; Arpan Parichha

32252363,Revisiting the Role of Neurotrophic Factors in Inflammation.,"The neurotrophic factors are well known for their implication in the growth and the survival of the central, sensory, enteric and parasympathetic nervous systems. Due to these properties, neurturin (NRTN) and Glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), which belong to the GDNF family ligands (GFLs), have been assessed in clinical trials as a treatment for neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease. In addition, studies in favor of a functional role for GFLs outside the nervous system are accumulating. Thus, GFLs are present in several peripheral tissues, including digestive, respiratory, hematopoietic and urogenital systems, heart, blood, muscles and skin. More precisely, recent data have highlighted that different types of immune and epithelial cells (macrophages, T cells, such as, for example, mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, innate lymphoid cells (ILC) 3, dendritic cells, mast cells, monocytes, bronchial epithelial cells, keratinocytes) have the capacity to release GFLs and express their receptors, leading to the participation in the repair of epithelial barrier damage after inflammation. Some of these mechanisms pass on to ILCs to produce cytokines (such as IL-22) that can impact gut microbiota. In addition, there are indications that NRTN could be used in the treatment of inflammatory airway diseases and it prevents the development of hyperglycemia in the diabetic rat model. On the other hand, it is suspected that the dysregulation of GFLs produces oncogenic effects. This review proposes the discussion of the biological understanding and the potential new opportunities of the GFLs, in the perspective of developing new treatments within a broad range of human diseases.",Cells,2020,Lucas Morel; Olivia Domingues; Jacques Zimmer; Tatiana Michel

Since then, aSyn has been extensively studied in an attempt to unravel its roles in both physiology and pathology. Today, studying the mechanisms of aSyn toxicity remains in the limelight, leading to the identification of novel pathways involved in pathogenesis. In this chapter, we address the molecular mechanisms involved in synucleinopathies, from aSyn misfolding and aggregation to the various cellular effects and pathologies associated. In particular, we review our current understanding of the mechanisms involved in the spreading of aSyn between different cells, from the periphery to the brain, and back. Finally, we also review recent studies on the contribution of inflammation and the gut microbiota to pathology in synucleinopathies. Despite significant advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved, we still lack an integrated understanding of the pathways leading to neurodegeneration in PD and other synucleinopathies, compromising our ability to develop novel therapeutic strategies.",Progress in brain research,2020,Inês Caldeira Brás; Mary Xylaki; Tiago Fleming Outeiro

33064969,Characterization of the intestinal microbiota during <i>Citrobacter rodentium</i> infection in a mouse model of infection-triggered Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that has been shown to be influenced by the intestinal milieu. The gut microbiota is altered in PD patients, and murine studies have begun suggesting a causative role for the gut microbiota in progression of PD. We have previously shown that repeated infection with the intestinal murine pathogen <i>Citrobacter rodentium</i> resulted in the development of PD-like pathology in <i>Pink1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice compared to wild-type littermates. This addendum aims to expand this work by characterizing the gut microbiota during <i>C. rodentium</i> infection in our <i>Pink1</i><sup>-/-</sup> PD model. We observed little disturbance to the fecal microbiota diversity both between infection timepoints and between <i>Pink1</i><sup>-/-</sup> and wild-type control littermates.

33213462,Oral P. gingivalis impairs gut permeability and mediates immune responses associated with neurodegeneration in LRRK2 R1441G mice.,"The R1441G mutation in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene results in late-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). Peripheral inflammation and gut microbiota are closely associated with the pathogenesis of PD. Chronic periodontitis is a common type of peripheral inflammation, which is associated with PD. Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), the most common bacterium causing chronic periodontitis, can cause alteration of gut microbiota. It is not known whether Pg-induced dysbiosis plays a role in the pathophysiology of PD.In this study, live Pg were orally administrated to animals, three times a week for 1 month. Pg-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to stimulate mononuclear cells in vitro. The effects of oral Pg administration on the gut and brain were evaluated through behaviors, morphology, and cytokine expression.Dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra were reduced, and activated microglial cells were increased in R1441G mice given oral Pg. In addition, an increase in mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) as well as protein level of α-synuclein together with a decrease in zonula occludens-1 (Zo-1) was detected in the colon in Pg-treated R1441G mice. Furthermore, serum interleukin-17A (IL-17A) and brain IL-17 receptor A (IL-17RA) were increased in Pg-treated R1441G mice.These findings suggest that oral Pg-induced inflammation may play an important role in the pathophysiology of LRRK2-associated PD.",Journal of neuroinflammation,2020,Yu-Kun Feng; Qiong-Li Wu; Yan-Wen Peng; Feng-Yin Liang; Hua-Jing You; Yi-Wei Feng; Ge Li; Xue-Jiao Li; Shu-Hua Liu; Yong-Chao Li; Yu Zhang; Zhong Pei

Prespecified motor (International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society Unified PD Rating Scale [MDS-UPDRS], timed tests, and home-based wearable sensor measurements), nonmotor (Leeds Dyspepsia Questionnaire and Montreal Cognitive Assessment), and quality-of-life (Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39) outcome measures were assessed at weeks 6, 12, 24, and 52. The primary outcome was the baseline-to-week 12 change in ON medication MDS-UPDRS motor scores. Lactulose-hydrogen breath testing for concomitant small intestinal bacterial overgrowth was performed at baseline and repeated at week 24, together with the urea breath test.A total of 310 patients were screened for eligibility and 80 were randomly assigned, of whom 67 were included in the full-analysis set (32 treatment group patients, 35 placebo patients). HP eradication did not improve MDS-UPDRS motor scores at week 12 (mean difference 2.6 points in favor of placebo, 95% confidence interval: -0.4 to 5.6, P = 0.089). There was no significant improvement in any motor, nonmotor, or quality-of-life outcome at weeks 12 and 52. Both the full-analysis and per-protocol analyses (based on eradication status) supported these conclusions. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth status did not influence treatment results.HP eradication does not improve clinical outcomes in PD, suggesting that there is no justification for routine HP screening or eradication with the goal of improving PD symptoms. © 2020 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society,2020,Ai Huey Tan; Shen-Yang Lim; Sanjiv Mahadeva; Mun Fai Loke; Jiun Yan Tan; Ban Hong Ang; Kok Ping Chin; Amni Fatihah Mohammad Adnan; Shawna Mei Chien Ong; Aimi Izzah Ibrahim; Nusyaibah Zulkifli; Jing Kun Lee; Wan Ting Lim; Yong Teck Teo; Yong Leng Kok; Tze Ying Ng; Aaron Guan Siang Tan; Intan Maisara Zulkifle; Chin Khoon Ng; Soon Sean Ee; Shuhaina Arafin; Khairunnisa Mohamad Shukori; Jamunarani S Vadivelu; Connie Marras; Susan H Fox; Anthony E Lang
33166735,Dysbiosis is one of the risk factor for stroke and cognitive impairment and potential target for treatment.,"More than 50 million people have various forms of cognitive impairment basically caused by neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and cerebrovascular diseases as well as stroke. Often these conditions coexist and exacerbate one another. The damaged area in post-stroke dementia may lead to neurodegenerative lesions. Gut microbiome functions like an endocrine organ by generating bioactive metabolites that can directly or indirectly impact human physiology. An alteration in the composition and function of intestinal flora, i.e. gut dysbiosis, is implicated in neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases. Additionally, gut dysbiosis may accelerate the progression of cognitive impairment. Dysbiosis may result from obesity; metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disease, and sleep disorders, Lack of physical activity is associated with dysbiosis as well. These may coexist in various patterns in older people, enhancing the risk, incidence, and progression of cerebrovascular lesions, neurodegenerative disorders, and cognitive impairment, creating a vicious circle. Recently, it has been reported that several metabolites produced by gut microbiota (e.g., trimethylamine/trimethylamine N-oxide, short-chain fatty acids, secondary bile acids) may be linked to neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases. New treatment modalities, including prebiotic and probiotics, may normalize the gut microbiota composition, change the brain-gut barrier, and decrease the risk of the pathology development. Fecal microbiota transplantation, sometimes in combination with other methods, is used for remodeling and replenishing the symbiotic gut microbiome. This promising field of research is associated with basic findings of bidirectional communication between body organs and gut microbiota that creates new possibilities of pharmacological treatments of many clinical conditions. The authors present the role of gut microbiota in physiology, and the novel therapeutic targets in modulation of intestinal microbiota Personalized therapies based on their personal genome make up could offer benefits by modulating microbiota cross-talk with brain and cardiovascular system. A healthy lifestyle, including pre and probiotic nutrition is generally recommended. Prevention may also be enhanced by correcting gut dysbiosis resulting a reduced risk of post-stroke cognitive impairment including dementia.",Pharmacological research,2021,Magdalena Koszewicz; Joanna Jaroch; Anna Brzecka; Maria Ejma; Slawomir Budrewicz; Liudmila M Mikhaleva; Cristian Muresanu; Pamela Schield; Siva G Somasundaram; Cecil E Kirkland; Marco Avila-Rodriguez; Gjumrakch Aliev
33071933,Changes in Gastrointestinal Microbiome Composition in PD: A Pivotal Role of Covariates.,"Altered gut microbiota may trigger or accelerate alpha-synuclein aggregation in the enteric nervous system in Parkinson's disease (PD). While several previous studies observed gut microbiota alterations in PD, findings like diversity indices, and altered bacterial taxa itself show a considerable heterogeneity across studies. We recruited 179 participants, of whom 101 fulfilled stringent inclusion criteria. Subsequently, the composition of the gut microbiota in 71 PD patients and 30 healthy controls was analyzed, sequencing V3-V4 regions of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene in fecal samples. Our goal was (1) to evaluate whether gut microbiota are altered in a southern German PD cohort, (2) to delineate the influence of disease duration, stage, and motor impairment, and (3) to investigate the influence of PD associated covariates like constipation and coffee consumption. Aiming to control for a large variety of covariates, strict inclusion criteria were applied. Finally, propensity score matching was performed to correct for, and to delineate the effect of remaining covariates (non-motor symptom (NMS) burden, constipation, and coffee consumption) on microbiota composition. Prior to matching altered abundances of distinct bacterial classes, orders, families, and genera were observed. Both, disease duration, and stage influenced microbiome composition. Interestingly, levodopa equivalent dose influenced the correlation of taxa with disease duration, while motor impairment did not. Applying different statistical tests, and after propensity score matching to control for NMS burden, constipation and coffee consumption, <i>Faecalibacterium</i> and <i>Ruminococcus</i> were most consistently reduced in PD compared to controls. Taken together, similar to previous studies, alterations of several taxa were observed in PD. Yet, further controlling for PD associated covariates such as constipation and coffee consumption revealed a pivotal role of these covariates. Our data highlight the impact of these PD associated covariates on microbiota composition in PD. This suggests that altered microbiota may mediate the protective effect of i.e., coffee consumption and the negative effect of constipation in PD.",Frontiers in neurology,2020,Alexandra Cosma-Grigorov; Holger Meixner; Anne Mrochen; Stefan Wirtz; Jürgen Winkler; Franz Marxreiter
32154946,Plasma Short-Chain Fatty Acids in Patients With Parkinson's Disease.,"Short-chain fatty acids are exclusively produced by gut microbiota and are reduced in feces of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The objective of this study was to conduct a case-control study on peripheral concentration of short-chain fatty acids based on evidence of pathologic changes in the blood-brain barrier in PD and the possible role of short-chain fatty acids in blood-brain barrier permeability.The plasma short-chain fatty acid concentration was measured in 38 PD and 33 normal controls using gas chromatography. The clinical characteristics of patients with PD and controls were evaluated, and dietary information was obtained using a food frequency questionnaire. Short-chain fatty acid concentrations were further compared after adjusting for age, sex, and significant food frequency questionnaire items.The concentrations of acetate, propionate, and butyrate did not differ between patients with PD and controls in unadjusted comparison. Dietary intakes of fibers, carbohydrates, lipids (total and fatty acids), and proteins did not differ between groups. After correction of covariates, acetic acid concentration was higher in patients with PD than in controls (116.47 ± 16.83 vs 108.20 ± 18.37 μmol/L; P = 0.010). In correlation analyses, acetic acid concentration was positively correlated (R = 0.374, P = 0.021) with age, propionic acid concentration was negatively correlated with UPDRS part III score (R = -0.376, P = 0.020) and use of entacapone (R = -0.325, P = 0.047), and butyric acid concentration was correlated with monoamine oxidase inhibitor use (R = 0.382, P = 0.018) and anticholinergic use (R = -0.385, P = 0.024).Plasma short-chain fatty acids were paradoxically increased in PD and were associated with disease severity and antiparkinsonian medications. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the relationships of gut dysbiosis and inflammation with plasma short-chain fatty acids. © 2020 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society,2020,Chaewon Shin; Yunsook Lim; Hyewon Lim; Tae-Beom Ahn
32039674,Development of a Novel Oral Delivery Vehicle for Probiotics.,"There is a significant interest in effective oral drug delivery of therapeutic substances. For probiotics, there is a particular need for a delivery platform that protects the bacteria from destruction by the acidic stomach while enabling targeted delivery to the intestine where microbiota naturally reside. The use of probiotics and how they impact the gut microbiota is a growing field and holds promise for the treatment of a variety of gastrointestinal diseases, including irritable bowel disease Crohn's disease and C. diff and other diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's diseases.The aim of this research was to use our newly developed chemically-modified alginate hydrogel with the characteristic feature of stability in acidic environments but disintegration under neutral-basic pH conditions to design a novel system for effective targeted delivery of ingested probiotics.We have used the approach of encapsulation of bacterial cells in the hydrogel of the modified alginate with in vitro studies in both simulated stomach acid and intestinal fluid conditions to demonstrate the potential application of this novel platform in oral delivery of probiotics. Our data provide a proof-of-concept that enables further studies in vivo with this delivery platform.We have demonstrated in the present study that our chemically modified alginate hydrogel is resistant to acidic conditions and protects bacterial cells encapsulated in it, but it is sensitive to neutral-basic pH conditions under which it disintegrates and releases its viable bacteria cell payload.

We previously reported that the novel psychobiotic strain, Lactobacillus plantarum PS128 (PS128), ameliorated abnormal behaviors and modulated neurotransmissions in dopaminergic pathways in rodent models. Here, we report that orally administering PS128 for 4 weeks significantly alleviated the motor deficits, elevation in corticosterone, nigrostriatal dopaminergic neuronal death, and striatal dopamine reduction in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrathydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse models. PS128 ingestion suppressed glial cell hyperactivation and increased norepinephrine and neurotrophic factors in the striatum of the PD-model mice. PS128 administration also attenuated MPTP-induced oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in the nigrostriatal pathway. Fecal analysis showed that PS128 modulated the gut microbiota. L. plantarum abundance was significantly increased along with methionine biosynthesis-related microbial modules. PS128 also suppressed the increased family Enterobacteriaceae and lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan biosynthesis-related microbial modules caused by MPTP. In conclude, PS128 ingestion alleviated MPTP-induced motor deficits and neurotoxicity.PS128 supplementation inhibited neurodegenerative processes in PD-model mice and may help prevent PD.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2020,Jian-Fu Liao; Yun-Fang Cheng; Shu-Ting You; Wen-Chun Kuo; Chi-Wei Huang; Jen-Jie Chiou; Chih-Chieh Hsu; Hsiu-Mei Hsieh-Li; Sabrina Wang; Ying-Chieh Tsai
31836471,Sodium butyrate causes α-synuclein degradation by an Atg5-dependent and PI3K/Akt/mTOR-related autophagy pathway.,"Aggregation of α-Synuclein is central to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, these α-Synuclein inclusions are not only present in brain, but also in gut. Enteroendocrine cells (EECs), which are directly exposed to the gut lumen, can express α-Synuclein and directly connect to α-Synuclein-containing nerves. Dysbiosis of gut microbiota and microbial metabolite short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) has been implicated as a driver for PD. Butyrate is an SCFA produced by the gut microbiota. Our aim was to demonstrate how α-Synuclein expression in EECs responds to butyrate stimulation. Interestingly, we found that sodium butyrate (NaB) increases α-Synuclein mRNA expression, enhances Atg5-mediated autophagy (increased LC3B-II and decreased SQSTM1 (also known as p62) expression) in murine neuroendocrine STC-1 cells. Further, α-Synuclein mRNA was decreased by the inhibition of autophagy by using inhibitor bafilomycin A1 or by silencing Atg5 with siRNA. Moreover, the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway was significantly inhibited and cell apoptosis was activated by NaB. Conditioned media from NaB-stimulated STC-1 cells induced inflammation in SH-SY5Y cells. Collectively, NaB causes α-Synuclein degradation by an Atg5-dependent and PI3K/Akt/mTOR-related autophagy pathway.",Experimental cell research,2020,Chen-Meng Qiao; Meng-Fei Sun; Xue-Bing Jia; Yun Shi; Bo-Ping Zhang; Zhi-Lan Zhou; Li-Ping Zhao; Chun Cui; Yan-Qin Shen
34500451,Parkinson's Disease and Gut Microbiota.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is caused by abnormal aggregation of α-synuclein fibrils, called the Lewy bodies, in the central nervous system. Accumulating knowledge points to the notion that α-synuclein fibrils start from the dorsal vagal nucleus and ascend to the locus ceruleus and the substantia nigra (SN). Even in healthy elderly subjects without motor or cognitive impairment, α-synuclein fibrils are frequently observed in the brain and sometimes in the intestinal neural plexus. Enteroendocrine cells have a direct synapse to the vagal afferents, and the vagal nucleus has synaptic pathways to the SN and the striatum. Intestinal bacteria are likely to be involved in the formation of intestinal α-synuclein fibrils.A nonparametric meta-analysis of intestinal microbiota in PD in 5 countries, as well as scrutinization of the other reports from the other countries, indicates that mucin-degrading Akkermansia is increased in PD and that short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria are decreased in PD. Both dysbiosis should increase the intestinal permeability, which subsequently facilitates exposure of the intestinal neural plexus to toxins like lipopolysaccharide and pesticide, which should lead to abnormal aggregation of α-synuclein fibrils. Decreased SCFA also downregulates regulatory T cells and fails to suppress neuronal inflammation. Key Messages: Therapeutic intervention may be able to be established against these mechanisms. Additional biochemical, cellular, and animal studies are required to further dissect the direct association between intestinal microbiota and PD.",Annals of nutrition & metabolism,2021,Masaaki Hirayama; Kinji Ohno
34450312,The role of microbiota-gut-brain axis in neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders.,"Emerging evidence indicates that the gut microbiota play a crucial role in the bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain suggesting that the gut microbes may shape neural development, modulate neurotransmission and affect behavior, and thereby contribute to the pathogenesis and/or progression of many neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric, and neurological conditions. This review summarizes recent data on the role of microbiota-gut-brain axis in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders including depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, Parkinson's disease, migraine, and epilepsy. Also, the involvement of microbiota in gut disorders co-existing with neuropsychiatric conditions is highlighted. We discuss data from both in vivo preclinical experiments and clinical reports including: (1) studies in germ-free animals, (2) studies exploring the gut microbiota composition in animal models of diseases or in humans, (3) studies evaluating the effects of probiotic, prebiotic or antibiotic treatment as well as (4) the effects of fecal microbiota transplantation.",Pharmacological research,2021,Katarzyna Socała; Urszula Doboszewska; Aleksandra Szopa; Anna Serefko; Marcin Włodarczyk; Anna Zielińska; Ewa Poleszak; Jakub Fichna; Piotr Wlaź
34784980,Fecal microbiota transplantation protects rotenone-induced Parkinson's disease mice via suppressing inflammation mediated by the lipopolysaccharide-TLR4 signaling pathway through the microbiota-gut-brain axis.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, displaying not only well-known motor deficits but also gastrointestinal dysfunctions. Consistently, it has been increasingly evident that gut microbiota affects the communication between the gut and the brain in PD pathogenesis, known as the microbiota-gut-brain axis. As an approach to re-establishing a normal microbiota community, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has exerted beneficial effects on PD in recent studies. Here, in this study, we established a chronic rotenone-induced PD mouse model to evaluate the protective effects of FMT treatment on PD and to explore the underlying mechanisms, which also proves the involvement of gut microbiota dysbiosis in PD pathogenesis via the microbiota-gut-brain axis.We demonstrated that gut microbiota dysbiosis induced by rotenone administration caused gastrointestinal function impairment and poor behavioral performances in the PD mice. Moreover, 16S RNA sequencing identified the increase of bacterial genera Akkermansia and Desulfovibrio in fecal samples of rotenone-induced mice. By contrast, FMT treatment remarkably restored the gut microbial community, thus ameliorating the gastrointestinal dysfunctions and the motor deficits of the PD mice. Further experiments revealed that FMT administration alleviated intestinal inflammation and barrier destruction, thus reducing the levels of systemic inflammation. Subsequently, FMT treatment attenuated blood-brain barrier (BBB) impairment and suppressed neuroinflammation in the substantia nigra (SN), which further decreased the damage of dopaminergic neurons. Additional mechanistic investigation discovered that FMT treatment reduced lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels in the colon, the serum, and the SN, thereafter suppressing the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway and its downstream pro-inflammatory products both in the SN and the colon.Our current study demonstrates that FMT treatment can correct the gut microbiota dysbiosis and ameliorate the rotenone-induced PD mouse model, in which suppression of the inflammation mediated by the LPS-TLR4 signaling pathway both in the gut and the brain possibly plays a significant role. Further, we prove that rotenone-induced microbiota dysbiosis is involved in the genesis of PD via the microbiota-gut-brain axis.

Despite there is not a definitive description of the eubiotic microbiota architecture, numerous studies have demonstrated its involvement in human behaviour and its relationship with several pathologies. This is a systematic review about the association between dysbiosis on the gut microbiota and the presence of neurological or neuropsychiatric diseases such as cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, ADHD, and depression. Furthermore, this study analyzes the potential benefits of psychobiotics supplementation for these pathologies. Searches were conducted in the electronic databases PubMed and PsycINFO. 17 articles were included in this review, the majority were published after 2019. The results showed that gut dysbiosis predicts the development of these pathologies and influences their pathogenesis. In addition, it was found that different psychobiotics, mainly dietary fibers and probiotics of the Lactobacillus family, improved different cognitive functions such as cognitive performance and induce a reduced cortisol response. Improvement in different cognitive functions is possible when understanding gut microbiota-brain axis, enteric nervous system, neural-immune system, neuroendocrine system, and central nervous system's relationship.",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2022,Carmen Barrio; Samuel Arias-Sánchez; Isabel Martín-Monzón
33881598,"Gastrointestinal dysfunction in Parkinson's disease: molecular pathology and implications of gut microbiome, probiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation.","Gastrointestinal symptoms and gut dysbiosis may occur before the onset of motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). Prediagnostic and prodromal features, such as constipation and α-synuclein pathology, can be detected several years before the clinical diagnosis of PD and have the potential to develop as early PD biomarkers. Environmental toxins and gut dysbiosis may trigger oxidative stress and mucosal inflammation, and initiate α-synuclein accumulation in the enteric nervous system, early in PD. Chronic gut inflammation can lead to a leaky gut and systemic inflammation, neuro inflammation, and neuro degeneration via gut-vagus-brain signaling or through blood-brain barrier permeability. Concepts regarding the gut-brain signaling in PD pathogenesis are changing rapidly and more investigation is required. The gut microbiota interacts with the human body by modulating the enteric and central nervous systems, and immune activity. Understanding the immune responses between gut microbiota and human body might help in elucidating the PD pathogenesis. As changes in gut microbiota composition might be associated with different clinical phenotypes of PD, gut microbiota-modulating interventions, such as probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), have the potential to restore the gut dysbiosis, reduce inflammation, and possibly modulate the clinical PD phenotype.",Journal of neurology,2022,Vinod Metta; Valentina Leta; Kandadai Rukmini Mrudula; L K Prashanth; Vinay Goyal; Rupam Borgohain; Guy Chung-Faye; K Ray Chaudhuri

33557896,"Relationships of gut microbiota, short-chain fatty acids, inflammation, and the gut barrier in Parkinson's disease.","Previous studies have reported that gut microbiota, permeability, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and inflammation are altered in Parkinson's disease (PD), but how these factors are linked and how they contribute to disease processes and symptoms remains uncertain. This study sought to compare and identify associations among these factors in PD patients and controls to elucidate their interrelations and links to clinical manifestations of PD.Stool and plasma samples and clinical data were collected from 55 PD patients and 56 controls. Levels of stool SCFAs and stool and plasma inflammatory and permeability markers were compared between patients and controls and related to one another and to the gut microbiota.Calprotectin was increased and SCFAs decreased in stool in PD in a sex-dependent manner. Inflammatory markers in plasma and stool were neither intercorrelated nor strongly associated with SCFA levels. Age at PD onset was positively correlated with SCFAs and negatively correlated with CXCL8 and IL-1β in stool. Fecal zonulin correlated positively with fecal NGAL and negatively with PD motor and non-motor symptoms. Microbiota diversity and composition were linked to levels of SCFAs, inflammatory factors, and zonulin in stool. Certain relationships differed between patients and controls and by sex.Intestinal inflammatory responses and reductions in fecal SCFAs occur in PD, are related to the microbiota and to disease onset, and are not reflected in plasma inflammatory profiles. Some of these relationships are distinct in PD and are sex-dependent. This study revealed potential alterations in microbiota-host interactions and links between earlier PD onset and intestinal inflammatory responses and reduced SCFA levels, highlighting candidate molecules and pathways which may contribute to PD pathogenesis and clinical presentation and which warrant further investigation.",Molecular neurodegeneration,2021,Velma T E Aho; Madelyn C Houser; Pedro A B Pereira; Jianjun Chang; Knut Rudi; Lars Paulin; Vicki Hertzberg; Petri Auvinen; Malú G Tansey; Filip Scheperjans

The development of sequencing technology has evidenced the key regulatory role of the gut microbiota in several neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Epilepsy is a complex disease with multiple risk factors that affect more than 50 million people worldwide; nearly 30% of patients with epilepsy cannot be controlled with drugs. Interestingly, patients with inflammatory bowel disease are more susceptible to epilepsy, and a ketogenic diet is an effective treatment for patients with intractable epilepsy. Based on these clinical facts, the role of the microbiome and the gut-brain axis in epilepsy cannot be ignored. In this review, we discuss the relationship between the gut microbiota and epilepsy, summarize the possible pathogenic mechanisms of epilepsy from the perspective of the microbiota gut-brain axis, and discuss novel therapies targeting the gut microbiota. A better understanding of the role of the microbiota in the gut-brain axis, especially the intestinal one, would help investigate the mechanism, diagnosis, prognosis evaluation, and treatment of intractable epilepsy.",Frontiers in immunology,2021,Manqiu Ding; Yue Lang; Hang Shu; Jie Shao; Li Cui

The gut microbiota of patients with Parkinson's disease shows unique changes, which may be used as early biomarkers of disease. Alterations in the gut microbiota composition may be related to the cause or effect of motor or non-motor symptoms, but the specific pathogenic mechanisms are unclear. The gut microbiota and its metabolites have been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease by regulating neuroinflammation, barrier function and neurotransmitter activity.

33623004,Oral berberine improves brain dopa/dopamine levels to ameliorate Parkinson's disease by regulating gut microbiota.,"The phenylalanine-tyrosine-dopa-dopamine pathway provides dopamine to the brain. In this process, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is the rate-limiting enzyme that hydroxylates tyrosine and generates levodopa (L-dopa) with tetrahydrobiopterin (BH<sub>4</sub>) as a coenzyme. Here, we show that oral berberine (BBR) might supply H<sup>•</sup> through dihydroberberine (reduced BBR produced by bacterial nitroreductase) and promote the production of BH<sub>4</sub> from dihydrobiopterin; the increased BH<sub>4</sub> enhances TH activity, which accelerates the production of L-dopa by the gut bacteria. Oral BBR acts in a way similar to vitamins. The L-dopa produced by the intestinal bacteria enters the brain through the circulation and is transformed to dopamine. To verify the gut-brain dialog activated by BBR's effect, Enterococcus faecalis or Enterococcus faecium was transplanted into Parkinson's disease (PD) mice. The bacteria significantly increased brain dopamine and ameliorated PD manifestation in mice; additionally, combination of BBR with bacteria showed better therapeutic effect than that with bacteria alone. Moreover, 2,4,6-trimethyl-pyranylium tetrafluoroborate (TMP-TFB)-derivatized matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) imaging of dopamine identified elevated striatal dopamine levels in mouse brains with oral Enterococcus, and BBR strengthened the imaging intensity of brain dopamine. These results demonstrated that BBR was an agonist of TH in Enterococcus and could lead to the production of L-dopa in the gut. Furthermore, a study of 28 patients with hyperlipidemia confirmed that oral BBR increased blood/fecal L-dopa by the intestinal bacteria. Hence, BBR might improve the brain function by upregulating the biosynthesis of L-dopa in the gut microbiota through a vitamin-like effect.",Signal transduction and targeted therapy,2021,Yan Wang; Qian Tong; Shu-Rong Ma; Zhen-Xiong Zhao; Li-Bin Pan; Lin Cong; Pei Han; Ran Peng; Hang Yu; Yuan Lin; Tian-Le Gao; Jia-Wen Shou; Xiao-Yang Li; Xian-Feng Zhang; Zheng-Wei Zhang; Jie Fu; Bao-Ying Wen; Jin-Bo Yu; Xuetao Cao; Jian-Dong Jiang
34695538,"Oral, Nasal, and Gut Microbiota in Parkinson's Disease.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most frequently diagnosed neurodegenerative disease.

Sequencing was undertaken of the V4-V5 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene of the microbiome from the oral cavity, nasal cavity, and gut of 91 PD patients and 91 healthy controls. Significant differences were found in microbiota composition in the oral cavity and gut, but not the nasal cavity, between PD patients and healthy controls after adjusting for age, gender, and body mass index (BMI). More genera in the oral cavity were significantly positively correlated with clinical characteristics, such as the HAMA and HAMD rating scales. The taxa c_Clostridia, o_Clostridiales, and f_Ruminococcaceae in the gut microbiota were associated with weight and MMSE score. Furthermore, as a result of dysbiosis, there was an enrichment of ion channel-, oxidative phosphorylation-, and carbohydrate metabolism-related pathways in the oral cavity and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis- and propanoate metabolism-related pathways in the intestine. Changes in these pathways can influence metabolism and inflammation, thereby contributing to PD pathogenesis. In addition, several subnetworks containing differentially abundant microbiota in the oral cavity and gut samples from PD patients may regulate microbial composition and function in PD. Overall, our results indicate that oral and gut dysbiosis may affect PD progression and provide a basis for understanding the pathogenesis of PD and identifying potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of this disease.",Neuroscience,2022,Zhuo Li; Gang Lu; Enli Luo; Bin Wu; Zhe Li; Jianwen Guo; Zhangyong Xia; Chunye Zheng; Qiaozhen Su; Yan Zeng; Wai Yee Chan; Xianwei Su; Xinmin Qiu; Xirun Zheng; Qiaodi Cai; Yanjuan Xu; Yingjun Chen; Yuzhen Fan; Weiwei Chen; Zecheng Yu; Xinjie Chen; Chunying Zheng; Mingbang Wang; Wai Sang Poon; Xiaodong Luo
34492236,Probiotics: Potential novel therapeutics for microbiota-gut-brain axis dysfunction across gender and lifespan.,"Probiotics are live microorganisms, which when administered in adequate amounts, present a health benefit for the host. While the beneficial effects of probiotics on gastrointestinal function are generally well recognized, new animal research and clinical studies have found that alterations in gut microbial communities can have a broad range of effects throughout the body. Non-intestinal sites impacted include the immune, endocrine, cardiovascular and the central nervous system (CNS). In particular, there has been a growing interest and appreciation about the role that gut microbiota may play in affecting CNS-related function through the 'microbiota-gut-brain axis'. Emerging evidence suggests potential therapeutic benefits of probiotics in several CNS conditions, such as anxiety, depression, autism spectrum disorders and Parkinson's disease. There may also be some gender-specific variances in terms of probiotic mediated effects, with the gut microbiota shaping and being concurrently molded by the hormonal environment governing differences between the sexes. Probiotics may influence the ability of the gut microbiome to affect a variety of biological processes in the host, including neurotransmitter activity, vagal neurotransmission, generation of neuroactive metabolites and inflammatory response mediators. Some of these may engage in cross talk with host sex hormones, such as estrogens, which could be of relevance in relation to their effects on stress response and cognitive health. This raises the possibility of gender-specific variation with regards to the biological action of probiotics, including that on the endocrine and central nervous systems. In this review we aim to describe the current understanding in relation to the role and use of probiotics in microbiota-gut-brain axis-related dysfunction. Furthermore, we will address the conceptualization and classification of probiotics in the context of gender and lifespan as well as how restoring gut microbiota composition by clinical or dietary intervention can help in supporting health outcomes other than those related to the gastrointestinal tract. We also evaluate how these new learnings may impact industrial effort in probiotic research and the discovery and development of novel and more personalized, condition-specific, beneficial probiotic therapeutic agents.",Pharmacology & therapeutics,2022,Shikha Snigdha; Kevin Ha; Paul Tsai; Timothy G Dinan; Jeremy D Bartos; Mohammed Shahid
33649989,The Gut-Brain Axis: Two Ways Signaling in Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic, progressive and second most prevalent neurological disorder affecting the motor system. Cardinal motor impairment and α-synucleinopathy are the characteristic features of PD. Recently, it has been identified that the gut-brain axis is substantially regulated by the gut microbiome (GM) through an immunological, neuroendocrine, and neural mechanism. However, disturbance in the gut-microbiome-brain axis in PD might proceed to gastrointestinal manifestations intermittently leading to the motor system and the PD pathogenesis itself. The gut microbial toxins may induce the production of α-synuclein (α-syn) aggregates in the enteric nervous system (ENS), which may proliferate and propagate in a prion-like-manner through the vagus nerve to the central nervous system (CNS); supporting the hypothesis that, GM might play a pivotal role in PD pathogenesis. Overstimulated innate immune system due to intestinal bacterial overgrowth or gut dysbiosis and the enhanced intestinal permeability may persuade systemic inflammation, while the activation of enteric glial cells and enteric neurons may contribute to α-synucleinopathy. Gut microbiota can bear a significant impact on neurological outcomes such as learning, memory and cognition. In this review paper, we summarize how the alterations in gut microbiota and ENS inflammation are associated with PD pathogenesis. The evidence supporting the causative role played by gut-associated dysbiosis and microbial byproducts, in the onset of PD is also discussed.

33417973,Unravelling the role of gut microbiota in Parkinson's disease progression: Pathogenic and therapeutic implications.,"In recent years, researchers have shown interest in bi-directional interaction between the brain and gut, called ""gut-brain axis"". Emerging pieces of evidence indicate that disturbances in this axis is found to be associated with the Parkinson's disease (PD). Several clinical investigations revealed the crucial role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of PD. It has been suggested that aggregation of misfolded protein α-syn, the neuropathological hallmark of PD, might begin in gut and propagates to the CNS via vagus nerve and olfactory bulb. Emerging evidences also suggest that initiation and progression of PD may be due to inflammation originating from gut. It has been shown that microbial gut dysbiosis causes the production of various pathogenic microbial metabolites which elevates pro-inflammatory environment in the gut that promotes neuroinflammation in the CNS. These observations raise the intriguing question - how gut microbial dysbiosis could contribute to PD progression. In this context, various microbiota-targeted therapies are under consideration that can re-establish the intestinal homeostasis which may have greater promise in the prevention and treatment of PD. This review focuses on the role of the gut microbiota in the initiation, progression of PD and current therapeutic intervention to deplete the severity of the disease.",Neuroscience research,2021,Linchi Rani; Amal Chandra Mondal
34530073,Alterations of gut microbiota and metabolome with Parkinson's disease.,"Gut microbiota and amino acids that are one of their metabolites play important roles in the mechanism of pathology of Parkinson's disease (PD). It has been reported that the level of amino acids in vivo participate in neurodegeneration by regulating adaptive immune response, while the current researches on alteration of amino acids in gut microbiota are still insufficient. We hypothesized that alterations in gut microbiota might be accompanied by altered concentrations of amino acids, leading to the occurrence of PD. In this study, we collected stool samples from PD and healthy controls to analyse fecal microbiome and targeted metabolome by 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene sequencing and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). At the genus level, there was a greater abundance of Alistipes, Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group, Bifidobacterium, Parabacteroides, while Faecalibacterium was decreased in fecal samples from PD patients. Moreover, fecal branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) and aromatic amino acids concentrations were significantly reduced in PD patients compared to controls. Our study not only finds the abundance of certain gut microbiota in PD,but also reveals that it is related to BCAAs and aromatic amino acids. These findings are beneficial to identifying new therapeutic targets for PD by regulating diet and/or gut microbiota.",Microbial pathogenesis,2021,Zhenzhen Yan; Fan Yang; Jingwei Cao; Wencai Ding; Shi Yan; Wanying Shi; Shirong Wen; Lifen Yao
33643026,"The Association Between the Gut Microbiota and Parkinson's Disease, a Meta-Analysis.","Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) were often observed with gastrointestinal symptoms, which preceded the onset of motor symptoms. Neuropathology of PD has also been found in the enteric nervous system (ENS). Many studies have reported significant PD-related alterations of gut microbiota. This meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the differences of gut microbiota between patients with PD and healthy controls (HCs) across different geographical regions. We conducted a systematic online search for case-control studies detecting gut microbiota in patients with PD and HCs. Mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to access alterations in the abundance of certain microbiota families in PD. Fifteen case-control studies were included in this meta-analysis study. Our results showed significant lower abundance levels of <i>Prevotellaceae</i> (MD = -0.37, 95% CI = -0.62 to -0.11), <i>Faecalibacterium</i> (MD = -0.41, 95% CI: -0.57 to -0.24), and <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> (MD = -0.34, 95% CI = -0.59 to -0.09) in patients with PD compared to HCs. Significant higher abundance level of <i>Bifidobacteriaceae</i> (MD = 0.38, 95%; CI = 0.12 to 0.63), <i>Ruminococcaceae</i> (MD = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.07 to 1.10), <i>Verrucomicrobiaceae</i> (MD = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.21 to 0.69), and <i>Christensenellaceae</i> (MD = 0.20, 95% CI = 0.07 to 0.34) was also found in patients with PD. Thus, shared alterations of certain gut microbiota were detected in patients with PD across different geographical regions. These PD-related gut microbiota dysbiosis might lead to the impairment of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) producing process, lipid metabolism, immunoregulatory function, and intestinal permeability, which contribute to the pathogenesis of PD.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2021,Ting Shen; Yumei Yue; Tingting He; Cong Huang; Boyi Qu; Wen Lv; Hsin-Yi Lai
34536490,"Gut dysbiosis, defective autophagy and altered immune responses in neurodegenerative diseases: Tales of a vicious cycle.","The human microbiota comprises trillions of symbiotic microorganisms and is involved in regulating gastrointestinal (GI), immune, nervous system and metabolic homeostasis. Recent observations suggest a bidirectional communication between the gut microbiota and the brain via immune, circulatory and neural pathways, termed the Gut-Brain Axis (GBA). Alterations in gut microbiota composition, such as seen with an increased number of pathobionts and a decreased number of symbionts, termed gut dysbiosis or microbial intestinal dysbiosis, plays a prominent role in the pathogenesis of central nervous system (CNS)-related disorders. Clinical reports confirm that GI symptoms often precede neurological symptoms several years before the development of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). Pathologically, gut dysbiosis disrupts the integrity of the intestinal barrier leading to ingress of pathobionts and toxic metabolites into the systemic circulation causing GBA dysregulation. Subsequently, chronic neuroinflammation via dysregulated immune activation triggers the accumulation of neurotoxic misfolded proteins in and around CNS cells resulting in neuronal death. Emerging evidence links gut dysbiosis to the aggravation and/or spread of proteinopathies from the peripheral nervous system to the CNS and defective autophagy-mediated proteinopathies. This review summarizes the current understanding of the role of gut microbiota in NDDs, and highlights a vicious cycle of gut dysbiosis, immune-mediated chronic neuroinflammation, impaired autophagy and proteinopathies, which contributes to the development of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. We also discuss novel therapeutic strategies targeting the modulation of gut dysbiosis through prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics or dietary interventions, and faecal microbial transplantation (FMT) in the management of NDDs.",Pharmacology & therapeutics,2022,Saravana Babu Chidambaram; Musthafa Mohamed Essa; A G Rathipriya; Muhammed Bishir; Bipul Ray; Arehally M Mahalakshmi; A H Tousif; Meena K Sakharkar; Rajpal Singh Kashyap; Robert P Friedland; Tanya M Monaghan
34112355,Zinc.,"Since the discovery of manifest Zn deficiency in 1961, the increasing number of studies demonstrated the association between altered Zn status and multiple diseases. In this chapter, we provide a review of the most recent advances on the role of Zn in health and disease (2010-20), with a special focus on the role of Zn in neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders, diabetes and obesity, male and female reproduction, as well as COVID-19. In parallel with the revealed tight association between ASD risk and severity and Zn status, the particular mechanisms linking Zn<sup>2+</sup> and ASD pathogenesis like modulation of synaptic plasticity through ProSAP/Shank scaffold, neurotransmitter metabolism, and gut microbiota, have been elucidated. The increasing body of data indicate the potential involvement of Zn<sup>2+</sup> metabolism in neurodegeneration. Systemic Zn levels in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease were found to be reduced, whereas its sequestration in brain may result in modulation of amyloid β and α-synuclein processing with subsequent toxic effects. Zn<sup>2+</sup> was shown to possess adipotropic effects through the role of zinc transporters, zinc finger proteins, and Zn-α2-glycoprotein in adipose tissue physiology, underlying its particular role in pathogenesis of obesity and diabetes mellitus type 2. Recent findings also contribute to further understanding of the role of Zn2+ in spermatogenesis and sperm functioning, as well as oocyte development and fertilization. Finally, Zn<sup>2+</sup> was shown to be the potential adjuvant therapy in management of novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19), underlining the perspectives of zinc in management of old and new threats.",Advances in food and nutrition research,2021,Anatoly V Skalny; Michael Aschner; Alexey A Tinkov
34589401,Novel compound FLZ alleviates rotenone-induced PD mouse model by suppressing TLR4/MyD88/NF-<i>κ</i>B pathway through microbiota-gut-brain axis.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, but none of the current treatments for PD can halt the progress of the disease due to the limited understanding of the pathogenesis. In PD development, the communication between the brain and the gastrointestinal system influenced by gut microbiota is known as microbiota-gut-brain axis. However, the explicit mechanisms of microbiota dysbiosis in PD development have not been well elucidated yet. FLZ, a novel squamosamide derivative, has been proved to be effective in many PD models and is undergoing the phase I clinical trial to treat PD in China. Moreover, our previous pharmacokinetic study revealed that gut microbiota could regulate the absorption of FLZ <i>in vivo</i>. The aims of our study were to assess the protective effects of FLZ treatment on PD and to further explore the underlying microbiota-related mechanisms of PD by using FLZ as a tool. In the current study, chronic oral administration of rotenone was utilized to induce a mouse model to mimic the pathological process of PD. Here we revealed that FLZ treatment alleviated gastrointestinal dysfunctions, motor symptoms, and dopaminergic neuron death in rotenone-challenged mice. 16S rRNA sequencing found that PD-related microbiota alterations induced by rotenone were reversed by FLZ treatment. Remarkably, FLZ administration attenuated intestinal inflammation and gut barrier destruction, which subsequently inhibited systemic inflammation. Eventually, FLZ treatment restored blood-brain barrier structure and suppressed neuroinflammation by inhibiting the activation of astrocytes and microglia in the substantia nigra (SN). Further mechanistic research demonstrated that FLZ treatment suppressed the TLR4/MyD88/NF-<i>κ</i>B pathway both in the SN and colon. Collectively, FLZ treatment ameliorates microbiota dysbiosis to protect the PD model <i>via</i> inhibiting TLR4 pathway, which contributes to one of the underlying mechanisms beneath its neuroprotective effects. Our research also supports the importance of microbiota-gut-brain axis in PD pathogenesis, suggesting its potential role as a novel therapeutic target for PD treatment.",Acta pharmaceutica Sinica.

34669122,"An Alternative Explanation for Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease Initiation from Specific Antibiotics, Gut Microbiota Dysbiosis and Neurotoxins.","The late onset neuropathologies, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, have become increasingly prevalent. Their causation has been linked to genetics, gut microbiota dysbiosis (gut dysbiosis), autoimmune diseases, pathogens and exposures to neurotoxins. An alternative explanatory hypothesis is provided for their pathogenesis. Virtually everyone has pervasive daily exposures to neurotoxins, through inhalation, skin contact, direct blood transmission and through the gastrointestinal tract by ingestion. As a result, every individual has substantial and fluctuating neurotoxin blood levels. Two major barriers to neurotoxin entry into the central nervous system are the blood-brain barrier and the intestinal wall, in the absence of gut dysbiosis. Inflammation from gut dysbiosis, induced by antibiotic usage, can increase the intestinal wall permeability for neurotoxins to reach the bloodstream, and also increase the blood-brain barrier permeability to neurotoxins. Gut dysbiosis, including gut dysbiosis caused by antibiotic treatments, is an especially high risk for neurotoxin entry into the brain to cause late onset neuropathologies. Gut dysbiosis has far-reaching immune system and central nervous system effects, and even a transient gut dysbiosis can act in combination with neurotoxins, such as aluminum, mercury, lead, arsenic, cadmium, selenium, manganese, organophosphate pesticides and organochlorines, to reach neurotoxin blood levels that can initiate a late onset neuropathology, depending on an individual's age and genetic vulnerability.",Neurochemical research,2022,Kevin Roe
34475403,Gut microbiota and metabolites of α-synuclein transgenic monkey models with early stage of Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease. However, it is unclear whether microbiota and metabolites have demonstrated changes at early PD due to the difficulties in diagnosis and identification of early PD in clinical practice. In a previous study, we generated A53T transgenic monkeys with early Parkinson's symptoms, including anxiety and cognitive impairment. Here we analyzed the gut microbiota by metagenomic sequencing and metabolites by targeted gas chromatography. The gut microbiota analysis showed that the A53T monkeys have higher degree of diversity in gut microbiota with significantly elevated Sybergistetes, Akkermansia, and Eggerthella lenta compared with control monkeys. Prevotella significantly decreased in A53T transgenic monkeys. Glyceric acid, L-Aspartic acid, and p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid were significantly elevated, whereas Myristic acid and 3-Methylindole were significantly decreased in A53T monkeys. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (KO0131) and the oxidative phosphorylation reaction (KO2147) were significantly increased in metabolic pathways of A53T monkeys. Our study suggested that the transgenic A53T and α-syn aggregation may affect the intestine microbiota and metabolites of rhesus monkeys, and the identified five compositional different metabolites that are mainly associated with mitochondrial dysfunction may be related to the pathogenesis of PD.",NPJ biofilms and microbiomes,2021,Yaping Yan; Shuchao Ren; Yanchao Duan; Chenyu Lu; Yuyu Niu; Zhengbo Wang; Briauna Inglis; Weizhi Ji; Yun Zheng; Wei Si
31684843,Effect of nutrition on neurodegenerative diseases. A systematic review.,"Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the progressive functional loss of neurons in the brain, causing cognitive impairment and motoneuron disability. Although multifactorial interactions are evident, nutrition plays an essential role in the pathogenesis and evolution of these diseases. A systematic literature search was performed, and the prevalence of studies evaluated the effect of the Mediterranean diet (MeDiet), nutritional support, EPA and DHA, and vitamins on memory and cognition impairment. The data showed that malnutrition and low body mass index (BMI) is correlated with the higher development of dementia and mortality. MeDiet, nutritional support, and calorie-controlled diets play a protective effect against cognitive decline, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson disease (PD) while malnutrition and insulin resistance represent significant risk factors. Malnutrition activates also the gut-microbiota-brain axis dysfunction that exacerbate neurogenerative process. Omega-3 and -6, and the vitamins supplementation seem to be less effective in protecting neuron degeneration. Insulin activity is a prevalent factor contributing to brain health while malnutrition correlated with the higher development of dementia and mortality.",Nutritional neuroscience,2021,Vittorio Emanuele Bianchi; Pomares Fredy Herrera; Rizzi Laura
34243604,Role of microbiota-derived short-chain fatty acids in nervous system disorders.,"During the past decade, accumulating evidence from the research highlights the suggested effects of bacterial communities of the human gut microbiota and their metabolites on health and disease. In this regard, microbiota-derived metabolites and their receptors, beyond the immune system, maintain metabolism homeostasis, which is essential to maintain the host's health by balancing the utilization and intake of nutrients. It has been shown that gut bacterial dysbiosis can cause pathology and altered bacterial metabolites' formation, resulting in dysregulation of the immune system and metabolism. The short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as butyrate, acetate, and succinate, are produced due to the fermentation process of bacteria in the gut. It has been noted remodeling in the gut microbiota metabolites associated with the pathophysiology of several neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, stress, anxiety, depression, autism, vascular dementia, schizophrenia, stroke, and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders, among others.

34371014,The link between the gut microbiota and Parkinson's Disease: A systematic mechanism review with focus on α-synuclein transport.,"Research has suggested a link between the gut microbiota and Parkinson's Disease (PD), and an early involvement of gastrointestinal dysfunction has been reported in patients. A mechanism review was performed to investigate whether the neurodegenerative cascade begins in the gut; mediated by gut dysbiosis and retrograde transport of α-synuclein. This review provides a summary of microbiome composition associated with PD, and evaluates pathophysiological mechanisms from animal and in vitro models of PD.A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed; 82 of 299 papers met the inclusion criteria.All twenty-two human case-control studies demonstrated an altered gut microbiota in PD compared to healthy controls, with results suggesting a proinflammatory phenotype present in PD. A germ-free animal study has demonstrated that gut microbiota are required for microglia activation, α-synuclein pathology and motor deficits. Accumulation of phosphorylated α-synuclein has been observed in the enteric nervous system prior to the onset of motor symptoms in animal models of PD, and there is data to support retrograde transport of α-synuclein from the gut to the brain. Different animal models of PD have demonstrated neuroinflammation, microglial activation and loss of dopaminergic neurons in the brain.Evidence from this review supports the hypothesis that pathology spreads from the gut to the brain. Future animal studies using oral LPS or microbiota transplants from human PD cases could provide further insight into the entire mechanism. Prospective longitudinal microbiome studies and novel modelling approaches could help to identify functional dysbiosis and early biomarkers for PD.",Brain research,2021,Sophie D Nielsen; Nicola M Pearson; Karin Seidler
34948234,Human Gut Microbiota in Health and Selected Cancers.,"The majority of the epithelial surfaces of our body, and the digestive tract, respiratory and urogenital systems, are colonized by a vast number of bacteria, archaea, fungi, protozoans, and viruses. These <i>microbiota</i>, particularly those of the intestines, play an important, beneficial role in digestion, metabolism, and the synthesis of vitamins. Their metabolites stimulate cytokine production by the human host, which are used against potential pathogens. The composition of the microbiota is influenced by several internal and external factors, including diet, age, disease, and lifestyle. Such changes, called dysbiosis, may be involved in the development of various conditions, such as metabolic diseases, including metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, Hashimoto's thyroidis and Graves' disease; they can also play a role in nervous system disturbances, such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and depression. An association has also been found between gut microbiota dysbiosis and cancer. Our health is closely associated with the state of our microbiota, and their homeostasis. The aim of this review is to describe the associations between human gut microbiota and cancer, and examine the potential role of gut microbiota in anticancer therapy.",International journal of molecular sciences,2021,Aleksandra Sędzikowska; Leszek Szablewski
33499229,Clinical Phenotypes of Parkinson's Disease Associate with Distinct Gut Microbiota and Metabolome Enterotypes.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a clinically heterogenic disorder characterized by distinct clinical entities. Most studies on motor deficits dichotomize PD into tremor dominant (TD) or non-tremor dominant (non-TD) with akinetic-rigid features (AR). Different pathophysiological mechanisms may affect the onset of motor manifestations. Recent studies have suggested that gut microbes may be involved in PD pathogenesis. The aim of this study was to investigate the gut microbiota and metabolome composition in PD patients in relation to TD and non-TD phenotypes. In order to address this issue, gut microbiota and the metabolome structure of PD patients were determined from faecal samples using 16S next generation sequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry approaches. The results showed a reduction in the relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae, <i>Blautia</i>, <i>Coprococcus</i>, <i>Lachnospira</i>, and an increase in Enterobacteriaceae, <i>Escherichia</i> and <i>Serratia</i> linked to non-TD subtypes. Moreover, the levels of important molecules (i.e., nicotinic acid, cadaverine, glucuronic acid) were altered in relation to the severity of phenotype. We hypothesize that the microbiota/metabolome enterotypes associated to non-TD subtypes may favor the development of gut inflammatory environment and gastrointestinal dysfunctions and therefore a more severe α-synucleinopathy. This study adds important information to PD pathogenesis and emphasizes the potential pathophysiological link between gut microbiota/metabolites and PD motor subtypes.",Biomolecules,2021,Sarah Vascellari; Marta Melis; Vanessa Palmas; Silvia Pisanu; Alessandra Serra; Daniela Perra; Maria Laura Santoru; Valentina Oppo; Roberto Cusano; Paolo Uva; Luigi Atzori; Micaela Morelli; Giovanni Cossu; Aldo Manzin
34835406,Gut Microbiota Regulation and Their Implication in the Development of Neurodegenerative Disease.,"In recent years, human gut microbiota have become one of the most promising areas of microorganism research; meanwhile, the inter-relation between the gut microbiota and various human diseases is a primary focus. As is demonstrated by the accumulating evidence, the gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system interact through the gut-brain axis, which includes neuronal, immune-mediated and metabolite-mediated pathways. Additionally, recent progress from both preclinical and clinical studies indicated that gut microbiota play a pivotal role in gut-brain interactions, whereas the imbalance of the gut microbiota composition may be associated with the pathogenesis of neurological diseases (particularly neurodegenerative diseases), the underlying mechanism of which is insufficiently studied. This review aims to highlight the relationship between gut microbiota and neurodegenerative diseases, and to contribute to our understanding of the function of gut microbiota in neurodegeneration, as well as their relevant mechanisms. Furthermore, we also discuss the current application and future prospects of microbiota-associated therapy, including probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), potentially shedding new light on the research of neurodegeneration.",Microorganisms,2021,Peilin Sun; Lei Su; Hua Zhu; Xue Li; Yaxi Guo; Xiaopeng Du; Ling Zhang; Chuan Qin
34954497,Altered gut microbiota in Parkinson's disease patients with motor complications.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with gut dysbiosis. However, whether gut dysbiosis can cause motor complications is unclear.Subjects were enrolled from four independent movement disorder centers in Japan. We performed 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequence analysis of gut microbiota. Relative abundance of gut microbiota and relationships between them and clinical characteristics were statistically analyzed. Analysis of co-variance (ANCOVA) was used to assess altered gut microbiota associated with wearing-off or dyskinesia.We enrolled 223 patients with PD. Wearing-off was noted in 47.5% of patients and dyskinesia in 21.9%. We detected 98 genera of bacteria. Some changes in the gut microbiota were observed in patients with PD and motor complications. After Bonferroni correction, patients with wearing-off showed decreased relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae Blautia (p < 0.0001) and increased relative abundance of Lactobacillaceae Lactobacillus (p < 0.0001), but patients with dyskinesia no longer showed significant changes in the gut microbiota. Adjustment with two models of confounding factors followed by ANCOVA revealed that age (p < 0.0001), disease duration (p = 0.01), and wearing-off (p = 0.0004) were independent risks for the decreased relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae Blautia, and wearing-off (p = 0.009) was the only independent risk factor for the increased relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae Lactobacillus.Relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae Blautia and Lactobacillaceae Lactobacillus was significantly decreased and increased, respectively, in the gut microbiota of PD patients with motor complications. This indicates that an altered gut microbiota is associated with the development of motor complications in patients with advanced PD.",Parkinsonism & related disorders,2022,Kai Takahashi; Hiroshi Nishiwaki; Mikako Ito; Kazuhiro Iwaoka; Kenta Takahashi; Yoshio Suzuki; Keita Taguchi; Kanako Yamahara; Yoshio Tsuboi; Kenichi Kashihara; Masaaki Hirayama; Kinji Ohno; Tetsuya Maeda
35052575,Parkinson's Disease and the Metal-Microbiome-Gut-Brain Axis: A Systems Toxicology Approach.,"Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease, leading to motor and non-motor complications. Autonomic alterations, including gastrointestinal symptoms, precede motor defects and act as early warning signs. Chronic exposure to dietary, environmental heavy metals impacts the gastrointestinal system and host-associated microbiome, eventually affecting the central nervous system. The correlation between dysbiosis and PD suggests a functional and bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain. The bioaccumulation of metals promotes stress mechanisms by increasing reactive oxygen species, likely altering the bidirectional gut-brain link. To better understand the differing molecular mechanisms underlying PD, integrative modeling approaches are necessary to connect multifactorial perturbations in this heterogeneous disorder. By exploring the effects of gut microbiota modulation on dietary heavy metal exposure in relation to PD onset, the modification of the host-associated microbiome to mitigate neurological stress may be a future treatment option against neurodegeneration through bioremediation. The progressive movement towards a systems toxicology framework for precision medicine can uncover molecular mechanisms underlying PD onset such as metal regulation and microbial community interactions by developing predictive models to better understand PD etiology to identify options for novel treatments and beyond. Several methodologies recently addressed the complexity of this interaction from different perspectives; however, to date, a comprehensive review of these approaches is still lacking. Therefore, our main aim through this manuscript is to fill this gap in the scientific literature by reviewing recently published papers to address the surrounding questions regarding the underlying molecular mechanisms between metals, microbiota, and the gut-brain-axis, as well as the regulation of this system to prevent neurodegeneration.","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2021,Lady Johanna Forero-Rodríguez; Jonathan Josephs-Spaulding; Stefano Flor; Andrés Pinzón; Christoph Kaleta
34938619,Is the Gut Microbiota a Neglected Aspect of Gut and Brain Disorders?,"The gut microbiota is a quickly developing bacterial ecosystem with biodiversity. It is an adaptive immunity that varies with food intake, environmental conditions, and human habits, among other factors. Various external stimuli, such as drugs, can influence the gut microbial environment and lead to gut dysbiosis. Recently, gut dysbiosis has been identified as an important factor that leads to several diseases either by the released metabolites or by the gut neuronal connection. In brain disorders, gut dysbiosis is involved in neuropsychiatric manifestations, including autism spectrum disorder, anxiety, and depression by interfering with neurotransmitter homeostasis, and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease by releasing abnormal metabolites from the gut. Gut dysbiosis has been documented in gut disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease or irritable bowel syndrome. Immune cells in the gut are modulated by external factors such as stress, diet, and drugs to produce inflammatory cytokines, including interleukins (IL-4, IL-6, IL-17, IL-23, etc.). Inflammatory cytokines lead to a cascade of events, which lead to various ailments in the bowel. Beneficial bacteria in the form of probiotics ameliorate the condition and have healthful effects in disease conditions. This warrants further research to identify newer therapeutic strategies for diseases that cannot be cured or are difficult to treat.",Cureus,2021,Yuvaraj Balan; Archana Gaur; Varatharajan Sakthivadivel; Bhushan Kamble; Raja Sundaramurthy
33860738,The gut-brain axis and Parkinson disease: clinical and pathogenetic relevance.,"Gastrointestinal disorders are one of the most significant non-motor problems affecting people with Parkinson disease (PD). Pathogenetically, the gastrointestinal tract has been proposed to be the initial site of pathological changes in PD. Intestinal inflammation and alterations in the gut microbiota may contribute to initiation and progression of pathology in PD. However, the mechanisms underlying this ""gut-brain"" axis in PD remain unclear. PD patients can display a large variety of gastrointestinal symptoms, leading to reduced quality of life and psychological distress. Gastrointestinal disorders can also limit patients' response to medications, and consequently negatively impact on neurological outcomes. Despite an increasing research focus, gastrointestinal disorders in PD remain poorly understood and their clinical management often suboptimal. This review summarises our understanding of the relevance of the ""gut-brain"" axis to the pathogenesis of PD, discusses the impact of gastrointestinal disorders in patients with PD, and provides clinicians with practical guidance to their management.",Annals of medicine,2021,Elisa Menozzi; Jane Macnaughtan; Anthony H V Schapira
33459114,Role of gut microbiota in regulating gastrointestinal dysfunction and motor symptoms in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized primarily by motor and non-motor gastrointestinal (GI) deficits. GI symptoms' including compromised intestinal barrier function often accompanies altered gut microbiota composition and motor deficits in PD. Therefore, in this study, we set to investigate the role of gut microbiota and epithelial barrier dysfunction on motor symptom generation using a rotenone-induced mouse model of PD. We found that while six weeks of 10 mg/kg of chronic rotenone administration by oral gavage resulted in loss of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) neurons in both germ-free (GF) and conventionally raised (CR) mice, the decrease in motor strength and coordination was observed only in CR mice. Chronic rotenone treatment did not disrupt intestinal permeability in GF mice but resulted in a significant change in gut microbiota composition and an increase in intestinal permeability in CR mice. These results highlight the potential role of gut microbiota in regulating barrier dysfunction and motor deficits in PD.",Gut microbes,2021,Yogesh Bhattarai; Jie Si; Meng Pu; Owen A Ross; Pamela J McLean; Lisa Till; William Moor; Madhusudan Grover; Karunya K Kandimalla; Kara G Margolis; Gianrico Farrugia; Purna C Kashyap
35779869,Role of the gut microbiota in the development of various neurological diseases.,"In recent years, the scientific evidence supporting a relationship between the microbiota and various diseases has increased significantly; this trend has also been observed for neurological diseases. This has given rise to the concept of the gut-brain axis and the idea of a relationship between the gut microbiota and several neurological diseases whose aetiopathogenesis is yet to be clearly defined.We review the role of the gut microbiota in the gut-brain axis and analyse those neurological diseases in which alterations in the gut microbiota have been described as a result of human studies: specifically, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, and multiple sclerosis.The body of evidence linking the gut microbiota to various neurological diseases has grown considerably. Several interesting studies show a relationship between the gut microbiota and Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer disease, neuromyelitis optica, and multiple sclerosis, whereas other controversial studies implicate it in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Many of these studies place considerable emphasis on modulation of inflammation, particularly by bacteria capable of producing short-chain fatty acids. Despite these encouraging results, many questions remain, and there is a need to demonstrate causality, determine the role of fungi or viruses, and research possible treatment through diet, probiotics, or faecal microbiota transplantation.",Neurologia,2022,F Castillo-Álvarez; M E Marzo-Sola
34274348,Interactions between the microbiota and enteric nervous system during gut-brain disorders.,"For the last 20 years, researchers have focused their intention on the impact of gut microbiota in healthy and pathological conditions. This year (2021), more than 25,000 articles can be retrieved from PubMed with the keywords ""gut microbiota and physiology"", showing the constant progress and impact of gut microbes in scientific life. As a result, numerous therapeutic perspectives have been proposed to modulate the gut microbiota composition and/or bioactive factors released from microbes to restore our body functions. Currently, the gut is considered a primary site for the development of pathologies that modify brain functions such as neurodegenerative (Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, etc.) and metabolic (type 2 diabetes, obesity, etc.) disorders. Deciphering the mode of interaction between microbiota and the brain is a real original option to prevent (and maybe treat in the future) the establishment of gut-brain pathologies. The objective of this review is to describe recent scientific elements that explore the communication between gut microbiota and the brain by focusing our interest on the enteric nervous system (ENS) as an intermediate partner. The ENS, which is known as the ""second brain"", could be under the direct or indirect influence of the gut microbiota and its released factors (short-chain fatty acids, neurotransmitters, gaseous factors, etc.). Thus, in addition to their actions on tissue (adipose tissue, liver, brain, etc.), microbes can have an impact on local ENS activity. This potential modification of ENS function has global repercussions in the whole body via the gut-brain axis and represents a new therapeutic strategy.

33573273,Bile Acids and Microbiota: Multifaceted and Versatile Regulators of the Liver-Gut Axis.,"After their synthesis from cholesterol in hepatic tissues, bile acids (BAs) are secreted into the intestinal lumen. Most BAs are subsequently re-absorbed in the terminal ileum and are transported back for recycling to the liver. Some of them, however, reach the colon and change their physicochemical properties upon modification by gut bacteria, and vice versa, BAs also shape the composition and function of the intestinal microbiota. This mutual interplay of both BAs and gut microbiota regulates many physiological processes, including the lipid, carbohydrate and energy metabolism of the host. Emerging evidence also implies an important role of this enterohepatic BA circuit in shaping mucosal colonization resistance as well as local and distant immune responses, tissue physiology and carcinogenesis.

In this review, we focused on the nervous system and aimed to summarize the findings regarding <i>H. pylori</i> infection and its involvement in the induction/progression of neurological disorders. Neurological impairments induced by <i>H. pylori</i> infection are primarily due to impairments in the gut-brain axis (GBA) and to an altered gut microbiota facilitated by <i>H. pylori</i> colonization. Currently, regarding a potential relationship between <i>Helicobacter</i> infection and neurological disorders, most of the studies are mainly focused on <i>H. pylori</i>.",Cells,2021,Jacek Baj; Alicja Forma; Wojciech Flieger; Izabela Morawska; Adam Michalski; Grzegorz Buszewicz; Elżbieta Sitarz; Piero Portincasa; Gabriella Garruti; Michał Flieger; Grzegorz Teresiński
34370175,Gut brain axis: an insight into microbiota role in Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common progressive neurodegenerative diseases. It is characterized neuropathologically by the presence of alpha-synuclein containing Lewy Bodies in the substantia nigra of the brain with loss of dopaminergic neurons in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra. The presence of alpha-synuclein aggregates in the substantia nigra and the enteric nervous system (ENS) drew attention to the possibility of a correlation between the gut microbiota and Parkinson's disease. The gut-brain axis is a two-way communication system, which explains how through the vagus nerve, the gut microbiota can affect the central nervous system (CNS), including brain functions related to the ENS, as well as how CNS can alter various gut secretions and immune responses. As a result, this dysbiosis or alteration in gut microbiota can be an early sign of PD with reported changes in short chain fatty acids, bile acids, and lipids. This gave rise to the use of probiotics and faecal microbiota transplantation as alternative approaches to improve the symptoms of patients with PD. The aim of this review is to discuss investigations that have been done to explore the gastrointestinal involvement in Parkinson's disease, the effect of dysbiosis, and potential therapeutic strategies for PD.",Metabolic brain disease,2021,Sara Ayman Moustafa; Shrouk Mohamed; Abdelhameed Dawood; Jihan Azar; Ekramy Elmorsy; Noura A M Rizk; Mohamed Salama
34839011,"Effects of Resistant Starch on Symptoms, Fecal Markers, and Gut Microbiota in Parkinson's Disease - The RESISTA-PD Trial.","The composition of the gut microbiota is linked to multiple diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD). Abundance of bacteria producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and fecal SCFA concentrations are reduced in PD. SCFAs exert various beneficial functions in humans. In the interventional, monocentric, open-label clinical trial ""Effects of Resistant Starch on Bowel Habits, Short Chain Fatty Acids and Gut Microbiota in Parkinson'sDisease"" (RESISTA-PD; ID: NCT02784145), we aimed at altering fecal SCFAs by an 8-week prebiotic intervention with resistant starch (RS). We enrolled 87 subjects in three study-arms: 32 PD patients received RS (PD + RS), 30 control subjects received RS, and 25 PD patients received solely dietary instructions. We performed paired-end 100 bp length metagenomic sequencing of fecal samples using the BGISEQ platform at an average of 9.9 GB. RS was well-tolerated. In the PD + RS group, fecal butyrate concentrations increased significantly, and fecal calprotectin concentrations dropped significantly after 8 weeks of RS intervention. Clinically, we observed a reduction in non-motor symptom load in the PD + RS group. The reference-based analysis of metagenomes highlighted stable alpha-diversity and beta-diversity across the three groups, including bacteria producing SCFAs. Reference-free analysis suggested punctual, yet pronounced differences in the metagenomic signature in the PD + RS group. RESISTA-PD highlights that a prebiotic treatment with RS is safe and well-tolerated in PD. The stable alpha-diversity and beta-diversity alongside altered fecal butyrate and calprotectin concentrations call for long-term studies, also investigating whether RS is able to modify the clinical course of PD.","Genomics, proteomics & bioinformatics",2022,Anouck Becker; Georges Pierre Schmartz; Laura Gröger; Nadja Grammes; Valentina Galata; Hannah Philippeit; Jacqueline Weiland; Nicole Ludwig; Eckart Meese; Sascha Tierling; Jörn Walter; Andreas Schwiertz; Jörg Spiegel; Gudrun Wagenpfeil; Klaus Faßbender; Andreas Keller; Marcus M Unger
34358037,Modulation of Neuroinflammation by the Gut Microbiota in Prion and Prion-Like Diseases.,"The process of neuroinflammation contributes to the pathogenic mechanism of many neurodegenerative diseases. The deleterious attributes of neuroinflammation involve aberrant and uncontrolled activation of glia, which can result in damage to proximal brain parenchyma. Failure to distinguish self from non-self, as well as leukocyte reaction to aggregation and accumulation of proteins in the CNS, are the primary mechanisms by which neuroinflammation is initiated. While processes local to the CNS may instigate neurodegenerative disease, the existence or dysregulation of systemic homeostasis can also serve to improve or worsen CNS pathologies, respectively. One fundamental component of systemic homeostasis is the gut microbiota, which communicates with the CNS via microbial metabolite production, the peripheral nervous system, and regulation of tryptophan metabolism. Over the past 10-15 years, research focused on the microbiota-gut-brain axis has culminated in the discovery that dysbiosis, or an imbalance between commensal and pathogenic gut bacteria, can promote CNS pathologies. Conversely, a properly regulated and well-balanced microbiome supports CNS homeostasis and reduces the incidence and extent of pathogenic neuroinflammation. This review will discuss the role of the gut microbiota in exacerbating or alleviating neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases, and potential microbiota-based therapeutic approaches to reduce pathology in diseased states.","Pathogens (Basel, Switzerland)",2021,Josephine Trichka; Wen-Quan Zou
34682763,The Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis as a Key to Neuropsychiatric Disorders: A Mini Review.,"The central nervous system (CNS) is closely related to the gastrointestinal tract, mainly through regulating its function and homeostasis. Simultaneously, the gut flora affects the CNS and plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of neurologic and neuropsychological disorders such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or autism spectrum disorder. The population of gut microorganisms contains more than one billion bacteria. The most common are six phyla: Proteobacteria, Actinomyces, Verucomicrobia, Fusobacteria, and dominant Bacteroides with Firmicutes. The microbiota-gut-brain axis is a bidirectional nervous, endocrine, and immune communication between these two organs. They are connected through a variety of pathways, including the vagus nerve, the immune system, microbial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), the enteric nervous system, and hormones. Age, diet, antibiotics influence the balance of gut microorganisms and probably lead to the development of neurodegenerative disorders. In this article, a review is presented and discussed, with a specific focus on the changes of gut microbiota, gut-brain axis, related disorders, and the factors that influence gut imbalance.",Journal of clinical medicine,2021,Katarzyna Stopińska; Maria Radziwoń-Zaleska; Izabela Domitrz

34737076,Environmental neurotoxicants and inflammasome activation in Parkinson's disease - A focus on the gut-brain axis.,"Inflammasomes are multi-protein complexes expressed in immune cells that function as intracellular sensors of environmental, metabolic and cellular stress. Inflammasome activation in the brain, has been shown to drive neuropathology and disease progression by multiple mechanisms, making it one of the most attractive therapeutic targets for disease modification in Parkinson's Disease (PD). Extensive inflammasome activation is evident in the brains of people with PD at the sites of dopaminergic degeneration and synuclein aggregation. While substantial progress has been made on validating inflammasome activation as a therapeutic target for PD, the mechanisms by which inflammasome activation is triggered and sustained over the disease course remain poorly understood. A growing body of evidence point to environmental and occupational chemical exposures as possible triggers of inflammasome activation in PD. The involvement of the gastrointestinal system and gut microbiota in PD pathophysiology is beginning to be elucidated, especially the profound link between gut dysbiosis and immune activation. While large cohort studies confirmed specific changes in the gut microbiota in PD patients compared to age-matched healthy controls, recent research suggest that synuclein pathology could be initiated in the gastrointestinal tract. In this review, we present a summarized perspective on current understanding on inflammasome activation and the gut-brain-axis link during PD pathophysiology. We discuss multiple environmental toxicants that are implicated as the etiological agents in causing idiopathic PD and their mechanistic underpinnings during neuroinflammatory events. We additionally present future directions that needs to address the research questions related to the gut-microbiome-brain mechanisms in PD.",The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology,2022,Aishwarya M Johnson; Zhen-Yi Andy Ou; Richard Gordon; Hariharan Saminathan
34512244,What Is Our Understanding of the Influence of Gut Microbiota on the Pathophysiology of Parkinson's Disease?,"Microbiota have increasingly become implicated in predisposition to human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Traditionally, a central nervous system (CNS)-centric approach to understanding PD has predominated; however, an association of the gut with PD has existed since Parkinson himself reported the disease. The gut-brain axis refers to the bidirectional communication between the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and the brain. Gut microbiota dysbiosis, reported in PD patients, may extend this to a microbiota-gut-brain axis. To date, mainly the bacteriome has been investigated. The change in abundance of bacterial products which accompanies dysbiosis is hypothesised to influence PD pathophysiology <i>via</i> multiple mechanisms which broadly centre on inflammation, a cause of alpha-synuclein (a-syn) misfolding. Two main routes are hypothesised by which gut microbiota can influence PD pathophysiology, the neural and humoral routes. The neural route involves a-syn misfolding peripherally in the enteric nerves which can then be transported to the brain <i>via</i> the vagus nerve. The humoral route involves transportation of bacterial products and proinflammatory cytokines from the gut <i>via</i> the circulation which can cause central a-syn misfolding by inducing neuroinflammation. This article will assess whether the current literature supports gut bacteria influencing PD pathophysiology <i>via</i> both routes.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2021,Amaryllis E Hill; Richard Wade-Martins; Philip W J Burnet
34094829,"Gut microbiota mediates the absorption of FLZ, a new drug for Parkinson's disease treatment.","The gut microbiota plays an important role in regulating the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of many drugs. FLZ, a novel squamosamide derivative, has been shown to have neuroprotective effects on experimental Parkinson's disease (PD) models. FLZ is under phase Ⅰ clinical trial now, while the underlying mechanisms contributing to the absorption of FLZ are still not fully elucidated. Due to the main metabolite of FLZ was abundant in feces but rare in urine and bile of mice, we focused on the gut microbiota to address how FLZ was metabolized and absorbed. <i>In vitro</i> studies revealed that FLZ could be exclusively metabolized to its major metabolite M1 by the lanosterol 14 alpha-demethylase (CYP51) in the gut microbiota, but was almost not metabolized by any other metabolism-related organs, such as liver, kidney, and small intestine. M1 was quickly absorbed into the blood and then remethylated to FLZ by catechol <i>O</i>-methyltransferase (COMT). Notably, dysbacteriosis reduced the therapeutic efficacy of FLZ on the PD mouse model by inhibiting its absorption. The results show that the gut microbiota mediate the absorption of FLZ through a FLZ-M1-FLZ circulation. Our research elucidates the vital role of the gut microbiota in the absorption of FLZ and provides a theoretical basis for clinical pharmacokinetic studies and clinical application of FLZ in the treatment of PD.",Acta pharmaceutica Sinica.

34977556,Influence of probiotic bacteria on gut microbiota composition and gut wall function in an <i>in-vitro</i> model in patients with Parkinson's disease.,"We report here the potential role of a 4-strain probiotic suspension for use with patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Stool samples from a group of three patients with diagnosed PD were used to create microbiotas in an <i>in-vitro</i> gut model. The effects of dosing with an oral probiotic suspension (Symprove) on bacterial composition and metabolic activity in the microbiotas was evaluated over 48 h and compared with healthy controls. Additionally, the effect of probiotic dosing on epithelial tight-junction integrity, production of inflammatory markers and wound healing were evaluated in cell culture models. In general, the relative proportions of the main bacterial phyla in the microbiotas of PD patients differed from those of healthy subjects, with levels of <i>Firmicutes</i> raised and levels of <i>Bacteroidetes</i> reduced. Dosing with probiotic resulted in a change in bacterial composition in the microbiotas over a 48 h period. Several other indicators of gut health changed upon dosing with the probiotic; production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and lactate was stimulated, levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-10) increased and levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (MCP-1 and IL-8) decreased. Tight junction integrity was seen to improve with probiotic dosing and wound healing was seen to occur faster than a control. The data suggest that if development and/or progression of PD is influenced by gut microbiota dysbiosis then supplementation of the diet with a properly formulated probiotic may be a useful adjunct to standard treatment in clinic.",International journal of pharmaceutics: X,2021,Jonas Ghyselinck; Lynn Verstrepen; Frédéric Moens; Pieter Van Den Abbeele; Arnout Bruggeman; Jawal Said; Barry Smith; Lynne Ann Barker; Caroline Jordan; Valentina Leta; K Ray Chaudhuri; Abdul W Basit; Simon Gaisford
33804226,New Avenues for Parkinson's Disease Therapeutics: Disease-Modifying Strategies Based on the Gut Microbiota.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder that currently affects 1% of the population over the age of 60 years, and for which no disease-modifying treatments exist. Neurodegeneration and neuropathology in different brain areas are manifested as both motor and non-motor symptoms in patients. Recent interest in the gut-brain axis has led to increasing research into the gut microbiota changes in PD patients and their impact on disease pathophysiology. As evidence is piling up on the effects of gut microbiota in disease development and progression, another front of action has opened up in relation to the potential usage of microbiota-based therapeutic strategies in treating gastrointestinal alterations and possibly also motor symptoms in PD.

33857347,Bacterial Extracellular Vesicles and the Gut-Microbiota Brain Axis: Emerging Roles in Communication and Potential as Therapeutics.,"Bacterial extracellular vesicles (BEVs) have emerged as candidate signaling vectors for long-distance interkingdom communication within the gut-microbiota brain axis. Most bacteria release these nanosized vesicles, capable of signaling to the brain via their abundant protein and small RNA cargo, possibly directly via crossing the blood-brain barrier. BEVs have been shown to regulate brain gene expression and induce pathology at most stages of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, and thus they may play a causal role in diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and depression/anxiety. On the other hand, BEVs have intrinsic therapeutic properties that may be relevant to probiotic therapy and can also be engineered to function as drug delivery vehicles and vaccines. Thus, BEVs may be both a cause of and solution to neuropathological conditions. In this review, current knowledge of the physiological roles of BEVs as well as state of the art pertaining to the development of therapeutic BEVs in the context of the microbiome-gut-brain axis are summarized.",Advanced biology,2021,Nicholas H Pirolli; William E Bentley; Steven M Jay
33746867,Effect of Levodopa Initiation on the Gut Microbiota in Parkinson's Disease.,"<b>Background:</b> The impact of Levodopa on the gut microbiota of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients has not been sufficiently addressed. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted a longitudinal study to examine the impact of Levodopa initiation on the gut microbiota composition of 19 PD patients who had not previously been exposed to Levodopa. Patients provided two stool samples prior to and two samples 90 days after starting Levodopa. Motor impairment (MDS-UPDRS Part III), diet, and other patient characteristics were assessed. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was used to characterize the microbiota. We examined, cross-sectionally and longitudinally, the associations between Levodopa use and alpha and beta diversity and performed feature-wise, multivariate modeling to identify taxa associated longitudinally with Levodopa use and with improvement in motor function after Levodopa administration. <b>Results:</b> We did not observe significant differences in alpha or beta diversity before vs. after initiation of Levodopa. In longitudinal feature-wise analyses, at the genus level, no taxa were significantly associated with Levodopa use after false discovery rate (FDR) correction (<i>q</i> < 0.05). We observed a marginally lower relative abundance of bacteria belonging to <i>Clostridium</i> group IV in PD patients who experienced a medium or large improvement in motor impairment in response to Levodopa compared to those with a small response [β = -0.64 (SE: 0.18), p-trend: 0.00015 p-FDR: 0.019]. <b>Conclusions:</b> In this study, Levodopa was not associated with changes in microbiota composition in this longitudinal analysis. The association between abundance of <i>Clostridium</i> group IV and short-term motor symptom response to Levodopa is preliminary and should be investigated in larger, longer-term studies, that include a control group.",Frontiers in neurology,2021,Natalia Palacios; Anas Hannoun; Julie Flahive; Doyle Ward; Kelsey Goostrey; Anindita Deb; Kara M Smith
34934429,Gut microbiota relieves inflammation in the substantia nigra of chronic Parkinson's disease by protecting the function of dopamine neurons.,"The composition of the intestinal flora of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) can change. However, whether reshaping the gut microbial composition can treat PD remains to be seen. The present study evaluated the effect of intestinal flora in the treatment of PD in a C57BL/6 mouse PD model induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Chronic, low-dose, MPTP-treated mice exhibited upregulated gene expression levels of TNF-α and IL-1β in the substantia nigra (SN) of the mice, and induced intestinal microbial disorders. This indicated that the chronic low-dose MPTP model could be used to evaluate the progress of early intestinal pathology and intestinal flora imbalance in PD. After transplantation of faecal bacteria to MPTP-induced PD mice, the level of inflammation in the SN of the mice was reduced, and motor dysfunction was alleviated. Notably, faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) upregulated the abundance of <i>Blautia</i> but downregulated <i>Anaerostipes</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, <i>ASF356</i> and <i>Ruminococcus</i> in the gut of PD mice. In addition, FMT reduced the activation of microglia and astrocytes in the SN and reduced the expression levels of GSK3β, IL-1β, inducible nitric oxide synthase and phosphorylated PTEN in the SN. Overall, the present study demonstrated that gut microbial dysfunction is associated with the pathogenesis of PD, and that FMT can protect PD mice by inhibiting neuroinflammation.",Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2022,Tian Zhang; Tan Wang; Xinxu Chen; Zhenqiang Zhao; Zhibin Chen
33763767,Unravelling the potential of gut microbiota in sustaining brain health and their current prospective towards development of neurotherapeutics.,"Increasing incidences of neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are being reported, but an insight into their pathology remains elusive. Findings have suggested that gut microbiota play a major role in regulating brain functions through the gut-brain axis. A unique bidirectional communication between gut microbiota and maintenance of brain health could play a pivotal role in regulating incidences of neurodegenerative diseases. Contrarily, the present life style with changing food habits and disturbed circadian rhythm may contribute to gut homeostatic imbalance and dysbiosis leading to progression of several neurological disorders. Therefore, dysbiosis, as a primary factor behind intestinal disorders, may also augment inflammation, intestinal and blood-brain barrier permeability through microbiota-gut-brain axis. This review primarily focuses on the gut-brain axis functions, specific gut microbial population, metabolites produced by gut microbiota, their role in regulating various metabolic processes and role of gut microbiota towards development of neurodegenerative diseases. However, several studies have reported a decrease in abundance of a specific gut microbial population and a corresponding increase in other microbial family, with few findings revealing some contradictions. Reports also showed that colonization of gut microbiota isolated from patients suffering from neurodegenerative disease leads to the development of enhance pathological outcomes in animal models. Hence, a systematic understanding of the dominant role of specific gut microbiome towards development of different neurodegenerative diseases could possibly provide novel insight into the use of probiotics and microbial transplantation as a substitute approach for treating/preventing such health maladies.",Archives of microbiology,2021,Ankita Banerjee; Lilesh Kumar Pradhan; Pradyumna Kumar Sahoo; Kautilya Kumar Jena; Nishant Ranjan Chauhan; Santosh Chauhan; Saroj Kumar Das
33337387,Does Gut Microbiota Influence the Course of Parkinson's Disease? A 3-Year Prospective Exploratory Study in de novo Patients.,"Although abnormalities in gut microbiota are hypothesized to influence the pathogenesis and clinical phenotype of Parkinson's disease (PD), prospective studies on de novo patients are lacking.To preliminarily investigate whether gut microbiota in early untreated PD may predict motor and non-motor features progression over a 3-year period.16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicons were sequenced on fecal samples of 39 de novo PD patients. Multiple confounders were taken into account, including dietary habits. Motor and non-motor symptoms were assessed using validated scales at baseline and followed-up yearly for 3 years. At last follow-up, a detailed neuropsychological assessment was additionally performed. A general linear model for repeated measurements- adjusted by dopaminergic therapy at follow-up- was used to investigate the relationship between bacterial taxa abundance at baseline (stratified by the median of distribution at baseline) and outcome variables.Twenty-five patients were included (11 refused, 2 lost at follow-up, 1 died). Lower abundance of Roseburia (Firmicutes phylum) at baseline was associated with worse evolution of motor, non-motor and cognitive functions at 3-year follow-up. Similarly, lower abundance of Ruminococcaceae and Actinobacteria at baseline was associated with faster worsening of global cognitive functions. At follow-up, frontal lobe functions were the features most robustly associated with baseline microbial abnormalities.In the present exploratory study on de novo PD, we found an association between abnormal distribution of specific bacterial taxa and the progression of motor and non-motor features over a 3-year period. This proof-of-principle study supports the design of a larger observational study aiming to determine whether these differences survive multiple-comparison correction and define microbiota-specific subgroups suitable for therapeutic targeting.",Journal of Parkinson's disease,2021,Roberto Cilia; Marco Piatti; Emanuele Cereda; Carlotta Bolliri; Serena Caronni; Valentina Ferri; Erica Cassani; Salvatore Bonvegna; Carlo Ferrarese; Anna L Zecchinelli; Michela Barichella; Gianni Pezzoli
34219519,The Role of The Gut Microbiome in Parkinson's Disease.,"The gut microbiota is known to play a role in various disease states through inflammatory, immune and endocrinologic response. Parkinson's Disease is of particular interest as gastrointestinal involvement is one of the earlier features seen in this disease. This paper examines the relationship between gut microbiota and Parkinson's Disease, which has a growing body of literature. Inflammation caused by gut dysbiosis is thought to increase a-synuclein aggregation and worsen motor and neurologic symptoms of Parkinson's disease. We discuss potential treatment and supplementation to modify the microbiota. Some of these treatments require further research before recommendations can be made, such as cord blood transplant, antibiotic use, immunomodulation and fecal microbiota transplant.

34032644,Gut Microbiota as a Mediator of Host Neuro-Immune Interactions: Implications in Neuroinflammatory Disorders.,"The dynamic population of microbes that reside in the gastrointestinal tract plays a pivotal role in orchestrating several aspects of host physiology and health, including but not limited to nutrient extraction and metabolism, as well as the regulation of intestinal epithelial barrier integrity. Gut microbes interact with the host in a bi-directional manner as the microbiota can support the development and education of the innate and adaptive immune systems, thereby conferring protection against pathogens and harmful stimuli while training the host to maintain a homeostatic tolerance towards commensal symbiotics. Recent advances in the field have highlighted the importance of the host-microbiota relationship in neurodevelopment and behaviour, with relevant implications for the onset and progression of brain disorders of inflammatory origin. Microbial modulation of brain function is achieved throughout complex neuro-immune-endocrine pathways of the microbiome-gut-brain axis. Changes in the composition of the gut microbiota or perturbation in microbial-derived metabolites and neuroactive compounds are sensed by the afferent branches of the sympathetic and vagal innervation and transmitted to the central nervous system, which in turn produces behavioural responses. Here, we focus on how the crosstalk between the gut microbiota and the immune system modulates the development and function of the peripheral and central nervous systems. Specific attention is afforded to the involvement of host-microbe neuroimmune interactions in the pathogenesis of neuro-psychiatric and neuroinflammatory disorders such as autism spectrum disorders, anxiety, and depression, as well as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.",Modern trends in psychiatry,2021,Valentina Caputi; Jelena Popov; Maria Cecilia Giron; Siobhain O Apos Mahony

Studies show that the gut microbiota plays an important role in the pathophysiology of neurological and psychiatric disorders through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Therefore, reconstruction of the healthy gut microbiota is a promising new strategy for treating cerebral diseases. We have reviewed the latest research on the role of gut microbiota in different nervous system diseases as well as FMT in the context of its application in neurological, psychiatric, and other nervous system-related diseases (Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder, hepatic encephalopathy, neuropathic pain, etc.).",Gastroenterology research and practice,2021,Hao-Ming Xu; Hong-Li Huang; You-Lian Zhou; Hai-Lan Zhao; Jing Xu; Di-Wen Shou; Yan-Di Liu; Yong-Jian Zhou; Yu-Qiang Nie

33400024,Is Gut Dysbiosis an Epicenter of Parkinson's Disease?,"Once recognized as one of the most esoteric diseases of the central nervous system, Parkinson's disease (PD) is now deemed to be a chronic illness contributed by the central, autonomic and enteric nervous systems. Most likely, an accumulation of α-synuclein in the central and enteric nervous systems is the key that supports this viewpoint. Constipation, one of the non-motor hallmarks in roughly two-third of PD patients, is regulated by the composition of gut bacteria, which is assumed to set off the enteric α-synuclein accrual. Vagus nerve is suggested to direct the signal for α-synuclein over-expression and accumulation to the brain. While trillions of microorganisms reside in the intestinal tract, only one third of the proportion inhabits evenly in all individuals. Existence of an impaired gut-microbe-brain axis consonant with dysbiosis could be an epicenter of this inexplicable disorder. Any alteration in the structure and function of the gastrointestinal tract owing to exposure of endogenous or exogenous chemicals or toxicants could lead to dysbiosis. However, inconsistency in the symptoms even after exposure to same chemical or toxicant in PD patients emphatically creates a conundrum. While the level of a few specific neurotransmitters and metabolites is influenced by microbes, implication of dysbiosis is still debatable. Nevertheless, the scientific literature is overflowing with the remarkable observations supporting the role of dysbiosis in PD. Lack of specificity to differentially diagnose PD with non-PD or PD-plus syndrome, to identify highly precise drug targets and to develop therapeutic stratagems to encounter the disease on the basis of this approach, causes us to be open-minded about the dysbiosis theory. The article reviews the facts supporting gut dysbiosis as the foremost trigger for PD onset along with disagreements.",Neurochemical research,2021,Charul Rajput; Alika Sarkar; Nidhi Sachan; Neeraj Rawat; Mahendra Pratap Singh

Some genetic and environmental factors contribute to the promotion of the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Currently, there are no effective treatments for neurodegenerative diseases. It has been revealed that bidirectional communication exists between the brain and the gut. The gut microbiota is a changeable and experience-dependent ecosystem and can be modified by genetic and environmental factors. The gut microbiota provides potential therapeutic targets that can be regulated as new interventions for neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we discuss genetic and environmental risk factors for neurodegenerative diseases, summarize the communication among the components of the microbiota-gut-brain axis, and discuss the treatment strategy of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). FMT is a promising treatment for neurodegenerative diseases, and restoration of the gut microbiota to a premorbid state is a novel goal for prevention and treatment strategies.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2021,Hui Wang; Feng Yang; Shidong Zhang; Ruihua Xin; Yan Sun
33549028,A narrative review of relationship between gut microbiota and neuropsychiatric disorders: mechanisms and clinical application of probiotics and prebiotics.,"The gut microbiota is a kind of fixed-value bacteria in the human intestine, characterized by a large quantity, a wide variety and interdependence with each other and with the host. The gut microbiota is considered to be an important link in maintaining health and pathogenic mechanism of many diseases. The gut microbiota affects the central nervous system under the action of the microbe-gut-brain axis through nerve, immune, endocrine and metabolic pathways. The gut microbiota not only regulates the gastrointestinal tract but plays a vital role in the development and function of the brain. More and more studies believe that normal gut microbiota is essential for the development of the central nervous system and emotional regulation. The imbalance of the gut microbiota can affect some neuropsychiatric diseases. Probiotics and prebiotics are active microorganisms beneficial to the human body and can regulate the microecological balance of the human intestinal tract. Current research shows that probiotics and prebiotics have a good preventive effect on Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, depression, autism spectrum disorders and other neurological and mental diseases. Based on this, we review the relevant research on the pathogenesis of probiotics and prebiotics and neuropsychiatric diseases, in an attempt to providing new ideas for exploring the treatment and prevention of neuropsychiatric diseases.",Annals of palliative medicine,2021,Huan Yang; Yuqing Liu; Rui Cai; Ying Li; Bing Gu

The complex interplay between gut microbiota and the brain, and vice versa, has recently become not only the focus of neuroscience, but also the starting point for research regarding many diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). The bi-directional interaction between gut microbiota and the brain is not completely understood. The aim of this review is to sum up the evidencesconcerningthe role of the gut-brain microbiota axis in ischemic stroke and to highlight the more recent evidences about the potential role of the gut-brain microbiota axis in the interaction between inflammatory bowel disease and ischemic stroke.","Life (Basel, Switzerland)",2021,Emanuele Sinagra; Gaia Pellegatta; Valentina Guarnotta; Marcello Maida; Francesca Rossi; Giuseppe Conoscenti; Socrate Pallio; Rita Alloro; Dario Raimondo; Fabio Pace; Andrea Anderloni
33470765,The gut microbiota metabolite propionate ameliorates intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction-mediated Parkinson's disease via the AKT signaling pathway.,"Parkinson's disease is a common neurodegenerative disease. Here, we investigated the protective effect and potential mechanisms of propionate on the intestinal epithelial barrier in mice with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced Parkinson's disease.Gas chromatography was used to determine short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) concentrations in the fecal samples of Parkinson's disease patients and healthy controls. The stepping test was used to analyze forelimb akinesia, whisker test was used to analyze sensorimotor injury, cylinder test was used to analyze sensorimotor function, and Western blotting was used to analyze protein expression.The concentrations of SCFAs, including acetate, butyrate and propionate, were significantly downregulated in the fecal samples of Parkinson's disease patients, and among the SCFAs, propionate decreased the most. Propionate administration improved the stepping test score, whisker test score and cylinder test score of MPTP-induced Parkinson's disease mice. Additionally, propionate administration increased the protein expression of zonula occludens-1 and occludin. Moreover, the effects of propionate on motor behavior and the intestinal epithelial barrier were dependent on the proteirrserinc-threonine kinases (AKT) signaling pathway. More importantly, treatment with SC79, a specific AKT agonist, abolished the effects of propionate on the intestinal epithelial barrier and motor behavior.Our results demonstrated that propionate, which was decreased in the fecal samples of Parkinson's disease patients, exerted beneficial effects on intestinal epithelial barrier function and improved motor behavior in MPTP-induced Parkinson's disease mice through the AKT signaling pathway.",Neuroreport,2021,Tingting Huang; Hongjuan Shi; Yuanfeng Xu; Lili Ji
34495955,Gut microbiota alterations in response to sleep length among African-origin adults.,"Sleep disorders are increasingly being characterized in modern society as contributing to a host of serious medical problems, including obesity and metabolic syndrome. Changes to the microbial community in the human gut have been reportedly associated with many of these cardiometabolic outcomes. In this study, we investigated the impact of sleep length on the gut microbiota in a large cohort of 655 participants of African descent, aged 25-45, from Ghana, South Africa (SA), Jamaica, and the United States (US). The sleep duration was self-reported via a questionnaire. Participants were classified into 3 sleep groups: short (<7hrs), normal (7-<9hrs), and long (≥9hrs). Forty-seven percent of US participants were classified as short sleepers and 88% of SA participants as long sleepers. Gut microbial composition analysis (16S rRNA gene sequencing) revealed that bacterial alpha diversity negatively correlated with sleep length (p<0.05). Furthermore, sleep length significantly contributed to the inter-individual beta diversity dissimilarity in gut microbial composition (p<0.01). Participants with both short and long-sleep durations exhibited significantly higher abundances of several taxonomic features, compared to normal sleep duration participants. The predicted relative proportion of two genes involved in the butyrate synthesis via lysine pathway were enriched in short sleep duration participants. Finally, co-occurrence relationships revealed by network analysis showed unique interactions among the short, normal and long duration sleepers. These results suggest that sleep length in humans may alter gut microbiota by driving population shifts of the whole microbiota and also specific changes in Exact Sequence Variants abundance, which may have implications for chronic inflammation associated diseases. The current findings suggest a possible relationship between disrupted sleep patterns and the composition of the gut microbiota. Prospective investigations in larger and more prolonged sleep researches and causally experimental studies are needed to confirm these findings, investigate the underlying mechanism and determine whether improving microbial homeostasis may buffer against sleep-related health decline in humans.",PloS one,2021,Na Fei; Candice Choo-Kang; Sirimon Reutrakul; Stephanie J Crowley; Dale Rae; Kweku Bedu-Addo; Jacob Plange-Rhule; Terrence E Forrester; Estelle V Lambert; Pascal Bovet; Walter Riesen; Wolfgang Korte; Amy Luke; Brian T Layden; Jack A Gilbert; Lara R Dugas
34974121,Gut microbiota modulation by prednisolone in a rat kindling model of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizure.,"The gut microbiota is a complex community composed by several microorganisms that interact in the maintenance of homeostasis and contribute to physiological processes, including brain function. The relationship of the taxonomic composition of the gut microbiota with neurological diseases such as autism, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, anxiety, and depression is widely recognized. The immune system is an important intermediary between the gut microbiota and the central nervous system, being one of the communication routes of the gut-brain axis. Although the complexity of the relationship between inflammation and epilepsy has not yet been elucidated, inflammatory processes are similar in many ways to the consequences of dysbiosis and contribute to disease progression. This study aimed to analyze the taxonomic composition of the gut microbiota of rats treated with prednisolone in a kindling model of epilepsy. Male Wistar rats (90 days, n = 24) divided into four experimental groups: sodium chloride solution 0.9 g%, diazepam 2 mg/kg, prednisolone 1 mg/kg, and prednisolone 5 mg/kg administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) for 14 days. The kindling model was induced by pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) 25 mg/kg i.p. on alternate days. The taxonomic profile was established by applying metagenomic DNA sequencing. There was no change in alpha diversity, and the composition of the gut microbiota between prednisolone and diazepam was similar. The significant increase in Verrucomicrobia, Saccharibacteria, and Actinobacteria may be related to the protective activity against seizures and inflammatory processes that cause some cases of epilepsy. Further studies are needed to investigate the functional influence that these species have on epilepsy and the inflammatory processes that trigger it.",Microbial pathogenesis,2022,Amanda Muliterno Domingues Lourenço de Lima; Gabriel de Lima Rosa; Edson Fernando Müller Guzzo; Rafael Bremm Padilha; Rodrigo Costa da Silva; Alexandre Kleber Silveira; Daiana de Lima Morales; Milena Conci de Araujo; José Claudio Fonseca Moreira; Afonso Luís Barth; Adriana Simon Coitinho; Sueli Teresinha Van Der Sand

A. muciniphila, a mucin-degrading bacterium, is a potential next-generation microbe that has anti-inflammatory properties and is responsible for keeping the body healthy. As the role of A. muciniphila in PD has become increasingly apparent, we discuss the potential link between A. muciniphila and various neurological diseases (including PD) in the current review.",Current medical science,2021,Xin Fang; Fang-Jun Li; Dao-Jun Hong
33404072,Role of pattern recognition receptors and the microbiota in neurological disorders.,"In recent years, the gut microbiota has been increasingly implicated in the development of many extraintestinal disorders, including neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Despite this growing connection, our understanding of the precise mechanisms behind these effects is currently lacking. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are important innate immune proteins expressed on the surface and within the cytoplasm of a multitude of cells, both immune and otherwise, including epithelial, endothelial and neuronal. PRRs comprise four major subfamilies: the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain leucine rich repeats-containing receptors (NLRs), the retinoic acid inducible gene 1-like receptors and the C-type lectin receptors. Recognition of commensal bacteria by PRRs is critical for maintaining host-microbe interactions and homeostasis, including behaviour. The expression of PRRs on multiple cell types makes them a highly interesting and novel target for regulation of host-microbe signalling, which may lead to gut-brain signalling. Emerging evidence indicates that two of the four known families of PRRs (the NLRs and the TLRs) are involved in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders via the gut-brain axis. Taken together, increasing evidence supports a role for these PRRs in the development of neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis, via the microbiota-gut-brain axis.",The Journal of physiology,2021,Ciara E Keogh; Kavi M Rude; Mélanie G Gareau
33985520,Evaluation of fecal microbiota transplantation in Parkinson's disease patients with constipation.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder and 70-80% of PD patients suffer from gastrointestinal dysfunction such as constipation. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for treating PD related to gastrointestinal dysfunction. We conducted a prospective, single- study. Eleven patients with PD received FMT. Fecal samples were collected before and after FMT and subjected to 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) gene sequencing. Hoehn-Yahr (H-Y) grade, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score, and the Non-Motion Symptom Questionnaire (NMSS) were used to assess improvements in motor and non-motor symptoms. PAC-QOL score and Wexner constipation score were used to assess the patient's constipation symptoms. All patients were tested by the small intestine breath hydrogen test, performed before and after FMT. Community richness (chao) and microbial structure in before-FMT PD patients were significantly different from the after-FMT. We observed an increased abundance of Blautia and Prevotella in PD patients after FMT, while the abundance of Bacteroidetes decreased dramatically. After FMT, the H-Y grade, UPDRS, and NMSS of PD patients decreased significantly. Through the lactulose H2 breath test, the intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) in PD patients returned to normal. The PAC-QOL score and Wexner constipation score in after-FMT patients decreased significantly. Our study profiles specific characteristics and microbial dysbiosis in the gut of PD patients. FMT might be a therapeutic potential for reconstructing the gut microbiota of PD patients and improving their motor and non-motor symptoms.",Microbial cell factories,2021,Xiao-Yi Kuai; Xiao-Han Yao; Li-Juan Xu; Yu-Qing Zhou; Li-Ping Zhang; Yi Liu; Shao-Fang Pei; Chun-Li Zhou
34053222,Development of an Efficient and Sensitive Chemical Derivatization-Based LC-MS/MS Method for Quantifying Gut Microbiota-Derived Metabolites in Human Plasma and Its Application in Studying Cardiovascular Disease.,"Recently, the gut microbiota has been found to be associated with many diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, depression, Parkinson's disease, cancer, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Among various gut microbiota-derived metabolites (GMs), short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), bile acids (BAs), and tryptophan (TRP) metabolites are the most frequently discussed metabolites. LC-MS/MS shows advantages in quantifying the levels of metabolites with good sensitivity and selectivity; however, the poor ionization efficiency and polar characteristics of SCFAs make their analysis challenging, especially when analyzing plasma samples with low SCFA concentrations. Moreover, without characteristic fragment ions for unconjugated BAs and different detection ion modes for TRP metabolites and BAs, GM analysis is complex and time-consuming. To overcome these problems, we developed a derivatization method combined with LC-MS/MS to enhance the sensitivity and LC retention of GMs. Through derivatization with 3-nitrophenylhydrazine (3-NPH), 7 SCFAs, 9 bile acids, and 6 tryptophan metabolites can be simultaneously analyzed via separation within 14 min on a reversed-phase C18 column. For accurate quantification, <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-3NPH-labeled standards were used as one-to-one internal standards. This derivatization approach was optimized and then validated. We further applied this method to investigate the targeted GM profile in patients with CVD. The results showed a significant reduction in plasma butyrate levels in CVD patients compared with healthy controls, suggesting its potentially protective role in CVD. In summary, this work provides a sensitive and effective LC-MS/MS method for simultaneously quantifying gut microbiota-related metabolites in human plasma, which could benefit various future gut microbiota-related studies.",Journal of proteome research,2021,Hsin-Yu Liao; Chin-Yi Wang; Ching-Hua Lee; Hsien-Li Kao; Wei-Kai Wu; Ching-Hua Kuo
34276644,Altered Actinobacteria and Firmicutes Phylum Associated Epitopes in Patients With Parkinson's Disease.,"Recent evidence suggests that inflammation was participated in the pathogenesis of PD, thus, to understand the potential mechanism of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), we performed a metagenomic analysis of fecal samples from PD patient and controls. Using a two-stage metagenome-wide association strategy, fecal DNA samples from 69 PD patients and 244 controls in three groups (comprising 66 spouses, 97 age-matched, and 81 normal samples, respectively) were analyzed, and differences between candidate gut microbiota and microbiota-associated epitopes (MEs) were compared. In the study, 27 candidate bacterial biomarkers and twenty-eight candidate epitope peptides were significantly different between the PD patients and control groups. Further, enriched 4 and 13 MEs in PD were positively associated with abnormal inflammatory indicators [neutrophil percentage (NEUT.1), monocyte count/percentage (MONO/MONO.1), white blood cell count (WBC)] and five candidate bacterial biomarkers (c_Actinobacteria, f_Bifidobacteriaceae, <i>g_Bifidobacterium</i>, o_Bifidobacteriales, p_Actinobacteria) from Actinobacteria phylum, and they were also positively associated with histidine degradation and proline biosynthesis pathways, respectively. Additionally, enriched 2 MEs and 1 ME in PD were positively associated with above inflammatory indicators and two bacteria (f_Lactobacillaceae, <i>g_Lactobacillus</i>) from Firmicutes phylum, and they were also positively associated with pyruvate fermentation to propanoate I and negatively associated with isopropanol biosynthesis, respectively. Of these MEs, two MEs from GROEL2, RPSC were derived from <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, triggered the T cell immune response, as previously reported. Additionally, other candidate epitope peptides derived from <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> and <i>Mycobacterium leprae</i> may also have potential immune effects in PD. In all, the altered MEs in PD may relate to abnormalities in immunity and glutamate and propionate metabolism, which furthers our understanding of the pathogenesis of PD.",Frontiers in immunology,2021,Zhuo Li; Gang Lu; Zhe Li; Bin Wu; Enli Luo; Xinmin Qiu; Jianwen Guo; Zhangyong Xia; Chunye Zheng; Qiaozhen Su; Yan Zeng; Wai Yee Chan; Xianwei Su; Qiaodi Cai; Yanjuan Xu; Yingjun Chen; Mingbang Wang; Wai Sang Poon; Xiaodong Luo
33912026,Colonic Dopaminergic Neurons Changed Reversely With Those in the Midbrain via Gut Microbiota-Mediated Autophagy in a Chronic Parkinson's Disease Mice Model.,"The role of gut-brain axis in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) have become a research hotspot, appropriate animal model to study gut-brain axis in PD is yet to be confirmed. Our study employed a classical PD mice model achieved by chronic MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) injection to study concurrent changes of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain and the colon of mice. Our results showed such a PD model exhibited apparent locomotor deficits but not gastrointestinal dysfunction. Tyrosine hydroxylase expressions and dopamine content reduced greatly in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) or striatum, but increased in the colon of PD mice. Mechanism investigation indicated autophagy activity and apoptosis were stimulated in the SNpc, but inhibited in the colon of PD mice. Interplay of gut microbiota (GM) and autophagy in response to chronic MPTP injection led to GM dysbiosis and defective autophagy in mice colon. Meanwhile, fecal short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), acetate and propionate in particular, declined greatly in PD mice, which could be attributed to the decreased bacteria abundance of phylum <i>Bacteroidetes</i>, but increased abundance of phylum <i>Firmicutes</i>. GM dysbiosis derived fecal SCFAs might be one of the mediators of downregulated autophagy in the colon of PD mice. In conclusion, colonic dopaminergic neurons changed in the opposition direction with those in the midbrain via GM dysbiosis-mediated autophagy inhibition followed by suppressed apoptosis in response to chronic MPTP injection. Such a chronic PD mice model might not be an ideal model to study role of gut-brain axis in PD progression.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2021,Xin Liu; Zhong-Rui Du; Xiong Wang; Kar-Him Luk; Cheuk-Hin Chan; Xu Cao; Qing Zhao; Fang Zhao; Wing-Tak Wong; Ka-Hing Wong; Xiao-Li Dong
33557583,Electroacupuncture may alleviate behavioral defects via modulation of gut microbiota in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease involving non-motor symptoms, of which gastrointestinal disorders are the most common. In light of recent results, intestinal dysfunction may be involved in the pathogenesis of PD. Electroacupuncture (EA) has shown potential effects, although the underlying mechanism remains mostly unknown. We speculated that EA could relieve the behavioral defects of PD, and that this effect would be associated with modulation of the gut microbiota.Mice were randomly divided into three groups: control, PD + MA (manual acupuncture), and PD + EA. MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) was used to establish the mouse model of PD. Rotarod performance tests, open field tests, and pole tests were carried out to assess motor deficiencies. Immunohistochemistry was conducted to examine the survival of dopaminergic neurons. 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing was applied to investigate the alterations of the gut microbiome. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to characterize the messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines.We found that EA was able to alleviate the behavioral defects in the rotarod performance test and pole test, and partially rescue the significant loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) chemically induced by MPTP in mice. Moreover, the PD + MA mice showed a tendency toward decreased intestinal microbial alpha diversity, while EA significantly reversed it. The abundance of Erysipelotrichaceae was significantly increased in PD + MA mice, and the alteration was also reversed by EA. In addition, the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were substantially increased in the SN of PD + MA mice, an effect that was reversed by EA.These results suggest that EA may alleviate behavioral defects via modulation of gut microbiota and suppression of inflammation in the SN of mice with PD, which provides new insights into the pathogenesis of PD and its treatment.",Acupuncture in medicine : journal of the British Medical Acupuncture Society,2021,Qiu-Qin Han; Yi Fu; Jia-Mei Le; Adam Pilot; Si Cheng; Pei-Qing Chen; Hailong Wu; Guo-Qing Wan; Xue-Feng Gu
34569965,Drosophila as a Model for Microbiota Studies of Neurodegeneration.,"Accumulating evidence show that the gut microbiota is deeply involved not only in host nutrient metabolism but also in immune function, endocrine regulation, and chronic disease. In neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the gut-brain axis, the bidirectional interaction between the brain and the gut, provides new route of pathological spread and potential therapeutic targets. Although studies of gut microbiota have been conducted mainly in mice, mammalian gut microbiota is highly diverse, complex, and sensitive to environmental changes. Drosophila melanogaster, a fruit fly, has many advantages as a laboratory animal: short life cycle, numerous and genetically homogenous offspring, less ethical concerns, availability of many genetic models, and low maintenance costs. Drosophila has a simpler gut microbiota than mammals and can be made to remain sterile or to have standardized gut microbiota by simple established methods. Research on the microbiota of Drosophila has revealed new molecules that regulate the brain-gut axis, and it has been shown that dysbiosis of the fly microbiota worsens lifespan, motor function, and neurodegeneration in AD and PD models. The results shown in fly studies represents a fundamental part of the immune and proteomic process involving gut-microbiota interactions that are highly conserved. Even though the fly's gut microbiota are not simple mimics of humans, flies are a valuable system to learn the molecular mechanisms of how the gut microbiota affect host health and behavior.",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2021,Fukiko Kitani-Morii; Robert P Friedland; Hideki Yoshida; Toshiki Mizuno
33889128,Impact of Subthalamic Deep Brain Stimulation on Hyposmia in Patients With Parkinson's Disease Is Influenced by Constipation and Dysbiosis of Microbiota.,"<b>Background:</b> Non-motor symptoms in PD usually arise at very early stage and vary during the whole disease progression. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is considered as a highly efficient treatment option for PD's motor function. However, the effect of DBS on NMS, especially hyposmia, has not been fully understood and the deep connection between different NMS such as hyposmia and constipation is still unknown. <b>Objective:</b> The objective of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic effect of DBS on hyposmia in PD patients with or without constipation and find potential factors which might influence the efficacy. <b>Methods:</b> A retrospective analysis of 65 PD patients accepted STN-DBS operation in Qilu Hospital during 2019-2020 were conducted to evaluate the exact therapeutic effect of DBS on hyposmia in PD. Sub-group analyses about the relationship between hyposmia and constipation were carried out. Analysis of flora in nasal mucosa was also conducted to evaluate the abundance and variety in different PD groups. <b>Results:</b> Our study showed that DBS had clearly improved olfactory function in Parkinson patients (<i>P</i> = 0.012) and subgroup analysis found that PD patients with constipation have lower olfactory function scores (25.27 ± 3.44 vs. 33.90 ± 6.633, <i>p</i> = 0.014) and worse improvement after DBS operation (ΔTDI 12.11 ± 3.2 vs. 8.78 ± 2.91, <i>p</i> = 0.0072). Analysis of flora indicated the obvious discrepancy on olfactory function scores and degree of improvement might be related to the abundance and dysbiosis of microbiota. <b>Conclusion:</b> In summary, this article presents a study on PD with hyposmia and constipation after DBS operation, explored the relationship between different NMS and offer a potential explanation on why PD patients with constipation usually have worse olfactory function for the less abundance and variety of microbiota.",Frontiers in neurology,2021,Chao Li; Ying Hou; Xu Wang; Yue-Xuan Li; Feng Li; Chao Zhang; Wei-Guo Li
34128115,The impact of device-assisted therapies on the gut microbiome in Parkinson's disease.,"Microbiome feedbacks are proposed to influence Parkinson's disease (PD) pathophysiology. A number of studies have evaluated the impact of oral medication on the gut microbiome (GM) in PD. However, the influence of PD device-assisted therapies (DATs) on the GM remains to be investigated.To profile acute gut microbial community alterations in response to PD DAT initiation.Clinical data and stool samples were collected from 21 PD patients initiating either deep brain stimulation (DBS) or levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) and ten spousal healthy control (HC) subjects. 16S amplicon sequencing of stool DNA enabled comparison of temporal GM stability between groups and with clinical measures, including disease alterations relative to therapy initiation.We assessed GM response to therapy in the PD group by comparing pre-therapy (- 2 and 0 weeks) with post-therapy initiation timepoints (+ 2 and + 4 weeks) and HCs at baseline (0 weeks). Altered GM compositions were noted between the PD and HC groups at various taxonomic levels, including specific differences for DBS (overrepresentation of Clostridium_XlVa, Bilophila, Parabacteroides, Pseudoflavonifractor and underrepresentation of Dorea) and LCIG therapy (overrepresentation of Pseudoflavonifractor, Escherichia/Shigella, and underrepresentation of Gemmiger). Beta diversity changes were also found over the 4 week post-treatment initiation period.We report on initial short-term GM changes in response to the initiation of PD DATs. Prior to the introduction of the DAT, a PD-associated GM was observed. Following initiation of DAT, several DAT-specific changes in GM composition were identified, suggesting DATs can influence the GM in PD.",Journal of neurology,2022,Michal Lubomski; Xiangnan Xu; Andrew J Holmes; Jean Y H Yang; Carolyn M Sue; Ryan L Davis

Epidemiological evidence supported an association between milk intake and a higher incidence of Parkinson's disease (PD), questions have been raised about prospective associations between dietary factors and the incidence of PD. Here, we investigated the significance of casein in the development of PD. The mice were given casein (6.75 g/kg i.g.) for 21 days after MPTP (25 mg/kg i.p. × 5 days) treatment, the motor function, dopaminergic neurons, inflammation, gut microbiota and fecal metabolites were observed. The experimental results revealed that the mice with casein gavage after MPTP treatment showed a persisted dyskinesia, the content of dopamine in striatum and the expression of TH in midbrain and ileum were decreased, the expression of Iba-1, CD4, IL-22 in midbrain and ileum increased continuously with persisted intestinal histopathology and intestinal barrier injury. Decreased intestinal bile secretion in addition with abnormal digestion and metabolism of carbohydrate, lipids and proteins were found, whereas these pathological status for the MPTP mice without casein intake had recovered after 24 days, no significant differences were observed with regard to only treated with casein. Our study demonstrates that intestinal pathologic injury, intestinal dysbacteriosis and metabolism changes promoted by casein in MPTP mice ultimately exacerbated the lesions to dopaminergic neurons.",Neurochemical research,2021,Xinrong Liu; Shuya Liu; Yong Tang; Zhengjia Pu; Hong Xiao; Jieying Gao; Qi Yin; Yan Jia; Qunhua Bai

34785689,Cholecystectomy and subsequent risk of Parkinson's disease: a nationwide retrospective cohort study.,"Growing evidence has suggested that the gut-brain axis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), and that this role is mediated by the interactions between bile acids (BAs) and intestinal microbiota. Given that cholecystectomy can lead to alterations in BAs and gut microbiota, we investigated whether cholecystectomy is linked to a higher risk of PD. We constructed a cohort of patients with an operation code of cholecystectomy from 2010 to 2015 (n = 161,838) and age- and sex-matched control subjects without cholecystectomy (n = 286,135) using the National Health Insurance Service database. Incident PD was traced over a maximum observation period of 7 years. We identified 1404 incident PD cases during 1,631,265 person-years of follow-up. The cholecystectomy group showed an elevated risk of PD compared to the control group, even after adjusting for potential confounding factors (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.27). When the data were split by sex, the risk elevation was significant in men (adjusted HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.06-1.41), but not in women (adjusted HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.88-1.22). Our results provide evidence that cholecystectomy is associated with an increased risk of developing PD. This association differed between men and women, suggesting sex-specific effects of cholecystectomy on the risk of PD.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2021,Ryul Kim; Jee-Young Lee; Sanghyun Park; Kyungdo Han; Cheol Min Shin
34430117,Fecal Microbiota Transplantation: A Microbiome Modulation Technique for Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and the fifth leading cause of death among the elderly. AD involves parts of the brain that can lead to progressive memory loss and impaired language skills and cognitive thinking, affecting one's ability to carry out daily activities. Aging, bad dietary habits, family history, as well as altered gut microbiota composition may play a role in the pathogenesis of AD. Although the association between the imbalance of gut microbiota and AD is still difficult to determine, it has been suggested that dysbiosis can lead to the increased secretion of lipopolysaccharides and amyloid, which may impair the permeability of the intestine and the blood-brain barrier. Moreover, it can progress the process of neuroinflammation, amyloid-beta formation, and ultimately neuronal death. Microbiota-targeted interventions such as personalized diet, probiotics, or fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) might represent a potential therapeutic option for AD. This review article discusses the procedure of FMT and its possible side effects on the recipient's body. In addition, we review the role of FMT in the context of its application in various nervous system-related disorders (AD, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis).",Cureus,2021,Varsha Nandwana; Shibajee Debbarma
34566874,Intestinal Decontamination Therapy for Dyskinesia and Motor Fluctuations in Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease is neurodegenerative disorder with an initial robust response to levodopa. As the disease progresses, patients frequently develop dyskinesia and motor fluctuations, which are sometimes resistant to pharmacological therapy. In recent years, abnormalities in gut microbiota have been identified in these patients with a possible role in motor manifestations. Dysbiosis may reduce levodopa absorption leading to delayed ""On"" or ""no-On"" states. Among 84 consecutive patients with PD, we selected 14 with levodopa-induced dyskinesia and motor fluctuations with a Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) part IV ≥ 8 points following a trial of pharmacological adjustment 2-3 months prior to study enrollment or adjustments in deep brain stimulation therapy. Patients received treatment with sodium phosphate enema followed by oral rifaximin and polyethylene glycol for 7 and 10 days, respectively. Evaluations between 14 to 21 days after starting treatment showed improvement in MDS-UPDRS-IV (<i>P</i> = 0.001), including duration (<i>P</i> = 0.001) and severity of dyskinesia (<i>P</i> = 0.003); duration of medication ""Off""-state (<i>P</i> = 0.004); functional impact of motor fluctuations (<i>P</i> = 0.047) and complexity of motor fluctuations (<i>P</i> = 0.031); no statistical improvement was observed in ""Off"" dystonia (<i>P</i> = 0.109) and total motor scores (<i>P</i> = 0.430). Marked to moderate improvement in dyskinesia was observed in 57% of cases with blinded evaluation of videos. About 80% of patients perceived moderate to robust improvement at follow-up.

35002935,Mediterranean Diet Adherence in People With Parkinson's Disease Reduces Constipation Symptoms and Changes Fecal Microbiota After a 5-Week Single-Arm Pilot Study.,"<b>Introduction:</b> Non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) such as gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction are common, yet little is known about how modifying dietary intake impacts PD symptoms. The aim of this study in individuals with PD was to determine whether a Mediterranean diet intervention is feasible and affects GI function, intestinal permeability and fecal microbial communities. <b>Methods:</b> A single-arm, 5-week Mediterranean diet intervention study was conducted in eight people with PD. Daily and weekly questionnaires were administered to determine changes in GI symptoms. Urine and stool samples were collected at baseline and after 5 weeks to assess intestinal permeability and fecal microbial communities. Additionally, live-in partners of the participants with PD were matched as controls (<i>n</i> = 8) for baseline urine and stool samples. <b>Results:</b> Participants with PD increased intake of Mediterranean diet based on adherence scores from baseline to week 5 (4.4 ± 0.6 vs. 11.9 ± 0.7; <i>P</i> < 0.01 with >10 representing good adherence), which was linked with weight loss (77.4 kg vs. 74.9 kg, <i>P</i> = 0.01). Constipation syndrome scores decreased after 5 weeks (2.3 ± 0.5 vs. 1.5 ± 0.3; <i>P</i> = 0.04). <i>Bilophila</i>, was higher at baseline in PD (0.6 ± 0.1% vs. 0.2 ± 0.1% <i>P</i> = 0.02) and slightly decreased after the diet intervention (0.5 ± 0.1%; <i>P</i> = 0.01). Interestingly, the proportion of <i>Roseburia</i> was significantly lower in PD compared to controls (0.6 ± 0.2% vs. 1.6 ± 0.3%; <i>P</i> = 0.02) and increased at week 5 (0.9 ± 0.2%; <i>P</i> < 0.01). No differences were observed for markers of intestinal permeability between the control and PD groups or post-intervention. <b>Conclusions:</b> Short-term Mediterranean diet adherence is feasible in participants with PD; correlated with weight loss, improved constipation, and modified gut microbiota. <b>Clinical Trial Registration:</b> ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT03851861.",Frontiers in neurology,2021,Carley Rusch; Matthew Beke; Lily Tucciarone; Carmelo Nieves; Maria Ukhanova; Massimiliano S Tagliamonte; Volker Mai; Joon Hyuk Suh; Yu Wang; Shannon Chiu; Bhavana Patel; Adolfo Ramirez-Zamora; Bobbi Langkamp-Henken
34032647,Production of Psychoactive Metabolites by Gut Bacteria.,"The gut microbiome plays a vital role in numerous aspects of physiology, including functions related to metabolism, the immune system, behaviour, brain structure and function. Furthermore, it is now becoming increasingly clear that alterations in microbial composition or diversity are implicated in several disease states, including anxiety, depression, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), obesity, and diabetes. Therefore, therapeutic targeting of the gut microbiota has the potential to be useful in the treatment of both stress-related disorders and metabolic diseases. An important method by which the gut microbiome can influence the gut-brain axis is through microbial production of psychoactive metabolites. Several bacteria have been shown to produce metabolites which can impact host health, such as short-chain fatty acids, conjugated linoleic acid, antimicrobials, exopolysaccharides, and vitamins. Furthermore, several molecules with neuroactive functions, including serotonin, gamma-aminobutyric acid, catecholamines, and acetylcholine, have been isolated from bacteria within the human gut. This review aims to explore the psychoactive metabolites reported to be produced by gut bacteria, particularly those of relevance to stress-related disorders. Screening methods for psychoactive metabolite production, as well as the challenges and limitations of this research, will also be addressed. Finally, the implications of metabolite production for neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, and stress, behavioural disorders such as ASD, and neurodegenerative disorders such as AD and PD will be discussed.",Modern trends in psychiatry,2021,Niamh C Wiley; John F Cryan; Timothy G Dinan; R Paul Ross; Catherine Stanton
34347266,Fecal Microbiota Transplantation Exerts a Protective Role in MPTP-Induced Parkinson's Disease via the TLR4/PI3K/AKT/NF-κB Pathway Stimulated by α-Synuclein.,"Gut microbiota is closely related to the Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis. Additionally, aggregation of α-synuclein (α-syn) is central to PD pathogenesis. Here we identified the further mechanisms of gut microbiota in PD. A mouse model with PD was established via injection of MPTP. Normal or MPTP-induced PD like animals were treated with FMT from healthy normal mice. Pole test and traction test were performed to examine the effects of FMT on motor function of PD mice. Fecal SCFAs were assessed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The α-syn level in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SN) of mice was measured using western blot. Dopaminergic neurons and microglial activation in the SN were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) staining. FMT alleviated physical impairment, decreased fecal SCFAs in a mouse model of PD. Additionally, FMT decreased the expression of α-syn, as well as inhibited the activation of microglia in the SN, and blocked the TLR4/PI3K/AKT/NF-κB signaling in the SN and striatum. FMT could protect mice against PD via suppressing α-syn expression and inactivating the TLR4/PI3K/AKT/NF-κB signaling.",Neurochemical research,2021,Zhe Zhong; Weijie Chen; Huan Gao; Ningning Che; Min Xu; Lanqing Yang; Yingfang Zhang; Min Ye
34012926,<i>Desulfovibrio</i> Bacteria Are Associated With Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most prevalent movement disorder known and predominantly affects the elderly. It is a progressive neurodegenerative disease wherein α-synuclein, a neuronal protein, aggregates to form toxic structures in nerve cells. The cause of Parkinson's disease (PD) remains unknown. Intestinal dysfunction and changes in the gut microbiota, common symptoms of PD, are evidently linked to the pathogenesis of PD. Although a multitude of studies have investigated microbial etiologies of PD, the microbial role in disease progression remains unclear. Here, we show that Gram-negative sulfate-reducing bacteria of the genus <i>Desulfovibrio</i> may play a potential role in the development of PD. Conventional and quantitative real-time PCR analysis of feces from twenty PD patients and twenty healthy controls revealed that all PD patients harbored <i>Desulfovibrio</i> bacteria in their gut microbiota and these bacteria were present at higher levels in PD patients than in healthy controls. Additionally, the concentration of <i>Desulfovibrio</i> species correlated with the severity of PD. <i>Desulfovibrio</i> bacteria produce hydrogen sulfide and lipopolysaccharide, and several strains synthesize magnetite, all of which likely induce the oligomerization and aggregation of α-synuclein protein. The substances originating from <i>Desulfovibrio</i> bacteria likely take part in pathogenesis of PD. These findings may open new avenues for the treatment of PD and the identification of people at risk for developing PD.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2021,Kari E Murros; Vy A Huynh; Timo M Takala; Per E J Saris
33327916,Modulation of Gut-Brain Axis by Probiotics: A Promising Anti-depressant Approach.,"The human digestive system is embedded with trillions of microbes of various species and genera. These organisms serve several purposes in the human body and exist in symbiosis with the host. Their major role is involved in the digestion and conversion of food materials into many useful substrates for the human body. Apart from this, the gut microbiota also maintains healthy communication with other body parts, including the brain. The connection between gut microbiota and the brain is termed as gut-brain axis (GBA), and these connections are established by neuronal, endocrine and immunological pathways. Thus, they are involved in neurophysiology and neuropathology of several diseases like Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), depression, and autism. There are several food supplements such as prebiotics and probiotics that modulate the composition of gut microbiota. This article provides a review about the role of gut microbiota in depression and supplements such as probiotics that are useful in the treatment of depression.",Current neuropharmacology,2021,Koumudhi Rajanala; Nitesh Kumar; Mallikarjuna Rao Chamallamudi
34795270,Micronutrient supplements can promote disruptive protozoan and fungal communities in the developing infant gut.,"Supplementation with micronutrients, including vitamins, iron and zinc, is a key strategy to alleviate child malnutrition. However, association of gastrointestinal disorders with iron has led to ongoing debate over their administration. To better understand their impact on gut microbiota, we analyse the bacterial, protozoal, fungal and helminth communities of stool samples collected from a subset of 80 children at 12 and 24 months of age, previously enrolled into a large cluster randomized controlled trial of micronutrient supplementation in Pakistan (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00705445). We show that while bacterial diversity is reduced in supplemented children, vitamins and iron (as well as residence in a rural setting) may promote colonization with distinct protozoa and mucormycetes, whereas the addition of zinc appears to ameliorate this effect. We suggest that the risks and benefits of micronutrient interventions may depend on eukaryotic communities, potentially exacerbated by exposure to a rural setting. Larger studies are needed to evaluate the clinical significance of these findings and their impact on health outcomes.",Nature communications,2021,Ana Popovic; Celine Bourdon; Pauline W Wang; David S Guttman; Sajid Soofi; Zulfiqar A Bhutta; Robert H J Bandsma; John Parkinson; Lisa G Pell
33704660,Modulating neuroinflammation in neurodegeneration-related dementia: can microglial toll-like receptors pull the plug?,"Neurodegeneration-associated dementia disorders (NADDs), namely Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases, are developed by a significant portion of the elderly population globally. Extensive research has provided critical insights into the molecular basis of the pathological advancements of these diseases, but an efficient curative therapy seems elusive. A common attribute of NADDs is neuroinflammation due to a chronic inflammatory response within the central nervous system (CNS), which is primarily modulated by microglia. This response within the CNS is positively regulated by cytokines, chemokines, secondary messengers or cyclic nucleotides, and free radicals. Microglia mediated immune activation is regulated by a positive feedback loop in NADDs. The present review focuses on evaluating the crosstalk between inflammatory mediators and microglia, which aggravates both the clinical progression and extent of NADDs by forming a persistent chronic inflammatory milieu within the CNS. We also discuss the role of the human gut microbiota and its effect on NADDs as well as the suitability of targeting toll-like receptors for an immunotherapeutic intervention targeting the deflation of an inflamed milieu within the CNS.",Metabolic brain disease,2021,Rohit Kumar Tiwari; Afrasim Moin; Syed Mohd Danish Rizvi; Syed Monowar Alam Shahid; Preeti Bajpai
34402617,Advances in Genome-Scale Metabolic Modeling toward Microbial Community Analysis of the Human Microbiome.,"A genome-scale metabolic model (GEM) represents metabolic pathways of an organism in a mathematical form and can be built using biochemistry and genome annotation data. GEMs are invaluable for understanding organisms since they analyze the metabolic capabilities and behaviors quantitatively and can predict phenotypes. The development of high-throughput data collection techniques led to an immense increase in omics data such as metagenomics, which expand our knowledge on the human microbiome, but this also created a need for systematic analysis of these data. In recent years, GEMs have also been reconstructed for microbial species, including human gut microbiota, and methods for the analysis of microbial communities have been developed to examine the interaction between the organisms or the host. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive guide for the applications of GEMs in microbial community analysis. Starting with GEM repositories, automatic GEM reconstruction tools, and quality control of models, this review will give insights into microbe-microbe and microbe-host interaction predictions and optimization of microbial community models. Recent studies that utilize microbial GEMs and personalized models to infer the influence of microbiota on human diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) or Parkinson's disease are exemplified. Being powerful system biology tools for both species-level and community-level analysis of microbes, GEMs integrated with omics data and machine learning techniques will be indispensable for studying the microbiome and their effects on human physiology as well as for deciphering the mechanisms behind human diseases.",ACS synthetic biology,2021,Elif Esvap; Kutlu O Ulgen
34829716,The Emerging Scenario of the Gut-Brain Axis: The Therapeutic Actions of the New Actor Kefir against Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"The fact that millions of people worldwide suffer from Alzheimer's disease (AD) or Parkinson's disease (PD), the two most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), has been a permanent challenge to science. New tools were developed over the past two decades and were immediately incorporated into routines in many laboratories, but the most valuable scientific contribution was the ""waking up"" of the gut microbiota. Disturbances in the gut microbiota, such as an imbalance in the beneficial/pathogenic effects and a decrease in diversity, can result in the passage of undesired chemicals and cells to the systemic circulation. Recently, the potential effect of probiotics on restoring/preserving the microbiota was also evaluated regarding important metabolite and vitamin production, pathogen exclusion, immune system maturation, and intestinal mucosal barrier integrity. Therefore, the focus of the present review is to discuss the available data and conclude what has been accomplished over the past two decades. This perspective fosters program development of the next steps that are necessary to obtain confirmation through clinical trials on the magnitude of the effects of kefir in large samples.","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2021,Thiago M C Pereira; Larissa Z Côco; Alyne M M Ton; Silvana S Meyrelles; Manuel Campos-Toimil; Bianca P Campagnaro; Elisardo C Vasquez
34769091,Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth as Potential Therapeutic Target in Parkinson's Disease.,"Increasing evidence suggests that the gut microbiota and the brain are closely connected via the so-called gut-brain axis. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is a gut dysbiosis in which the small intestine is abundantly colonized by bacteria that are typically found in the colon. Though not a disease, it may result in intestinal symptoms caused by the accumulation of microbial gases in the intestine. Intestinal inflammation, malabsorption and vitamin imbalances may also develop. SIBO can be eradicated by one or several courses of antibiotics but reappears if the predisposing condition persists. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative proteinopathy for which disease modifying interventions are not available. Sporadic forms may start in the gut years before the development of clinical features. Increased gastrointestinal transit time is present in most people with PD early during the course of the disease, predisposing to gut dysbiosis, including SIBO. The role that gut dysbiosis may play in the etiopathogenesis of PD is not fully understood yet. Here, we discuss the possibility that SIBO could contribute to the progression of PD, by promoting or preventing neurodegeneration, thus being a potential target for treatments aiming at slowing down the progression of PD. The direct symptomatic impact of SIBO and its impact on symptomatic medication are also briefly discussed.",International journal of molecular sciences,2021,Adela Dănău; Laura Dumitrescu; Antonia Lefter; Delia Tulbă; Bogdan Ovidiu Popescu
34909657,Gauging the role and impact of drug interactions and repurposing in neurodegenerative disorders.,"Neurodegenerative diseases (ND) are of vast origin which are characterized by gradual progressive loss of neurons in the brain region. ND can be classified according to the clinical symptoms present (e.g. Cognitive decline, hyperkinetic, and hypokinetic movements disorder) or by the pathological protein deposited (e.g., Amyloid, tau, Alpha-synuclein, TDP-43). Alzheimer's disease preceded by Parkinson's is the most prevalent form of ND world-wide. Multiple factors like aging, genetic mutations, environmental factors, gut microbiota, blood-brain barrier microvascular complication, etc. may increase the predisposition towards ND. Genetic mutation is a major contributor in increasing the susceptibility towards ND, the concept of one disease-one gene is obsolete and now multiple genes are considered to be involved in causing one particular disease. Also, the involvement of multiple pathological mechanisms like oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, etc. contributes to the complexity and makes them difficult to be treated by traditional mono-targeted ligands. In this aspect, the Poly-pharmacological drug approach which targets multiple pathological pathways at the same time provides the best way to treat such complex networked CNS diseases. In this review, we have provided an overview of ND and their pathological origin, along with a brief description of various genes associated with multiple diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Multiple sclerosis (MS), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's and a comprehensive detail about the Poly-pharmacology approach (MTDLs and Fixed-dose combinations) along with their merits over the traditional single-targeted drug is provided. This review also provides insights into current repurposing strategies along with its regulatory considerations.",Current research in pharmacology and drug discovery,2021,Dharmendra Kumar Khatri; Amey Kadbhane; Monica Patel; Shweta Nene; Srividya Atmakuri; Saurabh Srivastava; Shashi Bala Singh
33571701,The pleiotropic neuroprotective effects of resveratrol in cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease pathology: From antioxidant to epigenetic therapy.,"While the elderly segment of the population continues growing in importance, neurodegenerative diseases increase exponentially. Lifestyle factors such as nutrition, exercise, and education, among others, influence ageing progression, throughout life. Notably, the Central Nervous System (CNS) can benefit from nutritional strategies and dietary interventions that prevent signs of senescence, such as cognitive decline or neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's Disease. The dietary polyphenol Resveratrol (RV) possesses antioxidant and cytoprotective effects, producing neuroprotection in several organisms. The oxidative stress (OS) occurs because of Reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation that has been proposed to explain the cause of the ageing. One of the most harmful effects of ROS in the cell is DNA damage. Nevertheless, there is also evidence demonstrating that OS can produce other molecular changes such as mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, apoptosis, and epigenetic modifications, among others. Interestingly, the dietary polyphenol RV is a potent antioxidant and possesses pleiotropic actions, exerting its activity through various molecular pathways. In addition, recent evidence has shown that RV mediates epigenetic changes involved in ageing and the function of the CNS that persists across generations. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that RV interacts with gut microbiota, showing modifications in bacterial composition associated with beneficial effects. In this review, we give a comprehensive overview of the main mechanisms of action of RV in different experimental models, including clinical trials and discuss how the interconnection of these molecular events could explain the neuroprotective effects induced by RV.",Ageing research reviews,2021,Christian Griñán-Ferré; Aina Bellver-Sanchis; Vanessa Izquierdo; Rubén Corpas; Joan Roig-Soriano; Miguel Chillón; Cristina Andres-Lacueva; Milán Somogyvári; Csaba Sőti; Coral Sanfeliu; Mercè Pallàs
33417221,Pathophysiological Clues to How the Emergent SARS-CoV-2 Can Potentially Increase the Susceptibility to Neurodegeneration.,"Along with emergence of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in late 2019, a myriad of neurologic symptoms, associated with structural brain changes, were reported. In this paper, we provide evidence to critically discuss the claim that the survived patients could possibly be at increased risk for neurodegenerative diseases via various mechanisms. This virus can directly invade the brain through olfactory bulb, retrograde axonal transport from peripheral nerve endings, or via hematogenous or lymphatic routes. Infection of the neurons along with peripheral leukocytes activation results in pro-inflammatory cytokine increment, rendering the brain to neurodegenerative changes. Also, occupation of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) with the virus may lead to a decline in ACE-2 activity, which acts as a neuroprotective factor. Furthermore, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and septicemia induce hypoxemia and hypoperfusion, which are locally exacerbated due to the hypercoagulable state and micro-thrombosis in brain vessels, leading to oxidative stress and neurodegeneration. Common risk factors for COVID-19 and neurodegenerative diseases, such as metabolic risk factors, genetic predispositions, and even gut microbiota dysbiosis, can contribute to higher occurrence of neurodegenerative diseases in COVID-19 survivors. However, it should be considered that severity of the infection, the extent of neurologic symptoms, and the persistence of viral infection consequences are major determinants of this association. Importantly, whether this pandemic will increase the overall incidence of neurodegeneration is not clear, as a high percentage of patients with severe form of COVID-19 might probably not survive enough to develop neurodegenerative diseases.",Molecular neurobiology,2021,Mahsa Dolatshahi; Mohammadmahdi Sabahi; Mohammad Hadi Aarabi
35035709,An analysis of the characteristics of the intestinal flora in patients with Parkinson's disease complicated with constipation.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a degenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS) and is common among the middle-aged and elderly populations. Increasing evidence shows that the gut microbiota may trigger PD through the ""gut-microbiota-brain"" axis. A previous study revealed that constipation, one of the non-motor symptoms of PD, affects gut microbiota and the progression of PD. However, whether constipation is involved in gut microbiota-associated PD is largely unknown. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between gut microbiota, PD, and constipation in this study. We carried out 16S rRNA sequencing in 15 constipated PD patients (C-PD), 14 non-constipated PD (NC-PD) patients, and 15 healthy controls to evaluate the microbial population. Furthermore, co-occurrence networks were used to assess the gut ecology of the three groups. Spearman analyses were used to analyze the correlation between the differential microbiota and the clinical features. The results showed that there were differences in the composition of the gut microbiota among the C-PD group, the NC-PD group, and the healthy controls. No significant differences were observed in the alpha diversity among the three groups, but the beta diversity differed significantly among the groups. Compared with the healthy controls, the abundance of <i>Hungatella and Collinsella</i> was increased and the abundance of <i>Lachnospira and Fusicatenibacter</i> was reduced in the PD patients' feces. Compared with the NC-PD group, the relative abundance of <i>Megamonas and Holdemanella</i> were lower, while <i>Hungatella, Streptococcus</i> and <i>Anaerotruncus</i> were enriched in the C-PD group. The co-occurrence network analysis showed that the C-PD group presented a different microbial community relationship compared with the NC-PD group and the healthy controls. Our study provides strong evidence that the gut microbiota may be related to constipation in PD. In addition, our data suggest an association between the differential microbiota genera and the clinical features of PD. Therefore, modulating gut microbiota may be another way to monitor and optimize PD treatment.",American journal of translational research,2021,Weijie Chen; Zaoan Bi; Qihui Zhu; Huan Gao; Yi Fan; Chenyang Zhang; Xingyin Liu; Min Ye
33935107,Plasma Short-Chain Fatty Acids Differences in Multiple System Atrophy from Parkinson's Disease.,"Multiple system atrophy (MSA) and Parkinson's disease (PD) have overlapping symptoms, making diagnosis challenging. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are produced exclusively by gut microbiota and were reduced in feces of MSA patients. However, plasma SCFA concentrations in MSA patients have not been investigated.We aimed to investigate the plasma SCFAs in MSA patients and to identify the potential differential diagnostic ability.Plasma SCFA were measured in 25 MSA patients, 46 healthy controls, and 46 PD patients using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants were evaluated.Acetic acid concentration was lower in MSA patients than in healthy controls. Acetic acid and propionic acid concentrations were lower in MSA and MSA with predominant parkinsonism (MSA-P) patients than in PD patients. A receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis revealed reduced acetic acid concentration discriminated MSA patients from healthy controls with 76% specificity but only 57% sensitivity and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.68 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.55-0.81). Combined acetic acid and propionic acid concentrations discriminated MSA patients from PD patients with an AUC of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.71-0.93), 84% specificity and 76% sensitivity. Especially, with combined acetic acid and propionic acid concentrations, MSA-P patients were separated from PD patients with an AUC of 0.89 (95% CI: 0.80-0.97), 91% specificity and 80% sensitivity.Plasma SCFAs were decreased in MSA patients.

33662500,"Korean red ginseng suppresses 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced inflammation in the substantia nigra and colon.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease involving dopaminergic neuronal death in the substantia nigra (SN); recent studies have shown that interactions between gut and brain play a critical role in the pathogenesis of PD. In this study, the anti-inflammatory effect of Korean red ginseng (KRG) and the changes in gut microbiota were evaluated in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse model. Male nine-week-old C57BL/6 mice were injected intraperitoneally with 30 mg/kg of MPTP at 24-h intervals for 5 days. Two hours after the daily MPTP injection, the mice were orally administered 100 mg/kg of KRG, which continued for 7 days beyond the MPTP injections, for a total of 12 consecutive days. Eight days after the final KRG administration, the pole and rotarod tests were performed and brain and colon samples of the mice were collected. Dopaminergic neuronal death, activation of microglia and astrocytes, α-synuclein and expressions of inflammatory cytokines and disruption of tight junction were evaluated. In addition, 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing of mouse fecal samples was performed to investigate microbiome changes. KRG treatment prevented MPTP-induced behavioral impairment, dopaminergic neuronal death, activation of microglia and astrocytes in the nigrostriatal pathway, disruption of tight junction and the increase in α-synuclein, interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α expression in the colon. The 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that MPTP altered the number of bacterial species and their relative abundances, which were partially suppressed by KRG treatment. Especially, KRG suppressed the abundance of the inflammation-related phylum Verrucomicrobia and genera Ruminococcus and Akkermansia (especially Akkermansia muciniphila), and elevated the abundance of Eubacterium, which produces the anti-inflammatory substances. These findings suggest that KRG prevents MPTP-induced dopaminergic neuronal death, activation of microglia and astrocytes, and accumulation of α-synuclein in the SN, and the regulation of inflammation-related factors in the colon may influence the effect.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2021,Hyongjun Jeon; Chang-Hwan Bae; Yukyoung Lee; Hee-Young Kim; Seungtae Kim
34413194,Genome-wide screen identifies curli amyloid fibril as a bacterial component promoting host neurodegeneration.,"Growing evidence indicates that gut microbiota play a critical role in regulating the progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease. The molecular mechanism underlying such microbe-host interaction is unclear. In this study, by feeding <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> expressing human α-syn with <i>Escherichia coli</i> knockout mutants, we conducted a genome-wide screen to identify bacterial genes that promote host neurodegeneration. The screen yielded 38 genes that fall into several genetic pathways including curli formation, lipopolysaccharide assembly, and adenosylcobalamin synthesis among others. We then focused on the curli amyloid fibril and found that genetically deleting or pharmacologically inhibiting the curli major subunit CsgA in <i>E. coli</i> reduced α-syn-induced neuronal death, restored mitochondrial health, and improved neuronal functions. CsgA secreted by the bacteria colocalized with α-syn inside neurons and promoted α-syn aggregation through cross-seeding. Similarly, curli also promoted neurodegeneration in <i>C. elegans</i> models of Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington's disease and in human neuroblastoma cells.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2021,Chenyin Wang; Chun Yin Lau; Fuqiang Ma; Chaogu Zheng
34783227,Response of <i>Escherichia coli</i> to hydrogen nanobubbles: an in vitro evaluation using synchrotron infrared spectroscopy.,"Hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>)-rich water, an apparent source of molecular H<sub>2</sub>, is an emerging functional drink with many purported benefits for human health (Yang et al., 2020; Ostojic, 2021). The preventive and therapeutic effects of H<sub>2</sub> on various pathological processes have been intensively investigated in numerous clinical trials; it is commonly believed that the beneficial effects are mainly attributed to its selective antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties (Lee et al., 2015; Ohta, 2015; LeBaron et al., 2019; Qiu et al., 2020). In recent years, a handful of rodent studies revealed that exogenous H<sub>2</sub> can affect the gut microbiota (Sha et al., 2018; Valdes et al., 2018). For example, H<sub>2</sub> was reported to induce a higher abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria in a rat model of Parkinson's disease (Bordoni et al., 2019). Recent first-in-human trials have explored the effects of the long-term consumption of H<sub>2</sub>-rich water on antioxidant activity and the gut flora (Sha et al., 2018; Suzuki et al., 2018).

34802221,From the intestinal mucosal barrier to the enteric neuromuscular compartment: an integrated overview on the morphological changes in Parkinson's disease.,"Gastrointestinal dysfunctions represent the most common non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). Of note, changes in gut microbiota, impairments of intestinal epithelial barrier (IEB), bowel inflammation and neuroplastic rearrangements of the enteric nervous system (ENS) could be involved in the pathophysiology of the intestinal disturbances in PD. In this context, although several review articles have pooled together evidence on the alterations of enteric bacteria-neuro-immune network in PD, a revision of the literature on the specific morphological changes occurring in the intestinal mucosal barrier, the ENS and enteric muscular layers in PD, is lacking. The present review provides a complete appraisal of the available knowledge on the morphological alterations of intestinal mucosal barrier, with particular focus on IEB, ENS and enteric muscular layers in PD. In particular, our intent was to critically discuss whether, based on evidence from translational studies and pre-clinical models, morphological changes in the intestinal barrier and enteric neuromuscular compartment contribute to the pathophysiology of intestinal dysfunctions occurring in PD.",European journal of histochemistry : EJH,2021,Carolina Pellegrini; Vanessa D'Antongiovanni; Chiara Ippolito; Cristina Segnani; Luca Antonioli; Matteo Fornai; Nunzia Bernardini
34911958,Gut bacterial tyrosine decarboxylase associates with clinical variables in a longitudinal cohort study of Parkinsons disease.,"Gut microbiota influences the clinical response of a wide variety of orally administered drugs. However, the underlying mechanisms through which drug-microbiota interactions occur are still obscure. Previously, we reported that tyrosine decarboxylating (TDC) bacteria may restrict the levels of levodopa reaching circulation in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). We observed a significant positive association between disease duration and the abundance of the bacterial tdc-gene. The question arises whether increased exposure to anti-PD medication could affect the abundance of bacterial TDC, to ultimately impact drug efficacy. To this end, we investigated the potential association between anti-PD drug exposure and bacterial tdc-gene abundance over a period of 2 years in a longitudinal cohort of PD patients and healthy controls. Our data reveal significant associations between tdc-gene abundance, several anti-PD medications, including entacapone, rasagiline, pramipexole, and ropinirole but not levodopa, and gastrointestinal symptoms, warranting further research on the effect of anti-PD medication on microbial changes and gastrointestinal function.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2021,Sebastiaan P van Kessel; Petri Auvinen; Filip Scheperjans; Sahar El Aidy
33617267,Prebiotic Lactulose Ameliorates the Cognitive Deficit in Alzheimer's Disease Mouse Model through Macroautophagy and Chaperone-Mediated Autophagy Pathways.,"Lactulose, as a prebiotic, can be utilized by human gut microbiota and stimulate their growth. Although microbiota modulation has become an emerging approach to manage many diseases and can be achieved by the administration of prebiotics, fewer investigations have been carried out on the therapeutic mechanism of lactulose. Two trehalose analogs, lactulose and melibiose, were identified as having a neuroprotective effect in polyglutamine and Parkinson disease models. In this study, we examined lactulose and melibiose in a mouse primary hippocampal neuronal culture under the toxicity of oligomeric Aβ<sub>25-35</sub>. Lactulose was further tested in vivo because its effective concentration is lower than that of melibiose. Lactulose and trehalose were applied individually to mice before a bilateral intrahippocampal CA1 injection of oligomeric Aβ<sub>25-35</sub>. The administration of lactulose and trehalose attenuated the short-term memory and the learning retrieval of Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice. From a pathological analysis, we found that the pretreatment of lactulose and trehalose decreased neuroinflammation and increased the levels of the autophagic pathways. These results suggest that the neuroprotective effects of both lactulose and trehalose are achieved through anti-inflammation and autophagy. In addition, lactulose was better than trehalose in the enhancement of the synaptic protein expression level in AD mice. Therefore, lactulose could potentially be developed into a preventive and/or therapeutic disaccharide for AD.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2021,Yan-Suan Lee; Dar-Ming Lai; Hei-Jen Huang; Guey-Jen Lee-Chen; Ching-Hwa Chang; Hsiu Mei Hsieh-Li; Guan-Chiun Lee
34025392,Probiotic Supplementation Facilitates Recovery of 6-OHDA-Induced Motor Deficit via Improving Mitochondrial Function and Energy Metabolism.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with progressive impairment of motor and non-motor functions in aging people. Overwhelming evidence indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction is a central factor in PD pathophysiology, which impairs energy metabolism. While, several other studies have shown probiotic supplementations to improve host energy metabolism, alleviate the disease progression, prevent gut microbiota dysbiosis and alter commensal bacterial metabolites. But, whether probiotic and/or prebiotic supplementation can affect energy metabolism and cause the impediment of PD progression remains poorly characterized. Therefore, we investigated 8-weeks supplementation effects of probiotic [<i>Lactobacillus salivarius</i> subsp. <i>salicinius</i> AP-32 (AP-32)], residual medium (RM) obtained from the AP-32 culture medium, and combination of AP-32 and RM (A-RM) on unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced PD rats. We found that AP-32, RM and A-RM supplementation induced neuroprotective effects on dopaminergic neurons along with improved motor functions in PD rats. These effects were accompanied by significant increases in mitochondrial activities in the brain and muscle, antioxidative enzymes level in serum, and altered SCFAs profile in fecal samples. Importantly, the AP-32 supplement restored muscle mass along with improved motor function in PD rats, and produced the best results among the supplements. Our results demonstrate that probiotic AP-32 and A-RM supplementations can recover energy metabolism via increasing SCFAs producing and mitochondria function. This restoring of mitochondrial function in the brain and muscles with improved energy metabolism might additionally be potentiated by ROS suppression by the elevated generation of antioxidants, and which finally leads to facilitated recovery of 6-OHDA-induced motor deficit. Taken together, this work demonstrates that probiotic AP-32 supplementation could be a potential candidate for alternate treatment strategy to avert PD progression.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2021,Bira Arumndari Nurrahma; Shu-Ping Tsao; Chieh-Hsi Wu; Tu-Hsueh Yeh; Pei-Shan Hsieh; Binar Panunggal; Hui-Yu Huang
35127723,Human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells Improve Locomotor Function in Parkinson's Disease Mouse Model Through Regulating Intestinal Microorganisms.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder characterized by loss of neurons that synthesize dopamine, and subsequent impaired movement. Umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) exerted neuroprotection effects in a rodent model of PD. However, the mechanism underlying UC-MSC-generated neuroprotection was not fully elucidated. In the present study, we found that intranasal administration of UC-MSCs significantly alleviated locomotor deficits and rescued dopaminergic neurons by inhibiting neuroinflammation in a PD mouse model induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP, a toxic agent which selectively destroys nigrostriatal neurons but does not affect dopaminergic neurons elsewhere). Furthermore, UC-MSC treatment altered gut microbiota composition characterized by decreased phylum Proteobacteria, class Gammaproteobacteria, family Enterobacteriaceae, and genus <i>Escherichia-Shigella</i>. In addition, the neurotransmitter dopamine in the striatum and 5-hydroxytryptamine in the colon were also modulated by UC-MSCs. Meanwhile, UC-MSCs significantly maintained intestinal goblet cells, which secrete mucus as a mechanical barrier against pathogens. Furthermore, UC-MSCs alleviate the level of TNF-α and IL-6 as well as the conversion of NF-κB expression in the colon, indicating that inflammatory responses were blocked by UC-MSCs. PICRUSt showed that some pathways including bacterial invasion of epithelial cells, fluorobenzoate degradation, and pathogenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> infection were significantly reversed by UC-MSCs. These data suggest that the beneficial effects were detected following UC-MSC intranasal transplantation in MPTP-treated mice. There is a possible neuroprotective role of UC-MSCs in MPTP-induced PD mice by cross talk between the brain and gut.",Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,2021,Zhengqin Sun; Ping Gu; Hongjun Xu; Wei Zhao; Yongjie Zhou; Luyang Zhou; Zhongxia Zhang; Wenting Wang; Rui Han; Xiqing Chai; Shengjun An
34896331,Sodium butyrate attenuates rotenone-induced toxicity by activation of autophagy through epigenetically regulating PGC-1α expression in PC12 cells.,"Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are considered the key molecular link between gut microbiota and pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the role of SCFAs in PD pathogenesis is controversial. Autophagy is important for the degradation of α-synuclein, which is critical to the development of PD. However, whether SCFAs can regulate autophagy in PD remains unknown. We aimed to investigate the role of SCFAs and explore the potential mechanisms in rat dopaminergic PC12 cells treated with rotenone. Expression levels of α-synuclein, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta (LC3B)-II were detected by Western blot. Histone acetylation levels at PGC-1α promoter region were measured using chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (ChIP-qPCR). Among the three SCFAs, sodium butyrate (NaB) protected against rotenone-induced toxicity. NaB activated autophagy pathway and reduced rotenone-induced α-synuclein expression through the activation of autophagy. Notably, NaB activated autophagy pathway through upregulating PGC-1α expression. More importantly, NaB promoted the levels of histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9Ac) and histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27Ac) at PGC-1α promoter region, indicating that NaB promotes PGC-1α expression via histone acetylation modification. In conclusion, NaB can protect against rotenone-induced toxicity through activation of the autophagy pathway by upregulating PGC-1α expression via epigenetic modification.",Brain research,2022,Yi Zhang; Shaoqing Xu; Yiwei Qian; Xiaoqin He; Chengjun Mo; Xiaodong Yang; Qin Xiao
34768765,Gastric <i>Helicobacter suis</i> Infection Partially Protects against Neurotoxicity in A 6-OHDA Parkinson's Disease Mouse Model.,"The exact etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) remains largely unknown, but more and more research suggests the involvement of the gut microbiota. Interestingly, idiopathic PD patients were shown to have at least a 10 times higher prevalence of <i>Helicobacter suis</i> (<i>H. suis</i>) DNA in gastric biopsies compared to control patients. <i>H. suis</i> is a zoonotic <i>Helicobacter</i> species that naturally colonizes the stomach of pigs and non-human primates but can be transmitted to humans. Here, we investigated the influence of a gastric <i>H. suis</i> infection on PD disease progression through a 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) mouse model. Therefore, mice with either a short- or long-term <i>H. suis</i> infection were stereotactically injected with 6-OHDA in the left striatum and sampled one week later. Remarkably, a reduced loss of dopaminergic neurons was seen in the <i>H. suis/</i>6-OHDA groups compared to the control/6-OHDA groups. Correspondingly, motor function of the <i>H. suis</i>-infected 6-OHDA mice was superior to that in the non-infected 6-OHDA mice. Interestingly, we also observed higher expression levels of antioxidant genes in brain tissue from <i>H. suis</i>-infected 6-OHDA mice, as a potential explanation for the reduced 6-OHDA-induced cell loss. Our data support an unexpected neuroprotective effect of gastric <i>H. suis</i> on PD pathology, mediated through changes in oxidative stress.",International journal of molecular sciences,2021,Helena Berlamont; Arnout Bruggeman; Eva Bauwens; Charysse Vandendriessche; Elien Clarebout; Junhua Xie; Sofie De Bruyckere; Griet Van Imschoot; Elien Van Wonterghem; Richard Ducatelle; Patrick Santens; Annemieke Smet; Freddy Haesebrouck; Roosmarijn E Vandenbroucke
35144237,"Mediterranean diet adherence, gut microbiota, and Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease risk: A systematic review.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are the two most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases, both without prevention or cure. The Mediterranean diet (MeDi) may be neuroprotective by modulating gut microbiota. We aimed to assess the effects of adherence to MeDi on the gut microbiota in relation to AD or PD risk. A search from inception to November 2020 was conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, Web of Science, Global Health, Biological Abstracts, and Grey Literature Report databases. Two searches were conducted: 1) (MeDi or Microbiota) and (PD or AD) and 2) MeDi and microbiota. Inclusion criteria for papers were specified prior to review. Of 4672 studies identified, 64 were eligible for inclusion. These studies were divided into five groups: MeDi and AD risk (n = 4), MeDi and PD risk (n = 2), MeDi and microbial composition or metabolomics (n = 21), AD and microbial composition or metabolomics (n = 7), and PD and microbial composition or metabolomics (n = 30). Adherence to the MeDi was associated with a lower risk of AD and PD development. Eight genera and two species of bacteria had an inverse relationship with MeDi and AD, and one family, eight genera and three species of bacteria had an inverse relationship with MeDi and PD. More studies are needed to investigate if MeDi, gut microbiota, and neurodegeneration are causally related.",Journal of the neurological sciences,2022,Rebecca J Solch; Julia O Aigbogun; Andrew G Voyiadjis; Grant M Talkington; Revonda M Darensbourg; Samantha O'Connell; Keith M Pickett; Sarah R Perez; Demetrius M Maraganore
36280322,Human gut microbiota and Parkinson's disease.,"The bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain has come up very fascinating in recent years. Many studies have reported that the onset of gastrointestinal issues appears long before the actual manifestation of Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms. Disturbances in the gut-brain axis have been found to be linked with PD. PD-linked neuropathological changes in the enteric nervous system and significant alteration of gut microbiota suggest a vital role of gut microbiota in PD pathogenesis. Studies have also suggested that aggregation of α-synuclein, one of the major proteins associated with PD neuropathology, might start from the gut and move to the central nervous system (CNS) through the vagus nerve and olfactory bulb. Inflammation in the gut has been suggested to be associated with PD initiation and progression. The flushing out of healthy gut microbiota and replacing with pathogens induces gut inflammation and promotes neuroinflammation in the CNS. Therefore, it is intriguing to understand the mechanism of gut-brain communications associated with the development of PD. This review sheds light on the PD pathology, the gut dysbiosis that is associated with PD and its medications, altered gene expression, pathways and microbial metabolites during PD.",Progress in molecular biology and translational science,2022,Archana Pant; Krishna Singh Bisht; Swati Aggarwal; Tushar Kanti Maiti
36087572,Probiotics for constipation and gut microbiota in Parkinson's disease.,"Constipation is one of the common non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease that significantly impacts patient quality of life. Probiotics supplementation may improve constipation symptoms, but its effect on the gut microbiota population is unclear.In this randomized controlled study, 46 PD patients with constipation according to Rome Ⅲ criteria were recruited. The number of complete bowel movements per week, degree of defecation effort, Bristol stool Scale (BSS), Patient Assessment of Constipation symptom (PAC-SYM) and Patient assessment of constipation quality of life questionnaire (PAC-QOL) were collected pre- and post-intervention to evaluate the constipation symptoms. In addition, fresh feces of subjects before and after intervention and healthy controls were collected for 16s rRNA gene V3-V4 region sequencing to compare bacterial flora differences.Compared with the control group, the treatment group increased the average number of complete bowel movements per week (1.09 ± 1.24 vs. 0.04 ± 0.64, P &lt; 0.001). Probiotics supplementation reduced the BSS score (0.65 ± 0.93 vs. -0.17 ± 0.94, P = 0.004), PAC-SYM score (4.09 ± 6.31 vs. -1.83 ± 4.14, P &lt; 0.001), PAC-QOL score (10.65 ± 16.53 vs. 0.57 ± 12.82, P = 0.042), and degree of defecation effort score (1.00 ± 0.80 vs. 0.00 ± 0.30, P &lt; 0.001). The improvement rate of constipation in the probiotics group was significantly higher than that in the control group (52.2% vs. 8.7%, P = 0.001). PD patients showed intestinal flora disorders compared to healthy controls.

35464431,"Gut Microbiota Interact With the Brain Through Systemic Chronic Inflammation: Implications on Neuroinflammation, Neurodegeneration, and Aging.","It has been noticed in recent years that the unfavorable effects of the gut microbiota could exhaust host vigor and life, yet knowledge and theory are just beginning to be established. Increasing documentation suggests that the microbiota-gut-brain axis not only impacts brain cognition and psychiatric symptoms but also precipitates neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). How the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a machinery protecting the central nervous system (CNS) from the systemic circulation, allows the risky factors derived from the gut to be translocated into the brain seems paradoxical. For the unique anatomical, histological, and immunological properties underpinning its permeable dynamics, the BBB has been regarded as a biomarker associated with neural pathogenesis. The BBB permeability of mice and rats caused by GM dysbiosis raises the question of how the GM and its metabolites change BBB permeability and causes the brain pathophysiology of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration (NF&ND) and brain aging, a pivotal multidisciplinary field tightly associated with immune and chronic systemic inflammation. If not all, gut microbiota-induced systemic chronic inflammation (GM-SCI) mainly refers to excessive gut inflammation caused by gut mucosal immunity dysregulation, which is often influenced by dietary components and age, is produced at the interface of the intestinal barrier (IB) or exacerbated after IB disruption, initiates various common chronic diseases along its dispersal routes, and eventually impairs BBB integrity to cause NF&ND and brain aging. To illustrate the immune roles of the BBB in pathophysiology affected by inflammatory or ""leaky"" IB resulting from GM and their metabolites, we reviewed the selected publications, including the role of the BBB as the immune barrier, systemic chronic inflammation and inflammation influences on BBB permeability, NF&ND, and brain aging. To add depth to the bridging role of systemic chronic inflammation, a plausible mechanism indispensable for BBB corruption was highlighted; namely, BBB maintenance cues are affected by inflammatory cytokines, which may help to understand how GM and its metabolites play a major role in NF&ND and aging.",Frontiers in immunology,2022,Yi Mou; Yu Du; Lixing Zhou; Jirong Yue; Xianliang Hu; Yixin Liu; Sao Chen; Xiufang Lin; Gongchang Zhang; Hengyi Xiao; Birong Dong
36293176,The Interplay between Gut Microbiota and Parkinson's Disease: Implications on Diagnosis and Treatment.,"The bidirectional interaction between the gut microbiota (GM) and the Central Nervous System, the so-called gut microbiota brain axis (GMBA), deeply affects brain function and has an important impact on the development of neurodegenerative diseases. In Parkinson's disease (PD), gastrointestinal symptoms often precede the onset of motor and non-motor manifestations, and alterations in the GM composition accompany disease pathogenesis. Several studies have been conducted to unravel the role of dysbiosis and intestinal permeability in PD onset and progression, but the therapeutic and diagnostic applications of GM modifying approaches remain to be fully elucidated. After a brief introduction on the involvement of GMBA in the disease, we present evidence for GM alterations and leaky gut in PD patients. According to these data, we then review the potential of GM-based signatures to serve as disease biomarkers and we highlight the emerging role of probiotics, prebiotics, antibiotics, dietary interventions, and fecal microbiota transplantation as supportive therapeutic approaches in PD. Finally, we analyze the mutual influence between commonly prescribed PD medications and gut-microbiota, and we offer insights on the involvement also of nasal and oral microbiota in PD pathology, thus providing a comprehensive and up-to-date overview on the role of microbial features in disease diagnosis and treatment.",International journal of molecular sciences,2022,Angelica Varesi; Lucrezia Irene Maria Campagnoli; Foroogh Fahmideh; Elisa Pierella; Marcello Romeo; Giovanni Ricevuti; Marchesi Nicoletta; Salvatore Chirumbolo; Alessia Pascale
35246670,Inflammation and immune dysfunction in Parkinson disease.,"Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects peripheral organs as well as the central nervous system and involves a fundamental role of neuroinflammation in its pathophysiology. Neurohistological and neuroimaging studies support the presence of ongoing and end-stage neuroinflammatory processes in PD. Moreover, numerous studies of peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid from patients with PD suggest alterations in markers of inflammation and immune cell populations that could initiate or exacerbate neuroinflammation and perpetuate the neurodegenerative process. A number of disease genes and risk factors have been identified as modulators of immune function in PD and evidence is mounting for a role of viral or bacterial exposure, pesticides and alterations in gut microbiota in disease pathogenesis. This has led to the hypothesis that complex gene-by-environment interactions combine with an ageing immune system to create the 'perfect storm' that enables the development and progression of PD. We discuss the evidence for this hypothesis and opportunities to harness the emerging immunological knowledge from patients with PD to create better preclinical models with the long-term goal of enabling earlier identification of at-risk individuals to prevent, delay and more effectively treat the disease.",Nature reviews.

34996879,Association of Fecal and Plasma Levels of Short-Chain Fatty Acids With Gut Microbiota and Clinical Severity in Patients With Parkinson Disease.,"Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are gut microbial metabolites that promote the disease process in a rodent model of Parkinson disease (PD), but fecal levels of SCFAs in patients with PD are reduced. Simultaneous assessments of fecal and plasma SCFA levels, and their interrelationships with the PD disease process, are scarce. We aimed to compare fecal and plasma levels of different SCFA subtypes in patients with PD and healthy controls to delineate their interrelations and link to gut microbiota changes and clinical severity of PD.A cohort of 96 patients with PD and 85 controls were recruited from National Taiwan University Hospital. Fecal and plasma concentrations of SCFAs were measured using chromatography and mass spectrometry. Gut microbiota was analyzed using metagenomic shotgun sequencing. Body mass index and medical comorbidities were evaluated and dietary information was obtained using a food frequency questionnaire. To assess motor and cognitive impairment, we used the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) and the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE).Compared with controls, patients with PD had lower fecal but higher plasma concentrations of acetate, propionate, and butyrate. After adjustment for age, sex, disease duration, and anti-PD medication dosage, MDS-UPDRS part III motor scores correlated with reduced fecal levels of acetate (ρ = -0.37, <i>p</i> = 0.012), propionate (ρ = -0.32, <i>p</i> = 0.036), and butyrate (ρ = -0.40, <i>p</i> = 0.004) and with increased plasma propionate concentrations (ρ = 0.26, <i>p</i> = 0.042) in patients with PD. MMSE scores negatively correlated with plasma levels of butyrate (ρ = -0.09, <i>p</i> = 0.027) and valerate (ρ = -0.032, <i>p</i> = 0.033) after adjustment for confounders. SCFAs-producing gut bacteria correlated positively with fecal levels of SCFAs in healthy controls but revealed no association in patients with PD. In the PD patient group, the abundance of proinflammatory microbes, such as <i>Clostridiales bacterium NK3B98</i> and <i>Ruminococcus sp AM07-15</i>, significantly correlated with decreased fecal levels and increased plasma levels of SCFAs, especially propionic acid.Reductions in fecal SCFAs but increased plasma SCFAs were observed in patients with PD and corelated to specific gut microbiota changes and the clinical severity of PD.This study provides Class III evidence that gut metabolite SCFAs distinguish between patients with PD and controls and are associated with disease severity in patients with PD.",Neurology,2022,Szu-Ju Chen; Chieh-Chang Chen; Hsin-Yu Liao; Ya-Ting Lin; Yu-Wei Wu; Jyh-Ming Liou; Ming-Shiang Wu; Ching-Hua Kuo; Chin-Hsien Lin
35245613,Brain-gut-microbiota axis in Parkinson's disease: A historical review and future perspective.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common degenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS) after Alzheimer's disease. In addition to the typical motor symptoms, the clinical manifestations of patients with PD include gastrointestinal symptoms, which even precede the motor symptoms. Recent research has found that the gut microbiota regulates the brain-gut axial interaction through immune, endocrine, and direct neural mechanisms, supporting the hypothesis that the pathological process of PD spreads from the gut to the brain. In this review article, we highlight the landmark findings in the field of PD, with particular attention to the brain-gut-microbiota axis. We summarize the changes and their clinical effects on the gut microbiota and metabolites observed in PD. The intestinal microbiota may contain appropriate targets for the prevention and treatment of PD. Clinical cohort studies suggest that certain intestinal microbes have protective or pathogenic effects on the progression of PD. A better understanding of the interaction between the gut-brain axis, the gut microbiota, and PD has the potential to lead to new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Animal experiments suggest that fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is helpful for treating PD, and FMT is expected to be an effective treatment for PD in the future.",Brain research bulletin,2022,Siyu Dong; Mei Sun; Chuan He; Hong Cheng
35812394,Gut Microbiota: A Novel Therapeutic Target for Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor dysfunction. Growing evidence has demonstrated that gut dysbiosis is involved in the occurrence, development and progression of PD. Numerous clinical trials have identified the characteristics of the changed gut microbiota profiles, and preclinical studies in PD animal models have indicated that gut dysbiosis can influence the progression and onset of PD <i>via</i> increasing intestinal permeability, aggravating neuroinflammation, aggregating abnormal levels of α-synuclein fibrils, increasing oxidative stress, and decreasing neurotransmitter production. The gut microbiota can be considered promising diagnostic and therapeutic targets for PD, which can be regulated by probiotics, psychobiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, postbiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, diet modifications, and Chinese medicine. This review summarizes the recent studies in PD-associated gut microbiota profiles and functions, the potential roles, and mechanisms of gut microbiota in PD, and gut microbiota-targeted interventions for PD. Deciphering the underlying roles and mechanisms of the PD-associated gut microbiota will help interpret the pathogenesis of PD from new perspectives and elucidate novel therapeutic strategies for PD.",Frontiers in immunology,2022,Manlian Zhu; Xia Liu; Yiru Ye; Xiumei Yan; Yiwen Cheng; Longyou Zhao; Feng Chen; Zongxin Ling
36408101,Interactions between gut microbiota and Parkinson's disease: The role of microbiota-derived amino acid metabolism.,"Non-motor symptoms (NMS) of Parkinson's disease (PD), such as constipation, sleep disorders, and olfactory deficits, may emerge up to 20 years earlier than motor symptoms. A series of evidence indicates that the pathology of PD may occur from the gastrointestinal tract to the brain. Numerous studies support that the gut microbiota communicates with the brain through the immune system, special amino acid metabolism, and the nervous system in PD. Recently, there is growing recognition that the gut microbiota plays a vital role in the modulation of multiple neurochemical pathways <i>via</i> the ""gut microbiota-brain axis"" (GMBA). Many gut microbiota metabolites, such as fatty acids, amino acids, and bile acids, convey signaling functions as they mediate the crosstalk between gut microbiota and host physiology. Amino acids' abundance and species alteration, including glutamate and tryptophan, may disturb the signaling transmission between nerve cells and disrupt the normal basal ganglia function in PD. Specific amino acids and their receptors are considered new potential targets for ameliorating PD. The present study aimed to systematically summarize all available evidence on the gut microbiota-derived amino acid metabolism alterations associated with PD.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2022,Wang Wang; Shujun Jiang; Chengcheng Xu; Lili Tang; Yan Liang; Yang Zhao; Guoxue Zhu
36421902,Approaching the Gut and Nasal Microbiota in Parkinson's Disease in the Era of the Seed Amplification Assays.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder often associated with pre-motor symptoms involving both gastrointestinal and olfactory tissues. PD patients frequently suffer from hyposmia, hyposalivation, dysphagia and gastrointestinal dysfunctions. During the last few years it has been speculated that microbial agents could play a crucial role in PD. In particular, alterations of the microbiota composition (dysbiosis) might contribute to the formation of misfolded α-synuclein, which is believed to be the leading cause of PD. However, while several findings confirmed that there might be an important link between intestinal microbiota alterations and PD onset, little is known about the potential contribution of the nasal microbiota. Here, we describe the latest findings on this topic by considering that more than 80% of patients with PD develop remarkable olfactory deficits in their prodromal disease stage. Therefore, the nasal microbiota might contribute to PD, eventually boosting the gut microbiota in promoting disease onset. Finally, we present the applications of the seed amplification assays to the study of the gut and olfactory mucosa of PD patients, and how they could be exploited to investigate whether pathogenic bacteria present in the gut and the nose might promote α-synuclein misfolding and aggregation.",Brain sciences,2022,Alessandra Consonni; Martina Miglietti; Chiara Maria Giulia De Luca; Federico Angelo Cazzaniga; Arianna Ciullini; Ilaria Linda Dellarole; Giuseppe Bufano; Alessio Di Fonzo; Giorgio Giaccone; Fulvio Baggi; Fabio Moda
35304983,Modifying the diet and gut microbiota to prevent and manage neurodegenerative diseases.,"The global prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease is steadily increasing due to the aging population. The lack of effective drugs against these neurodegenerative disorders makes it imperative to identify new strategies for their prevention and treatment. Recent studies have revealed that harnessing the power of the gut microbiota through modification of diet may be a valuable approach for reducing the risk, modulating the symptoms, and ameliorating the pathophysiological aspects of neurodegenerative diseases. Consuming specific dietary components can alter the prevalence of bacterial communities within the gut to a healthy enterotype, which can influence the production of beneficial metabolites by microbiota. This article focuses on several dietary components, which have been demonstrated to affect the gut microbiota-brain axis and therefore could lead to attenuation of specific pathological processes in neurodegenerative diseases. Published evidence indicates that fermented foods, including kefir, and foods that are high in bioactive polyphenols and complex carbohydrates, such as grapes, pomegranates, and seaweed, may be effective at reducing neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, neurotransmitter dysfunction, and neuronal death associated with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Even though experimental evidence supporting the protective properties of the above dietary components in these diseases is emerging, it is evident that further human clinical studies are required to conclusively establish the benefits of any suggested dietary interventions. The translational potential of such research is illustrated by the clinical success of the recently developed Alzheimer's drug, GV-971, which is a seaweed derivative that works by modulating the gut microbiota-brain axis.",Reviews in the neurosciences,2022,Ellen J Gates; Anna K Bernath; Andis Klegeris
36034698,Curcumin-driven reprogramming of the gut microbiota and metabolome ameliorates motor deficits and neuroinflammation in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder, accompanied by motor deficits as well as gastrointestinal dysfunctions. Recent studies have proved that the disturbance of gut microbiota and metabolism contributes to the pathogenesis of PD; however, the mechanisms underlying these effects have yet to be elucidated. Curcumin (CUR) has been reported to provide neuroprotective effects on neurological disorders and modulate the gut flora in intestinal-related diseases. Therefore, it is of significant interest to investigate whether CUR could exert a protective effect on PD and whether the effect of CUR is dependent on the intestinal flora and subsequent changes in metabolites.In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of CUR on a mouse model of PD induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). 16S rRNA sequencing was performed to explore the profile of the gut microbiota among controls, MPTP-treated mice and CUR-treated mice. Then, antibiotic treatment (ABX) and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiments were conducted to examine the role of intestinal microbes on the protective effects of CUR in PD mice. Furthermore, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS)-based metabolomics analysis was used to identify the landscape of the CUR-driven serum metabolome. Finally, Pearson's analysis was conducted to investigate correlations between the gut flora-metabolite axis and CUR-driven neuroprotection in PD.Our results showed that CUR intervention effectively improved motor deficits, glial cell activation, and the aggregation of α-synuclein (α-syn) in MPTP-treated mice. 16S rRNA sequencing showed elevated abundances of <i>Muribaculaceae</i>, <i>Lactobacillaceae</i>, <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> and <i>Eggerthellaceae</i> but depleted abundances of <i>Aerococcaceae</i> and <i>Staphylococcaceae</i> in CUR-treated mice when compared with MPTP mice. ABX and FMT experiments further confirmed that the gut microbiota was required for CUR-induced protection in PD mice. Serum metabolomics analysis showed that CUR notably upregulated the levels of tyrosine, methionine, sarcosine and creatine. Importantly, strong correlations were identified among crucial taxa (<i>Aerococcaceae</i>, <i>Staphylococcaceae</i>, <i>Muribaculaceae</i>, <i>Lactobacillaceae</i>, <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> and <i>Eggerthellaceae</i>), pivotal metabolites (tyrosine, methionine, sarcosine and creatine) and the motor function and pathological results of mice.

36613486,Mediterranean Diet and Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder, diagnosed on the basis of typical motor disturbances, but also characterized by the presence of non-motor symptoms, such as rapid eye movement (REM)-sleep behavior disorders, olfactory impairment, and constipation, which are often prodromal to the onset of the disease. PD is often associated with the presence of oxidative brain injury and chronic neuroinflammation, with infiltration and accumulation of peripheral immune cells that have been found in affected brain regions of PD patients. Recently, the role of the gut-brain axis in the pathogenesis of PD is getting more and more attention, and several pieces of evidence indicate alterations in the gut microbiota of PD-affected patients. Diet exerts a central role in defining the microbiota composition and different dietetic patterns can result in a higher or lower abundance of specific bacteria that, in turn, can affect gut permeability and express anti- or pro-inflammatory metabolites. In the present review, the effects of the Mediterranean diet in modulating both PD onset and its progression will be considered with a special focus on the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of this dietetic regimen as well as on its effects on the microbiota composition.",International journal of molecular sciences,2022,Marco Bisaglia

Our results indicated that <i>L. plantarum</i> DP189 increased the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxide (GSH-Px), and interleukin-10 (IL-10) and decreased the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), reactive oxygen species (ROS), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β). Moreover, <i>L. plantarum</i> DP189 reduced the α-SYN accumulation in SN. Mechanistically, <i>L. plantarum</i> DP189 activated the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2)/ARE and PGC-1α pathways and suppressed the NLRP3 inflammasome. Furthermore, fecal analysis showed that <i>L. plantarum</i> DP189 reshaped the gut microbiota in PD mice by reducing the number of pathogenic bacteria (<i>Proteobacteria</i> and <i>Actinobacteria</i>) and increased the abundance of probiotics (<i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Prevotella</i>). Our results suggested that <i>L. plantarum</i> DP189 could delay the neurodegeneration caused by the accumulation of α-SYN in the SN of PD mice via suppressing oxidative stress, repressing proinflammatory response, and modulating gut microbiota.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2022,Lei Wang; Zijian Zhao; Lei Zhao; Yujuan Zhao; Ge Yang; Chao Wang; Lei Gao; Chunhua Niu; Shengyu Li
35203645,Role of Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis in Regulating Dopaminergic Signaling.,"Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a critical role both peripherally and centrally in vital functions such as cognition, reward, satiety, voluntary motor movements, pleasure, and motivation. Optimal dopamine bioavailability is essential for normal brain functioning and protection against the development of neurological diseases. Emerging evidence shows that gut microbiota have significant roles in maintaining adequate concentrations of dopamine via intricate, bidirectional communication known as the microbiota-gut-brain axis. The vagus nerve, immune system, hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, and microbial metabolites serve as important mediators of the reciprocal microbiota-gut-brain signaling. Furthermore, gut microbiota contain intrinsic enzymatic activity that is highly involved in dopamine metabolism, facilitating dopamine synthesis as well as its metabolite breakdown. This review examines the relationship between key genera of gut microbiota such as <i>Prevotella, Bacteroides, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium,</i><i>Enterococcus,</i> and <i>Ruminococcus</i> and their effects on dopamine. The effects of gut dysbiosis on dopamine bioavailability and the subsequent impact on dopamine-related pathological conditions such as Parkinson's disease are also discussed. Understanding the role of gut microbiota in modulating dopamine activity and bioavailability both in the periphery and in the central nervous system can help identify new therapeutic targets as well as optimize available methods to prevent, delay, or restore dopaminergic deficits in neurologic and metabolic disorders.",Biomedicines,2022,Sevag Hamamah; Armin Aghazarian; Anthony Nazaryan; Andras Hajnal; Mihai Covasa
35923300,The Role of Gut Microbiota in the Progression of Parkinson's Disease and the Mechanism of Intervention by Traditional Chinese Medicine.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common degenerative disease of the nervous system that seriously affects the quality of life of the patients. The pathogenesis of PD is not yet fully clear. Previous studies have confirmed that patients with PD exhibit obvious gut microbiota imbalance, while intervention of PD by regulating the gut microbiota has become an important approach to the prevention and treatment of this disease. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been shown to be safe and effective in treating PD. It has the advantages of affecting multiple targets. Studies have shown TCM can regulate gut microbiota. However, the specific mechanism of action is still unclear. Therefore, this article will mainly discuss the association of the alteration of the gut microbiota and the incidence of PD, the advantages of TCM in treating PD, and the mechanism of regulating gut microbiota by TCM to treat PD. It will clarify the target and mechanism of TCM treating PD by acting gut microbiota and provided a novel methodology for the prevention and treatment of PD.",Neuropsychiatric disease and treatment,2022,Pengfei Huan; Li Wang; Zhuqing He; Jiancheng He
36075637,Enteric nervous system and intestinal epithelial regulation of the gut-brain axis.,"The gut-brain axis describes a bidirectional interplay within the enteric environment between the intestinal epithelium, the mucosal immune system, and the microbiota with the enteric nervous system. This interplay provides a link between exogenous environmental stimuli such as nutrient sensing, and nervous system function, as well as a mechanism of feedback from cortical and sensory centers of the brain to enteric activities. The intestinal epithelium is one of the human body's largest sources of hormones and neurotransmitters, which have critical effects on neuronal function. The influence of the gut microbiota on these processes appears to be profound; yet to date, it has been insufficiently explored. Disruption of the intestinal microbiota is linked not only to diseases in the gut but also to brain symptomatology, including neurodegenerative and behavioral disorders (Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, autism, and anxiety and/or depression). In this review we discuss the cellular wiring of the gut-brain axis, with a particular focus on the epithelial and neuronal interaction, the evidence that has led to our current understanding of the intestinal role in neurologic function, and future directions of research to unravel this important interaction in both health and allergic disease.",The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,2022,Laura R Dowling; Michael R Strazzari; Simon Keely; Gerard E Kaiko
35275534,"Investigating Casual Associations Among Gut Microbiota, Metabolites, and Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Mendelian Randomization Study.","Recent studies had explored that gut microbiota was associated with neurodegenerative diseases (including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)) through the gut-brain axis, among which metabolic pathways played an important role. However, the underlying causality remained unclear.Our study aimed to evaluate potential causal relationships between gut microbiota, metabolites, and neurodegenerative diseases through Mendelian randomization (MR) approach.We selected genetic variants associated with gut microbiota traits (N = 18,340) and gut microbiota-derived metabolites (N = 7,824) from genome-wide association studies. Summary statistics of neurodegenerative diseases were obtained from IGAP (AD, 17,008 cases; 37,154 controls), IPDGC (PD, 37,688 cases; 141,779 controls), and IALSC (ALS, 20,806 cases; 59,804 controls) respectively.Greater abundance of Ruminococcus (OR, 1.245; 95% CI, 1.103-1.405; p = 0.0004) was found significantly related to higher risk of ALS. Besides, our study found suggestive associations of Actinobacteria, Lactobacillaceae, Faecalibacterium, Ruminiclostridium, and Lachnoclostridium with AD, of Lentisphaerae, Lentisphaeria, Oxalobacteraceae, Victivallales, Bacillales, Eubacteriumhalliigroup, Anaerostipes, and Clostridiumsensustricto1 with PD, and of Lachnospira, Fusicatenibacter, Catenibacterium, and Ruminococcusgnavusgroup with ALS. Our study also revealed suggestive associations between 12 gut microbiome-dependent metabolites and neurodegenerative diseases. Glutamine was related to lower risk of AD. For the serotonin pathway, serotonin was found as a protective factor of PD, while kynurenine as a risk factor for ALS.Our study firstly applied a two-sample MR approach to detect causal relationships among gut microbiota, gut metabolites, and neurodegenerative diseases. Our findings may provide new targets for treatments and may offer valuable insights for further studies on the underlying mechanisms.",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2022,Jing Ning; Shu-Yi Huang; Shi-Dong Chen; Ya-Ru Zhang; Yu-Yuan Huang; Jin-Tai Yu
36126853,Role of gut microbiota-derived branched-chain amino acids in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease: An animal study.,"Neuroinflammation caused by the disorder of gut microbiota and its metabolites is associated with the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Thus, it is necessary to identify certain molecules derived from gut microbiota to verify whether they could become intervention targets for the treatment of PD. The branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), as a common dietary supplement, could modulate brain function. Herein, we investigated the longitudinal shifts of microbial community in mice treated with rotenone for 0, 3 and 4 weeks by 16S rRNA gene sequencing to identify the microbial markers at different PD stages. Serum BCAAs were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Then, rotenone-induced mice were given a high BCAA diet to evaluate the motor and non-motor functions, dopaminergic neuron loss, and inflammation levels. Using a PD mouse model, we discovered that during PD progression, the alterations of gut microbiota compositions led to the peripheral decrease of BCAAs. Based on the serum lipopolysaccharide binding protein concentrations and the levels of pro-inflammatory factors (including tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin [IL]-1β, and IL-6) in the colon and substantia nigra, we found that the high BCAA diet could attenuate the inflammatory levels in PD mice, and reverse motor and non-motor dysfunctions and dopaminergic neuron impairment. Together, our results emphasize the dynamic changes of gut microbiota and BCAA metabolism and propose a novel strategy for PD therapy: a high BCAA diet intervention could improve PD progression by regulating the levels of inflammation.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2022,Zhenzhen Yan; Fan Yang; Linlin Sun; Jing Yu; Lina Sun; Yao Si; Lifen Yao
35456966,Biomarker of Neuroinflammation in Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is caused by abnormal accumulation of α-synuclein in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra, which subsequently causes motor symptoms. Neuroinflammation plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration in PD. This neuroinflammatory neurodegeneration involves the activation of microglia, upregulation of proinflammatory factors, and gut microbiota. In this review, we summarized the recent findings on detection of PD by using inflammatory biomarkers, such as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α; regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and presumably secreted (RANTES) and high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hsCRP); and radiotracers such as [11C]PK11195 and [18F]-FEPPA, as well as by monitoring disease progression and the treatment response. Many PD-causing mutations in <i>SNCA</i>, <i>LRRK2</i>, <i>PRKN</i>, <i>PINK1</i>, and <i>DJ-1</i> are also associated with neuroinflammation. Several anti-inflammatory medications, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), inhibitors of TNF-α and NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), agonists of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), and steroids, have demonstrated neuroprotective effects in in vivo or in vitro PD models.

36334596,The intestinal barrier in disorders of the central nervous system.,"The intestinal barrier, which primarily consists of a mucus layer, an epithelial barrier, and a gut vascular barrier, has a crucial role in health and disease by facilitating nutrient absorption and preventing the entry of pathogens. The intestinal barrier is in close contact with gut microbiota on its luminal side and with enteric neurons and glial cells on its tissue side. Mounting evidence now suggests that the intestinal barrier is compromised not only in digestive disorders, but also in disorders of the central nervous system (CNS), such as Parkinson's disease, autism spectrum disorder, depression, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease. After providing an overview of the structure and functions of the intestinal barrier, we review existing preclinical and clinical studies supporting the notion that intestinal barrier dysfunction is present in neurological, neurodevelopmental, and psychiatric disorders. On the basis of this evidence, we discuss the mechanisms that possibly link gut barrier dysfunction and CNS disorders and the potential impact that evaluating enteric barriers in brain disorders could have on clinical practice, in terms of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, in the near future.",The lancet.

35931717,Specific gut microbiota alterations in essential tremor and its difference from Parkinson's disease.,"Essential tremor (ET) is the most common movement disorder and share overlapping symptoms with Parkinson's disease (PD), making differential diagnosis challenging. Gut dysbiosis is regarded crucial in the pathogenesis of PD. Since ET patients also has comorbidity in gastrointestinal disorders, the relationship between gut microbiota and ET really worth investigating and may help distinguishing ET from PD. Fecal samples from 54 ET, 67 de novo PD and 54 normal controls (NC) were collected for 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR. ET showed lower species richness (Chao1 index) than NC and PD. ET was with Bacteroides-dominant enterotype, while PD was with Ruminococcus-dominant enterotype. Compared with NC, 7 genera were significantly reduced in ET, 4 of which (Ruminococcus, Romboutsia, Mucispirillum, and Aeromonas) were identified to be distinctive with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.705. Compared to PD, 26 genera were found significantly different from ET, 4 of which (Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Phascolarctobacterium, and Lachnospira) were found distinguishable with an AUC of 0.756. Clinical association results indicated that Proteus was associated with disease severity (TETRAS) of ET, while Klebsiella was linked to depression and anxiety in ET. Functional predictions revealed that 4 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways were altered in ET. This study reveals gut dysbiosis in ET and it provides new insight into the pathogenesis of ET and helps distinguishing ET from PD.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2022,Pingchen Zhang; Pei Huang; Juanjuan Du; Yixi He; Jin Liu; Guiying He; Shishuang Cui; Weishan Zhang; Gen Li; Shengdi Chen
35422756,Gut-Derived Sterile Inflammation and Parkinson's Disease.,"The etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) is unknown, but evidence is increasing that there is a prominent inflammatory component to the illness. Epidemiological, genetic, and preclinical evidence support a role for gut-derived sterile inflammation. Pro-inflammatory bacteria are over-represented in the PD gut microbiota. There is evidence for decreased gut barrier function and leak of bacterial antigen across the gut epithelium with sub-mucosal inflammation and systemic exposure to the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide. Preclinical evidence supports these clinical findings and suggests that systemic inflammation can affect the CNS through vagal pathways or the systemic circulation. We will review recent preclinical and clinical evidence to support this mechanism and suggest possible treatments directed at the gut-brain axis.",Frontiers in neurology,2022,Kathleen M Shannon

No associations were found between metabolite features and within-PD clinical variables. The results suggest alterations in serum metabolite profiles in PD, and the results of correlation analysis between metabolite features and microbiota suggest that several bacterial taxa are associated with altered lipid and energy metabolism in PD.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2022,Pedro A B Pereira; Drupad K Trivedi; Justin Silverman; Ilhan Cem Duru; Lars Paulin; Petri Auvinen; Filip Scheperjans
36359864,Rifaximin Modifies Gut Microbiota and Attenuates Inflammation in Parkinson's Disease: Preclinical and Clinical Studies.,"Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) exhibit distinct gut microbiota, which may promote gut-derived inflammation. Rifaximin is a nonabsorbable antibiotic that can modify gut microbiota. The present study investigated the effect of rifaximin on gut microbiota and inflammation status in PD. The study examined the effect of long-term rifaximin treatment on in vivo transgenic PD mice (MitoPark) and short-term rifaximin treatment on patients with PD. Rifaximin treatment caused a significant change in gut microbiota in the transgenic PD mice; in particular, it reduced the relative abundance of <i>Prevotellaceae UCG-001</i> and increased the relative abundance of <i>Bacteroides</i>, <i>Muribaculum</i>, and <i>Lachnospiraceae UCG-001</i>. Rifaximin treatment attenuated serum interleukin-1β, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α, claudin-5 and occludin, which indicated the reduction of systemic inflammation and the protection of the blood-brain barrier integrity. The rifaximin-treated MitoPark mice exhibited better motor and memory performance than did the control mice, with lower microglial activation and increased neuronal survival in the hippocampus. In the patients with PD, 7-day rifaximin treatment caused an increase in the relative abundance of <i>Flavonifractor</i> 6 months after treatment, and the change in plasma proinflammatory cytokine levels was negatively associated with the baseline plasma interleukin-1α level. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that rifaximin exerted a neuroprotective effect on the transgenic PD mice by modulating gut microbiota. We observed that patients with higher baseline inflammation possibly benefited from rifaximin treatment. With consideration for the tolerability and safety of rifaximin, randomized controlled trials should investigate the disease-modification effect of long-term treatment on select patients with PD.",Cells,2022,Chien-Tai Hong; Lung Chan; Kai-Yun Chen; Hsun-Hua Lee; Li-Kai Huang; Yu-Chen S H Yang; Yun-Ru Liu; Chaur-Jong Hu
36467550,Curcumin Regulates Gut Microbiota and Exerts a Neuroprotective Effect in the MPTP Model of Parkinson's Disease.,"The experiment aimed to explore the effects of curcumin on motor impairment, dopamine neurons, and gut microbiota in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mice model.Mice were randomly assigned to six groups: normal control group, solvent control group, MPTP group, curcumin-low-dose group (40 mg/kg), curcumin-medium-dose group (80 mg/kg), and curcumin-high-dose group (160 mg/kg). After 14 days, each group of mice was subjected to the pole text, the hanging test, and the open-field test. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunohistochemistry was used to observe the survival of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons. Moreover, ultrastructural changes were observed with a transmission electron microscope in mice striatal tissue cells. Then, 16S rRNA was used to assess changes in the gut microbiota.(1) Each dose of curcumin reduced pole climbing time and increased suspension score and total distance moved dose-dependently. (2) All curcumin groups improved cell wrinkling and vacuolar degeneration, increased the number of TH positives, improved cell survival, and the higher the dose of curcumin, the better the effect. (3) There were differences in microbiota composition and a relative abundance among the groups. The relative abundance of <i>Patescibacteria</i>, <i>Proteobacteria</i>, and <i>Verrucomicrobia</i> was higher in the MPTP group. The relative abundance of <i>Patescibacteria</i>, <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i>, <i>Enterococcaceae</i> all decreased in all curcumin groups. In addition, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways showed a reduction in the superpathway of N-acetylneuraminate degradation after medium- and high-dose curcumin administration.Curcumin regulates gut microbiota and exerts a neuroprotective effect in the MPTP mice model. This preliminary study demonstrates the therapeutic potential of curcumin for Parkinson's disease, providing clues for microbially targeted therapies for Parkinson's disease.",Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,2022,Hong Zhu; Houwen Zhang; Bonan Hou; Bin Xu; Liting Ji; You Wu
36362150,Mucosal Immunity and the Gut-Microbiota-Brain-Axis in Neuroimmune Disease.,"Recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have opened the door to a wellspring of information regarding the composition of the gut microbiota. Leveraging NGS technology, early metagenomic studies revealed that several diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, autism, and myalgic encephalomyelitis, are characterized by alterations in the diversity of gut-associated microbes. More recently, interest has shifted toward understanding how these microbes impact their host, with a special emphasis on their interactions with the brain. Such interactions typically occur either systemically, through the production of small molecules in the gut that are released into circulation, or through signaling via the vagus nerves which directly connect the enteric nervous system to the central nervous system. Collectively, this system of communication is now commonly referred to as the gut-microbiota-brain axis. While equally important, little attention has focused on the causes of the alterations in the composition of gut microbiota. Although several factors can contribute, mucosal immunity plays a significant role in shaping the microbiota in both healthy individuals and in association with several diseases. The purpose of this review is to provide a brief overview of the components of mucosal immunity that impact the gut microbiota and then discuss how altered immunological conditions may shape the gut microbiota and consequently affect neuroimmune diseases, using a select group of common neuroimmune diseases as examples.",International journal of molecular sciences,2022,Kathryn G Sterling; Griffin Kutler Dodd; Shatha Alhamdi; Peter G Asimenios; Ruben K Dagda; Kenny L De Meirleir; Dorothy Hudig; Vincent C Lombardi
35730414,The role of nutrition on Parkinson's disease: a systematic review.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) in elderly patients is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease. The pathogenesis of PD is associated with dopaminergic neuron degeneration of the substantia nigra in the basal ganglia, causing classic motor symptoms. Oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation have been identified as possible pathways in laboratory investigations. Nutrition, a potentially versatile factor from all environmental factors affecting PD, has received intense research scrutiny.A systematic search was conducted in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and WEB OF SCIENCE databases from 2000 until the present. Only randomized clinical trials (RCTs), observational case-control studies, and follow-up studies were included.We retrieved fifty-two studies that met the inclusion criteria. Most selected studies investigated the effects of malnutrition and the Mediterranean diet (MeDiet) on PD incidence and progression. Other investigations contributed evidence on the critical role of microbiota, vitamins, polyphenols, dairy products, coffee, and alcohol intake.There are still many concerns regarding the association between PD and nutrition, possibly due to underlying genetic and environmental factors. However, there is a body of evidence revealing that correcting malnutrition, gut microbiota, and following the MeDiet reduced the onset of PD and reduced clinical progression. Other factors, such as polyphenols, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and coffee intake, can have a potential protective effect. Conversely, milk and its accessory products can increase PD risk. Nutritional intervention is essential for neurologists to improve clinical outcomes and reduce the disease progression of PD.",Nutritional neuroscience,2023,Vittorio Emanuele Bianchi; Laura Rizzi; Fahad Somaa
36558531,The Interaction of Polyphenols and the Gut Microbiota in Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Polyphenols are secondary metabolites of plants and play a potential role in the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases (NND) such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) due to their unique physiological functions such as acting as antioxidants, being anti-inflammatory, being neuroprotective, and promoting intestinal health. Since dietary polyphenols exist in plant foods in the form of glycosylation or esterification or are combined with polymers, they need to undergo extensive metabolism through phase I and phase II biotransformations by various intestinal enzymes, as well as metabolism by the intestinal microbiota before they can be fully absorbed. Polyphenols improve intestinal microbiota disorders by influencing the structure and function of intestinal microbiota, inducing beneficial bacteria to produce a variety of metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), promoting the secretion of hormones and neurotransmitters, and playing an important role in the prevention and treatment of NND by affecting the microbe-gut-brain axis. We review the ways in which some polyphenols can change the composition of the intestinal microbiota and their metabolites in AD or PD animal models to exert the role of slowing down the progression of NND, aiming to provide evidence for the role of polyphenols in slowing the progression of NND via the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis.",Nutrients,2022,Yuan Zhang; Wanpeng Yu; Lei Zhang; Man Wang; Wenguang Chang
36200207,Microbiota- Brain-Gut-Axis Relevance to Parkinson's Disease: Potential Therapeutic Effects of Probiotics.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common type of neurogenerative disease among middleaged and older people, characterized by aggregation of alpha-synuclein and dopaminergic neuron loss. The microbiota- gut-brain axis is a dynamic bidirectional communication network and is involved in the pathogenesis of PD. The aggregation of misfolded protein alpha-synuclein is a neuropathological characteristic of PD, originates in the gut and migrates to the central nervous system (CNS) through the vagus nerve and olfactory bulb. The change in the architecture of gut microbiota increases the level short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and other metabolites, acting on the neuroendocrine system and modulating the concentrations of gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), serotonin, and other neurotransmitters. It also alters the vagus and intestinal signalling, influencing the brain and behaviour by activating microglia and systemic cytokines. Both experimental and clinical reports indicate the role of intestinal dysbiosis and microbiota host interaction in neurodegeneration. Probiotics are live microorganisms that modify the gut microbiota in the small intestine to avoid neurological diseases. Probiotics have been shown in clinical and preclinical studies to be effective in the treatment of PD by balancing the gut microbiota. In this article, we described the role of gut-microbiota in the pathogenesis of PD. The article aims to explore the mechanistic strategy of the gut-brain axis and its relation with motor impairment and the use of probiotics to maintain gut microbial flora and prevent PD-like symptoms.",Current pharmaceutical design,2022,Khadga Raj; Shamsher Singh; Shivani Chib; Sudhanshu Mallan

The gut microbiota has been suggested to play a role in modulating PD motor and non-motor features, although the causality and mechanisms behind these proposed interactions remains largely understudied.In this study, we aimed to provide in-depth characterization of an established mouse model of PD (transgenic (TG) SNCA A53T) and experimentally address how changes to the gut microbiota impact the PD-like phenotype.We profiled the PD-like phenotype of transgenic mice through a panel of motor, GI, and behavioral tests. We then investigated how antibiotic treatment or gut microbial community transfer (via cohousing with wild-type mice) impacted the PD-like phenotype.We found that this mouse model demonstrated early (6 weeks of age) motor symptoms when compared to a wild-type control mouse strain. Transgenic mice also exhibited early GI dysfunction, as well as behavioral alterations, including reduced anxiety-like behavior, and increased depression-like and apathy-like behavior. Compared to wild-type mice, the transgenic fecal microbiota was less diverse and compositionally distinct. Interestingly, drastic alterations to the gut microbiota, through antibiotic treatment or cohousing with wild-type mice, had a minimal effect on the motor, GI, and behavioral phenotype of transgenic mice.We concluded that this mouse model effectively recapitulates motor and non-motor features of PD; however, the gut microbiota appears to exhibit a minor impact on the pathophysiology of this PD model.",Journal of Parkinson's disease,2022,Nina Radisavljevic; Mihai Cirstea; Kylynda Bauer; Christine Lo; Avril Metcalfe-Roach; Tahereh Bozorgmehr; Haggai Bar-Yoseph; B Brett Finlay

The inflammatory responses of astrocytes and microglia during parasite infection are strongly influenced by a variety of environmental factors. Although it has recently been shown that the gut microbiota influences the physiology and immunomodulation of the central nervous system in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's, the putative link in parasite-induced neuroinflammatory diseases has not been well characterized. Likewise, the central nervous system can influence the gut microbiota. In parasite infections, the gut microbiota is strongly perturbed and might influence the severity of the central nervous system inflammation response through changes in the production of bacterial metabolites.

This has given rise to the concept of the gut-brain axis and the idea of a relationship between the gut microbiota and several neurological diseases whose aetiopathogenesis is yet to be clearly defined.We review the role of the gut microbiota in the gut-brain axis and analyse those neurological diseases in which alterations in the gut microbiota have been described as a result of human studies: specifically, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, and multiple sclerosis.The body of evidence linking the gut microbiota to various neurological diseases has grown considerably. Several interesting studies show a relationship between the gut microbiota and Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer disease, neuromyelitis optica, and multiple sclerosis, whereas other controversial studies implicate it in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Many of these studies place considerable emphasis on modulation of inflammation, particularly by bacteria capable of producing short-chain fatty acids. Despite these encouraging results, many questions remain, and there is a need to demonstrate causality, determine the role of fungi or viruses, and research possible treatment through diet, probiotics, or faecal microbiota transplantation.",Neurologia,2022,F Castillo-Álvarez; M E Marzo-Sola
36018501,"Diet, Gut Microbiome, and Cognitive Decline.","An epidemic of age-associated cognitive decline, most commonly ascribed to neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, is causing healthcare costs to soar and devastating caregivers. An estimated 6.5 million Americans are living today with Alzheimer's disease, with 13.8 million cases projected by mid-century. Although genetic mutations are known to cause neurodegeneration, autosomal dominant disease is very rare and most sporadic cases can be attributed, at least in part, to modifiable risk factors.Diet is a potential modifiable risk factor in cognitive decline. Food communicates with the brain through a complex signaling web involving multiple cells, mediators and receptors. Gut-brain communication is modulated by microorganisms including bacteria, archaea, viruses, and unicellular eukaryotes, which together constitute the microbiota. Microbes not only play major roles in the digestion and fermentation of the food, providing nutrients and bioactive metabolites, but also reflect the type and amount of food consumed and food-borne toxic exposures. Food components modify the diversity and abundance of the microbial populations, maintain the integrity of the gut barrier, and regulate the passage of microbes and their metabolites into the blood stream where they modulate the immune system and communicate with body systems including the brain. This paper will focus on selected mechanisms through which interactions between diet and the gut microbiota can modify brain integrity and cognitive function with emphasis on the pathogenesis of the most common dementia, Alzheimer's disease.",Current nutrition reports,2022,Susan Ettinger
35367961,Relationship Between the Gut Microbiota and Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review.,"In recent years, scientific research on the gut microbiota and their relationship with some diseases, including neurological ones, has notably increased. As a result of these investigations, the so-called gut-brain axis arises. Despite its influence on the evolution and development of cognitive impairment, the gut-brain axis is little defined and demonstrated.To provide the best scientific evidence available on the relationship between the gut microbiota and Alzheimer's disease.Systematic and narrative review of the information generated in the last 5 years in national and international databases, in English and Spanish.Eight observational studies were selected, carried out in humans and, therefore, suitable for inclusion in this review.The results of these studies support the hypothesis that there is a relationship between the gut microbiota and cognitive disorders through the gut-brain axis. However, today, there is a substantial lack of human studies, especially clinical trials, which makes it difficult to formulate clinical recommendations on this topic.",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2022,Elisa Marina González Cordero; Miguel Angel Cuevas-Budhart; Diana Pérez Morán; Miguel Angel Trejo Villeda; Mercedes Gomez-Del-Pulgar Gª-Madrid
35890040,Gut Microbes and Neuropathology: Is There a Causal Nexus?,"The gut microbiota is a virtual organ which produces a myriad of molecules that the brain and other organs require. Humans and microbes are in a symbiotic relationship, we feed the microbes, and in turn, they provide us with essential molecules. Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes phyla account for around 80% of the total human gut microbiota, and approximately 1000 species of bacteria have been identified in the human gut. In adults, the main factors influencing microbiota structure are diet, exercise, stress, disease and medications. In this narrative review, we explore the involvement of the gut microbiota in Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis and autism, as these are such high-prevalence disorders. We focus on preclinical studies that increase the understanding of disease pathophysiology. We examine the potential for targeting the gut microbiota in the development of novel therapies and the limitations of the currently published clinical studies. We conclude that while the field shows enormous promise, further large-scale studies are required if a causal link between these disorders and gut microbes is to be definitively established.","Pathogens (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,Katherine Dinan; Timothy G Dinan
35965446,The gut microbiome and cognition in Parkinson's disease: a systematic review.,"The pathology underlying cognitive changes in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) is not well understood. In healthy older adults, gut microbiome composition has been associated with cognitive function. In people with PD, preliminary evidence suggests that cortical spreading of abnormal alpha-synuclein aggregates may be associated with cognitive impairment. As changes in the gut have been linked to PD onset and associated Lewy body pathology, an investigation of the gut microbiome and cognition in PD is warranted.To synthesise existing evidence on the relationship between the gut microbiome and cognitive function in PD.A systematic review was conducted to search for peer-reviewed articles and grey literature published to July 2021 across seven electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Scopus, Cochrane Library, ProQuest, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses). English language articles reporting the relationship between cognition and the gut microbiome in human participants with PD were considered for inclusion. Results were qualitatively synthesised and evidence quality was assessed using the QualSyst tool for quantitative studies.Five cross-sectional studies reporting the association between the gut microbiome and cognition in 395 participants with PD were included. Studies provided preliminary evidence of a relationship between cognition and gut microbiota within the <i>Bacteroidetes</i> and <i>Firmicutes</i> phyla, however, associations with specific genera were inconsistent across studies.Some species of short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria (e.g. acetate, butyrate, and propionate producers) appear to be reduced in participants with PD with cognitive impairment. More research with larger samples and more consistent methodology is needed to substantiate these findings.",Nutritional neuroscience,2023,Hayley Grant; Ryan Anderton; Natalie Gasson; Blake J Lawrence
35103734,Neuroprotection of chicoric acid in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease involves gut microbiota and TLR4 signaling pathway.,"Chicoric acid (CA), a polyphenolic acid obtained from chicory and purple coneflower (<i>Echinacea purpurea</i>), has been regarded as a nutraceutical to combat inflammation, viruses and obesity. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder, and the microbiota-gut-brain axis might be the potential mechanism in the pathogenesis and development of PD. The results obtained in this study demonstrated that oral pretreatments of CA significantly prevented the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced motor dysfunctions and death of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons along with the inhibition of glial hyperactivation and the increment in striatal neurotrophins. 16S rRNA sequence results showed that CA significantly reduced MPTP-induced microbial dysbiosis and partially restored the composition of the gut microbiota to normal, including decreased phylum <i>Bacteroidetes</i> and genera <i>Parabacteroide</i>, as well as increased phylum <i>Firmicutes</i>, genera <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Ruminiclostridium</i>. Besides, CA promoted colonic epithelial integrity and restored normal SCFA production. We also observed that proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β in the serum, striatum and colon were reduced by CA, indicating that CA prevented neuroinflammation and gut inflammation, in which the suppression of the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway might be the underlying molecular mechanism. These findings demonstrated that CA had neuroprotective effects on MPTP-induced PD mice possibly <i>via</i> modulating the gut microbiota and inhibiting inflammation throughout the brain-gut axis.",Food & function,2022,Ning Wang; Bai-Nian Feng; Bin Hu; Yu-Liang Cheng; Ya-Hui Guo; He Qian

35449203,Plasma branched-chain and aromatic amino acids correlate with the gut microbiota and severity of Parkinson's disease.,"Disturbances of circulating amino acids have been demonstrated in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, there have been no consistent results for branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and aromatic amino acids (AAAs), and related factors have not been explored. We aimed to explore plasma BCAA and AAA profiles in PD patients, and identify their correlations with clinical characteristics and the gut microbiota. Plasma BCAA (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) and AAA (tyrosine and phenylalanine) levels were measured in 106 PD patients and 114 controls. Fecal samples were collected from PD patients for microbiota sequencing and functional analysis. We found that plasma BCAAs and tyrosine were decreased in PD patients. BCAAs and AAAs were correlated with clinical characteristics and microbial taxa, and, in particular, they were negatively correlated with the Hoehn and Yahr stage. Compared with early PD patients, BCAA and AAA levels were even lower, and microbial composition was altered in advanced PD patients. Predictive functional analysis indicated that predicted genes numbers involved in BCAA biosynthesis were lower in advanced PD patients. What's more, the fecal abundances of critical genes (ilvB, ilvC, ilvD, and ilvN) involved in BCAA biosynthesis were reduced and fecal BCAA concentrations were lower in advanced PD patients. In conclusion, the disturbances of plasma BCAAs and AAAs in PD patients may be related to the gut microbiota and exacerbated with PD severity. The microbial amino acid metabolism may serve as a potential mechanistic link.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2022,Yi Zhang; Xiaoqin He; Yiwei Qian; Shaoqing Xu; Chengjun Mo; Zheng Yan; Xiaodong Yang; Qin Xiao
36243356,Emerging insights between gut microbiome dysbiosis and Parkinson's disease: Pathogenic and clinical relevance.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complicated neurodegenerative disease, of which gastrointestinal disturbance appears prior to motor symptoms. Numerous studies have shed light on the roles of gastrointestinal tract and its neural connection to brain in PD pathology. In the past decades, the fields of microbiology and neuroscience have become ever more entwined. The emergence of gut microbiome has been considered as one of the key regulators of gut-brain function. With the advent of multi-omics sequencing techniques, gut microbiome of PD patients has been shown unique characteristics. The resident gut microbiota can exert considerable effects in PD and there are suggestions of a link between gut microbiome dysbiosis and PD progression. In this review, we summarize the latest progresses of gut microbiome dysbiosis in PD pathogenesis, further highlight the clinical relevance of gut microbiota and its metabolites in both the non-motor and motor symptoms of PD. Furthermore, we draw attention to the complex interplay between gut microbiota and PD drugs, with the purpose of improving drug efficacy and prescription accordingly. Further studies at specific strain level and longitudinal prospective clinical trials using optimized methods are still needed for the development of diagnostic markers and novel therapeutic regimens for PD.",Ageing research reviews,2022,Mingxia Bi; Lijuan Feng; Jiahui He; Chang Liu; Yulin Wang; Hong Jiang; Shuang-Jiang Liu
36257595,Gut microbiota manipulation as an epilepsy treatment.,"Many studies have documented the important role of the gut microbiota (GM) in the regulation of several central nervous system (CNS) processes through the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis. This latter represents the connection between the CNS, the enteric nervous system, the gut and its microbiota through several ascending and descending pathways. The variation of the GM composition is associated with the pathogenesis and/or progression as well as severity of various neuropsychiatric/neurological diseases such as depression, autism spectrum disorder, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's diseases. Recently, changes in the bacterial composition of the GM have also been linked to epilepsy and seizures, with some studies exploring the potential role of GM in the regulation of neuronal hyperexcitability, seizure occurrence and epileptogenesis. Accordingly, there are potential novel treatments which are currently being investigated such as probiotics, prebiotics and symbiotic that may represent innovative therapeutic approaches. The aim of this review is to explore the effect of gut microbiota manipulation as a therapeutic strategy in epilepsy and the methodological challenges to design (translational) clinical trial investigating the gut microbiota.",Neurobiology of disease,2022,Luigi Francesco Iannone; Maria Gómez-Eguílaz; Carmen De Caro
35807841,Overlapping Mechanisms of Action of Brain-Active Bacteria and Bacterial Metabolites in the Pathogenesis of Common Brain Diseases.,"The involvement of the gut microbiota and the metabolites of colon-residing bacteria in brain disease pathogenesis has been covered in a growing number of studies, but comparative literature is scarce. To fill this gap, we explored the contribution of the microbiota-gut-brain axis to the pathophysiology of seven brain-related diseases (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, major depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder). In this article, we discussed changes in bacterial abundance and the metabolic implications of these changes on disease development and progression. Our central findings indicate that, mechanistically, all seven diseases are associated with a leaky gut, neuroinflammation, and over-activated microglial cells, to which gut-residing bacteria and their metabolites are important contributors. Patients show a pro-inflammatory shift in their colon microbiota, harbouring more Gram-negative bacteria containing immune-triggering lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in their cell walls. In addition, bacteria with pro-inflammatory properties (<i>Alistipes</i>, <i>Eggerthella</i>, <i>Flavonifractor</i>) are found in higher abundances, whereas lower abundances of anti-inflammatory bacteria (<i>Bifidobacterium</i>, <i>Coprococcus</i>, <i>Eucbacterium</i>, <i>Eubacterium rectale</i>, <i>Faecalibacterium</i>, <i>Faecalibacterium prasunitzii</i>, <i>Lactobacillus</i>, <i>Prevotella</i>, <i>Roseburia</i>) are reported, when compared to healthy controls. On the metabolite level, aberrant levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are involved in disease pathogenesis and are mostly found in lower quantities. Moreover, bacterial metabolites such as neurotransmitters (acetylcholine, dopamine, noradrenaline, GABA, glutamate, serotonin) or amino acids (phenylalanine, tryptophan) also play an important role. In the future, defined aberrations in the abundance of bacteria strains and altered bacterial metabolite levels could likely be possible markers for disease diagnostics and follow-ups. Moreover, they could help to identify novel treatment options, underlining the necessity for a deeper understanding of the microbiota-gut-brain axis.",Nutrients,2022,Tanja Patricia Eicher; M Hasan Mohajeri
35225349,Rethinking Parkinson Disease: Exploring Gut-Brain Interactions and the Potential Role of Exercise.,"Although Parkinson disease (PD) has traditionally been considered a disease of the central nervous system, a bidirectional communication system known as the gut-brain axis can influence PD pathogenesis. The dual-hit hypothesis proposed that PD is due to peripheral dysregulations to the gut microbiota, known as dysbiosis. Since then, further investigation has shown that there are multiple pathological sources associated with PD. However, dysbiosis plays a critical role in the disease process. Substantial evidence has identified that cardinal motor symptoms of PD and disease progression are associated with dysbiosis. In other neurodegenerative disorders, dysbiosis has been linked to cognition. Non-PD research has shown that exercise can effectively restore the gut microbiota. Likewise, exercise has become a well-established strategy to improve cognitive and motor function in PD. However, despite the interaction between the gut and brain, and the exercise benefits on gut health, no research to date has considered the effects of exercise on the gut microbiota in PD. Therefore, the purpose of this Perspective is to explore whether exercise benefits observed in PD could partly be due to restorations to the gut microbiota. First, we will review the gut-brain axis and its influence on motor and cognitive function. Next, we will outline evidence regarding exercise-induced restoration of the gut microbiota in non-PD populations. Finally, we will summarize benefits of exercise on motor-cognitive function in PD, proposing that benefits of exercise seen in PD might actually be due to restorations to the gut microbiota. By positing the gut microbiota as a moderator of exercise improvements to motor and cognitive function, we aim to provide a new perspective for physical therapists to prioritize exercise regimens for individuals with PD that can specifically restore the gut microbiota to better improve PD symptoms and prognosis.This Perspective raises awareness that dysregulations to the gut microbiota have recently been attributed to PD symptoms and pathology and that exercise can be an effective therapeutic strategy to improve gut health in individuals with PD.People with PD have been found to have reduced microbial diversity in their gut, which can play an important role in the progression of the disease. Physical therapists can design therapeutic exercises that might help improve gut health in people with PD.",Physical therapy,2022,Kaylie Zapanta; E Todd Schroeder; Beth E Fisher
36034146,The relationship between Parkinson's disease and gastrointestinal diseases.,"An increasing number of studies have provided evidence for the hypothesis that the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) may derive from the gut. Firstly, Lewy pathology can be induced in the enteric nervous system (ENS) and be transported to the central nervous system (CNS) via the vagal nerve. Secondly, the altered composition of gut microbiota causes an imbalance between beneficial and deleterious microbial metabolites which interacts with the increased gut permeability and the gut inflammation as well as the systemic inflammation. The activated inflammatory status then affects the CNS and promotes the pathology of PD. Given the above-mentioned findings, researchers start to pay attention to the connection between PD and gastrointestinal diseases including irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), microscopic colitis (MC), gastrointestinal infections, gastrointestinal neoplasms, and colonic diverticular disease (CDD). This review focuses on the association between PD and gastrointestinal diseases as well as the pathogenesis of PD from the gut.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2022,Jiaqi Zeng; Xinchan Wang; Fei Pan; Zhiqi Mao
37693045,Neuroprotective effects of an engineered <i>Escherichia coli</i> Nissle 1917 on Parkinson's disease in mice by delivering GLP-1 and modulating gut microbiota.,"Considerable evidence suggests that insulin resistance is closely linked to Parkinson's disease (PD), leading to agents aiming at treating diabetes can be regarded as new neuroprotective strategies in PD, notably glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). However, the extremely short half-life of GLP-1 due to degradation by the ubiquitous proteolytic enzyme limits its clinical application. In this study, we engineered the recombinant integrant probiotic strain <i>Escherichia coli</i> Nissle 1917 (EcN) to create a strain EcN-GLP-1 that effectively delivers the heterologous GLP-1 molecule. Subsequently, we assessed its neuroprotective effects on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mice. We demonstrated that EcN-GLP-1 treatment could improve motor deficits, increase tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons, suppress microglia and astrocyte activation, reduce brain and colon inflammation, and ameliorate colonic barrier function damaged by MPTP induction. Meanwhile, we confirmed that the oral administration of EcN-GLP-1 could restore the disturbance of gut microbiota in the MPTP-induced PD mice, by reducing the relative abundances of <i>Akkermansia</i> and <i>Oscillospira</i>, and increasing the level of <i>Prevotella</i> in the gut. These results support further development of an engineered probiotic platform in which production of GLP-1 for gut-brain disorders, such as PD.",Bioengineering & translational medicine,2023,Heng Wu; Jing Wei; Xiumiao Zhao; Ying Liu; Zhihang Chen; Kehong Wei; Jiachen Lu; Wenjie Chen; Meixiu Jiang; Shengjie Li; Tingtao Chen
36182642,Gut-oriented disease modifying therapy for Parkinson's disease.,"Neuropathology studies have shown that the pathognomonic feature of Parkinson's disease (PD), one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders, may start from the gut enteric nervous system and then spread to the central dopaminergic neurons through the gut-brain axis. With the advent of metagenomic sequencing and metabolomic analysis, a plethora of evidence has revealed different gut microbiomes and gut metabolites in patients with PD compared with unaffected controls. Currently, although dopaminergic treatments and deep brain stimulation can provide some symptomatic benefits for motor symptoms of the disease, their long-term use is problematic. A mechanism-targeted therapy to halt the neurodegeneration is lacking. The recently observed gut microenvironmental changes in the early stages of the disease play a vital role in the PD pathogenesis. Patients whose disease begins in the gut may benefit most from interventions that target the gut microenvironments. In this review, we will summarize the current studies demonstrating multifunctional roles of gut microbiota in the gut-brain axis of PD and the currently available evidence for targeting the gut microbiota as a novel approach to potential disease-modifying therapy in PD.",Journal of the Formosan Medical Association = Taiwan yi zhi,2023,Chin-Hsien Lin; Hsin-Chih Lai; Ming-Shiang Wu
35463646,"A Pilot Study Exploring the Association of Entacapone, Gut Microbiota, and the Subsequent Side Effects in Patients With Parkinson's Disease.","Entacapone, one of the most common drugs distributed among patients with Parkinson's disease, is a peripherally acting catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor that is used in addition to levodopa to control symptoms. However, there have been negative effects reported against entacapone, namely, gastrointestinal (GI) problems and drowsiness. In this pilot study, we aim to examine the hypothesis that the discomfort induced by entacapone might be originated from the shift of microbial composition by adjusting the effect of levodopa.The population in this pilot study consisted of 13 PD patients treated with levodopa only and 11 with both levodopa and entacapone. The 16S rRNA gene sequence data were processed, aligned, and categorized using the DADA2. Alpha diversity indices for Observed, Chao1, Shannon, and Simpson metrics were calculated with Phyloseq 1.32.0. Dissimilarities were calculated using unweighted unique fraction metrics (Unifrac), weighted Unifrac, and Canberra distance. Functional differences were calculated by PICRUSt2 based on the KEGG database.Results of 16S rRNA sequencing analysis showed that while entacapone did not influence the species richness, the composition of the microbial community shifted considerably. Relative abundances of bacteria related to constipation and other GI disorders also altered significantly. Functional enrichment analysis revealed changes in the metabolic activity of alanine, aspartate, and glutamate. These amino acids are related to common side effects of entacapone such as auditory hallucinations, fatigue, and nightmare.Our findings provide testable hypothesis on the cause of unpleasant side effects of entacapone, which in the long run could possibly be reduced through gut microbiota manipulation.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2022,Shih-Chen Fu; Chung-Han Lee; Yi-Chen Hsieh; Pei-Hua Wu; Sheng-Hsuan Lin; Hsiuying Wang

It is likely triggered by proinflammatory markers produced by specific gut bacteria. This review's aim is to identify gut bacterial biomarkers of Parkinson disease. A comprehensive search for original research papers on gut microbiota composition in Parkinson disease was conducted using the PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases. Research papers on intestinal permeability, nasal and oral microbiomes, and interventional studies were excluded. The yielded results were categorized into four groups: Parkinson disease vs. healthy controls; disease severity; non-motor symptoms; and clinical phenotypes. This review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA 2020 statement. A total of 51 studies met the eligibility criteria. In the Parkinson disease vs. healthy controls group, 22 bacteria were deemed potentially important. In the disease severity category, two bacteria were distinguished. In the non-motor symptoms and clinical phenotypes categories, no distinct pathogen was identified. The studies in this review report bacteria of varying taxonomic levels, which prevents the authors from reaching a clear conclusion. Future research should follow a unified methodology in order to identify potential biomarkers for Parkinson disease.",Biomedicines,2022,Julia Maya Nowak; Mateusz Kopczyński; Andrzej Friedman; Dariusz Koziorowski; Monika Figura
35677440,Gut Microbial Dysbiosis and Cognitive Impairment in Bipolar Disorder: Current Evidence.,"Recent studies have reported that the gut microbiota influences mood and cognitive function through the gut-brain axis, which is involved in the pathophysiology of neurocognitive and mental disorders, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia. These disorders have similar pathophysiology to that of cognitive dysfunction in bipolar disorder (BD), including neuroinflammation and dysregulation of various neurotransmitters (i.e., serotonin and dopamine). There is also emerging evidence of alterations in the gut microbial composition of patients with BD, suggesting that gut microbial dysbiosis contributes to disease progression and cognitive impairment in BD. Therefore, microbiota-centered treatment might be an effective adjuvant therapy for BD-related cognitive impairment. Given that studies focusing on connections between the gut microbiota and BD-related cognitive impairment are lagging behind those on other neurocognitive disorders, this review sought to explore the potential mechanisms of how gut microbial dysbiosis affects cognitive function in BD and identify potential microbiota-centered treatment.",Frontiers in pharmacology,2022,Wenyu Dai; Jieyu Liu; Yan Qiu; Ziwei Teng; Sujuan Li; Hui Yuan; Jing Huang; Hui Xiang; Hui Tang; Bolun Wang; Jindong Chen; Haishan Wu
36458227,Modulating the Gut Microbiota as a Therapeutic Intervention for Alzheimer's Disease.,"Growing evidence suggested that the change of composition and proportion of intestinal microbiota may be related to many diseases, such as irritable bowel syndrome, bipolar disorder, Parkinson's disease, as well as Alzheimer's disease. Current literature supports the fact that unbalanced gut microbial composition (gut dysbiosis) is a risk factor for AD. In our review, we briefly sum up the recent progress regarding the correlations between the gut microbiota and AD. Therapeutic interventions capable of modulating the make-up of the gut microflora may exert beneficial effects on AD, preventing or delaying the beginning of AD or counteracting its development. Additionally, well-documented approaches that can positively influence AD may exert their beneficial effects through modifying the gut microbiota. Therefore, other novel interventions which can target on gut microbiota will also be potential therapies for AD. The chances and challenges that AD is confronted with in the research field of microbiomics are also discussed in this review.",Indian journal of microbiology,2022,Mingli Liu; Ping Zhong
35076270,Parkinson's Disease Medication Alters Small Intestinal Motility and Microbiota Composition in Healthy Rats.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is known to be associated with altered gastrointestinal function and microbiota composition. To date, the effect of PD medication on the gastrointestinal function and microbiota, at the site of drug absorption, the small intestine, has not been studied, although it may represent an important confounder in reported microbiota alterations observed in PD patients. To this end, healthy (non-PD) wild-type Groningen rats were employed and treated with dopamine, pramipexole (in combination with levodopa-carbidopa), or ropinirole (in combination with levodopa-carbidopa) for 14 sequential days. Rats treated with dopamine agonists showed a significant reduction in small intestinal motility and an increase in bacterial overgrowth in the distal small intestine. Notably, significant alterations in microbial taxa were observed between the treated and vehicle groups; analogous to the changes previously reported in human PD versus healthy control microbiota studies. These microbial changes included an increase in <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Bifidobacterium</i> and a decrease in <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> and <i>Prevotellaceae</i>. Markedly, certain <i>Lactobacillus</i> species correlated negatively with levodopa levels in the systemic circulation, potentially affecting the bioavailability of levodopa. Overall, the study highlights a significant effect of PD medication intrinsically on disease-associated comorbidities, including gastrointestinal dysfunction and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, as well as the gut microbiota composition. The results urge future studies to take into account the influence of PD medication <i>per se</i> when seeking to identify microbiota-related biomarkers for PD. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder and is known to be associated with altered gastrointestinal function and microbiota composition. We previously showed that the gut bacteria harboring tyrosine decarboxylase enzymes interfere with levodopa, the main treatment for PD (S. P. van Kessel, A. K. Frye, A. O. El-Gendy, M. Castejon, A. Keshavarzian, G. van Dijk, and S. El Aidy, Nat Commun 10:310, 2019). Although PD medication could be an important confounder in the reported alterations, its effect, apart from the disease itself, on the microbiota composition or the gastrointestinal function at the site of drug absorption, the small intestine, has not been studied. The findings presented here show a significant impact of commonly prescribed PD medication on the small intestinal motility, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, and microbiota composition, irrespective of the PD. Remarkably, we observed negative associations between bacterial species harboring tyrosine decarboxylase activity and levodopa levels in the systemic circulation, potentially affecting the bioavailability of levodopa. Overall, this study shows that PD medication is an important factor in determining gastrointestinal motility and, in turn, microbiota composition and may, partly, explain the differential abundant taxa previously reported in the cross-sectional PD microbiota human studies. The results urge future studies to take into account the influence of PD medication on gut motility and microbiota composition when seeking to identify microbiota-related biomarkers for PD.",mSystems,2022,Sebastiaan P van Kessel; Amber Bullock; Gertjan van Dijk; Sahar El Aidy
36365188,Membrane Vesicles Derived from Gut Microbiota and Probiotics: Cutting-Edge Therapeutic Approaches for Multidrug-Resistant Superbugs Linked to Neurological Anomalies.,"Multidrug-resistant (MDR) superbugs can breach the blood-brain barrier (BBB), leading to a continuous barrage of pro-inflammatory modulators and induction of severe infection-related pathologies, including meningitis and brain abscess. Both broad-spectrum or species-specific antibiotics (β-lactamase inhibitors, polymyxins, vancomycin, meropenem, plazomicin, and sarecycline) and biocompatible poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles have been used to treat these infections. However, new therapeutic platforms with a broad impact that do not exert off-target deleterious effects are needed. Membrane vesicles or extracellular vesicles (EVs) are lipid bilayer-enclosed particles with therapeutic potential owing to their ability to circumvent BBB constraints. Bacteria-derived EVs (bEVs) from gut microbiota are efficient transporters that can penetrate the central nervous system. In fact, bEVs can be remodeled via surface modification and CRISPR/Cas editing and, thus, represent a novel platform for conferring protection against infections breaching the BBB. Here, we discuss the latest scientific research related to gut microbiota- and probiotic-derived bEVs, and their therapeutic modifications, in terms of regulating neurotransmitters and inhibiting quorum sensing, for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. We also emphasize the benefits of probiotic-derived bEVs to human health and propose a novel direction for the development of innovative heterologous expression systems to combat BBB-crossing pathogens.",Pharmaceutics,2022,Prakhar Srivastava; Kwang-Sun Kim
35263739,Is There Any Link between Cognitive Impairment and Gut Microbiota? A Systematic Review.,"Symptoms of cognitive impairments vary from mild without clinical manifestation to severe with advanced signs of dementia or Alzheimer's disease (AD). Growing evidence in recent years has indicated the association between the brain and gut microbiota, which has been described as the ""gut-brain axis."" This systematic review seeks to summarize the primary results from recent human and animal studies regarding the alteration of gut microbiota composition in cognitive disorders.A systematic literature search was conducted on PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases up to August 2020. The full texts of the papers were analyzed to retrieve the relevant information.Totally, 24 observational studies (14 animal and 13 human studies) were included. Most of the animal studies were performed on mouse models of AD. Human studies were conducted on patients with Parkinson's disease (3 studies), AD (4 studies), poststroke cognitive impairment patients (1 study), and patients with mild to severe cognitive impairment without mention to the cause of disease (5 studies). More recent evidence suggests that throughout aging Firmicutes and Bifidobacteria decrease but Proteobacteria increases.The gut microbiota may alter brain function or trigger various psychiatric conditions through the gut-brain axis.

35611932,Urolithins: potential biomarkers of gut dysbiosis and disease stage in Parkinson's patients.,"Gut microbiota alteration (gut dysbiosis) occurs during the onset and progression of Parkinson's disease. Gut dysbiosis biomarkers could be relevant to prodromal disease. Urolithins, anti-inflammatory metabolites produced from some dietary polyphenols by specific gut microbial ecologies (urolithin metabotypes), have been proposed as biomarkers of gut microbiota composition and functionality. However, this has not been explored in Parkinson's disease patients. The current study aimed to assess associations between urolithin metabotypes, gut dysbiosis and disease severity in Parkinson's disease patients. Participants (52 patients and 117 healthy controls) provided stool samples for microbiota sequencing and urine samples for urolithin profiling before and after consuming 30 g of walnuts for three days. Data on demographics, medication, disease duration and Hoehn and Yahr disease stage were collected. We observed a significant gradual increase of urolithin non-producers (metabotype-0) as the disease severity increased. The gut microbiome of metabotype-0 patients and patients with the greatest severity was characterized by a more altered bacterial composition, <i>i.e.</i>, increased pro-inflammatory Enterobacteriaceae and reduced protective bacteria against autoimmune and inflammatory processes, including butyrate and urolithin-producing bacteria (Lachnospiraceae members and <i>Gordonibacter</i>). Besides, their microbiome was characterized by predictive functions of lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and metabolism of glutathione, cysteine and methionine that could indirectly reflect the gut pro-inflammatory status. Urolithin detection in urine is a feasible, non-invasive and fast approach that can reflect gut microbiome dysbiosis and intestinal inflammation in Parkinson's disease patients. Our current study could provide novel strategies for improving diagnostics, and for preventing and treating disease progression in microbiota-based interventions.",Food & function,2022,María Romo-Vaquero; Emiliano Fernández-Villalba; Ana-Luisa Gil-Martinez; Lorena Cuenca-Bermejo; Juan Carlos Espín; María Trinidad Herrero; María Victoria Selma
35889124,"Nasal Microbiota, Olfactory Health, Neurological Disorders and Aging-A Review.","The nasal region is one of the distinct environments for the survival of various microbiota. The human microbial niche begins to inhabit the human body right from birth, and the microbiota survive as commensals or opportunistic pathogens throughout the life of humans in their bodies in various habitats. These microbial communities help to maintain a healthy microenvironment by preventing the attack of pathogens and being involved in immune regulation. Any dysbiosis of microbiota residing in the mucosal surfaces, such as the nasal passages, guts, and genital regions, causes immune modulation and severe infections. The coexistence of microorganisms in the mucosal layers of respiratory passage, resulting in infections due to their co-abundance and interactions, and the background molecular mechanisms responsible for such interactions, need to be considered for investigation. Additional clinical evaluations can explain the interactions among the nasal microbiota, nasal dysbiosis and neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). The respiratory airways usually act as a substratum place for the microbes and can act as the base for respiratory tract infections. The microbial metabolites and the microbes can cross the blood-brain barrier and may cause NDs, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). The scientific investigations on the potential role of the nasal microbiota in olfactory functions and the relationship between their dysfunction and neurological diseases are limited. Recently, the consequences of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in patients with neurological diseases are under exploration. The crosstalk between the gut and the nasal microbiota is highly influential, because their mucosal regions are the prominent microbial niche and are connected to the olfaction, immune regulation, and homeostasis of the central nervous system. Diet is one of the major factors, which strongly influences the mucosal membranes of the airways, gut, and lung. Unhealthy diet practices cause dysbiosis in gut microbiota and the mucosal barrier. The current review summarizes the interrelationship between the nasal microbiota dysbiosis, resulting olfactory dysfunctions, and the progression of NDs during aging and the involvement of coronavirus disease 2019 in provoking the NDs.",Microorganisms,2022,Subramanian Thangaleela; Bhagavathi Sundaram Sivamaruthi; Periyanaina Kesika; Muruganantham Bharathi; Chaiyavat Chaiyasut
36013962,"Role of the Gut-Brain Axis, Gut Microbial Composition, Diet, and Probiotic Intervention in Parkinson's Disease.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second-most prevalent neurodegenerative or neuropsychiatric disease, affecting 1% of seniors worldwide. The gut microbiota (GM) is one of the key access controls for most diseases and disorders. Disturbance in the GM creates an imbalance in the function and circulation of metabolites, resulting in unhealthy conditions. Any dysbiosis could affect the function of the gut, consequently disturbing the equilibrium in the intestine, and provoking pro-inflammatory conditions in the gut lumen, which send signals to the central nervous system (CNS) through the vagus enteric nervous system, possibly disturbing the blood-brain barrier. The neuroinflammatory conditions in the brain cause accumulation of α-syn, and progressively develop PD. An important aspect of understanding and treating the disease is access to broad knowledge about the influence of dietary supplements on GM. Probiotics are live microorganisms which, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host. Probiotic supplementation improves the function of the CNS, and improves the motor and non-motor symptoms of PD. Probiotic supplementation could be an adjuvant therapeutic method to manage PD. This review summarizes the role of GM in health, the GM-brain axis, the pathogenesis of PD, the role of GM and diet in PD, and the influence of probiotic supplementation on PD. The study encourages further detailed clinical trials in PD patients with probiotics, which aids in determining the involvement of GM, intestinal mediators, and neurological mediators in the treatment or management of PD.",Microorganisms,2022,Subramanian Thangaleela; Bhagavathi Sundaram Sivamaruthi; Periyanaina Kesika; Muruganantham Bharathi; Chaiyavat Chaiyasut
36619150,Gut Microbiota Modification via Glucagon-like Peptide-1 with Beneficial Neuroprotective Effects.,"<b>BACKGROUND</b>: In recent decades, it has been shown that the association between intestinal bacterial imbalance (dysbiosis) and various diseases such as type 2 diabetes can play a role in the development of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. In this study, the beneficial effects of intestinal microbiota glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) in cognitive disorders were investigated. <b>METHODS</b>: PubMed-Medline, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched to identify experimental studies based on the bacterial strains along with GLP-1 1 expression in preventing or reducing cognitive impairment. Of the 233 studies, six were eligible for inclusion, and the Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) risk of bias tool was used to evaluate the risk of bias in individual studies. <b>RESULTS</b>: The results showed that intestinal expression of GLP-1 1 could reduce the intestinal pathogenic genus such as <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> and was obviously associated with a greater number of beneficial genera such as <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Akkermansia</i>. Also, the neuroprotective effects of <i>Clostridium butyricum</i> with GLP-1 1 in a mice were approved. Therefore, the modulation of the intestinal microbiota, mediated by an increase in the intestinal GLP-1 1 level, consequently improved cognitive function. <b>CONCLUSION</b>: In this review, we have indicated that the gut microbiota, by stimulating the expression of the intestinal hormones like GLP-1 1, and also with a beneficial effect in inhibiting some involved genes in inflammation, can declined the development of cognitive disorders.",Middle East journal of digestive diseases,2022,Fatemeh Sayehmiri; Mohammad Samadian; Ashraf Mohamadkhani; Abbas Tafakhori; Somayeh Haghighat; Aryoobarzan Rahmatian; Mohammad Ali Mohammadkhani; Hamid Reza Fazli; Mostafa Rezaei Tavirani
36355147,Dysbiosis of Gut Microbiota from the Perspective of the Gut-Brain Axis: Role in the Provocation of Neurological Disorders.,"The gut-brain axis is a bidirectional communication network connecting the gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system. The axis keeps track of gastrointestinal activities and integrates them to connect gut health to higher cognitive parts of the brain. Disruption in this connection may facilitate various neurological and gastrointestinal problems. Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the progressive dysfunction of specific populations of neurons, determining clinical presentation. Misfolded protein aggregates that cause cellular toxicity and that aid in the collapse of cellular proteostasis are a defining characteristic of neurodegenerative proteinopathies. These disorders are not only caused by changes in the neural compartment but also due to other factors of non-neural origin. Mounting data reveal that the majority of gastrointestinal (GI) physiologies and mechanics are governed by the central nervous system (CNS). Furthermore, the gut microbiota plays a critical role in the regulation and physiological function of the brain, although the mechanism involved has not yet been fully interpreted. One of the emerging explanations of the start and progression of many neurodegenerative illnesses is dysbiosis of the gut microbial makeup. The present understanding of the literature surrounding the relationship between intestinal dysbiosis and the emergence of certain neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and multiple sclerosis, is the main emphasis of this review. The potential entry pathway of the pathogen-associated secretions and toxins into the CNS compartment has been explored in this article at the outset of neuropathology. We have also included the possible mechanism of undelaying the synergistic effect of infections, their metabolites, and other interactions based on the current understanding.",Metabolites,2022,Meenakshi Kandpal; Omkar Indari; Budhadev Baral; Shweta Jakhmola; Deeksha Tiwari; Vasundhra Bhandari; Rajan Kumar Pandey; Kiran Bala; Avinash Sonawane; Hem Chandra Jha
35895243,Role of the gut-microbiota-metabolite axis in the rotenone model of early-stage Parkinson's Disease.,"Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in the early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD), but its potential pathogenesis remains unclear. Therefore, in the present study, we used the 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry-based metabolomics to investigate the alterations of gut microbiome and serum amino acid levels in the early-stage PD mice model induced with rotenone. The results demonstrated that the microbial taxa at phylum, family and genus levels remarkably altered in rotenone-induced mice relative to vehicle-induced mice. The rotenone-induced mice had higher relative abundance of Flavobacteriaceae, Staphylococcaceae, and Prevotellaceae as well as lower relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae_UCG-001, Ruminiclostridium, and Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group than vehicle-induced mice. The evaluation of serum amino acids revealed the alterations in several classes of amino acids, including L-proline, L-alanine, L-serine, L-asparagine, L-threonine, L-glutamine, L-methionine, and L-4-hydroxyproline. Notably, the altered serum amino acid levels were significantly associated with the abundance of gut microbiota, especially Ruminococcaceae and Ruminiclostridium. Our study explored the possible role of the gut-microbiota-metabolite axis in the early-stage PD and provided the possibility of prevention and treatment of PD by gut-microbiota-metabolite axis in the future.",Metabolic brain disease,2022,Zhenzhen Yan; Ruihua Li; Wanying Shi; Lifen Yao
36361826,Molecular and Cellular Interactions in Pathogenesis of Sporadic Parkinson Disease.,"An increasing number of the population all around the world suffer from age-associated neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease (PD). This disorder presents different signs of genetic, epigenetic and environmental origin, and molecular, cellular and intracellular dysfunction. At the molecular level, α-synuclein (αSyn) was identified as the principal molecule constituting the Lewy bodies (LB). The gut microbiota participates in the pathogenesis of PD and may contribute to the loss of dopaminergic neurons through mitochondrial dysfunction. The most important pathogenetic link is an imbalance of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, which is associated with redox imbalance in the cells and increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this review, genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors that cause these disorders and their cause-and-effect relationships are considered. As a constituent of environmental factors, the example of organophosphates (OPs) is also reviewed. The role of endothelial damage in the pathogenesis of PD is discussed, and a 'triple hit hypothesis' is proposed as a modification of Braak's dual hit one. In the absence of effective therapies for neurodegenerative diseases, more and more evidence is emerging about the positive impact of nutritional structure and healthy lifestyle on the state of blood vessels and the risk of developing these diseases.",International journal of molecular sciences,2022,Lyudmila P Dolgacheva; Valery P Zinchenko; Nikolay V Goncharov
36494405,Gut microbiota in dementia with Lewy bodies.,"Gut microbiota and fecal bile acids were analyzed in 278 patients with α-synucleinopathies, which were comprised of 28 patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), 224 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), and 26 patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD). Similarly to PD, short-chain fatty acids-producing genera were decreased in DLB. Additionally, Ruminococcus torques and Collinsella were increased in DLB, which were not changed in PD. Random forest models to differentiate DLB and PD showed that high Ruminococcus torques and high Collinsella, which presumably increase intestinal permeability, as well as low Bifidobacterium, which are also observed in Alzheimer's disease, were predictive of DLB. As Ruminococcus torques and Collinsella are also major secondary bile acids-producing bacteria, we quantified fecal bile acids and found that the production of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) was high in DLB. Increased UDCA in DLB may mitigate neuroinflammation at the substantia nigra, whereas neuroinflammation may not be critical at the neocortex. Theraeutic intervention to increase Bifidobacteirum and its metabolites may retard the development and progression of DLB.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2022,Hiroshi Nishiwaki; Jun Ueyama; Kenichi Kashihara; Mikako Ito; Tomonari Hamaguchi; Tetsuya Maeda; Yoshio Tsuboi; Masahisa Katsuno; Masaaki Hirayama; Kinji Ohno
36406865,Gut Microbiota Alternation in Disease Progression of Neurosyphilis.,"The gut microbiota plays an important role in the development of neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. However, studies on the gut microbiota of patients with neurosyphilis (NS) were rarely reported.In this study, we collected fecal samples from 62 syphilis patients, including 39 with NS and 23 with non-NS. Among the NS patients, 18 were general paresis (GP). The white blood cell counts, protein concentrations, and Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test positive rates of cerebrospinal fluid from patients in NS or GP group were significantly higher than those from patients in non-NS group. 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing results revealed that the alpha and beta diversities of the gut microbiota were similar between NS and non-NS patients or GP and non-NS patients.Linear discriminant analysis with effect size (LEfSe) analysis showed that some taxa, such as <i>Coprobacter</i>, were increased in both NS group and GP group, compared with non-NS group. Besides, the clade of <i>Akkermansia</i> was also overrepresented in GP Patients. Meanwhile, some taxa such as <i>Clostridia_UCG-014</i> and <i>SC-I-84</i> were underrepresented in NS patients. The abundances of class <i>Bacilli</i> and genus <i>Alloprevotella</i> were decreased in GP patients. Among them, the abundances of some taxa such as <i>Coprobacter</i> and <i>Akkermansia</i> have been reported to be associated with other neuropsychiatric disorders.Our findings suggest that the alternation of the gut microbiota in NS patients may contribute to the course of NS, which will deepen our understanding of NS.",Infection and drug resistance,2022,Guixuan Wang; Danyang Zou; Xinying Lu; Xin Gu; Yuanyuan Cheng; Tengfei Qi; Yanchun Cheng; Junjun Yu; Meiping Ye; Pingyu Zhou
36543925,Helicobacter hepaticus augmentation triggers Dopaminergic degeneration and motor disorders in mice with Parkinson's disease.,"Gut dysbiosis contributes to Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis. Gastrointestinal disturbances in PD patients, along with gut leakage and intestinal inflammation, take place long before motor disorders. However, it remains unknown what bacterial species in gut microbiomes play the key role in driving PD pathogenesis. Here we show that Helicobacter hepaticus (H. hepaticus), abundant in gut microbiota from rotenone-treated human α-Synuclein gene (SNCA) transgenic mice and PD patients, initiates α-Synuclein pathology and motor deficits in an AEP-dependent manner in SNCA mice. Chronic Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) treatment, an inflammatory inducer in the gut, activates AEP (asparagine endopeptidase) that cleaves α-Synuclein N103 and triggers its aggregation, promoting inflammation in the gut and the brain and motor defects in SNCA mice. PD fecal microbiota transplant or live H. hepaticus administration into antibiotics cocktail (Abx)-pretreated SNCA mice induces α-Synuclein pathology, inflammation in the gut and brain, and motor dysfunctions, for which AEP is indispensable. Hence, Helicobacter hepaticus enriched in PD gut microbiomes may facilitate α-Synuclein pathologies and motor impairments via activating AEP.",Molecular psychiatry,2023,Eun Hee Ahn; Xia Liu; Ashfaqul M Alam; Seong Su Kang; Keqiang Ye
35337376,Shedding light on biological sex differences and microbiota-gut-brain axis: a comprehensive review of its roles in neuropsychiatric disorders.,"Women and men are suggested to have differences in vulnerability to neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), schizophrenia, eating disorders, including anorexia nervosa, and bulimia nervosa, neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease. Genetic factors and sex hormones are apparently the main mediators of these differences. Recent evidence uncovers that reciprocal interactions between sex-related features (e.g., sex hormones and sex differences in the brain) and gut microbiota could play a role in the development of neuropsychiatric disorders via influencing the gut-brain axis. It is increasingly evident that sex-microbiota-brain interactions take part in the occurrence of neurologic and psychiatric disorders. Accordingly, integrating the existing evidence might help to enlighten the fundamental roles of these interactions in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders. In addition, an increased understanding of the biological sex differences on the microbiota-brain may lead to advances in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders and increase the potential for precision medicine. This review discusses the effects of sex differences on the brain and gut microbiota and the putative underlying mechanisms of action. Additionally, we discuss the consequences of interactions between sex differences and gut microbiota on the emergence of particular neuropsychiatric disorders.",Biology of sex differences,2022,Parnian Shobeiri; Amirali Kalantari; Antônio L Teixeira; Nima Rezaei
35275538,The Oral and Fecal Microbiota in a Canadian Cohort of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Despite decades of research, our understanding of Alzheimer's disease (AD) etiology remains incomplete. In recent years, appreciation has grown for potential roles for the microbiota in shaping neurological health.This study aimed to examine associations between the microbiota and AD in a human cross-sectional cohort.Forty-five AD patients and 54 matched controls were recruited in Vancouver, Canada. Fecal and oral samples underwent 16S microbiota sequencing. A wide array of demographic and clinical data were collected. Differences between participant groups were assessed, and associations between microbes and clinical variables were examined within the AD population.The gut microbiota of AD patients displayed lower diversity relative to controls, although taxonomic differences were sparse. In contrast, the AD oral microbiota displayed higher diversity, with several taxonomic differences relative to controls, including a lower abundance of the families Streptococcaceae and Actinomycetaceae, and a higher abundance of Weeksellaceae, among others. The periodontitis-associated oral microbe Porphyromonas gingivalis was 5 times more prevalent among patients. No significant associations between gut or oral microbes and cognition were detected, but several correlations existed between microbes and mood disorders and BMI among patients, including a strong positive correlation between Alphaproteobacteria and depression score.The gut microbiota of AD patients was not overtly different from controls, although it displayed lower diversity, an overall marker of microbiota health. The oral microbiota did display marked differences. Cognition was not associated with a microbial signature, but other relevant AD factors including mood and BMI did demonstrate an association.",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2022,Mihai S Cirstea; Daniel Kliger; Abbey D MacLellan; Adam C Yu; Jenna Langlois; Mannie Fan; Seti Boroomand; Faezeh Kharazyan; Robin G Y Hsiung; Brian A MacVicar; Howard Chertkow; Victor Whitehead; B Brett Finlay; Silke Appel-Cresswell
35886849,"Impact of Nutrition, Microbiota Transplant and Weight Loss Surgery on Dopaminergic Alterations in Parkinson's Disease and Obesity.","Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disorder worldwide, is characterized by dopaminergic neuron degeneration and α-synuclein aggregation in the substantia nigra pars compacta of the midbrain. Emerging evidence has shown that dietary intake affects the microbial composition in the gut, which in turn contributes to, or protects against, the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in affected regions of the brain. More specifically, the Mediterranean diet and Western diet, composed of varying amounts of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats, exert contrasting effects on PD pathophysiology via alterations in the gut microbiota and dopamine levels. Interestingly, the negative changes in the gut microbiota of patients with PD parallel changes that are seen in individuals that consume a Western diet, and are opposite to those that adhere to a Mediterranean diet. In this review, we first examine the role of prominent food groups on dopamine bioavailability, how they modulate the composition and function of the gut microbiota and the subsequent effects on PD and obesity pathophysiology. We then highlight evidence on how microbiota transplant and weight loss surgery can be used as therapeutic tools to restore dopaminergic deficits through optimizing gut microbial composition. In the process, we revisit dietary metabolites and their role in therapeutic approaches involving dopaminergic pathways. Overall, understanding the role of nutrition on dopamine bioavailability and gut microbiota in dopamine-related pathologies such as PD will help develop more precise therapeutic targets to rescue dopaminergic deficits in neurologic and metabolic disorders.",International journal of molecular sciences,2022,Sevag Hamamah; Andras Hajnal; Mihai Covasa
37529095,Influence of aerobic exercise training on mice gut microbiota in Parkinson's disease.,"Accumulating evidence shows that gut microbial dysbiosis may represent a risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD). Exercise has a positive effect on microbiota in general. The effect of aerobic exercise training (AET) on the gut microbial environment in PD remains to be explored. Here, we performed the 16S rRNA gene sequencing on feces from sham operated-mice (sham), PD mice model, and mice receiving AET (AET). Results indicated that AET had no remarkable effect on species richness and bacterial diversity of PD mice. The relative abundance of the <i>Bacteroidetes</i> was reduced, while <i>Firmicutes</i>, <i>Actinobacteria</i>, <i>Lactobacillaceae</i>, <i>Streptococcaceae</i>, <i>Lactobacillus</i>, <i>Streptococcus</i>, <i>Lactococcus</i>, <i>Lysinibacillus</i>, <i>Pelomonas</i>, and <i>Prevotellaceae_UCG-001</i> were increased in PD mice compared with those of sham operated-mice, whereas AET partly rescued their abundance. Additionally, the composition proportion of beneficial <i>Lactobacillus_gasseri</i> and u<i>ncultured_Erysipelotrichales_bacterium</i> significantly increased in AET mice compared to PD mice. Moreover, discriminative bacteria, such as <i>Bacilli</i>, <i>Lactobacillales</i>, <i>Lactobacillaceae</i>, <i>Lactobacillus</i>, and <i>Lactococcus</i> were identified as a specific taxon in AET mice.

35879588,Implication of Paraprobiotics in Age-Associated Gut Dysbiosis and Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, are major age-related concerns in elderly people. Since no drug fully addresses the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, advance treatment strategies are urgently needed. Several studies have noted the senescence of immune system and the perturbation of gut microbiota in the aged population. In recent years, the role of gut microbiota has been increasingly studied in the manifestation of age-related CNS disorders. In this context, prebiotics, probiotics, and paraprobiotics are reported to improve the behavioural and neurobiological abnormalities in elderly patients. As live microbiota, prescribed in the form of probiotics, shows some adverse effects like sepsis, translocation, and horizontal gene transfer, paraprobiotics could be a possible alternative strategy in designing microbiome-based therapeutics.

35897024,Gut microenvironmental changes as a potential trigger in Parkinson's disease through the gut-brain axis.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease attributed to the synergistic effects of genetic risk and environmental stimuli. Although PD is characterized by motor dysfunction resulting from intraneuronal alpha-synuclein accumulations, termed Lewy bodies, and dopaminergic neuronal degeneration in the substantia nigra, multiple systems are involved in the disease process, resulting in heterogenous clinical presentation and progression. Genetic predisposition to PD regarding aberrant immune responses, abnormal protein aggregation, autophagolysosomal impairment, and mitochondrial dysfunction leads to vulnerable neurons that are sensitive to environmental triggers and, together, result in neuronal degeneration. Neuropathology studies have shown that, at least in some patients, Lewy bodies start from the enteric nervous system and then spread to the central dopaminergic neurons through the gut-brain axis, suggesting the contribution of an altered gut microenvironment in the pathogenesis of PD. A plethora of evidence has revealed different gut microbiomes and gut metabolites in patients with PD compared to unaffected controls. Chronic gut inflammation and impaired intestinal barrier integrity have been observed in human PD patients and mouse models of PD. These observations led to the hypothesis that an altered gut microenvironment is a potential trigger of the PD process in a genetically susceptible host. In this review, we will discuss the complex interplay between genetic factors and gut microenvironmental changes contributing to PD pathogenesis.",Journal of biomedical science,2022,Szu-Ju Chen; Chin-Hsien Lin
34982206,Challenges of repurposing tetracyclines for the treatment of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.,"The novel antibiotic-exploiting strategy in the treatment of Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's (PD) disease has emerged as a potential breakthrough in the field. The research in animal AD/PD models provided evidence on the antiamyloidogenic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antiapoptotic activity of tetracyclines, associated with cognitive improvement. The neuroprotective effects of minocycline and doxycycline in animals initiated investigation of their clinical efficacy in AD and PD patients which led to inconclusive results and additionally to insufficient safety data on a long-standing doxycycline and minocycline therapy in these patient populations. The safety issues should be considered in two levels; in AD/PD patients (particularly antibiotic-induced alteration of gut microbiota and its consequences), and as a world-wide threat of development of bacterial resistance to these antibiotics posed by a fact that AD and PD are widespread incurable diseases which require daily administered long-lasting antibiotic therapy. Recently proposed subantimicrobial doxycycline doses should be thoroughly explored for their effectiveness and long-term safety especially in AD/PD populations. Keeping in mind the antibacterial activity-related far-reaching undesirable effects both for the patients and globally, further work on repurposing these drugs for a long-standing therapy of AD/PD should consider the chemically modified tetracycline compounds tailored to lack antimicrobial but retain (or introduce) other activities effective against the AD/PD pathology. This strategy might reduce the risk of long-term therapy-related adverse effects (particularly gut-related ones) and development of bacterial resistance toward the tetracycline antibiotic agents but the therapeutic potential and desirable safety profile of such compounds in AD/PD patients need to be confirmed.","Journal of neural transmission (Vienna, Austria : 1996)",2022,Iva Markulin; Marija Matasin; Viktorija Erdeljic Turk; Melita Salković-Petrisic
34719435,"The Role of Pathogens and Anti-Infective Agents in Parkinson's Disease, from Etiology to Therapeutic Implications.","Parkinson's disease is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder whose etiology is still unclear, hampering the development of effective treatments. There is an urgent need to identify the etiology and provide further effective treatments. Recently, accumulating evidence has indicated that infection may play a role in the etiology of Parkinson's disease. The infective pathogens may act as a trigger for Parkinson's disease, the most common of which are hepatitis C virus, influenza virus, and Helicobacter pylori. In addition, gut microbiota is increasingly recognized to influence brain function through the gut-brain axis, showing an important role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, a series of anti-infective agents exhibit surprising neuroprotective effects via various mechanisms, such as interfering with α-synuclein aggregation, inhibiting neuroinflammation, attenuating oxidative stress, and preventing from cell death, independent of their antimicrobial effects. The pleiotropic agents affect important events in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Moreover, most of them are less toxic, clinically safe and have good blood-brain penetrability, making them hopeful candidates for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. However, the use of antibiotics and subsequent gut dysbiosis may also play a role in Parkinson's disease, making the long-term effects of anti-infective drugs worthy of further consideration and exploration. This review summarizes the current evidence for the association between infective pathogens and Parkinson's disease and subsequently explores the application prospects of anti-infective drugs in Parkinson's disease treatment, providing novel insights into the pathogenesis and treatment of Parkinson's disease.",Journal of Parkinson's disease,2022,Si Shen; Chan Zhang; Yu-Ming Xu; Chang-He Shi

However, when the gut microbiota shift toward dysbiosis in the PD process remains unclear.We aim to investigate the changes in gut microbiota, locomotor function, and neuropathology longitudinally in PD rodent models.Fecal microbiota were longitudinally assessed by sequencing the V4-V5 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene in a human mutant α-synuclein over-expressing mouse model of PD, SNCA p.A53T mice, and the non-transgenic littermate controls. The locomotor function, neuronal integrity, and α-synuclein expression in the different brain regions were compared between groups. Human fecal microbiota communities from 58 patients with PD and 46 unaffected controls were also analyzed using metagenomic sequencing for comparison.Compared to non-transgenic littermate controls, the altered gut microbiota of the SNCA p.A53T mice can be detected as early as 2 months old, and the diurnal oscillation of the gut microbiome was dampened throughout PD progression starting from 4 months old. However, neuropathology changes and motor deficits were observed starting at 6 months old. Similar changes in altered gut microbiota were also observed in another PD genetic mouse model carrying the LRRK2 p.G2019S mutation at 2 months old. Among the commonly enriched gut microbiota in both PD genetic mouse models, the abundance of Parabateroides Merdae and Ruminococcus torques were also increased in human PD patients compared to controls.These findings revealed the altered gut microbiota communities and oscillations preceding the occurrence of neuropathy and motor dysfunction in the PD process.",Journal of Parkinson's disease,2022,Feng Liang; Cheng-Yu Chen; Yun-Pu Li; Yi-Ci Ke; En-Pong Ho; Chih-Fan Jeng; Chin-Hsien Lin; Shih-Kuo Chen
35349746,Microbiota-microglia connections in age-related cognition decline.,"Aging is an inevitable process that all individuals experience, of which the extent differs among individuals. It has been recognized as the risk factor of neurodegenerative diseases by affecting gut microbiota compositions, microglia, and cognition abilities. Aging-induced changes in gut microbiota compositions have a critical role in orchestrating the morphology and functions of microglia through the gut-brain axis. Gut microbiota communicates with microglia by its secreted metabolites and neurotransmitters. This is highly associated with age-related cognitive declines. Here, we review the main composition of microbiota in the aged individuals, outline the changes of the brain in age-related cognitive decline from a neuroinflammation perspective, especially the changes of morphology and functions of microglia, discuss the crosstalk between microbiota and microglia in the aged brain and further highlight the role of microbiota-microglia connections in neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease).",Aging cell,2022,Rui Zhou; Shufang Qian; William C S Cho; Jinyun Zhou; Chentao Jin; Yan Zhong; Jing Wang; Xiaohui Zhang; Zhoujiao Xu; Mei Tian; Lawrence W C Chan; Hong Zhang
35016506,Effect of Coffee against MPTP-Induced Motor Deficits and Neurodegeneration in Mice Via Regulating Gut Microbiota.,"The mechanisms of coffee against Parkinson disease (PD) remained incompletely elucidated. Numerous studies suggested that gut microbiota played a crucial role in the pathogenesis of PD. Here, we explored the further mechanisms of coffee against PD via regulating gut microbiota. C57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally injected with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to induce a PD mouse model, then treated with coffee for 4 consecutive weeks. Behavioral tests consisting of the pole test and beam-walking test were conducted to evaluate the motor function of mice. The levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and α-synuclein (α-syn) were assessed for dopaminergic neuronal loss. The levels of occludin, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), Bcl-2, Bax, cleaved caspase-3, and cytochrome c (Cyt c) were detected. Moreover, microbial components were measured by 16s rRNA sequencing. Our results showed that coffee significantly improved the motor deficits and TH neuron loss, and reduced the level of α-syn in the MPTP-induced mice. Moreover, coffee increased the level of BBB tight junction protein occludin and reduced the level of astrocyte activation marker GFAP in the MPTP-induced mice. Furthermore, coffee significantly decreased the levels of proapoptotic proteins, including Bax, cleaved caspase-3, and cytochrome c, while it increased the level of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2, consequently preventing MPTP-induced apoptotic cascade. Moreover, coffee improved MPTP-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis. These findings suggested that the neuroprotective effects of coffee on PD were involved in the regulation of gut microbiota, which might provide a novel option to elucidate the effects of coffee on PD.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2022,Jiaming Liu; Yuhe Zhang; Tao Ye; Qingxia Yu; Jiaheng Yu; Shushu Yuan; Xinxin Gao; Xinxin Wan; Rui Zhang; Weihua Han; Yang Zhang
35607987,Parkinson's Disease Is Associated with Impaired Gut-Blood Barrier for Short-Chain Fatty Acids.,"Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by gut microbiota are reduced in feces but paradoxically increased in plasma of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), which may stem from intestinal wall leakage. Gut function should be taken into consideration when conducting microbial-metabolite research.The objective was to investigate synchronous changes of SCFAs in feces and plasma of patients with PD, taking constipation as a confounder to better disentangle the SCFA metabolism exclusively associated with PD.The concentrations of fecal and plasma SCFAs in 33 healthy control subjects and 95 patients with PD were measured using liquid and gas chromatography mass spectrometry, respectively. Patients with PD were divided into patients with PD without constipation (n = 35) and patients with PD with constipation (n = 60). Gut-blood barrier (GBB) permeability was assessed by plasma/fecal ratio of SCFA concentrations and fecal α1-antitrypsin concentration.Patients with PD displayed decreased concentrations of fecal acetic, propionic, and butyric acid and increased concentrations of plasma acetic and propionic acid. Fecal acetic, isobutyric, and isovaleric acid were lower and plasma acetic and propionic acid were higher in patients with PD with constipation than in patients with PD without constipation. Constipation aggravated GBB permeability in patients with PD. Combined fecal and plasma SCFAs could discriminate patients with PD from healthy control subjects. Fecal SCFAs, except propionic acid, were negatively correlated with disease severity, while plasma acetic, propionic, and valeric acid showed a positive correlation.Our study showed alterations of fecal and plasma SCFAs in patients with PD that were associated with an impaired GBB and might be aggravated by constipation. © 2022 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society,2022,Xiaodong Yang; Penghui Ai; Xiaoqin He; Chengjun Mo; Yi Zhang; Shaoqing Xu; Yiqiu Lai; Yiwei Qian; Qin Xiao
36355135,"A New Concept of Associations between Gut Microbiota, Immunity and Central Nervous System for the Innovative Treatment of Neurodegenerative Disorders.","Nerve cell death accounts for various neurodegenerative disorders, in which altered immunity to the integrated central nervous system (CNS) might have destructive consequences. This undesirable immune response often affects the progressive neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and/or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It has been shown that commensal gut microbiota could influence the brain and/or several machineries of immune function. In other words, neurodegenerative disorders may be connected to the gut-brain-immune correlational system. The engrams in the brain could retain the information of a certain inflammation in the body which might be involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. Tactics involving the use of probiotics and/or fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) are now evolving as the most promising and/or valuable for the modification of the gut-brain-immune axis. More deliberation of this concept and the roles of gut microbiota would lead to the development of stupendous treatments for the prevention of, and/or therapeutics for, various intractable diseases including several neurodegenerative disorders.",Metabolites,2022,Sayuri Yoshikawa; Kurumi Taniguchi; Haruka Sawamura; Yuka Ikeda; Ai Tsuji; Satoru Matsuda
35873830,Update to the Treatment of Parkinson's Disease Based on the Gut-Brain Axis Mechanism.,"Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms represented by constipation were significant non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) and were considered early manifestations and aggravating factors of the disease. This paper reviewed the research progress of the mechanism of the gut-brain axis (GBA) in PD and discussed the roles of α-synuclein, gut microbiota, immune inflammation, neuroendocrine, mitochondrial autophagy, and environmental toxins in the mechanism of the GBA in PD. Treatment of PD based on the GBA theory has also been discussed, including (1) dietary therapy, such as probiotics, vitamin therapy, Mediterranean diet, and low-calorie diet, (2) exercise therapy, (3) drug therapy, including antibiotics; GI peptides; GI motility agents, and (4) fecal flora transplantation can improve the flora.

36263629,Intestinal histomorphological and molecular alterations in patients with Parkinson's disease.,"Changes in gut microbiota composition, enteric inflammation, impairments of the intestinal epithelial barrier and neuroplastic changes in the enteric nervous system have been reported in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and could contribute to the onset of both neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms. However, their mutual interplay has rarely been investigated. This study evaluated, in an integrated manner, changes in faecal microbiota composition, morphofunctional alterations of colonic mucosal barrier and changes of inflammatory markers in blood and stools of PD patients.Nineteen PD patients and nineteen asymptomatic subjects were enrolled. Blood lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP, marker of altered intestinal permeability) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) levels, as well as stool IL-1β and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) levels, were evaluated. Gut microbiota analysis was performed. Epithelial mucins, collagen fibres, claudin-1 and S100-positive glial cells as markers of an impairment of the intestinal barrier, mucosal remodelling and enteric glial activation were evaluated on colonic mucosal specimens collected during colonoscopy.Faecal microbiota analysis revealed a significant difference in the α-diversity in PD patients compared to controls, while no differences were found in the β-diversity. Compared to controls, PD patients showed significant chenags in plasma LBP levels, as well as faecal TNF and IL-1β levels. The histological analysis showed a decrease in epithelial neutral mucins and claudin-1 expression and an increased expression of acidic mucins, collagen fibres and S100-positive glial cells.Parkinson's disease patients are characterized by enteric inflammation and increased intestinal epithelial barrier permeability, as well as colonic mucosal barrier remodelling, associated with changes in gut microbiota composition.",European journal of neurology,2023,Gabriele Bellini; Laura Benvenuti; Chiara Ippolito; Daniela Frosini; Cristina Segnani; Francesco Rettura; Andrea Pancetti; Lorenzo Bertani; Vanessa D'Antongiovanni; Giovanni Palermo; Eleonora Del Prete; Luca Antonioli; Vincenzo Nardini; Riccardo Morganti; Carolina Pellegrini; Nunzia Bernardini; Roberto Ceravolo; Matteo Fornai; Massimo Bellini
35741624,Not just a Snapshot: An Italian Longitudinal Evaluation of Stability of Gut Microbiota Findings in Parkinson's Disease.,"Most research analyzed gut-microbiota alterations in Parkinson's disease (PD) through cross-sectional studies, as single snapshots, without considering the time factor to either confirm methods and findings or observe longitudinal variations. In this study, we introduce the time factor by comparing gut-microbiota composition in 18 PD patients and 13 healthy controls (HC) at baseline and at least 1 year later, also considering PD clinical features. PD patients and HC underwent a fecal sampling at baseline and at a follow-up appointment. Fecal samples underwent sequencing and 16S rRNA amplicons analysis. Patients'clinical features were valued through Hoehn&Yahr (H&Y) staging-scale and Movement Disorder Society Unified PD Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part-III. Results demonstrated stability in microbiota findings in both PD patients and HC over a period of 14 months: both alfa and beta diversity were maintained in PD patients and HC over the observation period. In addition, differences in microbiota composition between PD patients and HC remained stable over the time period. Moreover, during the same period, patients did not experience any worsening of either staging or motor impairment. Our findings, highlighting the stability and reproducibility of the method, correlate clinical and microbiota stability over time and open the scenario to more extensive longitudinal evaluations.",Brain sciences,2022,Rocco Cerroni; Daniele Pietrucci; Adelaide Teofani; Giovanni Chillemi; Claudio Liguori; Mariangela Pierantozzi; Valeria Unida; Sidorela Selmani; Nicola Biagio Mercuri; Alessandro Stefani
35076890,Gastrointestinal Dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease.,"There has been exponential growth in the awareness and understanding of gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD) over the past 3 decades. The clinical features of GI dysfunction in PD have been clearly identified and innovative research has demonstrated the presence of pathology within the enteric nervous system (ENS) in individuals with PD, leading to suggestions that the GI system may be ground zero for the genesis and the portal of entry of PD pathology, which then ascends via the vagus nerve to the central nervous system (CNS). This theory, as well as the more recent recognition of the association of PD with dysbiosis within the gut microbiota, has been the object of intense study and scrutiny. Since most PD medications are absorbed through the GI system, the need for better understanding of changes within the GI tract that may potentially affect the pattern of response to medications has become evident. In this review, current knowledge of the pathophysiology of changes within the GI tract and the gut microbiome of individuals with PD, including changes that occur with progression of the disease, will be addressed. We focus on common clinical GI problems in PD that can arise from different segments of the GI tract. Relevant diagnostic evaluations and treatment options for each of these problems will be reviewed.",Drugs,2022,Delaram Safarpour; Kaveh Sharzehi; Ronald F Pfeiffer
35837118,Differences in Alpha Diversity of Gut Microbiota in Neurological Diseases.,"Neurological diseases are difficult to diagnose in time, and there is currently a lack of effective predictive methods. Previous studies have indicated that a variety of neurological diseases cause changes in the gut microbiota. Alpha diversity is a major indicator to describe the diversity of the gut microbiota. At present, the relationship between neurological diseases and the alpha diversity of the gut microbiota remains unclear.We performed a systematic literature search of Pubmed and Bioproject databases up to January 2021. Six indices were used to measure alpha diversity, including community richness (observed species, Chao1 and ACE), community diversity (Shannon, Simpson), and phylogenetic diversity (PD). Random-effects meta-analyses on the standardized mean difference (SMD) were carried out on the alpha diversity indices. Subgroup analyses were performed to explore the sources of interstudy heterogeneity. Meta-analysis was performed on articles by matching the age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) of the disease group with the control group. Meanwhile, subgroup analysis was performed to control the variability of the sequencing region, platform, geographical region, instrument, and diseases. The area under the curve (AUC) value of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was calculated to assess the prediction effectiveness of the microbial alpha diversity indices.We conducted a meta-analysis of 24 published studies on 16S rRNA gene amplified sequencing of the gut microbiota and neurological diseases from the Pubmed and Bioproject database (patients, <i>n</i> = 1,469; controls, <i>n</i> = 1,289). The pooled estimate demonstrated that there was no significant difference in the alpha diversity between patients and controls (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Alpha diversity decreased only in Parkinson's disease patients, while it increased in anorexia nervosa patients compared to controls. After adjusting for age, sex, BMI, and geographical region, none of the alpha diversity was associated with neurological diseases. In terms of Illumina HiSeq 2000 and the V3-V5 sequencing region, the results showed that alpha diversity increased significantly in comparison with the controls, while decreased in Illumina HiSeq 2500. ROC curves suggested that alpha diversity could be used as a biomarker to predict the AD (Simpson, AUC= 0.769, <i>P</i> = 0.0001), MS (observed species, AUC= 0.737, <i>P</i> = 0.001), schizophrenia (Chao1, AUC = 0.739, <i>P</i> = 0.002).Our review summarized the relationship between alpha diversity of the gut microbiota and neurological diseases. The alpha diversity of gut microbiota could be a promising predictor for AD, schizophrenia, and MS, but not for all neurological diseases.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2022,Zhuoxin Li; Jie Zhou; Hao Liang; Li Ye; Liuyan Lan; Fang Lu; Qing Wang; Ting Lei; Xiping Yang; Ping Cui; Jiegang Huang
35091889,Vancomycin Pretreatment on MPTP-Induced Parkinson's Disease Mice Exerts Neuroprotection by Suppressing Inflammation Both in Brain and Gut.,"A growing body of evidence implies that gut microbiota was involved in pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), but the mechanism is still unclear. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of antibiotics pretreatment on the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mice. In this study, vancomycin pretreatment was given by gavage once daily with either vancomycin or distilled water for 14 days to mice, then mice were administered with MPTP (20 mg/kg, i.p) for four times in one day to establish an acute PD model. Results show that vancomycin pretreatment significantly improved motor dysfunction of mice in pole and traction tests. Although vancomycin pretreatment had no effect on dopamine (DA) or the process of DA synthesis, it inhibited the metabolism of DA by suppressing the expression of striatal monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B). Furthermore, vancomycin pretreatment reduced the number of astrocytes and microglial cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) to alleviate neuroinflammation, decreased the expression of TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB/TNF-α signaling pathway in both brain and gut. Meanwhile, vancomycin pretreatment changed gut microbiome composition and the levels of fecal short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). The abundance of Akkermansia and Blautia increased significantly after vancomycin pretreatment, which might be related to inflammation and inhibition of TLR4 signaling pathway. In summary, these results demonstrate that the variation of gut microbiota and its metabolites induced by vancomycin pretreatment might decrease dopamine metabolic rate and relieve inflammation in both gut and brain via the microbiota-gut-brain axis in MPTP-induced PD mice. The neuroprotection of vancomycin pretreatment on MPTP-induced Parkinson's disease mice The alterations of gut microbiota and SCFAs induced by vancomycin pretreatment might not only improve motor dysfunction, but also decrease dopamine metabolism and relieve inflammation in both brain and gut via TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB/TNF-α pathway in MPTP-induced PD mice.",Journal of neuroimmune pharmacology : the official journal of the Society on NeuroImmune Pharmacology,2023,Chun Cui; Hui Hong; Yun Shi; Yu Zhou; Chen-Meng Qiao; Wei-Jiang Zhao; Li-Ping Zhao; Jian Wu; Wei Quan; Gu-Yu Niu; Yi-Bo Wu; Chao-Sheng Li; Li Cheng; Yan Hong; Yan-Qin Shen

Along with playing crucial roles in regulating and modulating various metabolic reactions and life processes, dysbiosis of gut microbiota also affects the permeability of gut and blood-brain barrier. This increases the chance of age-related neurological disorders' like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. <i>Withania somnifera</i> (<i>W. somnifera</i>) has been proclaimed as a virtuous plant for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and many other problems. We have studied the bioactive components of <i>W. somnifera</i> for combined treatment of gut-dysbiosis led bowel diseases (Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Irritable Bowel Syndrome) and the most common neurodegenerative diseases through common potential targets. This approach can solve along with curing the neurodegenerative diseases, the factors causing these diseases would also be obstructed from entering the brain, consonantly curing Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Irritable Bowel Syndrome. Our work on GPCR receptors common to gut inflammatory diseases and neuronal disorders through Network Pharmacology, Molecular docking and Dynamic Simulation approach has shown that modulation of these receptors with bioactive compounds present in <i>W. somnifera</i> can result in effective control of these diseases.

However, the potential role of gut dysbiosis in cryptogenic stroke (CS) has not been elucidated yet. In this study, a high prevalence of gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction and gut inflammation with increased intestinal permeability have been found in CS patients compared with normal controls (NCs). The systemic inflammation in CS patients was also identified by measuring the levels of plasma C-reactive protein (CRP), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), LPS-binding protein (LBP), and white blood cells (WBC) count. Using 16S rRNA sequencing, we found increased alpha diversity, accompanied by a higher abundance of Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcaceae, and Lactobacillaceae at the family level and <i>Escherichia-Shigella</i>, <i>Streptococcus</i>, <i>Lactobacillus</i>, and <i>Klebsilla</i> at the genus level in the intestinal microbiota of CS patients compared to NCs. Our results showed that the abundance of <i>Klebsilla</i> was positively correlated with the systemic inflammation, the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores, and the infarct volumes. In conclusion, gut dysbiosis in CS patients was associated with the severity of CS and the systemic inflammation.

36619768,The contribution of gut-brain axis to development of neurological symptoms in COVID-19 recovered patients: A hypothesis and review of literature.,"The gut microbiota undergoes significant alterations in response to viral infections, particularly the novel SARS-CoV-2. As impaired gut microbiota can trigger numerous neurological disorders, we suggest that the long-term neurological symptoms of COVID-19 may be related to intestinal microbiota disorders in these patients. Thus, we have gathered available information on how the virus can affect the microbiota of gastrointestinal systems, both in the acute and the recovery phase of the disease, and described several mechanisms through which this gut dysbiosis can lead to long-term neurological disorders, such as Guillain-Barre syndrome, chronic fatigue, psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety, and even neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. These mechanisms may be mediated by inflammatory cytokines, as well as certain chemicals such as gastrointestinal hormones (e.g., CCK), neurotransmitters (e.g., 5-HT), etc. (e.g., short-chain fatty acids), and the autonomic nervous system. In addition to the direct influences of the virus, repurposed medications used for COVID-19 patients can also play a role in gut dysbiosis. In conclusion, although there are many dark spots in our current knowledge of the mechanism of COVID-19-related gut-brain axis disturbance, based on available evidence, we can hypothesize that these two phenomena are more than just a coincidence and highly recommend large-scale epidemiologic studies in the future.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2022,Kimia Vakili; Mobina Fathi; Shirin Yaghoobpoor; Fatemeh Sayehmiri; Yasaman Nazerian; Amirhossein Nazerian; Ashraf Mohamadkhani; Pariya Khodabakhsh; Gislaine Z Réus; Ramtin Hajibeygi; Mostafa Rezaei-Tavirani
36552604,Mangosteen Pericarp Extract Supplementation Boosts Antioxidant Status via Rebuilding Gut Microbiota to Attenuate Motor Deficit in 6-OHDA-Induced Parkinson's Disease.,"Oxidative stress and gut dysbiosis have been known to precede Parkinson's disease (PD). An antioxidant-rich product, mangosteen pericarp (MP), has the ability to counterbalance excessive free radicals and the imbalanced gut microbiota composition, suggesting the MP's capacity to delay PD progression. In this study, we explored the effects of two doses of MP extract in a unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced PD rat model. We revealed that the 8-week supplementation of a low dose (LMP) and a high dose of the MP extract (HMP) improved motor function, as observed in decreased contralateral rotation, improved time spent on rod, and higher dopamine binding transporter (DAT) in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). The MP extract, especially the HMP, also increased antioxidant-related gene expressions, restored muscle mitochondrial function, and remodeled fecal microbiota composition, which were followed by reduced reactive oxygen species levels in brain and inflammation in plasma. Importantly, bacterial genera <i>Sutterella</i>, <i>Rothia</i>, and <i>Aggregatibacter</i>, which were negatively correlated with antioxidant gene expressions, decreased in the HMP group. It is imperative to note that in addition to directly acting as an antioxidant to reduce excessive free radicals, MP extract might also increase antioxidant state by rebuilding gut microbiota, thereby enhanced anti-inflammatory capacity and restored mitochondrial function to attenuate motor deficit in 6-OHDA-induced PD-like condition. All in all, MP extract is a potential candidate for auxiliary therapy for PD.","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,Bira Arumndari Nurrahma; Tu-Hsueh Yeh; Rong-Hong Hsieh; Shu-Ping Tsao; Chia-Wen Chen; Yen-Peng Lee; Chun-Hsu Pan; Hui-Yu Huang
36439235,Probiotic <i>Pediococcus pentosaceus</i> ameliorates MPTP-induced oxidative stress <i>via</i> regulating the gut microbiota-gut-brain axis.,"Recent evidence demonstrated that functional bacteria were involved in the regulation of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the mechanism of probiotics in improving PD was unclear. Here the antioxidant effect and the mechanism of probiotics <i>Pediococcus pentosaceus</i> (PP) on PD were studied by regulating the gut-brain axis. In this study, male C57BL/6J mice were injected with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) intraperitoneally to establish a PD model and were then treated with PP for 4 weeks. Subsequently, a series of neurobehavioral tests to evaluate the motor function of the mice was performed. Additionally, degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, accumulation of α-synuclein, the production of an oxidative stress response, and the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway-related proteins were evaluated. Moreover, the gut microbial composition and the level of metabolite γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were assessed. The results showed that PP treatment could improve MPTP-induced motor deficits, the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, and the accumulation of α-synuclein. Moreover, PP treatment significantly increased the levels of SOD1, Gpx1, and Nrf2, while it decreased the levels of Keap1 in the brain of MPTP-induced mice. Notably, PP treatment improved the gut microbial dysbiosis and increased the level of GABA in MPTP-induced mice. These findings indicated that PP might represent a promising candidate, due to the metabolite of GABA, that could be used for the treatment of PD.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2022,Sipei Pan; Hongming Wei; Shushu Yuan; Yu Kong; Huiqun Yang; Yuhe Zhang; Xiaorui Cui; Weian Chen; Jiaming Liu; Yang Zhang
36504794,Reviewing the state of the art of probiotics as clinical modalities for brain-gut-microbiota axis associated disorders.,"The rise in prevalence of mental and neurological disorders is causing a high burden on society, however adequate interventions are not always available. The brain-gut-microbiota axis (BGMA) may provide a new angle for the development of clinical modalities. Due to the intricate bi-directional signaling between the brain and the gut, it may be helpful to look into interventions that target the gut, such as probiotics. Therefore, this review aimed to investigate the state of the art of probiotics and their potential as clinical modalities for BGMA-associated indications by gaining insight into patents and clinical trials that have been applied for and executed since 1999. A total of 565 patents and 390 clinical trials were found, focusing on probiotic applications for 83 indications. Since the start of the 21st century, the highest numbers of patents and clinical trials were related to primary neuropsychological, affective (depression, anxiety) and cognitive disorders, neurodegenerative and/or inflammatory brain disorders (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amongst others), and gastrointestinal disorders (irritable bowel syndrome). The locations where the most patents and clinical trials were registered included China, the United States, and Iran. From 1999 to ~2013 a slight growth could be seen in the numbers of patents and clinical trials, followed by an almost exponential growth from ~2013 onwards. Overall, the developments of the state of the art were in accordance with previous research, however it appeared that clinical trials showed a slightly slower growth compared to patents, which may have implications for the future implementation of probiotics as clinical modalities for BGMA-associated indications.",Frontiers in microbiology,2022,Cato Wiegers; Mariët A Veerman; Robert Jan Brummer; Olaf F A Larsen
36570528,The effects of microbiota abundance on symptom severity in Parkinson's disease: A systematic review.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is neurodegenerative disease with a multifactorial etiopathogenesis with accumulating evidence identifying microbiota as a potential factor in the earliest, prodromal phases of the disease. Previous research has already shown a significant difference between gut microbiota composition in PD patients as opposed to healthy controls, with a growing number of studies correlating gut microbiota changes with the clinical presentation of the disease in later stages, through various motor and non-motor symptoms. Our aim in this systematic review is to compose and assess current knowledge in the field and determine if the findings could influence future clinical practice as well as therapy in PD.We have conducted a systematic review according to PRISMA guidelines through MEDLINE and Embase databases, with studies being selected for inclusion via a set inclusion and exclusion criteria.20 studies were included in this systematic review according to the selected inclusion and exclusion criteria. The search yielded 18 case control studies, 1 case study, and 1 prospective case study with no controls. The total number of PD patients encompassed in the studies cited in this review is 1,511.The link between gut microbiota and neurodegeneration is a complex one and it depends on various factors. The relative abundance of various microbiota taxa in the gut has been consistently shown to have a correlation with motor and non-motor symptom severity. The answer could lie in the products of gut microbiota metabolism which have also been linked to PD.

35342048,Alteration of Gut Microbial Metabolites in the Systemic Circulation of Patients with Parkinson's Disease.,"Emerging evidence suggests that gut dysbiosis contributes to Parkinson's disease (PD) by signaling through microbial metabolites. Hippuric acid (HA), indole derivatives, and secondary bile acids are among the most common gut metabolites.To examine the relationship of systemic concentrations of these microbial metabolites associated with changes of gut microbiota, PD status, and severity of PD.We enrolled 56 patients with PD and 43 age- and sex-matched healthy participants. Motor and cognitive severity were assessed with Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) part III motor score and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), respectively. Plasma concentrations of targeted gut metabolites were measured with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Gut microbiota was analyzed with shotgun metagenomic sequencing.Compared with controls, PD patients had significantly higher plasma levels of HA, indole-3-propionic acid (IPA), deoxycholic acid (DCA), and glycodeoxycholic acid (GDCA). After adjustment for age and sex in a multivariate logistic regression analysis, plasma levels of HA (odds ratio [OR] 3.21, p < 0.001), IPA (OR 2.59, p = 0.031), and GDCA (OR 2.82, p = 0.036) were associated with positive PD status. Concentrations of these gut metabolites did not correlate with MDS-UPDRS part III score or MMSE after adjustment for confounders. Microbial metabolite levels were associated with the relative abundance of pro-inflammatory gut bacteria.Aberrant gut microbial metabolites of HA, indole derivatives and secondary bile acids associated with specific gut microbiota changes were observed in patients with PD.",Journal of Parkinson's disease,2022,Szu-Ju Chen; Chieh-Chang Chen; Hsin-Yu Liao; Yu-Wei Wu; Jyh-Ming Liou; Ming-Shiang Wu; Ching-Hua Kuo; Chin-Hsien Lin
35572129,Multi-Omics Integration in Mice With Parkinson's Disease and the Intervention Effect of Cyanidin-3-<i>O</i>-Glucoside.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multifactorial degenerative disease of the central nervous system, which affects mostly older adults. To date, research has focused on the progression of PD. Simultaneously, it was confirmed that the imbalances in gut microbiota are associated with the onset and progression of PD. Accurate diagnosis and precise treatment of PD are currently deficient due to the absence of effective biomarkers.In this study, the pharmacodynamic study of cyanidin-3-<i>O</i>-glucoside in PD mice was used. It intends to use the ""imbalance"" and ""balance"" of intestinal microecology as the starting point to investigate the ""gut-to-brain"" hypothesis using metabolomic-combined 16S rRNA gene sequencing methods. Simultaneously, metabolomic analysis was implemented to acquire differential metabolites, and microbiome analysis was performed to analyze the composition and filter the remarkably altered gut microbiota at the phylum/genera level. Afterward, metabolic pathway and functional prediction analysis of the screened differential metabolites and gut microbiota were applied using the MetaboAnalyst database. In addition, Pearson's correlation analysis was used for the differential metabolites and gut microbiota. We found that cyanidin-3-<i>O</i>-glucoside could protect 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6- tetrahydropy ridine (MPTP)-induced PD mice.Metabolomic analysis showed that MPTP-induced dysbiosis of the gut microbiota significantly altered sixty-seven metabolites. The present studies have also shown that MPTP-induced PD is related to lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and so on. The 16S rRNA sequencing analysis indicated that 5 phyla and 22 genera were significantly altered. Furthermore, the differential gut microbiota was interrelated with amino acid metabolism, and so on. The metabolites and gut microbiota network diagram revealed significant correlations between 11 genera and 8 differential metabolites.In combination, this study offers potential molecular biomarkers that should be validated for future translation into clinical applications for more accurately diagnosing PD. Simultaneously, the results of this study lay a basis for further study of the association between host metabolisms, gut microbiota, and PD.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2022,Wang Wang; Guoxue Zhu; Yuwen Wang; Wei Li; Shilin Yi; Kai Wang; Lu Fan; Juanjuan Tang; Ruini Chen
34996385,Serum short-chain fatty acids and its correlation with motor and non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease patients.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with enteric nervous system dysfunction and gut microbiota dysbiosis. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), derived from gut microbiota, are supposed to anticipate PD pathogenesis via the pathway of spinal cord and vagal nerve or the circulatory system. However, the serum concentration of SCFAs in PD patients is poorly known. This study aims to investigate the exact level of SCFAs in PD patients and its correlation with Parkinson's symptoms.50 PD patients and 50 healthy controls were recruited, and their demographic and clinical characteristics were collected. The serum concentration of SCFAs was detected using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometer. SCFAs were compared between PD and control groups. The correlation between serum SCFAs and Parkinson's symptoms and the potential effects of medications on the serum SCFAs was analyzed.Serum propionic acid, butyric acid and caproic acid were lower, while heptanoic acid was higher in PD patients than in control subjects. However, only the serum level of propionic acid was correlated with Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRs) part III score (R = -0.365, P = 0.009), Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE) score (R = -0.416, P = 0.003), and Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) score (R = 0.306, P = 0.03). There was no correlation between other serum SCFAs and motor complications. The use of trihexyphenidyl or tizanidine increased the serum concentration of propionic acid.Serum SCFAs are altered in PD patients, and the decrease of serum propionic acid level is correlated with motor symptoms, cognitive ability and non-depressed state. Thus, the gut microbial-derived SCFAs potentially affect Parkinson's symptoms through the blood circulation. Propionic acid supplementation might ameliorate motor and non-motor symptoms of PD patients, although clinical trials are needed to test this hypothesis.",BMC neurology,2022,Gang Wu; Zhengli Jiang; Yaling Pu; Shiyong Chen; Tingling Wang; Yajing Wang; Xiaoping Xu; Shanshan Wang; Minya Jin; Yangyang Yao; Yang Liu; Shaofa Ke; Suzhi Liu
36358513,Neurodegenerative Microbially-Shaped Diseases: Oxidative Stress Meets Neuroinflammation.,"Inflammation and oxidative stress characterize a number of chronic conditions including neurodegenerative diseases and aging. Inflammation is a key component of the innate immune response in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease of which oxidative stress is an important hallmark. Immune dysregulation and mitochondrial dysfunction with concomitant reactive oxygen species accumulation have also been implicated in both diseases, both systemically and within the Central Nervous System. Mitochondria are a centrally positioned signalling hub for inflammatory responses and inflammatory cells can release reactive species at the site of inflammation often leading to exaggerated oxidative stress. A growing body of evidence suggests that disruption of normal gut microbiota composition may induce increased permeability of the gut barrier leading to chronic systemic inflammation, which may, in turn, impair the blood-brain barrier function and promote neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. The gastrointestinal tract is constantly exposed to myriad exogenous substances and microbial pathogens, which are abundant sources of reactive oxygen species, oxidative damage and pro-inflammatory events. Several studies have demonstrated that microbial infections may also affect the balance in gut microbiota composition (involving oxidant and inflammatory processes by the host and indigenous microbiota) and influence downstream Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease pathogenesis, in which blood-brain barrier damage ultimately occurs. Therefore, the oxidant/inflammatory insults triggered by a disrupted gut microbiota and chronic dysbiosis often lead to compromised gut barrier function, allowing inflammation to ""escape"" as well as uncontrolled immune responses that may ultimately disrupt mitochondrial function upwards the brain. Future therapeutic strategies should be designed to ""restrain"" gut inflammation, a goal that could ideally be attained by microbiota modulation strategies, in alternative to classic anti-inflammatory agents with unpredictable effects on the microbiota architecture itself.","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,Diana Filipa Silva; Nuno Empadinhas; Sandra Morais Cardoso; Ana Raquel Esteves
35405323,Linking circadian rhythms to microbiome-gut-brain axis in aging-associated neurodegenerative diseases.,"Emerging evidence suggests that both disruption of circadian rhythms and gut dysbiosis are closely related to aging-associated neurodegenerative diseases. Over the last decade, the microbiota-gut-brain axis has been an emerging field and revolutionized studies in pathology, diagnosis, and treatment of neurological disorders. Crosstalk between the brain and gut microbiota can be accomplished via the endocrine, immune, and nervous system. Recent studies have shown that the composition and diurnal oscillation of gut microbiota are influenced by host circadian rhythms. This provides a new perspective for investigating the microbiome-gut-brain axis. We aim to review current understanding and research on the dynamic interaction between circadian rhythms and the microbiome-gut-brain axis. Furthermore, we will address the possible neurodegenerative disease contribution through circadian rhythms and microbiome-gut-brain axis crosstalk.",Ageing research reviews,2022,Wai-Yin Cheng; Yuen-Shan Ho; Raymond Chuen-Chung Chang
36144449,Advanced Glycation End Products in Health and Disease.,"Advanced glycation end products (AGEs), formed through the nonenzymatic reaction of reducing sugars with the side-chain amino groups of lysine or arginine of proteins, followed by further glycoxidation reactions under oxidative stress conditions, are involved in the onset and exacerbation of a variety of diseases, including diabetes, atherosclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) as well as in the secondary stages of traumatic brain injury (TBI). AGEs, in the form of intra- and interprotein crosslinks, deactivate various enzymes, exacerbating disease progression. The interactions of AGEs with the receptors for the AGEs (RAGE) also result in further downstream inflammatory cascade events. The overexpression of RAGE and the AGE-RAGE interactions are especially involved in cases of Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases, including TBI and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Maillard reactions are also observed in the gut bacterial species. The protein aggregates found in the bacterial species resemble those of AD and Parkinson's disease (PD), and AGE inhibitors increase the life span of the bacteria. Dietary AGEs alter the gut microbiota composition and elevate plasma glycosylation, thereby leading to systemic proinflammatory effects and endothelial dysfunction. There is emerging interest in developing AGE inhibitor and AGE breaker compounds to treat AGE-mediated pathologies, including diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases. Gut-microbiota-derived enzymes may also function as AGE-breaker biocatalysts. Thus, AGEs have a prominent role in the pathogenesis of various diseases, and the AGE inhibitor and AGE breaker approach may lead to novel therapeutic candidates.",Microorganisms,2022,V Prakash Reddy; Puspa Aryal; Emmanuel K Darkwah
35684340,The Role of Microbiome in Brain Development and Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Hundreds of billions of commensal microorganisms live in and on our bodies, most of which colonize the gut shortly after birth and stay there for the rest of our lives. In animal models, bidirectional communications between the central nervous system and gut microbiota (Gut-Brain Axis) have been extensively studied, and it is clear that changes in microbiota composition play a vital role in the pathogenesis of various neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, such as Autism Spectrum Disorder, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, anxiety, stress, and so on. The makeup of the microbiome is impacted by a variety of factors, such as genetics, health status, method of delivery, environment, nutrition, and exercise, and the present understanding of the role of gut microbiota and its metabolites in the preservation of brain functioning and the development of the aforementioned neurological illnesses is summarized in this review article. Furthermore, we discuss current breakthroughs in the use of probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics to address neurological illnesses. Moreover, we also discussed the role of boron-based diet in memory, boron and microbiome relation, boron as anti-inflammatory agents, and boron in neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, in the coming years, boron reagents will play a significant role to improve dysbiosis and will open new areas for researchers.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,Varsha Nandwana; Nitesh K Nandwana; Yogarupa Das; Mariko Saito; Tanisha Panda; Sasmita Das; Frankis Almaguel; Narayan S Hosmane; Bhaskar C Das
36226922,Fucosylated Chondroitin Sulfate against Parkinson's Disease through Inhibiting Inflammation Induced by Gut Dysbiosis.,"Growing evidence for the importance of the gut-brain axis in Parkinson's disease (PD) has attracted researchers' interest in the possible application of microbiota-based treatment approaches. Using a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced mouse model, we looked into the prospect of treating PD with fucosylated chondroitin sulfate obtained from sea cucumbers <i>Isostichopus badionotus</i> (fCS-<i>Ib</i>). We showed that giving fCS-<i>Ib</i> polysaccharide orally greatly reduced the motor deficits, dopamine depletion, and alpha-synuclein increase caused by MPTP in the substantia nigra (SN). It appears that the anti-PD action of fCS-<i>Ib</i> polysaccharide could be attained by squelching inflammation. Glial cell hyperactivation in SN and overproduction of proinflammatory substances in serum could both be suppressed by fCS-<i>Ib</i> polysaccharide injection. The bacterial DNA in fresh colonic feces was submitted to 16S rRNA and untargeted metabolic analyses to confirm the participation of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in the aforementioned interpretation. The findings showed that the MPTP treatment-induced decrease in <i>norank_f_Muribaculaceae</i> and the increase in <i>Staphylococcus</i> were reversed by the administration of fCS-<i>Ib</i> polysaccharide. The NF-κB signaling pathway was shown to be involved in the fCS-<i>Ib</i> polysaccharide-induced anti-inflammation. In conclusion, our research demonstrated for the first time how fCS-<i>Ib</i> polysaccharide combats PD by reducing inflammation caused by gut microbial dysbiosis.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2022,Yimeng Liu; Xuyu Liu; Qiantao Ye; Yida Wang; Jiafu Zhang; Song Lin; Guang Wang; Xuesong Yang; Jichun Zhang; Shiguo Chen; Nian Wu
35829770,Studying the Parkinson's disease metabolome and exposome in biological samples through different analytical and cheminformatics approaches: a pilot study.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease, with an increasing incidence in recent years due to the aging population. Genetic mutations alone only explain <10% of PD cases, while environmental factors, including small molecules, may play a significant role in PD. In the present work, 22 plasma (11 PD, 11 control) and 19 feces samples (10 PD, 9 control) were analyzed by non-target high-resolution mass spectrometry (NT-HRMS) coupled to two liquid chromatography (LC) methods (reversed-phase (RP) and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC)). A cheminformatics workflow was optimized using open software (MS-DIAL and patRoon) and open databases (all public MSP-formatted spectral libraries for MS-DIAL, PubChemLite for Exposomics, and the LITMINEDNEURO list for patRoon). Furthermore, five disease-specific databases and three suspect lists (on PD and related disorders) were developed, using PubChem functionality to identifying relevant unknown chemicals. The results showed that non-target screening with the larger databases generally provided better results compared with smaller suspect lists. However, two suspect screening approaches with patRoon were also good options to study specific chemicals in PD. The combination of chromatographic methods (RP and HILIC) as well as two ionization modes (positive and negative) enhanced the coverage of chemicals in the biological samples. While most metabolomics studies in PD have focused on blood and cerebrospinal fluid, we found a higher number of relevant features in feces, such as alanine betaine or nicotinamide, which can be directly metabolized by gut microbiota. This highlights the potential role of gut dysbiosis in PD development.",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,2022,Begoña Talavera Andújar; Dagny Aurich; Velma T E Aho; Randolph R Singh; Tiejun Cheng; Leonid Zaslavsky; Evan E Bolton; Brit Mollenhauer; Paul Wilmes; Emma L Schymanski
36001607,A Metabologenomic approach reveals alterations in the gut microbiota of a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"The key role played by host-microbiota interactions on human health, disease onset and progression, and on host response to treatments has increasingly emerged in the latest decades. Indeed, dysbiosis has been associated to several human diseases such as obesity, diabetes, cancer and also neurodegenerative disease, such as Parkinson, Huntington and Alzheimer's disease (AD), although whether causative, consequence or merely an epiphenomenon is still under investigation. In the present study, we performed a metabologenomic analysis of stool samples from a mouse model of AD, the 3xTgAD. We found a significant change in the microbiota of AD mice compared to WT, with a longitudinal divergence of the F/B ratio, a parameter suggesting a gut dysbiosis. Moreover, AD mice showed a significant decrease of some amino acids, while data integration revealed a dysregulated production of desaminotyrosine (DAT) and dihydro-3-coumaric acid. Collectively, our data show a dysregulated gut microbiota associated to the onset and progression of AD, also indicating that a dysbiosis can occur prior to significant clinical signs, evidenced by early SCFA alterations, compatible with gut inflammation.",PloS one,2022,Francesco Favero; Elettra Barberis; Mara Gagliardi; Stefano Espinoza; Liliana Contu; Stefano Gustincich; Francesca Boccafoschi; Chiara Borsotti; Dmitry Lim; Vito Rubino; Flavio Mignone; Edoardo Pasolli; Marcello Manfredi; Silvia Zucchelli; Davide Corà; Marco Corazzari
35959396,<i>Porphyromonas gingivalis</i>: A key role in Parkinson's disease with cognitive impairment?,"Cognitive impairment (CI) is a common complication of Parkinson's disease (PD). The major features of Parkinson's disease with cognitive impairment (PD-CI) include convergence of α-Synuclein (α-Syn) and Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like pathologies, neuroinflammation, and dysbiosis of gut microbiota. <i>Porphyromonas gingivalis</i> (<i>P. gingivalis</i>) is an important pathogen in periodontitis. Recent research has suggested a role of P. gingivalis and its virulence factor in the pathogenesis of PD and AD, in particular concerning neuroinflammation and deposition of α-Synuclein (α-Syn) and amyloid-β (Aβ). Furthermore, in animal models, oral <i>P. gingivalis</i> could cause neurodegeneration through regulating the gut-brain axis, suggesting an oral-gut-brain axis might exist. In this article, we discussed the pathological characteristics of PD-CI and the role of <i>P. gingivalis</i> in them.",Frontiers in neurology,2022,Dongcheng Li; Tengzhu Ren; Hao Li; Geng Liao; Xiong Zhang
36289839,Involvement of Intestinal Enteroendocrine Cells in Neurological and Psychiatric Disorders.,"Neurological and psychiatric patients have increased dramatically in number in the past few decades. However, effective treatments for these diseases and disorders are limited due to heterogeneous and unclear pathogenic mechanisms. Therefore, further exploration of the biological aspects of the disease, and the identification of novel targets to develop alternative treatment strategies, is urgently required. Systems-level investigations have indicated the potential involvement of the brain-gut axis and intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis and regulation of neurological and psychiatric disorders. While intestinal microbiota is crucial for maintaining host physiology, some important sensory and regulatory cells in the host should not be overlooked. Intestinal epithelial enteroendocrine cells (EECs) residing in the epithelium throughout intestine are the key regulators orchestrating the communication along the brain-gut-microbiota axis. On one hand, EECs sense changes in luminal microorganisms via microbial metabolites; on the other hand, they communicate with host body systems via neuroendocrine molecules. Therefore, EECs are believed to play important roles in neurological and psychiatric disorders. This review highlights the involvement of EECs and subtype cells, via secretion of endocrine molecules, in the development and regulation of neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD), schizophrenia, visceral pain, neuropathic pain, and depression. Moreover, the current paper summarizes the potential mechanism of EECs in contributing to disease pathogenesis. Examination of these mechanisms may inspire and lead to the development of new aspects of treatment strategies for neurological and psychiatric disorders in the future.",Biomedicines,2022,Liangen Yu; Yihang Li
35742813,Dual-Hit Model of Parkinson's Disease: Impact of Dysbiosis on 6-Hydroxydopamine-Insulted Mice-Neuroprotective and Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Butyrate.,"Recent evidence highlights Parkinson's disease (PD) initiation in the gut as the prodromal phase of neurodegeneration. Gut impairment due to microbial dysbiosis could affect PD pathogenesis and progression. Here, we propose a two-hit model of PD through ceftriaxone (CFX)-induced dysbiosis and gut inflammation before the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) intrastriatal injection to mimic dysfunctional gut-associated mechanisms preceding PD onset. Therefore, we showed that dysbiosis and gut damage amplified PD progression, worsening motor deficits induced by 6-OHDA up to 14 days post intrastriatal injection. This effect was accompanied by a significant increase in neuronal dopaminergic loss (reduced tyrosine hydroxylase expression and increased Bcl-2/Bax ratio). Notably, CFX pretreatment also enhanced systemic and colon inflammation of dual-hit subjected mice. The exacerbated inflammatory response ran in tandem with a worsening of colonic architecture and gut microbiota perturbation. Finally, we demonstrated the beneficial effect of post-biotic sodium butyrate in limiting at once motor deficits, neuroinflammation, and colon damage and re-shaping microbiota composition in this novel dual-hit model of PD. Taken together, the bidirectional communication of the microbiota-gut-brain axis and the recapitulation of PD prodromal/pathogenic features make this new paradigm a useful tool for testing or repurposing new multi-target compounds in the treatment of PD.",International journal of molecular sciences,2022,Carmen Avagliano; Lorena Coretti; Adriano Lama; Claudio Pirozzi; Carmen De Caro; Davide De Biase; Luigia Turco; Maria Pina Mollica; Orlando Paciello; Antonio Calignano; Rosaria Meli; Francesca Lembo; Giuseppina Mattace Raso

Probiotics are live microbes, which are found in fermented foods, beverages, and cultured milk and, when administered in an adequate dose, confer health benefits to the host. They are known as ""health-friendly bacteria"", normally residing in the human gut and involved in maintaining homeostatic conditions. Imbalance in gut microbiota results in the pathophysiology of several diseases entailing the GIT tract, skin, immune system, inflammation, and gut-brain axis. Recently, the use of probiotics has gained tremendous interest, because of their profound effects on the management of these disease conditions. Recent findings suggest that probiotics enrichment in different human and mouse disease models showed promising beneficial effects and results in the amelioration of disease symptoms. Thus, this review focuses on the current probiotics-based products, different disease models, variable markers measured during trials, and evidence obtained from past studies on the use of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of different diseases, covering the skin to the central nervous system diseases.",International journal of molecular sciences,2022,Arifa Un-Nisa; Amjad Khan; Muhammad Zakria; Sami Siraj; Shakir Ullah; Muhammad Khalid Tipu; Muhammad Ikram; Myeong Ok Kim
36364961,Direct Action of Non-Digestible Oligosaccharides against a Leaky Gut.,"The epithelial monolayer is the primary determinant of mucosal barrier function, and tight junction (TJ) complexes seal the paracellular space between the adjacent epithelial cells and represent the main ""gate-keepers"" of the paracellular route. Impaired TJ functionality results in increased permeation of the ""pro-inflammatory"" luminal contents to the circulation that induces local and systemic inflammatory and immune responses, ultimately triggering and/or perpetuating (chronic) systemic inflammatory disorders. Increased gut leakiness is associated with intestinal and systemic disease states such as inflammatory bowel disease and neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease. Modulation of TJ dynamics is an appealing strategy aiming at inflammatory conditions associated with compromised intestinal epithelial function. Recently there has been a growing interest in nutraceuticals, particularly in non-digestible oligosaccharides (NDOs). NDOs confer innumerable health benefits via microbiome-shaping and gut microbiota-related immune responses, including enhancement of epithelial barrier integrity. Emerging evidence supports that NDOs also exert health-beneficial effects on microbiota independently via direct interactions with intestinal epithelial and immune cells. Among these valuable features, NDOs promote barrier function by directly regulating TJs via AMPK-, PKC-, MAPK-, and TLR-associated pathways. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the epithelial barrier-protective effects of different NDOs with a special focus on their microbiota-independent modulation of TJs.",Nutrients,2022,Maria Eleni Mavrogeni; Mostafa Asadpoor; Paul A J Henricks; Ali Keshavarzian; Gert Folkerts; Saskia Braber

The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs) of gut microbiota-based models for Hoehn & Yahr (HY) stages 1 and 2 were 0.799 and 0.705, respectively. Similarly, gut microbiota predicted the progression of Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) III scores in an early stage of PD with AUROC = 0.728. Decreases of short-chain fatty acid-producing genera, Fusicatenibacter, Faecalibacterium, and Blautia, as well as an increase of mucin-degrading genus Akkermansia, predicted accelerated disease progression. The four genera remained unchanged in two years in PD, indicating that the taxonomic changes were not the consequences of disease progression.

36240098,Association Between Microbial Tyrosine Decarboxylase Gene and Levodopa Responsiveness in Patients With Parkinson Disease.,"Interindividual variability in levodopa efficacy is a challenge for the personalized treatment of Parkinson disease (PD). Gut microbiota might represent a new approach for personalized medicine. Recently, a novel microbial levodopa metabolism pathway was identified, which is mediated by tyrosine decarboxylase mainly encoded by tyrosine decarboxylase gene (<i>tyrDC</i>) in <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i>. In this study, we aimed to identify whether the abundance of microbial <i>tyrDC</i> gene and <i>E faecalis</i> is associated with levodopa responsiveness and could predict the drug response.This cross-sectional study enrolled patients with PD between December 2019 and January 2022 and evaluated levodopa responsiveness using a levodopa challenge test. Patients were stratified into moderate and good responders based on levodopa responsiveness. The <i>tyrDC</i> gene and <i>E. faecalis</i> abundance in fecal samples were measured using quantitative real-time PCR. Plasma levodopa concentrations were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis. The predictive models for levodopa responsiveness were constructed and verified through cross-validation and external validation.A total of 101 patients with PD were enrolled in the primary cohort and 43 were enrolled in the external validation cohort. Moderate responders had higher abundances of the <i>tyrDC</i> gene (3.6 [3.1-4.3] vs 2.6 [2.1-2.9], <i>p</i> < 0.001) and <i>E faecalis</i> (3.2 [2.5-4.4] vs 2.6 [2.1-3.6], <i>p</i> = 0.010) than good responders. The <i>tyrDC</i> gene abundance was independently associated with levodopa responsiveness (OR: 5.848; 95% CI: 2.664-12.838; <i>p</i> < 0.001). Notably, <i>tyrDC</i> gene abundance showed certain discriminative power for levodopa responsiveness in primary cohort (sensitivity: 80.0%; specificity: 84.3%; area under the curve [AUC]: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.77-0.93; <i>p</i> < 0.001) and external validation cohort (sensitivity: 85.0%; specificity: 95.7%; AUC: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.89-1.02; <i>p</i> < 0.001). The prediction of levodopa responsiveness based on <i>tyrDC</i> gene abundance had good calibration and discrimination in cross-validation (C-index in training and test sets: 0.856 and 0.851, respectively) and external validation (C-index: 0.952).The microbial <i>tyrDC</i> gene abundance could serve as a potential biomarker of levodopa responsiveness. Novel strategies targeting the <i>tyrDC</i> gene may provide new approaches for personalized levodopa treatment.",Neurology,2022,Yi Zhang; Xiaoqin He; Chengjun Mo; Xiaoqian Liu; Jian Li; Zheng Yan; Yiwei Qian; Yiqiu Lai; Shaoqing Xu; Xiaodong Yang; Qin Xiao
35806985,The Risk of Developing Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Meta-Analysis.,"Recently, a growing body of research has linked gut microbiota dysbiosis to central nervous system diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD), and has suggested that AD and PD pathology may take its origin from chronic inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. Thus, this study aimed to elucidate whether inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with a higher risk of developing AD and PD as compared to the non-IBD population by conducting a meta-analysis. A thorough search of Pubmed and Embase databases was performed to identify all relevant articles. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were analyzed using a fixed-effect model. To assess publication bias and heterogeneity among the studies, Egger’s test and L’Abbé plots were used, respectively. A total of eight eligible studies were included in this meta-analysis. No significant heterogeneity or significant publication bias was detected. The risk of developing AD in IBD patients was higher than in non-IBD patients (OR = 0.37; 95% CI = 0.14−1.00; p = 0.05), and there was a relationship between the occurrence of AD and Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis (OR = 0.11; 95% CI = 0.04−0.30; p < 0.0001, OR = 0.14; 95% CI = 0.04−0.49; p = 0.0024, respectively). The risk of developing both of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, AD and PD, was also significantly higher in patients diagnosed with Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis (OR = 0.21; 95% CI = 0.09−0.49; p = 0.0003, OR = 0.25; 95% CI = 0.13−0.51; p = 0.0001, respectively). This meta-analysis revealed a higher risk of AD and PD among CD and UC patients compared to the general population. It may suggest a key role for the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of not only Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis but also AD and PD. The identification of this potential risk may provide earlier preventive measures to be implemented to reduce comorbidity and mortality rate.",Journal of clinical medicine,2022,Marta Szandruk-Bender; Benita Wiatrak; Adam Szeląg
36422338,Role of Probiotics and Diet in the Management of Neurological Diseases and Mood States: A Review.,"Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's diseases (PD) are common in older people. Autism spectrum disorders (ASD), anxiety, depression, stress, and cognitive impairment are prevalent among people irrespective of age. The incidence of neurological disorders has been increasing in recent decades. Communication between the gut microbiota and the brain is intrinsically complicated, and it is necessary for the maintenance of the gut, brain, and immune functions of the host. The bidirectional link among the gut, gut microbiota and the brain is designated as the ""microbiota-gut-brain axis."" Gut microbiota modulates the host immune system and functions of tissue barriers such as gut mucosa and blood-brain barrier (BBB). Gut microbial dysfunction disturbs the gut-brain interplay and may contribute to various gut disorders, neurocognitive and psychiatric disorders. Probiotics could protect intestinal integrity, enhance gut functions, promote intestinal mucosal and BBB functions, and support the synthesis of brain-derived neurotrophic factors, which enhance neuronal survival and differentiation. Probiotics could be considered an adjunct therapy to manage metabolic and psychiatric diseases. Predominantly, <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Bifidobacterium</i> strains are documented as potent probiotics, which help to maintain the bidirectional interactions between the gut and brain. The consumption of probiotics and probiotics containing fermented foods could improve the gut microbiota. The diet impacts gut microbiota, and a balanced diet could maintain the integrity of gut-brain communication by facilitating the production of neurotrophic factors and other neuropeptides. However, the beneficial effects of probiotics and diet might depend upon several factors, including strain, dosage, duration, age, host physiology, etc. This review summarizes the importance and involvement of probiotics and diet in neuroprotection and managing representative neurological disorders, injuries and mood states.",Microorganisms,2022,Subramanian Thangaleela; Bhagavathi Sundaram Sivamaruthi; Periyanaina Kesika; Chaiyavat Chaiyasut

35844606,T<sub>REG</sub>king From Gut to Brain: The Control of Regulatory T Cells Along the Gut-Brain Axis.,"The human gastrointestinal tract has an enormous and diverse microbial community, termed microbiota, that is necessary for the development of the immune system and tissue homeostasis. In contrast, microbial dysbiosis is associated with various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases as well as neurological disorders in humans by affecting not only the immune system in the gastrointestinal tract but also other distal organs. FOXP3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a subset of CD4<sup>+</sup> helper T cell lineages that function as a gatekeeper for immune activation and are essential for peripheral autoimmunity prevention. Tregs are crucial to the maintenance of immunological homeostasis and tolerance at barrier regions. Tregs reside in both lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues, and tissue-resident Tregs have unique tissue-specific phenotype and distinct function. The gut microbiota has an impact on Tregs development, accumulation, and function in periphery. Tregs, in turn, modulate antigen-specific responses aimed towards gut microbes, which supports the host-microbiota symbiotic interaction in the gut. Recent studies have indicated that Tregs interact with a variety of resident cells in central nervous system (CNS) to limit the progression of neurological illnesses such as ischemic stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease.

35600818,Network Pharmacology and Absolute Bacterial Quantification-Combined Approach to Explore the Mechanism of Tianqi Pingchan Granule Against 6-OHDA-Induced Parkinson's Disease in Rats.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. Tianqi Pingchan Granule (TPG) is a clinically effective formula of traditional Chinese medicine to treat PD. However, the therapeutic effect and underlying mechanisms of TPG in PD remain unclear. Based on network pharmacology, the corresponding targets of TPG were identified using the Traditional Chinese Medicine Database and Analysis Platform Database. Differentially expressed genes in PD were obtained from the Therapeutic Target Database, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, GeneCards, and DrugBank databases. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks of intersected targets were constructed using the STRING database and visualized using Cytoscape. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed, and the pathways directly related to the pathogenesis of PD were integrated manually. Furthermore, <i>in vivo</i> studies were carried out based on network pharmacology. The gut microbiota, peripheral inflammatory cytokines, and glia-mediated neuroinflammation in substantia nigra were evaluated. A total of 99 target genes were intersected between targets of TPG and deferentially expressed genes in PD. The PPI network analysis indicated the proinflammatory cytokine as essential targets. GO and KEGG analyses indicated that inflammatory response and its related signaling pathways were closely associated with TPG-mediated PD treatment. <i>In vivo</i> studies revealed that class Negativicutes and order Selenomonadales decreased, whereas class Mollicutes, order Enterobacteriales, and Mycoplasmatales increased in fecal samples of PD rats <i>via</i> 16S rRNA sequence analysis. Furthermore, the function prediction methods purposely revealed that TPG therapy may be involved in flavonoid biosynthesis, which have anti-inflammatory properties. In addition, <i>in vivo</i> studies revealed that TPG exposure was found to not only attenuate the production of peripheral inflammatory cytokines but also inhibit the activation of microglia and astrocytes in substantia nigra of PD rats. Through network pharmacology and <i>in vivo</i> experiment-combined approach, the mechanisms of TPG in the treatment of PD were revealed, and the role of TPG in the regulation of gut microbiota and inflammatory response was confirmed.",Frontiers in nutrition,2022,Zhihua Liu; Jiahao Zhao; Shuyuan Yang; Yu Zhang; Lu Song; Na Wu; Zhenguo Liu
33050862,Engineered Probiotic and Prebiotic Nutraceutical Supplementations in Combating Non-communicable Disorders: A Review.,"Nutritional supplementations are a form of nutrition sources that may help in improving the health complexities of a person throughout his or her life span. Being also categorized as food supplementations, nutraceuticals are products that are extracted from edible sources with medical benefits as well as primary nutritional values. Nutraceuticals can be considered as functional foods. There are evidences that nutraceutical supplementations can alter the commensal gut microbiota and help to prevent or fight against chronic non-communicable degenerative diseases in adults, including neurological disorders (Autism Spectrum Disorder [ASD], Parkinson's disease [PD], Multiple sclerosis [MS]) and metabolic disorders (Type-II diabetes, obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease). They can even lessen the complexities of preterm babies like extra-uterine growth restriction, necrotizing enterocolitis, infant eczema and allergy (during pregnancy) as well as bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Molecular perception of inflammatory and apoptotic modulators regulating the pathogenesis of these health risks, their control and management by probiotics and prebiotics could further emphasize the scientific overview of their utility. In this study, the pivotal role of nutraceutical supplementations in regulating or modulating molecular pathways in the above non-communicable diseases is briefly described. This work also gives an overall introduction of the sophisticated genome-editing techniques and advanced delivery systems in therapeutic activities applicable under these health risks.",Current pharmaceutical biotechnology,2022,Rout George Kerry; Gitishree Das; Upendarrao Golla; Maria Del Pilar Rodriguez-Torres; Han-Seung Shin; Jayanta Kumar Patra
36516809,Neurotensin-Binding Immunoglobulin G in Patients with Parkinson's Disease.,"Neurotensin (NTS) is a 13-amino acid neuropeptide functionally linked with the brain dopaminergic system via expression of the NTS peptide or its receptor in dopamine neurons. Neuropeptide-binding immunoglobulins (Igs) are present in humans and can be involved in both physiological and pathological processes. Considering the functional link between NTS and dopamine neurons, we studied the occurrence of NTS-binding IgG autoantibodies in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).Plasma levels of NTS-binding IgG were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in both male and female PD patents and in age-matched healthy controls. Possible microbial origin of NTS cross-reactive IgG was analyzed by sequence alignment of the 6-amino acid C-terminal NTS pharmacophore with bacterial and viral proteins from the public NCBI database.NTS-binding IgG were detected in the plasma of all study subjects, while their levels were consistently lower in PD patients versus controls (p = 0.0001), independently from age or sex of the study participants. Moreover, PD patients with a more severe stage (2.5-3.0) of the disease had lower levels of NTS-binding IgG (p = 0.0004) than those with a milder stage (1.0-2.0). Furthermore, PD patients taking amantadine or high doses of levodopa had higher levels of NTS-binding IgG than those without medication. Contiguous sequence homology for the NTS pharmacophore was present in several microbial proteins occurring in human gut microbiota.The study revealed that NTS-binding IgG occur naturally in humans and that PD patients display their low plasma levels accentuated by disease severity. The functional significance of this finding and its relevance to the pathophysiology of PD, including putative link to gut microbiota, remain to be studied.",Neuroimmunomodulation,2023,Zamira M Muruzheva; Daniil S Egorov; Margarita T Absalyamova; Dmitrii S Traktirov; Marina N Karpenko; Serguei O Fetissov
35272713,The microbiota restrains neurodegenerative microglia in a model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"The gut microbiota can affect neurologic disease by shaping microglia, the primary immune cell in the central nervous system (CNS). While antibiotics improve models of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and the C9orf72 model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), antibiotics worsen disease progression the in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> model of ALS. In ALS, microglia transition from a homeostatic to a neurodegenerative (MGnD) phenotype and contribute to disease pathogenesis, but whether this switch can be affected by the microbiota has not been investigated.In this short report, we found that a low-dose antibiotic treatment worsened motor function and decreased survival in the SOD1 mice, which is consistent with studies using high-dose antibiotics. We also found that co-housing SOD1 mice with wildtype mice had no effect on disease progression. We investigated changes in the microbiome and found that antibiotics reduced Akkermansia and butyrate-producing bacteria, which may be beneficial in ALS, and cohousing had little effect on the microbiome. To investigate changes in CNS resident immune cells, we sorted spinal cord microglia and found that antibiotics downregulated homeostatic genes and increased neurodegenerative disease genes in SOD1 mice. Furthermore, antibiotic-induced changes in microglia preceded changes in motor function, suggesting that this may be contributing to disease progression.Our findings suggest that the microbiota play a protective role in the SOD1 model of ALS by restraining MGnD microglia, which is opposite to other neurologic disease models, and sheds new light on the importance of disease-specific interactions between microbiota and microglia.

36615279,Potential Benefits of Anthocyanins in Chronic Disorders of the Central Nervous System.,"Anthocyanins have been shown to be effective in chronic diseases because of their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects together with changes in the gut microbiota and modulation of neuropeptides such as insulin-like growth factor-1. This review will examine whether these mechanisms may be effective to moderate the symptoms of disorders of the central nervous system in humans, including schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, autism spectrum disorder, depression, anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and epilepsy. Thus, anthocyanins from fruits and berries should be considered as complementary interventions to improve these chronic disorders.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,Sunil K Panchal; Lindsay Brown
35362965,Light-Sensitive <i>Lactococcus lactis</i> for Microbe-Gut-Brain Axis Regulating via Upconversion Optogenetic Micro-Nano System.,"The discovery of the gut-brain axis has proven that brain functions can be affected by the gut microbiota's metabolites, so there are significant opportunities to explore new tools to regulate gut microbiota and thus work on the brain functions. Meanwhile, engineered bacteria as oral live biotherapeutic agents to regulate the host's healthy homeostasis have attracted much attention in microbial therapy. However, whether this strategy is able to remotely regulate the host's brain function <i>in vivo</i> has not been investigated. Here, we engineered three blue-light-responsive probiotics as oral live biotherapeutic agents. They are spatiotemporally delivered and controlled by the upconversion optogenetic micro-nano system. This micro-nano system promotes the small intestine targeting and production of the exogenous <i>L. lactis</i> in the intestines, which realizes precise manipulation of brain functions including anxiety behavior, Parkinson's disease, and vagal afferent. The noninvasive and real-time probiotic intervention strategy makes the communiation from the gut to the host more controllable, which will enable the potential for engineered microbes accurately and effectively regulating a host's health.",ACS nano,2022,Huizhuo Pan; Tao Sun; Meihui Cui; Ning Ma; Chun Yang; Jing Liu; Gaoju Pang; Baona Liu; Lianyue Li; Xinyu Zhang; Weiwen Zhang; Jin Chang; Hanjie Wang
35563197,Bacteria-Derived Protein Aggregates Contribute to the Disruption of Host Proteostasis.,"Neurodegenerative protein conformational diseases are characterized by the misfolding and aggregation of metastable proteins encoded within the host genome. The host is also home to thousands of proteins encoded within exogenous genomes harbored by bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Yet, their contributions to host protein-folding homeostasis, or proteostasis, remain elusive. Recent studies, including our previous work, suggest that bacterial products contribute to the toxic aggregation of endogenous host proteins. We refer to these products as bacteria-derived protein aggregates (BDPAs). Furthermore, antibiotics were recently associated with an increased risk for neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-possibly by virtue of altering the composition of the human gut microbiota. Other studies have shown a negative correlation between disease progression and antibiotic administration, supporting their protective effect against neurodegenerative diseases. These contradicting studies emphasize the complexity of the human gut microbiota, the gut-brain axis, and the effect of antibiotics. Here, we further our understanding of bacteria's effect on host protein folding using the model <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. We employed genetic and chemical methods to demonstrate that the proteotoxic effect of bacteria on host protein folding correlates with the presence of BDPAs. Furthermore, the abundance and proteotoxicity of BDPAs are influenced by gentamicin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic that induces protein misfolding, and by butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid that we previously found to affect host protein aggregation and the associated toxicity. Collectively, these results increase our understanding of host-bacteria interactions in the context of protein conformational diseases.",International journal of molecular sciences,2022,Alyssa C Walker; Rohan Bhargava; Autumn S Dove; Amanda S Brust; Ali A Owji; Daniel M Czyż
36686268,High levels of <i>Bifidobacteriaceae</i> are associated with the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.,"The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is complex and there are no biomarkers for early identification. Many studies have reported altered gut microbiota in patients with PD compared with healthy individuals. However, results from previous studies vary across countries.The aim of this study was to identify gut microbiota biomarkers that could be used as a marker for the diagnosis of PD.Firstly, the differential gut microbiota was obtained by meta-analysis, and then the results of meta-analysis were validated through metagenomic cohort. Finally, the ROC curve was drawn based on the metagenomic validation results.The meta-analysis showed a lower relative abundance of <i>Prevotellaceae</i> (<i>p</i> < 0.00001) and <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.002), and a higher of <i>Ruminococcaceae</i> (<i>p</i> < 0.00001), <i>Christensenellaceae</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.03), <i>Bifidobacteriaceae</i> (<i>p</i> < 0.00001), and <i>Verrucomicrobiaceae</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.02) in patients with PD. Only <i>Bifidobacteriaceae</i> was also at high levels in the validation cohort of the metagenome. Meanwhile, three species from the <i>Bifidobacteriaceae</i>, including <i>Scardovia_inopinata</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.022), <i>Bifidobacterium_dentium</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.005), and <i>Scardovia_wiggsiae</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.024) were also high. The ROC curve showed that the three species (71.2%) from <i>Bifidobacteriaceae</i> had good predictive efficiency for PD.Elevated <i>Bifidobacteriaceae</i> may be associated with PD. Elevated three species from the <i>Bifidobacteriaceae</i>, including <i>Scardovia_inopinata</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium_dentium</i> and <i>Scardovia_wiggsiae</i> may provide new potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of PD.",Frontiers in integrative neuroscience,2022,ShuJia Zuo; HaiJing Wang; Qiang Zhao; Jie Tang; Min Wang; Yu Zhang; Ming Sang; Jing Tian; Puqing Wang
35924055,Neuroprotective Effects of Oligosaccharides From <i>Periplaneta Americana</i> on Parkinson's Disease Models <i>In Vitro</i> and <i>In Vivo</i>.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the neurodegenerative diseases that is characterized by obvious motor and some nonmotor symptoms. Various therapeutics failed in the effective treatment of PD because of impaired neurological function in the brain and various complications. <i>Periplaneta Americana</i> oligosaccharides (OPA), the main active ingredients extracted from the medicine residues of <i>Periplaneta Americana</i> (<i>P. Americana</i>), have been reported to exert anti-inflammatory effects. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the possible mechanisms of OPA against 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP<sup>+</sup>)-induced apotosis in SH-SY5Y cells and its potential neuroprotective effects in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD subacute model mice. The data demonstrated that OPA significantly reversed the MPP<sup>+</sup>-induced decrease in SH-SY5Y cell viability, reduced the proportion of apoptotic cells, and protected SH-SY5Y cells from apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner by regulating the expression of apoptosis-related genes. Furthermore, OPA also alleviated the motor dysfunction of PD model mice, prevented the loss of tyrosine hydroxylase positive cells, suppressed the apoptosis of substantia nigra cells, and improved the dysbiosis of gut microbiota <i>in vivo</i>, suggesting that OPA demonstrated a significantly neuroprotective effect on PD model mice. These results indicated that OPA might be the possibility of PD therapeutics with economic utility and high safety.",Frontiers in pharmacology,2022,Miao-Miao Liu; Nan Zhou; Na Jiang; Kai-Min Lu; Chuan-Fang Wu; Jin-Ku Bao
36110534,Global trends in research on miRNA-microbiome interaction from 2011 to 2021: A bibliometric analysis.,"An increasing number of research suggests that the microRNA (miRNA)-microbiome interaction plays an essential role in host health and diseases. This bibliometric analysis aimed to identify the status of global scientific output, research hotspots, and frontiers regarding the study of miRNA-microbiome interaction over the past decade. We retrieved miRNA-microbiome-related studies published from 2011 to 2021 from the Web of Science Core Collection database; the R package bibliometrix was used to analyze bibliometric indicators, and VOSviewer was used to visualize the field status, hotspots, and research trends of miRNA-microbiome interplay. In total, 590 articles and reviews were collected. A visual analysis of the results showed that significant increase in the number of publications over time. China produced the most papers, and the United States contributed the highest number of citations. Shanghai Jiaotong University and the University of California Davis were the most active institutions in the field. Most publications were published in the areas of biochemistry and molecular biology. Yu Aiming was the most prolific writer, as indicated by the h-index and m-index, and Liu Shirong was the most commonly co-cited author. A paper published in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences in 2017 had the highest number of citations. The keywords ""expression"" and ""gut microbiota"" appeared most frequently, and the top three groups of diseases that appeared among keywords were cancer (colorectal, et al.), inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), and neurological disorders (anxiety, Parkinson's disease, et al.). This bibliometric study revealed that most studies have focused on miRNAs (e.g., miR-21, miR-155, and miR-146a), gut microbes (e.g., <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, and <i>Fusobacterium nucleatum</i>), and gut bacteria metabolites (e.g., butyric acid), which have the potential to improve the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of diseases. We found that therapeutic strategies targeting the miRNA-microbiome axis focus on miRNA drugs produced <i>in vitro</i>; however, some studies suggest that <i>in vivo</i> fermentation can greatly increase the stability and reduce the degradation of miRNA. Therefore, this method is worthy of further research.",Frontiers in pharmacology,2022,Xiang-Yun Yan; Jun-Peng Yao; Yan-Qiu Li; Wei Zhang; Meng-Han Xi; Min Chen; Ying Li
35127957,Molecular and pharmacological aspects of piperine as a potential molecule for disease prevention and management: evidence from clinical trials.,"Piperine is a type of amide alkaloid that exhibits pleiotropic properties like antioxidant, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antihypertensive, hepatoprotective, neuroprotective and enhancing bioavailability and fertility-related activities. Piperine has the ability to alter gastrointestinal disorders, drug-metabolizing enzymes, and bioavailability of several drugs. The present review explores the available clinical and preclinical data, nanoformulations, extraction process, structure-activity relationships, molecular docking, bioavailability enhancement of phytochemicals and drugs, and brain penetration properties of piperine in the prevention, management, and treatment of various diseases and disorders.Piperine provides therapeutic benefits in patients suffering from diabetes, obesity, arthritis, oral cancer, breast cancer, multiple myeloma, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, cerebral stroke, cardiovascular diseases, kidney diseases, inflammatory diseases, and rhinopharyngitis. The molecular basis for the pleiotropic activities of piperine is based on its ability to regulate multiple signaling molecules such as cell cycle proteins, anti-apoptotic proteins, P-glycoprotein, cytochrome P450 3A4, multidrug resistance protein 1, breast cancer resistance protein, transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 proinflammatory cytokine, nuclear factor-κB, c-Fos, cAMP response element-binding protein, activation transcription factor-2, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma, Human G-quadruplex DNA, Cyclooxygenase-2, Nitric oxide synthases-2, MicroRNA, and coronaviruses. Piperine also regulates multiple signaling pathways such as Akt/mTOR/MMP-9, 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase-activated NLR family pyrin domain containing-3 inflammasome, voltage-gated K+ current, PKCα/ERK1/2, NF-κB/AP-1/MMP-9, Wnt/β-catenin, JNK/P38 MAPK, and gut microbiota.Based on the current evidence, piperine can be the potential molecule for treatment of disease, and its significance of this molecule in the clinic is discussed.",Beni-Suef University journal of basic and applied sciences,2022,Amit Kumar Tripathi; Anup Kumar Ray; Sunil Kumar Mishra
36687704,Mechanisms of the <i>Ping-wei-san plus</i> herbal decoction against Parkinson's disease: Multiomics analyses.,"Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder involving loss of dopaminergic neurons. Multiple studies implicate the microbiota-gut-brain axis in Parkinson's disease pathophysiology. <i>Ping-wei-san plus</i> Herbal Decoction, a traditional Chinese medicine composition with beneficial effects in Parkinson's disease, may have a complex array of actions. Here we sought to determine whether gut microbiota and metabolic pathways are involved in <i>Ping-wei-san plus</i> herbal therapy for Parkinson's disease and to identify functional pathways to guide research.The model of Parkinson's disease were induced with the rotenone. The <i>Ping-wei-san plus</i> group received the PWP herbal decoction for 90 days, after which all groups were analyzed experimentally. PWP herbal treatment improved motor behavior and emotional performance, balanced gut microbiota, and benefited dietary metabolism. Tandem Mass Tags mass spectrometry identified many differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in the substantia nigra and duodenum in the PWP group, and these DEPs were enriched in pathways such as those involving cAMP signaling, glutamatergic synapses, dopaminergic synapses, and ribosome-rich functions in the gut. The PWP group showed increases in recombinant tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase 3, and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine rich repeat, and pyrin domain containing proteins 6 in the substantia nigra and decreased parkin, gasdermin D, recombinant tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase 3, and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine rich repeat and pyrin domain containing proteins 6 in the duodenum.In conclusion, this study combined gut microbiota, metabolomics, and proteomics to evaluate the mechanism of action of <i>Ping-wei-san plus</i> on Parkinson's disease and revealed that PWP herbal treatment modulated gut microbiota, altered metabolite biological pathways, and affected functional pathway protein expression in Parkinson's disease mice, resulting in therapeutic effects.",Frontiers in nutrition,2022,Ding Li; Hong-Juan You; Guo-Jie Hu; Ru-Yong Yao; An-Mu Xie; Xiao-Yuan Li
35257836,Central dopaminergic control of cell proliferation in the colonic epithelium.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease, mainly characterized by the loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra. Several non-motor symptoms, including those associated with gastrointestinal dysfunction, precede the classical motor symptoms in PD. However, the mechanisms underlying gastrointestinal dysfunction in the prodromal phase of PD remain elusive. Here, we investigated the contribution of the central DA system to cell proliferation in the colonic epithelium. Degeneration of nigrostriatal DA pathway induced by striatal 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) injection resulted in a marked reduction in cell proliferation in the colonic epithelium as assessed by Ki-67 and bromodeoxyuridine labeling assays. RNA-sequencing analysis confirmed the suppression of cell cycle-related gene expression in the colonic epithelium of 6-OHDA-lesioned mice. Mesencephalic DA neuron degeneration also caused the gut microbiota dysbiosis. Moreover, 6-OHDA-lesioned mice showed profoundly increased vulnerability to dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis. Together, our study uncovers a crucial role for the integrity of nigral DA neurons in the maintenance of colonic epithelial cell homeostasis. Our data also provide a new strategy for protecting intestinal homeostasis in PD.",Neuroscience research,2022,Shui Yu; Hai-Rong Peng; Yu-Kai Zhang; Yan-Qing Yin; Jia-Wei Zhou
36742204,Effects of a probiotic suspension Symprove™ on a rat early-stage Parkinson's disease model.,"An increasing number of studies in recent years have focused on the role that the gut may play in Parkinson's Disease (PD) pathogenesis, suggesting that the maintenance of a healthy gut may lead to potential treatments of the disease. The health of microbiota has been shown to be directly associated with parameters that play a potential role in PD including gut barrier integrity, immunity, function, metabolism and the correct functioning of the gut-brain axis. The gut microbiota (GM) may therefore be employed as valuable indicators for early diagnosis of PD and potential targets for preventing or treating PD symptoms. Preserving the gut homeostasis using probiotics may therefore lead to a promising treatment strategy due to their known benefits in improving constipation, motor impairments, inflammation, and neurodegeneration. However, the mechanisms underlying the effects of probiotics in PD are yet to be clarified. In this project, we have tested the efficacy of an oral probiotic suspension, Symprove™, on an established animal model of PD. Symprove™, unlike many commercially available probiotics, has been shown to be resistant to gastric acidity, improve symptoms in gastrointestinal diseases and improve gut integrity in an <i>in vitro</i> PD model. In this study, we used an early-stage PD rat model to determine the effect of Symprove™ on neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in the brain and on plasma cytokine levels, GM composition and short chain fatty acid (SCFA) release. Symprove™ was shown to significantly influence both the gut and brain of the PD model. It preserved the gut integrity in the PD model, reduced plasma inflammatory markers and changed microbiota composition. The treatment also prevented the reduction in SCFAs and striatal inflammation and prevented tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive cell loss by 17% compared to that observed in animals treated with placebo. We conclude that Symprove™ treatment may have a positive influence on the symptomology of early-stage PD with obvious implications for the improvement of gut integrity and possibly delaying/preventing the onset of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in human PD patients.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2022,Marco Sancandi; Carmen De Caro; Neringa Cypaite; Nadia Marascio; Carmen Avagliano; Carmela De Marco; Emilio Russo; Andrew Constanti; Audrey Mercer
36551872,Milmed Yeast Alters the LPS-Induced M1 Microglia Cells to Form M2 Anti-Inflammatory Phenotype.,"Microglial cells polarized towards a proinflammatory phenotype are considered the main cellular players of neuroinflammation, underlying several neurodegenerative diseases. Many studies have suggested that imbalance of the gut microbial composition is associated with an increase in the pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress that underlie chronic neuroinflammatory diseases, and perturbations to the gut microbiota were detected in neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. The importance of gut-brain axis has been uncovered and the relevance of an appropriate microbiota balance has been highlighted. Probiotic treatment, rebalancing the gut microbioma, may reduce inflammation. We show that Milmed yeast, obtained from <i>S. cerevisiae</i> after exposure to electromagnetic millimeter wavelengths, induces a reversal of LPS-M1 polarized microglia towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype, as demonstrated morphologically by the recovery of resting phenotype by microglia, by the decrease in the mRNAs of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α and in the expression of iNOS. Moreover, Milmed stimulated the secretion of IL-10 and the expression of Arginase-1, cell markers of M2 anti-inflammatory polarized cells. The present findings data suggest that Milmed may be considered to be a probiotic with diversified anti-inflammatory activity, capable of directing the polarization of microglial cells.",Biomedicines,2022,Federica Armeli; Beatrice Mengoni; Elisa Maggi; Cristina Mazzoni; Adele Preziosi; Patrizia Mancini; Rita Businaro; Thomas Lenz; Trevor Archer
36168204,<i>Agathobaculum butyriciproducens</i> Shows Neuroprotective Effects in a 6-OHDA-Induced Mouse Model of Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second-most prevalent neurodegenerative disease and is characterized by dopaminergic neuronal death in the midbrain. Recently, the association between alterations in PD pathology and the gut microbiota has been explored. Microbiota-targeted interventions have been suggested as a novel therapeutic approach for PD. <i>Agathobaculum butyriciproducens</i> SR79<sup>T</sup> (SR79) is an anaerobic bacterium. Previously, we showed that SR79 treatment induced cognitive improvement and reduced Alzheimer's disease pathologies in a mouse model. In this study, we hypothesized that SR79 treatment may have beneficial effects on PD pathology. To investigate the therapeutic effects of SR79 on PD, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced mouse models were used. D-Amphetamine sulfate (d-AMPH)-induced behavioral rotations and dopaminergic cell death were analyzed in unilateral 6-OHDA-lesioned mice. Treatment with SR79 significantly decreased ipsilateral rotations induced by d-AMPH. Moreover, SR79 treatment markedly activated the AKT/GSK3β signaling pathway in the striatum. In addition, SR79 treatment affected the Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway and its downstream target genes in the striatum of 6-OHDA-lesioned mice. Our findings suggest a protective role of SR79 in 6-OHDA-induced toxicity by regulating the AKT/Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway and astrocyte activation. Thus, SR79 may be a potential microbe-based intervention and therapeutic strategy for PD.",Journal of microbiology and biotechnology,2022,Da Woon Lee; Young-Kyoung Ryu; Dong-Ho Chang; Hye-Yeon Park; Jun Go; So-Young Maeng; Dae Youn Hwang; Byoung-Chan Kim; Chul-Ho Lee; Kyoung-Shim Kim
35917710,Fecal microbiome transplantation attenuates manganese-induced neurotoxicity through regulation of the apelin signaling pathway by inhibition of autophagy in mouse brain.,"Manganese (Mn) is a common environmental pollutant. Mn exposure can lead to neurodegenerative diseases resembling Parkinson's disease, and has become a major public health concern. However, the mechanism of Mn-induced neurotoxicity in the brain is not clear. Fecal microbiome transplantation (FMT) may alleviate the neurotoxicity of Mn exposure by remodeling the gut microbiota. In this study, MnCl<sub>2</sub> (manganese chloride) was administered to mice as in drinking water (Mn: 200 mg/L), and fecal matter from donor mice was administered by oral gavage every other day to the recipient mice. The Mn exposure model (Mn group) and FMT model (Mn+FMT group) were established and analyzed 5 weeks post-exposure. The Wipi1 gene exhibited the most significant increase associated with Mn exposure and Mn+FMT treatment groups based on transcriptome analysis. Combined analysis of transcriptomics and proteomics demonstrated that the apelin signaling pathway is the main pathway affected by FMT during Mn exposure. Immunofluorescence and Western blot showed that the expression of key proteins (Beclin-1, LC-3B, and PINK1) associated with autophagy in the hippocampus was robustly activated in the Mn exposure group, but attenuation was observed in Mn+FMT mice, suggesting a critical role of autophagy in neurotoxicity induced by Mn exposure. Our research provides evidence for the neurotoxic effects of Mn exposure through autophagy activation and provides an underlying mechanism of FMT protection against Mn-induced neurotoxicity through regulation of the apelin signaling pathway.",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2022,Jingjing Liu; Xin Zhang; Xiaojuan Ta; Miaomiao Luo; Xuhong Chang; Hui Wang
35243260,<i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> induces mitochondrial calcium overload and α -synuclein aggregation in an enteroendocrine cell line.,"The gut microbiota influence neurodevelopment, modulate behavior, and contribute to neurodegenerative disorders. Several studies have consistently reported a greater abundance of <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> in Parkinson disease (PD) fecal samples. Therefore, we investigated whether <i>A.muciniphila</i>-conditioned medium (CM) could initiate α-synuclein (αSyn) misfolding in enteroendocrine cells (EEC) - a component of the gut epithelium featuring neuron-like properties. We found that <i>A</i>. <i>muciniphila</i> CM composition is influenced by the ability of the strain to degrade mucin. Our <i>in vitro</i> experiments showed that the protein-enriched fraction of mucin-free CM induces RyR-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and increased mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake leading to ROS generation and αSyn aggregation. Oral administration of <i>A. muciniphila</i> cultivated in the absence of mucin to mice led to αSyn aggregation in cholecystokinin (CCK)-positive EECs but no motor deficits were observed. Noteworthy, buffering mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> reverted the damaging effects observed. These molecular insights offer evidence that bacterial proteins can induce αSyn aggregation in EECs.",iScience,2022,Dionísio Pedro Amorim Neto; Beatriz Pelegrini Bosque; João Vitor Pereira de Godoy; Paulla Vieira Rodrigues; Dario Donoso Meneses; Katiane Tostes; Celisa Caldana Costa Tonoli; Hernandes Faustino de Carvalho; Christian González-Billault; Matheus de Castro Fonseca

Exercise training has a significant effect on the intestinal flora, so to investigate the promotion effect of exercise training on Parkinson's disease, we performed a rotarod walking training (5 times a week at 25 rpm for 20 min for 8 weeks) on a chronic mouse model of Parkinson's disease induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and observed the locomotor function of mice, function of dopaminergic neurons, intestinal mucosal barrier condition, intestinal inflammation and the structure and composition of intestinal flora. The results showed in these PD mice, exercise training improved their motility, increased the dopamine (DA) content in the striatum, along with promoted the gene expression of tyrosine hydroxylase and brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the striatum, which suggests this exercise training might protect striatal dopaminergic neurons from MPTP damage; the results also showed exercise training promoted recovery from ileal pathology, reduced the gene expression of intestinal inflammatory factors, and significantly altered the composition and structure of the intestinal flora in these mice.",Behavioural brain research,2023,Yongjun Wang; Zhengjia Pu; Yiran Zhang; Zhaohui Du; Zeming Guo; Qunhua Bai
35400445,Polymannuronic acid prebiotic plus Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG probiotic as a novel synbiotic promoted their separate neuroprotection against Parkinson's disease.,"Gut microbiota (GM) dysbiosis plays key roles in aggravating Parkinson's disease (PD) and discovery of agents targeting GM may open new avenues for PD therapy. This study aims to investigate the potentially neuroprotective effects and underlying mechanisms of polymannuronic acid (PM) or Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), or their combination in a chronic PD mice model. Our results found oral administration of prebiotic PM or LGG separately or in combination for 5 weeks could prevent dopaminergic neuronal loss via improving reduced walking distance and activity or weakened muscle strength in behavior tests by enhancing tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene and/or protein expressions in the midbrain and striatum of PD mice. Strikingly, PM and LGG in combination had a much better neuroprotective effects than separate PM or LGG. PM provided neuroprotection via a short chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-mediated anti-inflammation and anti-apoptosis mechanism. The neuroprotective effects of LGG might be associated with its ability to improve the expression of striatal glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and to increase bacteria abundance of Clostridiales. When PD mice were administered with PM + LGG, PM as prebiotic favored bacterial growth (from Bacilli class to Lactobacillus genus) in the colon, which helped to improve blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity and increase brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and GDNF expressions, thereby inhibiting apoptosis in the striatum. In conclusion, PM and LGG in combination promoted their separate neuroprotection against PD. Our study discovered and testified a novel synbiotic that might be one of the ideal oral agents for PD therapy.","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2022,Xin Liu; Zhong Rui Du; Xiong Wang; Xiang Rong Sun; Qing Zhao; Fang Zhao; Wing Tak Wong; Ka Hing Wong; Xiao-Li Dong
38098067,Parkinson's disease and gut microbiota: from clinical to mechanistic and therapeutic studies.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases. The typical symptomatology of PD includes motor symptoms; however, a range of nonmotor symptoms, such as intestinal issues, usually occur before the motor symptoms. Various microorganisms inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract can profoundly influence the physiopathology of the central nervous system through neurological, endocrine, and immune system pathways involved in the microbiota-gut-brain axis. In addition, extensive evidence suggests that the gut microbiota is strongly associated with PD. This review summarizes the latest findings on microbial changes in PD and their clinical relevance, describes the underlying mechanisms through which intestinal bacteria may mediate PD, and discusses the correlations between gut microbes and anti-PD drugs. In addition, this review outlines the status of research on microbial therapies for PD and the future directions of PD-gut microbiota research.",Translational neurodegeneration,2023,Xuxiang Zhang; Beisha Tang; Jifeng Guo
37159496,Associations between gut microbiota and Parkinson disease: A bidirectional Mendelian randomization analysis.,"Parkinson disease (PD)-associated alterations in the gut microbiome have been observed in clinical and animal studies. However, it remains unclear whether this association reflects a causal effect in humans.We performed two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization using summary statistics from the international consortium MiBioGen (N = 18,340), the Framingham Heart Study (N = 2076), and the International Parkinson's Disease Genomics Consortium for PD (33,674 cases and 449,056 controls) and PD age at onset (17,996 cases).Twelve microbiota features presented suggestive associations with PD risk or age at onset. Genetically increased Bifidobacterium levels correlated with decreased PD risk (odds ratio = 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.60-0.99, p = 0.040). Conversely, high levels of five short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria (LachnospiraceaeUCG010, RuminococcaceaeUCG002, Clostridium sensustricto1, Eubacterium hallii group, and Bacillales) correlated with increased PD risk, and three SCFA-producing bacteria (Roseburia, RuminococcaceaeUCG002, and Erysipelatoclostridium) correlated with an earlier age at PD onset. Gut production of serotonin was associated with an earlier age at PD onset (beta = -0.64, 95% CI = -1.15 to -0.13, p = 0.013). In the reverse direction, genetic predisposition to PD was related to altered gut microbiota composition.These results support a bidirectional relationship between gut microbiome dysbiosis and PD, and highlight the role of elevated endogenous SCFAs and serotonin in PD pathogenesis. Future clinical studies and experimental evidence are needed to explain the observed associations and to suggest new therapeutic approaches, such as dietary probiotic supplementation.",European journal of neurology,2023,Li Jiang; Jin-Chen Li; Bei-Sha Tang; Ji-Feng Guo
37404311,Signalling cognition: the gut microbiota and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.,"Cognitive function in humans depends on the complex and interplay between multiple body systems, including the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The gut microbiota, which vastly outnumbers human cells and has a genetic potential that exceeds that of the human genome, plays a crucial role in this interplay. The microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis is a bidirectional signalling pathway that operates through neural, endocrine, immune, and metabolic pathways. One of the major neuroendocrine systems responding to stress is the HPA axis which produces glucocorticoids such as cortisol in humans and corticosterone in rodents. Appropriate concentrations of cortisol are essential for normal neurodevelopment and function, as well as cognitive processes such as learning and memory, and studies have shown that microbes modulate the HPA axis throughout life. Stress can significantly impact the MGB axis <i>via</i> the HPA axis and other pathways. Animal research has advanced our understanding of these mechanisms and pathways, leading to a paradigm shift in conceptual thinking about the influence of the microbiota on human health and disease. Preclinical and human trials are currently underway to determine how these animal models translate to humans. In this review article, we summarize the current knowledge of the relationship between the gut microbiota, HPA axis, and cognition, and provide an overview of the main findings and conclusions in this broad field.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2023,Jody A Rusch; Brian T Layden; Lara R Dugas
36593694,Gut microbiota dysbiosis in Parkinson disease: A systematic review and pooled analysis.,"The role of the gut microbiome in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease (PD) is under intense investigation, and the results presented are still very heterogeneous. These discrepancies arise not only from the highly heterogeneous pathology of PD, but also from widely varying methodologies at all stages of the workflow, from sampling to final statistical analysis. The aim of the present work is to harmonize the workflow across studies to reduce the methodological heterogeneity and to perform a pooled analysis to account for other sources of heterogeneity.We performed a systematic review to identify studies comparing the gut microbiota of PD patients to healthy controls. A workflow was designed to harmonize processing across all studies from bioinformatics processing to final statistical analysis using a Bayesian random-effects meta-analysis based on individual patient-level data.The results show that harmonizing workflows minimizes differences between statistical methods and reveals only a small set of taxa being associated with the pathogenesis of PD. Increased shares of the genera Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium and decreased shares of the genera Roseburia and Faecalibacterium were most characteristic for PD-associated microbiota.Our study summarizes evidence that reduced levels of butyrate-producing taxa in combination with possible degradation of the mucus layer by Akkermansia may promote intestinal inflammation and reduced permeability of the gut mucosal layer. This may allow potentially pathogenic metabolites to transit and enter the enteric nervous system.",European journal of neurology,2023,Sven Kleine Bardenhorst; Emanuele Cereda; Marco Severgnini; Michela Barichella; Gianni Pezzoli; Ali Keshavarzian; Alessandro Desideri; Daniele Pietrucci; Velma T E Aho; Filip Scheperjans; Falk Hildebrand; Severin Weis; Markus Egert; André Karch; Marius Vital; Nicole Rübsamen
37892440,Gut Microbiota Composition in Patients with Neurodegenerative Disorders (Parkinson's and Alzheimer's) and Healthy Controls: A Systematic Review.,"This systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current literature regarding gut microbiota composition in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to healthy controls. To identify the relevant studies, a thorough search of PubMed, Medline, and Embase was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. Out of 5627 articles, 73 studies were assessed for full-text eligibility, which led to the inclusion of 42 studies (26 PD and 16 AD studies). The risk of bias assessment showed a medium risk in 32 studies (20 PD studies and 12 AD studies), a low risk in 9 studies (5 PD studies and 4 AD studies), and 1 PD study with a high risk. Among the PD studies, 22 out of 26 studies reported a different gut microbiota composition between the PD cases and the healthy controls, and 15 out of 16 AD studies reported differences in gut microbiota composition between the AD cases and the healthy controls. The PD and AD studies consistently identified the phyla Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria as prevalent in the gut microbiota in both the healthy groups and the case groups. Microbial dysbiosis was specifically characterized in the PD studies by a high abundance of <i>Akkermansia</i>, <i>Verrucomicrobiaceae</i>, <i>Lachnospiraceae</i>, and <i>Ruminococcaceae</i> in the cases and a high abundance of <i>Blautia</i>, <i>Coprococcus</i>, <i>Prevotellaceae</i>, and <i>Roseburia</i> in the controls. Similarly, Bacteroides and Acidobacteriota were abundant in the AD cases, and <i>Acidaminococcaceae</i>, Firmicutes, <i>Lachnospiraceae</i>, and <i>Ruminiclostridium</i> were abundant in the AD controls. The microbial signature assessment showed the association of several microbial taxa, including <i>Akkermansia</i>, <i>Lachnospiraceae</i>, <i>Verrucomicrobiaceae</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, <i>Ruminococcacea</i>, and Verrucomicrobia with PD and <i>Ruminococcaceae</i>, <i>Bacteroides</i>, and Actinobacteria with AD. The microbial diversity evaluations in the PD and AD studies indicated comparable alpha diversity in some groups and distinct gut microbiota composition in others, with consistent beta diversity differences between the cases and the controls across multiple studies. The bacterial signatures identified in this study that are associated with PD and AD may offer promising prospects for efficient management and treatment approaches.",Nutrients,2023,Fatemah Sadeghpour Heravi; Kaveh Naseri; Honghua Hu
37208728,Dysbiosis of gut microbiota inhibits NMNAT2 to promote neurobehavioral deficits and oxidative stress response in the 6-OHDA-lesioned rat model of Parkinson's disease.,"New data are accumulating on gut microbial dysbiosis in Parkinson's disease (PD), while the specific mechanism remains uncharacterized. This study aims to investigate the potential role and pathophysiological mechanism of dysbiosis of gut microbiota in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced PD rat models.The shotgun metagenome sequencing data of fecal samples from PD patients and healthy individuals were obtained from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database. The diversity, abundance, and functional composition of gut microbiota were further analyzed in these data. After the exploration of the functional pathway-related genes, KEGG and GEO databases were used to obtain PD-related microarray datasets for differential expression analysis. Finally, in vivo experiments were performed to confirm the roles of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and upregulated NMNAT2 in neurobehavioral symptoms and oxidative stress response in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats.Significant differences were found in the diversity, abundance, and functional composition of gut microbiota between PD patients and healthy individuals. Dysbiosis of gut microbiota could regulate NAD<sup>+</sup> anabolic pathway to affect the occurrence and development of PD. As a NAD<sup>+</sup> anabolic pathway-related gene, NMNAT2 was poorly expressed in the brain tissues of PD patients. More importantly, FMT or overexpression of NMNAT2 alleviated neurobehavioral deficits and reduced oxidative stress in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats.Taken together, we demonstrated that dysbiosis of gut microbiota suppressed NMNAT2 expression, thus exacerbating neurobehavioral deficits and oxidative stress response in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, which could be rescued by FMT or NMNAT2 restoration.",Journal of neuroinflammation,2023,Jianjun Yu; Jianhong Meng; Zhengwei Qin; Yuan Yu; Yingxin Liang; Yanjun Wang; Dongmei Min

37600019,The gut microbiota-brain axis in neurological disorder.,"The gut microbiota (GM) plays an important role in the physiology and pathology of the host. Microbiota communicate with different organs of the organism by synthesizing hormones and regulating body activity. The interaction of the central nervous system (CNS) and gut signaling pathways includes chemical, neural immune and endocrine routes. Alteration or dysbiosis in the gut microbiota leads to different gastrointestinal tract disorders that ultimately impact host physiology because of the abnormal microbial metabolites that stimulate and trigger different physiologic reactions in the host body. Intestinal dysbiosis leads to a change in the bidirectional relationship between the CNS and GM, which is linked to the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental and neurological disorders. Increasing preclinical and clinical studies/evidence indicate that gut microbes are a possible susceptibility factor for the progression of neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In this review, we discuss the crucial connection between the gut microbiota and the central nervous system, the signaling pathways of multiple biological systems and the contribution of gut microbiota-related neurological disorders.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2023,Hanif Ullah; Safia Arbab; Yali Tian; Chang-Qing Liu; Yuwen Chen; Li Qijie; Muhammad Inayat Ullah Khan; Inam Ul Hassan; Ka Li
37913731,"Flavonoids: Their putative neurologic roles, epigenetic changes, and gut microbiota alterations in Parkinson's disease.","Parkinson's Disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by the degeneration of progressive dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra region of the human midbrain. Although just what causes PD remains a mystery, it is known that oxidative stress (OS) as well as mitochondrial dysfunction, neuro-inflammation, and insufficient neurotrophic support play a role in the disease's pathophysiology. Phytochemicals are a diverse small molecule group derived from plants that can be classified into numerous classes on the basis of their biological activities and chemical structure. Of these groups of phytochemicals, the most abundant, which has well-established anti-Parkinson's effects, are polyphenols. Flavonoids, including naringin and naringenin, genistein, kaempferol, anthocyanins, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, and baicalein are plant-based biologically active polyphenols, which have been shown to exhibit therapeutic potential when used as treatment for a variety of pathological illnesses, such as neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) and PD. Recently, it was reported that flavonoids have beneficial effects on PD, such as the protection of DA neurons, improvement of motor and cognitive abilities, regulation of signaling pathways, and modulation of OS and neuro-inflammation. In addition, by changing the composition of bacteria in gut microbiota, flavonoids reduce pathogenic strains and promote the growth of beneficial strains. In this context, the current paper will provide a literature review on the neurological roles that flavonoids play, as one of the most abundant phytochemical families, in PD.",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2023,Yasemin Açar; Duygu Ağagündüz; Paola De Cicco; Raffaele Capasso
37823531,Role of Bmal1 and Gut Microbiota in Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease Pathophysiology: The Probable Effect of Melatonin on Their Association.,"In recent years, the role of new factors in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases has been investigated. Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are the most common neurodegenerative diseases worldwide. Although pathological changes such as the accumulation of aggregated proteins in the brain and inflammatory responses are known as the main factors involved in the development of these diseases, new studies show the role of gut microbiota and circadian rhythm in the occurrence of these changes. However, the association between circadian rhythm and gut microbiota in AD and PD has not yet been investigated. Recent results propose that alterations in circadian rhythm regulators, mainly Bmal1, may regulate the abundance of gut microbiota. This correlation has been linked to the regulation of the expression of immune-related genes and Bmal-1 mediated oscillation of IgA and hydrogen peroxide production. These data seem to provide new insight into the molecular mechanism of melatonin inhibiting the progression of AD and PD. Therefore, this manuscript aims to review the role of the gut microbiota and circadian rhythm in health and AD and PD and also presents a hypothesis on the effect of melatonin on their communication.",ACS chemical neuroscience,2023,Mohammad Rafi Khezri; Ayda Esmaeili; Morteza Ghasemnejad-Berenji
36934020,Oral and intestinal dysbiosis in Parkinson's disease.,"The suspicion of an origin of Parkinson's disease (PD) at the periphery of the body and the involvement of environmental risk factors in the pathogenesis of PD have directed the attention of the scientific community towards the microbiota. The microbiota represents all the microorganisms residing both in and on a host. It plays an essential role in the physiological functioning of the host. In this article, we review the dysbiosis repeatedly demonstrated in PD and how it influences PD symptoms. Dysbiosis is associated with both motor and non-motor PD symptoms. In animal models, dysbiosis only promotes symptoms in individuals genetically susceptible to Parkinson's disease, suggesting that dysbiosis is a risk factor but not a cause of Parkinson's disease. We also review how dysbiosis contributes to the pathophysiology of PD. Dysbiosis induces numerous and complex metabolic changes, resulting in increased intestinal permeability, local and systemic inflammation, production of bacterial amyloid proteins that promote α-synuclein aggregation, as well as a decrease in short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria that have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective potential. In addition, we review how dysbiosis decreases the efficacy of dopaminergic treatments. We then discuss the interest of dysbiosis analysis as a biomarker of Parkinson's disease. Finally, we give an overview of how interventions modulating the gut microbiota such as dietary interventions, pro-biotics, intestinal decontamination and fecal microbiota transplantation could influence the course of PD.",Revue neurologique,2023,E Berthouzoz; V Lazarevic; A Zekeridou; M Castro; I Debove; S Aybek; J Schrenzel; P R Burkhard; V Fleury
37967548,Gut Frailty: Its Concept and Pathogenesis.,"There is still a considerable gap between average life expectancy and healthy life expectancy in Japan. Recent research has revealed that gut frailty may be a worsening factor for various diseases, a cause of chronic inflammation, and a precursor to frailty.Among self-reported symptoms, constipation is particularly significant as one of the key symptoms of gut frailty. Studies have demonstrated that individuals with constipation have significantly lower survival rates and are also at a higher risk of developing various diseases such as chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's disease. Various molecular mechanisms could contribute to gut frailty, and the decrease in mucus secretion is an extremely early-stage pathology. Dysbiosis of gut microbiota has a major impact on many conditions associated with gut frailty. Prebiotics, probiotics, post-biotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation are under investigation as a treatment option for gut frailty.Although the concept of gut frailty has not yet gained widespread recognition, we hope to propose more practical screening methods, diagnostic approaches, and specific interventions in the future.",Digestion,2024,Yuji Naito

37960284,Understanding the Gut-Brain Axis and Its Therapeutic Implications for Neurodegenerative Disorders.,"The gut-brain axis (GBA) is a complex bidirectional communication network connecting the gut and brain. It involves neural, immune, and endocrine communication pathways between the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the central nervous system (CNS). Perturbations of the GBA have been reported in many neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs), such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), among others, suggesting a possible role in disease pathogenesis. The gut microbiota is a pivotal component of the GBA, and alterations in its composition, known as gut dysbiosis, have been associated with GBA dysfunction and neurodegeneration. The gut microbiota might influence the homeostasis of the CNS by modulating the immune system and, more directly, regulating the production of molecules and metabolites that influence the nervous and endocrine systems, making it a potential therapeutic target. Preclinical trials manipulating microbial composition through dietary intervention, probiotic and prebiotic supplementation, and fecal microbial transplantation (FMT) have provided promising outcomes. However, its clear mechanism is not well understood, and the results are not always consistent. Here, we provide an overview of the major components and communication pathways of the GBA, as well as therapeutic approaches targeting the GBA to ameliorate NDDs.",Nutrients,2023,Yadong Zheng; Laura Bonfili; Tao Wei; Anna Maria Eleuteri
37179826,Mitochondria: It is all about energy.,"Mitochondria play a key role in both health and disease. Their function is not limited to energy production but serves multiple mechanisms varying from iron and calcium homeostasis to the production of hormones and neurotransmitters, such as melatonin. They enable and influence communication at all physical levels through interaction with other organelles, the nucleus, and the outside environment. The literature suggests crosstalk mechanisms between mitochondria and circadian clocks, the gut microbiota, and the immune system. They might even be the hub supporting and integrating activity across all these domains. Hence, they might be the (missing) link in both health and disease. Mitochondrial dysfunction is related to metabolic syndrome, neuronal diseases, cancer, cardiovascular and infectious diseases, and inflammatory disorders. In this regard, diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), and chronic pain are discussed. This review focuses on understanding the mitochondrial mechanisms of action that allow for the maintenance of mitochondrial health and the pathways toward dysregulated mechanisms. Although mitochondria have allowed us to adapt to changes over the course of evolution, in turn, evolution has shaped mitochondria. Each evolution-based intervention influences mitochondria in its own way. The use of physiological stress triggers tolerance to the stressor, achieving adaptability and resistance. This review describes strategies that could recover mitochondrial functioning in multiple diseases, providing a comprehensive, root-cause-focused, integrative approach to recovering health and treating people suffering from chronic diseases.",Frontiers in physiology,2023,Amaloha Casanova; Anne Wevers; Santiago Navarro-Ledesma; Leo Pruimboom
37389240,Epidemiology of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.,"Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is defined as an increase in the bacterial content of the small intestine above normal values. The presence of SIBO is detected in 33.8% of patients with gastroenterological complaints who underwent a breath test, and is significantly associated with smoking, bloating, abdominal pain, and anemia. Proton pump inhibitor therapy is a significant risk factor for SIBO. The risk of SIBO increases with age and does not depend on gender or race. SIBO complicates the course of a number of diseases and may be of pathogenetic significance in the development of their symptoms. SIBO is significantly associated with functional dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome, functional abdominal bloating, functional constipation, functional diarrhea, short bowel syndrome, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, lactase deficiency, diverticular and celiac diseases, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, cirrhosis, metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), primary biliary cholangitis, gastroparesis, pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, gallstone disease, diabetes, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, acromegaly, multiple sclerosis, autism, Parkinson's disease, systemic sclerosis, spondylarthropathy, fibromyalgia, asthma, heart failure, and other diseases. The development of SIBO is often associated with a slowdown in orocecal transit time that decreases the normal clearance of bacteria from the small intestine. The slowdown of this transit may be due to motor dysfunction of the intestine in diseases of the gut, autonomic diabetic polyneuropathy, and portal hypertension, or a decrease in the motor-stimulating influence of thyroid hormones. In a number of diseases, including cirrhosis, MAFLD, diabetes, and pancreatitis, an association was found between disease severity and the presence of SIBO.

The gut microbiota can also influence the metabolism of levodopa, which is the mainstay of treatment of PD. Therefore, modifying the gut microbiota by faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) could be a supportive treatment strategy.We have developed a study protocol for a single-centre, prospective, self-controlled, interventional, safety and feasibility donor-FMT pilot study with randomisation and double-blinded allocation of donor faeces. The primary objectives are feasibility and safety of FMT in patients with PD. Secondary objectives include exploring whether FMT leads to alterations in motor complications (fluctuations and dyskinesias) and PD motor and non-motor symptoms (including constipation), determining alterations in gut microbiota composition, assessing donor-recipient microbiota similarities and their association with PD symptoms and motor complications, evaluating the ease of the study protocol and examining FMT-related adverse events in patients with PD. The study population will consist of 16 patients with idiopathic PD that use levodopa and experience motor complications. They will receive FMT with faeces from one of two selected healthy human donors. FMT will be administered via a gastroscope into the duodenum, after treatment with oral vancomycin, bowel lavage and domperidone. There will be seven follow-up moments during 12 months.This study was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee Leiden Den Haag Delft (ref. P20.087).

37798868,Erythrocytic α-Synuclein and the Gut Microbiome: Kindling of the Gut-Brain Axis in Parkinson's Disease.,"Progressive spreading of α-synuclein via gut-brain axis has been hypothesized in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the source of seeding-capable α-synuclein in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) has not been fully investigated. Additionally, the mechanism by which the GIT microbiome contributes to PD pathogenesis remains to be characterized.We aimed to investigate whether blood-derived α-synuclein might contribute to PD pathology via a gut-driven pathway and involve GIT microbiota.The GIT expression of α-synuclein and the transmission of extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from erythrocytes/red blood cells (RBCs), with their cargo α-synuclein, to the GIT were explored with various methods, including radioactive labeling of RBC-EVs and direct analysis of the transfer of α-synuclein protein. The potential role of microbiota on the EVs transmission was further investigated by administering butyrate, the short-chain fatty acids produced by gut microbiota and studying mice with different α-synuclein genotypes.This study demonstrated that RBC-EVs can effectively transport α-synuclein to the GIT in a region-dependent manner, along with variations closely associated with regional differences in the expression of gut-vascular barrier markers. The investigation further revealed that the infiltration of α-synuclein into the GIT was influenced significantly by butyrate and α-synuclein genotypes, which may also affect the GIT microbiome directly.By demonstrating the transportation of α-synuclein through RBC-EVs to the GIT, and its potential association with gut-vascular barrier markers and gut microbiome, this work highlights a potential mechanism by which RBC α-synuclein may impact PD initiation and/or progression. © 2023 The Authors.

Recent clinical and preclinical studies have shown that <i>A. muciniphila</i> plays a vital role in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders by influencing the host brain through the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA). Numerous studies observed that <i>A. muciniphila</i> and its metabolic substances can effectively improve the symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders by restoring the gut microbiota, reestablishing the integrity of the gut mucosal barrier, regulating host immunity, and modulating gut and neuroinflammation. However, <i>A. muciniphila</i> was also reported to participate in the development of neuropsychiatric disorders by aggravating inflammation and influencing mucus production. Therefore, the exact mechanism of action of <i>A. muciniphila</i> remains much controversial. This review summarizes the proposed roles and mechanisms of <i>A. muciniphila</i> in various neurological and psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, strokes, and autism spectrum disorders, and provides insights into the potential therapeutic application of <i>A. muciniphila</i> for the treatment of these conditions.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2023,Wenhui Lei; Yiwen Cheng; Jie Gao; Xia Liu; Li Shao; Qingming Kong; Nengneng Zheng; Zongxin Ling; Weiming Hu
36881358,Meta-analysis of the relations between gut microbiota and pathogens and Parkinson's disease.,"The motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) are commonly preceded by gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. The enteric nervous system (ENS) has also been reported to exhibit neuropathological characteristics of PD.To evaluate the relationship between the incidence of parkinsonism and alteration in gut microbiota and pathogens.Studies in different languages that evaluate the relationship between gut microorganisms and PD were included into this meta-analysis. The outcomes of these studies were analyzed using a random effects model; it was also used to calculate the mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) in order to quantify the impact of different rehabilitation techniques on clinical parameters. Dichotomous and continuous models were used for the analysis of extracted data.A total of 28 studies were included in our analysis. The analysis of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth showed a significant correlation with Parkinson's subjects compared with controls (p < 0.001). In addition, the presence of Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection was significantly related to the Parkinson's group (p < 0.001). On the other hand, there was a significantly higher abundance level of Bifidobacteriaceae (p = 0.008), Verrucomicrobiaceae (p < 0.001) and Christensenellaceae (p = 0.003) in Parkinson's subjects. In contrast, a significantly lower abundance levels in Parkinson's subjects were found in Faecalibacterium (p = 0.03), Lachnospiraceae (p = 0.005) and Prevotellaceae (p = 0.005). No significant difference was related to Ruminococcaceae.Parkinson's subjects showed a higher degree of alteration of gut microbiota and pathogens compared with normal human subjects.

37515687,Gut microbiota bridges the iron homeostasis and host health.,"The gut microbiota acts as a symbiotic microecosystem that plays an indispensable role in the regulation of a number of metabolic processes in the host by secreting secondary metabolites and impacting the physiology and pathophysiology of numerous organs and tissues through the circulatory system. This relationship, referred to as the ""gut-X axis"", is associated with the development and progression of disorders, including obesity, fatty liver and Parkinson's disease. Given its importance, the gut flora is a vital research area for the understanding and development of the novel therapeutic approaches for multiple disorders. Iron is a common but necessary element required by both mammals and bacteria. As a result, iron metabolism is closely intertwined with the gut microbiota. The host's iron homeostasis affects the composition of the gut microbiota and the interaction between host and gut microbiota through various mechanisms such as nutrient homeostasis, intestinal peaceability, gut immunity, and oxidative stress. Therefore, understanding the relationship between gut microbes and host iron metabolism is not only of enormous significance to host health but also may offer preventative and therapeutic approaches for a number of disorders that impact both parties. In this review, we delve into the connection between the dysregulation of iron metabolism and dysbiosis of gut microbiota, and how it contributes to the onset and progression of metabolic and chronic diseases.",Science China.

37346870,Gut Microbiota and Neuropsychiatric Disorders.,"Numerous studies in humans and animals hypothesize that gut microbiota dysbiosis is involved in the development of behavioral and neurological diseases such as depression, autism spectrum disorder, Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, stroke and Alzheimer's disease. Some of the most salient works so far regarding the brain-gut axis are mentioned below. The current knowledge on the impact of gut microbiota on nervous system diseases is far from being directly used for pharmacologic or nutritional advice toward restoration of normal bodily functions. It seems that a more comprehensive approach should be followed so that the individual effect of each kind of intervention on the patient's somatic or psychological status is determined. Future research must address global need for regimens which could reestablish normal composition of gut microorganisms after each neuropsychological disorder.",Basic and clinical neuroscience,2023,Reza Bidaki; Seyed Hossein Hekmati Moghaddam; Maryam Sadeh
36958817,Faecal metabolome and its determinants in inflammatory bowel disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a multifactorial immune-mediated inflammatory disease of the intestine, comprising Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. By characterising metabolites in faeces, combined with faecal metagenomics, host genetics and clinical characteristics, we aimed to unravel metabolic alterations in IBD.We measured 1684 different faecal metabolites and 8 short-chain and branched-chain fatty acids in stool samples of 424 patients with IBD and 255 non-IBD controls. Regression analyses were used to compare concentrations of metabolites between cases and controls and determine the relationship between metabolites and each participant's lifestyle, clinical characteristics and gut microbiota composition. Moreover, genome-wide association analysis was conducted on faecal metabolite levels.We identified over 300 molecules that were differentially abundant in the faeces of patients with IBD. The ratio between a sphingolipid and L-urobilin could discriminate between IBD and non-IBD samples (AUC=0.85). We found changes in the bile acid pool in patients with dysbiotic microbial communities and a strong association between faecal metabolome and gut microbiota. For example, the abundance of <i>Ruminococcus gnavus</i> was positively associated with tryptamine levels. In addition, we found 158 associations between metabolites and dietary patterns, and polymorphisms near <i>NAT2</i> strongly associated with coffee metabolism.In this large-scale analysis, we identified alterations in the metabolome of patients with IBD that are independent of commonly overlooked confounders such as diet and surgical history. Considering the influence of the microbiome on faecal metabolites, our results pave the way for future interventions targeting intestinal inflammation.",Gut,2023,Arnau Vich Vila; Shixian Hu; Sergio Andreu-Sánchez; Valerie Collij; Bernadien H Jansen; Hannah E Augustijn; Laura A Bolte; Renate A A A Ruigrok; Galeb Abu-Ali; Cosmas Giallourakis; Jessica Schneider; John Parkinson; Amal Al-Garawi; Alexandra Zhernakova; Ranko Gacesa; Jingyuan Fu; Rinse K Weersma
38097625,Plasma metabolites of aromatic amino acids associate with clinical severity and gut microbiota of Parkinson's disease.,"Gut microbial proteolytic metabolism has been reportedly altered in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the circulating aromatic amino acids (AAA) described in PD are inconsistent. Here we aimed to investigate plasma AAA profiles in a large cohort of PD patients, and examine their correlations with clinical severity and gut microbiota changes. We enrolled 500 participants including 250 PD patients and 250 neurologically normal controls. Plasma metabolites were measured using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Faecal samples were newly collected from 154 PD patients for microbiota shotgun metagenomic sequencing combined with data derived from 96 PD patients reported before. Data were collected regarding diet, medications, and motor and non-motor symptoms of PD. Compared to controls, PD patients had higher plasma AAA levels, including phenylacetylglutamine (PAGln), p-cresol sulfate (Pcs), p-cresol glucuronide (Pcg), and indoxyl sulfate (IS). Multivariable linear regression analyses, with adjustment for age, sex, and medications, revealed that the plasma levels of PAGln (coefficient 4.49, 95% CI 0.40-8.58, P = 0.032) and Pcg (coefficient 1.79, 95% CI 0.07-3.52, P = 0.042) positively correlated with motor symptom severity but not cognitive function. After correcting for abovementioned potential confounders, these AAA metabolites were also associated with the occurrence of constipation in PD patients (all P < 0.05). Furthermore, plasma levels of AAA metabolites were correlated with the abundance of specific gut microbiota species, including Bacteroides sp. CF01-10NS, Bacteroides vulgatus, and Clostridium sp. AF50-3. In conclusion, elevated plasma AAA metabolite levels correlated with disease characteristics in PD, suggesting that upregulated proteolytic metabolism may contribute to the pathophysiology of PD.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2023,Szu-Ju Chen; Yu-Jun Wu; Chieh-Chang Chen; Yu-Wei Wu; Jyh-Ming Liou; Ming-Shiang Wu; Ching-Hua Kuo; Chin-Hsien Lin
37490970,The Role of Gut Microbiota in Glaucoma Progression and Other Retinal Diseases.,"As a rapidly growing field, microbiota research offers novel approaches to promoting ocular health and treating major retinal diseases, such as glaucoma. Gut microbiota changes throughout life; however, certain patterns of population changes have been increasingly associated with specific diseases. It has been well established that a disrupted microbiome contributes to central nervous system diseases, including Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, and glioma, suggesting a prominent role of microbiome in neurodegenerative diseases. This review summarizes the progress in identifying significant changes in the microbial composition of patients with glaucoma by compiling studies on the association between microbiota and disease progression. Of interest is the relationship between increased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma, increased taurocholic acid, decreased glutathione, and a reduction in retinal ganglion cell survival. Connecting these microbes to specific metabolites sheds light on the pathogenic mechanism and novel treatment strategies. In summary, the current review synthesizes the findings of several studies investigating the effects of shifting bacterial population in retinal diseases, particularly glaucoma, with the aim to identify the current direction of treatment and help direct future endeavors.",The American journal of pathology,2023,Julie Chen; Dong Feng Chen; Kin-Sang Cho

The effects of curcumin against Parkinson's disease have been demonstrated; however, its neuroprotective mechanisms remain unknown. Our study investigated the potential mechanisms through which curcumin ameliorates Parkinson's disease via the microbiota-gut-brain axis. <b>Methods:</b> Mice were randomly divided into four groups: control, Curcumin, MPTP, and MPTP + Curcumin. Motor deficits and gastrointestinal dysfunction were assessed using behavioral test, intestinal motility test, and fecal parameter measurement. The loss of dopaminergic neurons and intestinal barrier function was measured using Western blot and immunofluorescence. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing and LC-MS were parallelly performed on mice feces to investigate alterations in microbiota and metabolites. <b>Results:</b> Curcumin alleviated motor deficits and the loss of dopaminergic neurons in MPTP-induced mice. Curcumin ameliorated gastrointestinal and intestinal barrier dysfunctions in MPTP-induced mice. Curcumin reduced gut microbial dysbiosis and modulated carbohydrate metabolism in MPTP-induced mice. Curcumin restored short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) profiles in MPTP-induced mice. <b>Conclusion:</b> Concurrently, these results indicate that curcumin inhibits Parkinson's disease by regulating the gut microbiota and short-chain fatty acids.",Frontiers in pharmacology,2023,Benchi Cai; Lifan Zhong; Qitong Wang; Wendi Xu; Xi Li; Tao Chen
37423520,Alterations of gut microbiota and its correlation with the liver metabolome in the process of ameliorating Parkinson's disease with Buyang Huanwu decoction.,"Buyang Huanwu decoction (BHD), a famous traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula, was first recorded in Qing Dynasty physician Qingren Wang's Yi Lin Gai Cuo. BHD has been widely utilized in the treatment of patients with neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the underlying mechanism has not been fully elucidated. In particular, little is known about the role of gut microbiota.We aimed to reveal the alterations and functions of gut microbiota and its correlation with the liver metabolome in the process of improving PD with BHD.The cecal contents were collected from PD mice treated with or without BHD. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiSeq-PE250 platform, and the ecological structure, dominant taxa, co-occurrence patterns, and function prediction of the gut microbial community were analyzed by multivariate statistical methods. The correlation between differential microbial communities in the gut and differentially accumulated metabolites in the liver was analyzed using Spearman's correlation analysis.The abundance of Butyricimonas, Christensenellaceae, Coprococcus, Peptococcaceae, Odoribacteraceae, and Roseburia was altered significantly in the model group, which was by BHD. Ten genera, namely Dorea, unclassified_Lachnospiraceae, Oscillospira, unidentified_Ruminococcaceae, unclassified_Clostridiales, unidentified_Clostridiales, Bacteroides, unclassified_Prevotellaceae, unidentified_Rikenellaceae, and unidentified_S24-7, were identified as key bacterial communities. According to the function prediction of differential genera, the mRNA surveillance pathway might be a target of BHD. Integrated analysis of gut microbiota and the liver metabolome revealed that several gut microbiota genera such as Parabacteroides, Ochrobactrum, Acinetobacter, Clostridium, and Halomonas, were positively or negatively correlated with some nervous system-related metabolites, such as L-carnitine, L-pyroglutamic acid, oleic acid, and taurine.Gut microbiota might be a target of BHD in the process of ameliorating PD. Our findings provide novel insight into the mechanisms underlying the effects of BHD on PD and contribute to the development of TCM.",Journal of ethnopharmacology,2024,Jianran Hu; Ping Li; Hongmei Zhao; Pengyu Ji; Yanjun Yang; Jianhua Ma; Xin Zhao
37819112,Gut microbiota-associated taurine metabolism dysregulation in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease.,"PD is recognized as a multisystem disease concerning GI dysfunction and microbiota dysbiosis but still lacks ideal therapies. Recently, aberrant microbiota-derived metabolites are emerging as important participants in PD etiology. However, the alterations of gut microbiota community and serum untargeted metabolite profile have not been fully investigated in a PD mice model. Here, we discover sharply reduced levels of <i>Lactobacillus</i> and taurine in MPTP-treated mice. Moreover, <i>Lactobacillus</i>, <i>Adlercreutzia</i>, and taurine-related metabolites showed the most significant correlation with pathological and GI performance of PD mice. The abundances of microbial transporter and enzymes participating in the degeneration of taurine were disturbed in PD mice. Most importantly, taurine supplement ameliorates MPTP-induced motor deficits, DA neuron loss, and microglial activation. Our data highlight the impaired taurine-based microbiome-metabolism axis during the progression of PD and reveal a novel and previously unrecognized role of genera in modulating taurine metabolism.",mSphere,2023,Can Cui; Huan Song; Yingying Han; Hongxiang Yu; Hongxia Li; Yumei Yang; Bei Zhang
37736791,"The link between the gut microbiome, inflammation, and Parkinson's disease.","As our society ages, the growing number of people with Parkinson's disease (PD) puts tremendous pressure on our society. Currently, there is no effective treatment for PD, so there is an urgent need to find new treatment options. In recent years, increasing studies have shown a strong link between gut microbes and PD. In this review, recent advances in research on gut microbes in PD patients were summarized. Increased potential pro-inflammatory microbes and decreased potential anti-inflammatory microbes are prominent features of gut microbiota in PD patients. These changes may lead to an increase in pro-inflammatory substances (such as lipopolysaccharide and H<sub>2</sub>S) and a decrease in anti-inflammatory substances (such as short-chain fatty acids) to promote inflammation in the gut. This gut microbiota-mediated inflammation will lead to pathological α-synuclein accumulation in the gut, and the inflammation and α-synuclein can spread to the brain via the microbiota-gut-brain axis, thereby promoting neuroinflammation, apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons, and ultimately the development of PD. This review also showed that therapies based on gut microbiota may have a bright future for PD. However, more research and new approaches are still needed to clarify the causal relationship between gut microbes and PD and to determine whether therapies based on gut microbiota are effective in PD patients. KEY POINTS: • There is a strong association between gut microbes and PD. • Inflammation mediated by gut microbes may promote the development of PD. • Therapies based on the gut microbiome provide a promising strategy for PD prevention.",Applied microbiology and biotechnology,2023,Shiqing Nie; Yuan Ge
37620311,Gut microbiota and fecal short chain fatty acids differ with adiposity and country of origin: the METS-microbiome study.,"The relationship between microbiota, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and obesity remains enigmatic. We employ amplicon sequencing and targeted metabolomics in a large (n = 1904) African origin cohort from Ghana, South Africa, Jamaica, Seychelles, and the US. Microbiota diversity and fecal SCFAs are greatest in Ghanaians, and lowest in Americans, representing each end of the urbanization spectrum. Obesity is significantly associated with a reduction in SCFA concentration, microbial diversity, and SCFA synthesizing bacteria, with country of origin being the strongest explanatory factor. Diabetes, glucose state, hypertension, obesity, and sex can be accurately predicted from the global microbiota, but when analyzed at the level of country, predictive accuracy is only universally maintained for sex. Diabetes, glucose, and hypertension are only predictive in certain low-income countries. Our findings suggest that adiposity-related microbiota differences differ between low-to-middle-income compared to high-income countries. Further investigation is needed to determine the factors driving this association.",Nature communications,2023,Gertrude Ecklu-Mensah; Candice Choo-Kang; Maria Gjerstad Maseng; Sonya Donato; Pascal Bovet; Bharathi Viswanathan; Kweku Bedu-Addo; Jacob Plange-Rhule; Prince Oti Boateng; Terrence E Forrester; Marie Williams; Estelle V Lambert; Dale Rae; Nandipha Sinyanya; Amy Luke; Brian T Layden; Stephen O'Keefe; Jack A Gilbert; Lara R Dugas
37807941,The gut microbiota metabolite butyrate mitigates MPTP/MPP<sup>+</sup> -induced Parkinson's disease by inhibiting the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.,"Butyrate (BU), a gut microbiota-derived metabolite, has been reported to play a neuroprotective role in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the specific molecular mechanism of BU has not been fully interpreted. This work aimed to verify the protective effects of BU against MPTP/MPP<sup>+</sup> -induced neurotoxicity and explore the mechanisms involved. The results showed that BU protected against MPTP-induced motor dysfunction and decreased tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine transporter (DAT) levels. Additionally, BU pretreatment improved PC12 cell viability and reduced MPP<sup>+</sup> -induced PC12 cell apoptosis. BU treatment also attenuated MPP<sup>+</sup> -stimulated oxidative stress and inflammatory response in PC12 cells. Furthermore, BU inhibited MPTP/MPP<sup>+</sup> -induced hyperactivation of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling in mice and PC12 cells. Besides, a JAK2 agonist, Coumermycin A1 (C-A1), substantially reversed BU-mediated inhibition on JAK2/STAT3 phosphorylation in MPP<sup>+</sup> -challenged PC12 cells and abated BU-induced repression on MPP<sup>+</sup> -triggered apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammatory response in PC12 cells. To sum up, BU might exert neuroprotective effects against MPP<sup>+</sup> /MPTP-induced neurotoxicity by inactivating the JAK2/STAT3 signaling.",The Kaohsiung journal of medical sciences,2023,Li-Li Ji; Ting-Ting Huang; Lun-Lin Mao; Yuan-Feng Xu; Wen-Ya Chen; Wei-Wei Wang; Li-Hui Wang
37332996,A review of studies on gut microbiota and levodopa metabolism.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease globally. Levodopa (L-dopa) has been the cornerstone for treating Parkinson's since the 1960s. However, complications such as ""wearing-off"" and dyskinesia inevitably appear with disease progression. With the further development of microbiomics in recent years, It has been recognized that gut microbiota plays a crucial role in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis. However, Little is known about the impact of gut microbiota in PD treatment, especially in levodopa metabolism. This review examines the possible mechanisms of gut microbiota, such as <i>Helicobacter pylori</i>, <i>Enterobacter faecalis</i>, and <i>Clostridium sporogenes,</i> affecting L-dopa absorption. Furthermore, we review the current status of gut microbiota intervention strategies, providing new insights into the treatment of PD.",Frontiers in neurology,2023,Zhe Zhong; Min Ye; Fuling Yan
37502423,Exploring the alteration of gut microbiota and brain function in gender-specific Parkinson's disease based on metagenomic sequencing.,"The role of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in Parkinson's disease (PD) has received increasing attention. Although gender differences are known to an essential role in the epidemiology and clinical course of PD, there are no studies on the sex specificity of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in the development and progression of PD.Fresh fecal samples from 24 PD patients (13 males, 11 females) were collected for metagenomic sequencing. The composition and function of the gut microbiota were analyzed by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Gender-dependent differences in brain ALFF values and their correlation with microbiota were further analyzed.The relative abundance of <i>Propionivibrio</i>, <i>Thermosediminibacter</i>, and <i>Flavobacteriaceae_noname</i> was increased in male PD patients. LEfse analysis showed that <i>Verrucomicrobial</i>, <i>Akkermansiaceae</i>, and <i>Akkermansia</i> were dominant in the males. In female patients, the relative abundance of <i>Propionicicella</i> was decreased and <i>Escherichia</i>, <i>Escherichia_coli</i>, and <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> were predominant. The expression of the sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis pathways was increased in male PD patients and was statistically different from females. Compared to the Male PD patients, female patients showed decreased ALFF values in the left inferior parietal regions, and the relative abundance of <i>Propionivibrio</i> was positively correlated with the regional ALFF values.Our study provides novel clinical evidence of the gender-specific relationship between gut microbiota alterations and brain function in PD patients, highlighting the critical role of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in gender differences in PD.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2023,Minna Zhang; Zhiyuan Zhai; Bo Yang; Le He; Jingyi Wang; Weijie Dai; Liujun Xue; Xiaozhong Yang; Yun Feng; Honggang Wang
38237261,"Rubusoside mitigates neuroinflammation and cellular apoptosis in Parkinson's disease, and alters gut microbiota and metabolite composition.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons within the substantia nigra. Neuroinflammation plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of PD, involving the activation of microglia cells, heightened production of proinflammatory cytokines, and perturbations in the composition of the gut microbiota. Rubusoside (Ru), the principal steviol bisglucoside present in Rubus chingii var. suavissimus (S.K.Lee) L.T.Lu (Rosaceae), has been documented for its anti-inflammatory properties in diverse disease models. Nonetheless, there is an imperative need to comprehensively assess and elucidate the protective and anti-inflammatory attributes of Ru concerning PD, as well as to uncover the underlying mechanism involved.The aim of this study is to evaluate the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of Ru on PD and investigate its potential mechanisms associated with microbes.We pre-treated mice and cell lines with Ru in order to simulate the progression of PD and the neuroinflammatory state. The mouse model was induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), SN4741 cells were induced by 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridine (mpp<sup>+</sup>), and BV-2 cells were induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We assessed the impact of Ru on motor function, neuroinflammation, neuron apoptosis, the composition of gut microbes, and their metabolites.Ru treatment reduces the release of pro-inflammatory mediators by inhibiting microglia activation. It also prevents neuronal apoptosis, thereby safeguarding dopaminergic neurons and ameliorating motor dysfunction. Furthermore, it induces alterations in the fecal microbiota composition and metabolites profile in PD mice. In vitro experiments have demonstrated that Ru inhibits neuronal apoptosis in SN4741 cells induced by mpp<sup>+</sup>, suppresses the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, and activates the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) signaling pathways.Ru exhibits inhibitory effects on the MPTP-induced PD model by mitigating neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis while also inducing changes in the gut microbiota and metabolite composition.",Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,2024,Tianyu Meng; Yufei Zhang; Jing Huang; Vijay Pandey; Shoupeng Fu; Shaohua Ma
38022117,The Role of Gut Microbiota in Neurodegenerative Diseases: Current Insights and Therapeutic Implications.,"Small microscopic entities known as microbes, having a population of hundreds of billions or perhaps even in trillions, reside in our gastrointestinal tract. A healthy immune system, digestion, and creation of vitamins and enzymes are all thanks to these microbes. However, new research has shown a hitherto unrecognized connection between the microbiota of the intestines and the genesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Neurons in the CNS gradually deteriorate in neurodegenerative illnesses like multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease (PD). This deterioration impairs cognitive and physical function. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), PD, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are just a few examples of neurodegenerative illnesses that pose a serious threat to world health and have few effective treatments. Recent research suggests that the gut microbiota, a diverse microbial population found in the gastrointestinal system, may substantially impact the cause and development of various diseases. The discovery of altered gut microbiota composition in people with these illnesses is one of the most critical lines of evidence connecting gut microbiota dysbiosis to neurodegenerative diseases. AD patients have a distinct characteristic of having a particular microbiota profile. In addition, an excess population of a specific microbe data profile is seen as compared to a healthy individual. Similar changes in the gut microbiota composition have been noted in people with multiple sclerosis and PD. The latest study indicates the potential that dysbiosis, a condition characterized by alteration in the intestinal microbiota's makeup and functioning, may have an effect on the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, including PD and multiple sclerosis. In order to emphasize any potential underlying mechanisms and examine potential treatment repercussions, the review article's goal is to summarize current knowledge about the connection between gut microbiota and neurodegenerative disorders. The review article aims to summarize current knowledge about the connection between gut microbiota and neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting potential underlying mechanisms and examining potential treatment repercussions.",Cureus,2023,Arpit Jain; Suryansh Madkan; Praful Patil
37200942,Ketogenic diet protects MPTP-induced mouse model of Parkinson's disease via altering gut microbiota and metabolites.,"The ketogenic diet (KD) is a low-carbohydrate, high-fat regime that is protective against neurodegenerative diseases. However, the impact of KD on Parkinson's disease (PD) and its mechanisms remains unclear. 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced mouse model of PD was fed with KD for 8 weeks. Motor function and dopaminergic neurons were evaluated. Inflammation in the brain, plasma, and colon tissue were also measured. Fecal samples were assessed by 16S rDNA gene sequencing and untargeted metabolomics. We found that KD protected motor dysfunction, dopaminergic neuron loss, and inflammation in an MPTP mouse model of PD. 16S rDNA sequencing revealed that MPTP administration significantly increased <i>Citrobacter</i>, <i>Desulfovibrio</i>, and <i>Ruminococcus</i>, and decreased <i>Dubosiella</i>, whereas KD treatment reversed the dysbiosis. Meanwhile, KD regulated the MPTP-induced histamine, N-acetylputrescine, d-aspartic acid, and other metabolites. Fecal microbiota transplantation using feces from the KD-treated mice attenuated the motor function impairment and dopaminergic neuron loss in antibiotic-pretreated PD mice. Our current study demonstrates that KD played a neuroprotective role in the MPTP mouse model of PD through the diet-gut microbiota-brain axis, which may involve inflammation in the brain and colon. However, future research is warranted to explore the explicit anti-inflammatory mechanisms of the gut-brain axis in PD models fed with KD.",MedComm,2023,Ziying Jiang; Xinyu Wang; Haoqiang Zhang; Jian Yin; Peiqing Zhao; Qingqing Yin; Zhenfu Wang
37323141,Effects of gut microbiota on neurodegenerative diseases.,"A progressive degradation of the brain's structure and function, which results in a reduction in cognitive and motor skills, characterizes neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington's disease (HD). The morbidity linked to NDs is growing, which poses a severe threat to human being's mental and physical ability to live well. The gut-brain axis (GBA) is now known to have a crucial role in the emergence of NDs. The gut microbiota is a conduit for the GBA, a two-way communication system between the gut and the brain. The myriad microorganisms that make up the gut microbiota can affect brain physiology by transmitting numerous microbial chemicals from the gut to the brain <i>via</i> the GBA or neurological system. The synthesis of neurotransmitters, the immunological response, and the metabolism of lipids and glucose have all been demonstrated to be impacted by alterations in the gut microbiota, such as an imbalance of helpful and harmful bacteria. In order to develop innovative interventions and clinical therapies for NDs, it is crucial to comprehend the participation of the gut microbiota in these conditions. In addition to using antibiotics and other drugs to target particular bacterial species that may be a factor in NDs, this also includes using probiotics and other fecal microbiota transplantation to maintain a healthy gut microbiota. In conclusion, the examination of the GBA can aid in understanding the etiology and development of NDs, which may benefit the improvement of clinical treatments for these disorders and ND interventions. This review indicates existing knowledge about the involvement of microbiota present in the gut in NDs and potential treatment options.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2023,Saima Khatoon; Nida Kalam; Summya Rashid; Gulnaz Bano
36692876,Causal effect of gut-microbiota-derived metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide on Parkinson's disease: A Mendelian randomization study.,"It has been suggested that trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is related to Parkinson's disease (PD) in observational studies. However, the direction of this association is inconsistent. An exploratory Mendelian randomization study was conducted to investigate whether TMAO and its precursors have a causal relationship with PD.Summary statistics were obtained for single nucleotide polymorphisms related to circulating levels of TMAO, betaine, carnitine and choline, and the corresponding data for the risk, age at onset and progression of PD from genome-wide association studies. Inverse-variance weighting was used as the primary method for effect estimation. The false discovery rate was applied to the correction of multiple testing. A p value of association <0.05 but above the false discovery rate corrected threshold was deemed suggestive evidence of a possible association. A range of robust Mendelian randomization methods were used for sensitivity analysis.Suggestive evidence was observed of an inverse causal effect of TMAO on motor fluctuations (odds ratio [OR] 0.851, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.731, 0.990, p = 0.037) and carnitine on insomnia (OR 0.817, 95% CI 0.700, 0.954, p = 0.010) and a positive causal effect of betaine on Hoehn-Yahr stage (OR 1.397, 95% CI 1.112, 1.756, p = 0.004), Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) III score (β = 0.138, 95% CI 0.051, 0.225, p = 0.002), motor fluctuations (OR 1.236, 95% CI 1.011, 1.511, p = 0.039), and choline on UPDRS IV (β = 0.106, 95% CI 0.026, 0.185, p = 0.009) and modified Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living Scale score (β = 0.806, 95% CI 0.127, 1.484, p = 0.020).Our findings provide suggestive evidence that TMAO and its precursors have a causal effect on the progression of PD.

38127816,Autophagic dysfunction and gut microbiota dysbiosis cause chronic immune activation in a Drosophila model of Gaucher disease.,"Mutations in the GBA1 gene cause the lysosomal storage disorder Gaucher disease (GD) and are the greatest known genetic risk factors for Parkinson's disease (PD). Communication between the gut and brain and immune dysregulation are increasingly being implicated in neurodegenerative disorders such as PD. Here, we show that flies lacking the Gba1b gene, the main fly orthologue of GBA1, display widespread NF-kB signalling activation, including gut inflammation, and brain glial activation. We also demonstrate intestinal autophagic defects, gut dysfunction, and microbiome dysbiosis. Remarkably, modulating the microbiome of Gba1b knockout flies, by raising them under germ-free conditions, partially ameliorates lifespan, locomotor and immune phenotypes. Moreover, we show that modulation of the immune deficiency (IMD) pathway is detrimental to the survival of Gba1 deficient flies. We also reveal that direct stimulation of autophagy by rapamycin treatment achieves similar benefits to germ-free conditions independent of gut bacterial load. Consistent with this, we show that pharmacologically blocking autophagosomal-lysosomal fusion, mimicking the autophagy defects of Gba1 depleted cells, is sufficient to stimulate intestinal immune activation. Overall, our data elucidate a mechanism whereby an altered microbiome, coupled with defects in autophagy, drive chronic activation of NF-kB signaling in a Gba1 loss-of-function model. It also highlights that elimination of the microbiota or stimulation of autophagy to remove immune mediators, rather than prolonged immunosuppression, may represent effective therapeutic avenues for GBA1-associated disorders.",PLoS genetics,2023,Magda L Atilano; Alexander Hull; Catalina-Andreea Romila; Mirjam L Adams; Jacob Wildfire; Enric Ureña; Miranda Dyson; Jorge Ivan-Castillo-Quan; Linda Partridge; Kerri J Kinghorn
37334756,Fibroblast growth factor 21 ameliorates behavior deficits in Parkinson's disease mouse model via modulating gut microbiota and metabolic homeostasis.,"The effects of FGF21 on Parkinson's disease (PD) and its relationship with gut microbiota have not been elucidated. This study aimed to investigate whether FGF21 would attenuate behavioral impairment through microbiota-gut-brain metabolic axis in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) induced PD mice model.Male C57BL/6 mice were rendomized into 3 groups: vehicle (CON); MPTP 30 mg/kg/day i.p. injection (MPTP); FGF21 1.5 mg/kg/d i.p. injection plus MPTP 30 mg/kg/day i.p. injection (FGF21 + MPTP). The behavioral features, metabolimics profiling, and 16 s rRNA sequencing were performed after FGF21 treatment for 7 days.MPTP-induced PD mice showed motor and cognitive deficits accompanied by gut microbiota dysbiosis and brain-region-specific metabolic abnormalities. FGF21 treatment dramatically attenuated motor and cognitive dysfunction in PD mice. FGF21 produced a region-specific alteration in the metabolic profile in the brain in ways indicative of greater ability in neurotransmitter metabolism and choline production. In addition, FGF21 also re-structured the gut microbiota profile and increased the relative abundance of Clostridiales, Ruminococcaceae, and Lachnospiraceae, thereby rescuing the PD-induced metabolic disorders in the colon.These findings indicate that FGF21 could affect behavior and brain metabolic homeostasis in ways that promote a favorable colonic microbiota composition and through effects on the microbiota-gut-brain metabolic axis.",CNS neuroscience & therapeutics,2023,Changwei Yang; Wuqiong Wang; Pengxi Deng; Xinyi Wang; Lin Zhu; Liangcai Zhao; Chen Li; Hongchang Gao
37049578,<i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> CCFM405 against Rotenone-Induced Parkinson's Disease Mice via Regulating Gut Microbiota and Branched-Chain Amino Acids Biosynthesis.,"Recent studies have demonstrated that disturbances in the gut microbiota and microbiota -derived metabolites contribute to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), suggesting that probiotic treatments that restore them may delay disease progression. This study aimed to examine the attenuating efficacy of <i>L. plantarum</i> CCFM405 and the potential mechanisms in mice with rotenone-induced PD. Our results indicate that <i>L. plantarum</i> CCFM405 ameliorated rotenone-induced motor deficits and constipation, decreased dopaminergic neuronal death, reduced intestinal inflammation and neuroinflammation, and raised dopamine levels, 5-HT, and associated metabolites in the striatal region of the brain in mice with PD. Sequencing of 16S rRNA from fecal microbiota revealed that <i>L. plantarum</i> CCFM405 normalized the gut bacterial composition in mice with PD, as evidenced by the increased relative abundance of the following genus, <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, <i>Turicibacter</i>, and <i>Faecalibaculum</i>, and decreased relative abundance of <i>Alistipes</i>, <i>Bilophila</i>, <i>Akkermansia</i>, and <i>Escherichia-Shigella</i>. The PICRUSt-predicted gut microbiota function revealed that <i>L. plantarum</i> CCFM405 enhanced the biosynthesis of amino acid pathways, particularly valine, leucine, and isoleucine (branched-chain amino acids, BCAAs). A non-metabolomic analysis of the serum and feces showed that <i>L. plantarum</i> CCFM405 markedly increased the levels of BCAAs. Pathway enrichment analysis based on the KEGG database further suggested that <i>L. plantarum</i> CCFM405 supplementation can promote BCAAs biosynthesis. Collectively, <i>L. plantarum</i> CCFM405 can help to prevent rotenone-induced PD by modulating the gut microbiota-metabolite axis. BCAAs may play a dominant role in <i>L. plantarum</i> CCFM405-associated neuroprotection in PD mice. This probiotic could be utilized as a potential food supplement in the management of PD.",Nutrients,2023,Chuanqi Chu; Leilei Yu; Yiwen Li; Hang Guo; Qixiao Zhai; Wei Chen; Fengwei Tian
36761177,Sodium butyrate ameliorates gut dysfunction and motor deficits in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease by regulating gut microbiota.,"A growing body of evidence showed that gut microbiota dysbiosis might be associated with the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Microbiota-targeted interventions could play a protective role in PD by regulating the gut microbiota-gut-brain axis. Sodium butyrate (NaB) could improve gut microbiota dysbiosis in PD and other neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the potential mechanism associated with the complex interaction between NaB and gut microbiota-gut-brain communication in PD needs further investigation.C57BL/6 mice were subjected to a rotenone-induced PD model and were treated intragastrically with NaB for 4 weeks. The gut function and motor function were evaluated. The α-synuclein expression in colon and substantia nigra were detected by western blotting. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons in substantia nigra were measured by immunofluorescence. Moreover, gut microbiota composition was analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing. Fecal short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) levels were determined by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The levels of glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) in tissues and serum were evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).NaB ameliorated gut dysfunction and motor deficits in rotenone-induced mice. Meanwhile, NaB protected against rotenone-induced α-synuclein expression in colon and substantia nigra, and prevented the loss of TH-positive neurons. In addition, NaB could remodel gut microbiota composition, and regulate gut SCFAs metabolism, and restore GLP-1 levels in colon, serum, and substantia nigra in PD mice.NaB could ameliorate gut dysfunction and motor deficits in rotenone-induced PD mice, and the mechanism might be associated with the regulation of gut microbiota dysbiosis.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2023,Yi Zhang; Shaoqing Xu; Yiwei Qian; Chengjun Mo; Penghui Ai; Xiaodong Yang; Qin Xiao
37460569,Association of fecal short-chain fatty acids with clinical severity and gut microbiota in essential tremor and its difference from Parkinson's disease.,"Diagnosis of essential tremor (ET) at an early stage can be difficult, especially when distinguishing it from healthy controls (HCs) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Recently, stool sample analysis of gut microbiota and its metabolites provides new ways to detect novel biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), as the main metabolites of gut microbiota, were reduced in the feces of PD. However, fecal SCFAs in ET have never been investigated. We aimed to investigate the fecal SCFA levels in ET, assess their relationships with clinical symptoms and gut microbiota, and identify their potential diagnostic abilities. Fecal SCFAs and gut microbiota in 37 ET, 37 de novo PD and 35 HC were measured. Constipation, autonomic dysfunction and tremor severity were evaluated by scales. ET had lower fecal propionic, butyric and isobutyric acid levels than HC. Combined propionic, butyric and isobutyric acid distinguished ET from HC with an AUC of 0.751 (95% CI: 0.634-0.867). ET had lower fecal isovaleric and isobutyric acid levels than PD. Isovaleric and isobutyric acid differentiated ET from PD with an AUC of 0.743 (95% CI: 0.629-0.857). Fecal propionic acid was negatively correlated with constipation and autonomic dysfunction. Isobutyric and isovaleric acid were negatively associated with tremor severity. Lowered fecal SCFAs were related to a decreased abundance of Faecalibacterium and Catenibacterium in ET. In conclusion, fecal SCFAs were decreased in ET and correlated with clinical severity and gut microbiota changes. Fecal propionic, butyric, isobutyric and isovaleric acid might be potential diagnostic and differential diagnostic biomarkers for ET.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2023,Pei Huang; Pingchen Zhang; Juanjuan Du; Chao Gao; Jin Liu; Yuyan Tan; Shengdi Chen
37754772,The impact of Parkinson's disease-associated gut microbiota on the transcriptome in <i>Drosophila</i>.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease in middle-aged and elderly people, and many studies have confirmed that the disorder of gut microbiota is involved in the pathophysiological process of PD. However, the molecular mechanism of gut microbiota in regulating the pathogenesis of PD is still lacking. In this study, to investigate the impact of PD-associated gut microbiota on host transcriptome, we established various PD models with fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in the model organism <i>Drosophila</i> followed by integrative data analysis of microbiome and transcriptome. We first constructed rotenone-induced PD models in <i>Drosophila</i> followed by FMT in different groups. Microbial analysis by 16S rDNA sequencing showed that gut microbiota from PD <i>Drosophila</i> could affect bacterial structure of normal <i>Drosophila</i>, and gut microbiota from normal <i>Drosophila</i> could affect bacterial structure of PD <i>Drosophila</i>. Transcriptome analysis revealed that PD-associated gut microbiota influenced expression patterns of genes enriched in neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, lysosome, and diverse metabolic pathways. Importantly, to verify our findings, we transplanted <i>Drosophila</i> with fecal samples from clinical PD patients. Compared to the control, <i>Drosophila</i> transplanted with fecal samples from PD patients had reduced microbiota <i>Acetobacter</i> and <i>Lactobacillus</i>, and differentially expressed genes enriched in diverse metabolic pathways. In summary, our results reveal the influence of PD-associated gut microbiota on host gene expression, and this study can help better understand the link between gut microbiota and PD pathogenesis through gut-brain axis. IMPORTANCE Gut microbiota plays important roles in regulating host gene expression and physiology through complex mechanisms.

37863655,Regulation of Pain Perception by Microbiota in Parkinson Disease.,"Pain perception involves current stimulation in peripheral nociceptive nerves and the subsequent stimulation of postsynaptic excitatory neurons in the spinal cord. Importantly, in chronic pain, the neural activity of both peripheral nociceptors and postsynaptic neurons in the central nervous system is influenced by several inflammatory mediators produced by the immune system. Growing evidence has indicated that the commensal microbiota plays an active role in regulating pain perception by either acting directly on nociceptors or indirectly through the modulation of the inflammatory activity on immune cells. This symbiotic relationship is mediated by soluble bacterial mediators or intrinsic structural components of bacteria that act on eukaryotic cells, including neurons, microglia, astrocytes, macrophages, T cells, enterochromaffin cells, and enteric glial cells. The molecular mechanisms involve bacterial molecules that act directly on neurons, affecting their excitability, or indirectly on non-neuronal cells, inducing changes in the production of proinflammatory or anti-inflammatory mediators. Importantly, Parkinson disease, a neurodegenerative and inflammatory disorder that affects mainly the dopaminergic neurons implicated in the control of voluntary movements, involves not only a motor decline but also nonmotor symptomatology, including chronic pain. Of note, several recent studies have shown that Parkinson disease involves a dysbiosis in the composition of the gut microbiota. In this review, we first summarize, integrate, and classify the molecular mechanisms implicated in the microbiota-mediated regulation of chronic pain. Second, we analyze the changes on the commensal microbiota associated to Parkinson disease and propose how these changes affect the development of chronic pain in this pathology. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The microbiota regulates chronic pain through the action of bacterial signals into two main locations: the peripheral nociceptors and the postsynaptic excitatory neurons in the spinal cord. The dysbiosis associated to Parkinson disease reveals increased representation of commensals that potentially exacerbate chronic pain and reduced levels of bacteria with beneficial effects on pain. This review encourages further research to better understand the signals involved in bacteria-bacteria and bacteria-host communication to get the clues for the development of probiotics with therapeutic potential.",Pharmacological reviews,2023,Zulmary Manjarres; Margarita Calvo; Rodrigo Pacheco
35830286,Gut microbiota: a new insight into neurological diseases.,"In the last decade, it has become increasingly recognized that a balanced gut microbiota plays an important role in maintaining the health of the host. Numerous clinical and preclinical studies have shown that changes in gut microbiota composition are associated with a variety of neurological diseases, e.g., Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and myasthenia gravis. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are complex and remain unclear. Behavioral phenotypes can be transmitted from humans to animals through gut microbiota transplantation, indicating that the gut microbiota may be an important regulator of neurological diseases. However, further research is required to determine whether animal-based findings can be extended to humans and to elucidate the relevant potential mechanisms by which the gut microbiota regulates neurological diseases. Such investigations may aid in the development of new microbiota-based strategies for diagnosis and treatment and improve the clinical management of neurological disorders. In this review, we describe the dysbiosis of gut microbiota and the corresponding mechanisms in common neurological diseases, and discuss the potential roles that the intestinal microbiome may play in the diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders.",Chinese medical journal,2023,Lanxiang Liu; Haiyang Wang; Xueyi Chen; Peng Xie
36839287,Neuroprotective Effects of Sodium Butyrate by Restoring Gut Microbiota and Inhibiting TLR4 Signaling in Mice with MPTP-Induced Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent type of neurodegenerative disease. There is mounting evidence that the gut microbiota is involved in the pathogenesis of PD. Sodium butyrate (NaB) can regulate gut microbiota and improve brain functioning in neurological disorders. Hence, we examined whether the neuroprotective function of NaB on PD was mediated by the modulation of gut microbial dysbiosis and revealed its possible mechanisms. Mice were administered 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) for 7 consecutive days to construct the PD model. NaB gavage was given 2 h after the daily MPTP injections for 21 days. NaB improved the motor functioning of PD mice, increased striatal neurotransmitter levels, and reduced the death of dopaminergic neurons. The 16S rRNA sequencing analysis revealed that NaB restored the gut microbial dysbiosis. NaB also attenuated the intestinal barrier's disruption and reduced serum, colon, and striatal pro-inflammatory cytokines, along with inhibiting the overactivation of glial cells, suggesting an inhibitory effect on inflammation from NaB throughout the gut-brain axis of the PD mice. Mechanistic studies revealed that NaB treatment suppressed the TLR4/MyD88/NF-kB pathway in the colon and striatum. In summary, NaB had a neuroprotective impact on the PD mice, likely linked to its regulation of gut microbiota to inhibit gut-brain axis inflammation.",Nutrients,2023,Tong-Tong Guo; Zheng Zhang; Yan Sun; Rui-Yang Zhu; Fei-Xia Wang; Lian-Ju Ma; Lin Jiang; Han-Deng Liu
37418977,Low and high doses of oral maslinic acid protect against Parkinson's disease via distinct gut microbiota-related mechanisms.,"The use of oral agents that can modify the gut microbiota (GM) could be a novel preventative or therapeutic option for Parkinson's disease (PD). Maslinic acid (MA), a pentacyclic triterpene acid with GM-dependent biological activities when it is taken orally, has not yet been reported to be effective against PD. The present study found both low and high dose MA treatment significantly prevented dopaminergic neuronal loss in a classical chronic PD mouse model by ameliorating motor functions and improving tyrosine hydroxylase expressions in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and increasing dopamine and its metabolite homovanillic acid levels in the striatum. However, the effects of MA in PD mice were not dose-responsive, since similar beneficial effects for low and high doses of MA were observed. Further mechanism studies indicated that low dose MA administration favored probiotic bacterial growth in PD mice, which helped to increase striatal serotonin, 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid, and γ-aminobutyric acid levels. High dose MA treatment did not influence GM composition in PD mice but significantly inhibited neuroinflammation as indicated by reduced levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 1β in the SNpc; moreover, these effects were mainly mediated by microbially-derived acetic acid in the colon. In conclusion, oral MA at different doses protected against PD via distinct mechanisms related to GM. Nevertheless, our study lacked in-depth investigations of the underlying mechanisms involved; future studies will be designed to further delineate the signaling pathways involved in the interactive actions between different doses of MA and GM.",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2023,Xu Cao; Zhong-Rui Du; Xin Liu; Xiong Wang; Chong Li; Sai-Nan Zhou; Jia-Rui Liu; Ping-Yi Xu; Jun-Li Ye; Qing Zhao; Fang Zhao; Ka-Hing Wong; Xiao-Li Dong
36901907,What the Gut Tells the Brain-Is There a Link between Microbiota and Huntington's Disease?,"The human intestinal microbiota is a diverse and dynamic microenvironment that forms a complex, bi-directional relationship with the host. The microbiome takes part in the digestion of food and the generation of crucial nutrients such as short chain fatty acids (SCFA), but is also impacts the host's metabolism, immune system, and even brain functions. Due to its indispensable role, microbiota has been implicated in both the maintenance of health and the pathogenesis of many diseases. Dysbiosis in the gut microbiota has already been implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, not much is known about the microbiome composition and its interactions in Huntington's disease (HD). This dominantly heritable, incurable neurodegenerative disease is caused by the expansion of CAG trinucleotide repeats in the huntingtin gene (<i>HTT</i>). As a result, toxic RNA and mutant protein (mHTT), rich in polyglutamine (polyQ), accumulate particularly in the brain, leading to its impaired functions. Interestingly, recent studies indicated that mHTT is also widely expressed in the intestines and could possibly interact with the microbiota, affecting the progression of HD. Several studies have aimed so far to screen the microbiota composition in mouse models of HD and find out whether observed microbiome dysbiosis could affect the functions of the HD brain. This review summarizes ongoing research in the HD field and highlights the essential role of the intestine-brain axis in HD pathogenesis and progression. The review also puts a strong emphasis on indicating microbiome composition as a future target in the urgently needed therapy for this still incurable disease.",International journal of molecular sciences,2023,Dorota Wronka; Anna Karlik; Julia O Misiorek; Lukasz Przybyl
37470081,Effect of <i>Lacticaseibacillus paracasei</i> strain Shirota supplementation on clinical responses and gut microbiome in Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor issues and a range of non-motor symptoms. Microbial therapy may be a useful approach for the treatment of PD. However, comprehensive analyses of the impact of probiotic supplementation on motor and non-motor symptoms are still lacking and the mechanisms whereby the treatment works remain unclear. This study investigated <i>Lacticaseibacillus paracasei</i> strain Shirota (LcS) supplementation on clinical responses, gut microbiota and faecal metabolites in PD patients. Patients (<i>n</i> = 128) were randomised to receive either probiotics (LcS-fermented milk, containing 1 × 10<sup>10</sup> living LcS cells) or placebo for 12 weeks. All participants were examined and the basic clinical features were recorded using questionnaires. Fecal and blood samples were collected at the baseline and after 12 weeks for further omics analysis. We found that LcS intervention significantly alleviated patients' constipation-related symptoms and non-motor symptoms. We found no significant shifts in the composition of gut microbiota or faecal metabolites. Several taxa were differentially abundant between the groups, especially with regard to LcS intake, which increased the abundance of the genus <i>Lacticaseibacillus</i> in the probiotic group compared with those at the baseline and in the placebo group. The faecal concentration of L-tyrosine was significantly decreased and the plasma concentration of L-tyrosine was increased in the probiotic group compared with the placebo group. Our study demonstrated that although supplementation with LcS did not induce major changes in the global gut microbiome, the probiotic had favorable effects in managing constipation and other non-motor symptoms in PD patients.

38098666,Exploring the role of gut microbiota in advancing personalized medicine.,"Ongoing extensive research in the field of gut microbiota (GM) has highlighted the crucial role of gut-dwelling microbes in human health. These microbes possess 100 times more genes than the human genome and offer significant biochemical advantages to the host in nutrient and drug absorption, metabolism, and excretion. It is increasingly clear that GM modulates the efficacy and toxicity of drugs, especially those taken orally. In addition, intra-individual variability of GM has been shown to contribute to drug response biases for certain therapeutics. For instance, the efficacy of cyclophosphamide depends on the presence of <i>Enterococcus hirae</i> and <i>Barnesiella intestinihominis</i> in the host intestine. Conversely, the presence of inappropriate or unwanted gut bacteria can inactivate a drug. For example, dehydroxylase of <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> and <i>Eggerthella lenta</i> A2 can metabolize L-dopa before it converts into the active form (dopamine) and crosses the blood-brain barrier to treat Parkinson's disease patients. Moreover, GM is emerging as a new player in personalized medicine, and various methods are being developed to treat diseases by remodeling patients' GM composition, such as prebiotic and probiotic interventions, microbiota transplants, and the introduction of synthetic GM. This review aims to highlight how the host's GM can improve drug efficacy and discuss how an unwanted bug can cause the inactivation of medicine.",Frontiers in microbiology,2023,Gouxin Huang; Raees Khan; Yilin Zheng; Ping-Chin Lee; Qingnan Li; Imran Khan
37787835,The gut microbiome: an important role in neurodegenerative diseases and their therapeutic advances.,"There are complex interactions between the gut and the brain. With increasing research on the relationship between gut microbiota and brain function, accumulated clinical and preclinical evidence suggests that gut microbiota is intimately involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). Increasingly studies are beginning to focus on the association between gut microbiota and central nervous system (CNS) degenerative pathologies to find potential therapies for these refractory diseases. In this review, we summarize the changes in the gut microbiota in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and contribute to our understanding of the function of the gut microbiota in NDs and its possible involvement in the pathogenesis. We subsequently discuss therapeutic approaches targeting gut microbial abnormalities in these diseases, including antibiotics, diet, probiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT).

37147392,Gastrointestinal disorders in Parkinson's disease and other Lewy body diseases.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is pathologically characterized by the abnormal accumulation of α-synuclein fibrils (Lewy bodies) in the substantia nigra and other brain regions, although the role of Lewy bodies remains elusive. Constipation usually precedes the motor symptoms in PD, which is in accordance with the notion that α-synuclein fibrils start from the intestinal neural plexus and ascend to the brain in at least half of PD patients. The gut microbiota is likely to be involved in intestinal and brain pathologies. Analyses of the gut microbiota in PD, rapid-eye-movement sleep behavior disorder, and dementia with Lewy bodies suggest three pathological pathways. First, Akkermansia, which is increased in PD, degrades the intestinal mucus layer and increases intestinal permeability, which triggers inflammation and oxidative stress in the intestinal neural plexus. Second, decreased short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producing bacteria in PD reduce the number of regulatory T cells. Third, SCFAs also aggravate microglial activation with an unelucidated pathway. In addition, in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), which is another form of α-synucleinopathies, increased genera, Ruminococcus torques and Collinsella, may mitigate neuroinflammation in the substantia nigra by increasing secondary bile acids. Interventions for the gut microbiota and their metabolites may potentially delay or mitigate the development and progression of PD and other Lewy body diseases.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2023,Masaaki Hirayama; Hiroshi Nishiwaki; Tomonari Hamaguchi; Kinji Ohno

We aimed to determine whether gut microbiota is altered in PD patients and whether non-motor symptoms of PD and disease duration had any relation with alterations of microbiota profiles among patients.Microbial taxa in stool samples obtained from 84 subjects (42-PD patients and 42-healthy spouses) were analyzed using 16S rRNA amplicon-sequencing.We observed a significant decrease of Firmicutes and a significant increase of Verrucomicrobiota at the phylum level. At the family level, Lactobacillaceae and Akkermansiaceae were significantly increased and Coriobacteriales Incertae Sedis were significantly decreased in the PD patients compared to their healthy spouses. Genus level comparison inferred significant increase in abundance only in Lactobacillus while the abundance of Lachnospiraceae ND3007 group, Tyzzerella, Fusicatenibacter, Eubacterium hallii group and Ruminococcus gauvreauii group were all decreased. We determined that the abundance of Prevotella genus decreased, but not significantly in PD patients. In addition, we found differences in microbiota composition between patients with and without non-motor symptoms.We observed differences in gut microbiota composition between PD patients and their healthy spouses. Our findings suggest that disease duration influenced microbiota composition, which in turn influenced development of non-motor symptoms in PD. This study is the first in terms of both gut microbiota research in Turkish PD patients and the probable effect of microbiota on non-motor symptoms of PD.",Acta neurologica Belgica,2023,Gulsen Babacan Yildiz; Zeynep Cigdem Kayacan; Ilker Karacan; Bilge Sumbul; Birsen Elibol; Ozlem Gelisin; Ozer Akgul
37047769,Neuroprotective Effects of <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> PS128 in a Mouse Model of Parkinson's Disease: The Role of Gut Microbiota and MicroRNAs.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor deficits and marked neuroinflammation in various brain regions. The pathophysiology of PD is complex and mounting evidence has suggested an association with the dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) and gut dysbiosis. Using a rotenone-induced PD mouse model, we observed that administration of <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> PS128 (PS128) significantly improved motor deficits in PD-like mice, accompanied by an increased level of dopamine, reduced dopaminergic neuron loss, reduced microglial activation, reduced levels of inflammatory factors, and enhanced expression of neurotrophic factor in the brain. Notably, the inflammation-related expression of miR-155-5p was significantly upregulated in the proximal colon, midbrain, and striatum of PD-like mice. PS128 reduced the level of miR-155-5p, whereas it increased the expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1), a direct target of miR-155-5p and a critical inhibitor of the inflammatory response in the brain. Alteration of the fecal microbiota in PD-like mice was partially restored by PS128 administration. Among them, <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, <i>Ruminiclostridium</i>_6, <i>Bacteroides</i>, and <i>Alistipes</i> were statistically correlated with the improvement of rotenone-induced motor deficits and the expression of miR-155-5p and SOCS1. Our findings suggested that PS128 ameliorates motor deficits and exerts neuroprotective effects by regulating the gut microbiota and miR-155-5p/SOCS1 pathway in rotenone-induced PD-like mice.",International journal of molecular sciences,2023,Yan Zhang Lee; Shih-Hsuan Cheng; Min-Yu Chang; Yu-Fen Lin; Chien-Chen Wu; Ying-Chieh Tsai
37897083,Gut microbiota-derived short chain fatty acids act as mediators of the gut-brain axis targeting age-related neurodegenerative disorders: a narrative review.,"Neurodegenerative diseases associated with aging are often accompanied by cognitive decline and gut microbiota disorder. But the impact of gut microbiota on these cognitive disturbances remains incompletely understood. Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are major metabolites produced by gut microbiota during the digestion of dietary fiber, serving as an energy source for gut epithelial cells and/or circulating to other organs, such as the liver and brain, through the bloodstream. SCFAs have been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier and played crucial roles in brain metabolism, with potential implications in mediating Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the underlying mechanisms that SCFAs might influence psychological functioning, including affective and cognitive processes and their neural basis, have not been fully elucidated. Furthermore, the dietary sources which determine these SCFAs production was not thoroughly evaluated yet. This comprehensive review explores the production of SCFAs by gut microbiota, their transportation through the gut-brain axis, and the potential mechanisms by which they influence age-related neurodegenerative disorders. Also, the review discusses the importance of dietary fiber sources and the challenges associated with harnessing dietary-derived SCFAs as promoters of neurological health in elderly individuals. Overall, this study suggests that gut microbiota-derived SCFAs and/or dietary fibers hold promise as potential targets and strategies for addressing age-related neurodegenerative disorders.",Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2023,Bingbing Guo; Jingyi Zhang; Weihao Zhang; Feng Chen; Bin Liu
37719758,Acupuncture for Parkinson's disease-related constipation: current evidence and perspectives.,"Parkinson's disease-related constipation (PDC) is commonly associated with impaired dopamine transmission and gastrointestinal dysfunction. Current pharmacological treatments have limited efficacy and potential side effects. Acupuncture has shown promise as an alternative or adjunct therapy by modulating the brain-gut axis, gastrointestinal hormones, and autonomic function. Preliminary randomized trials have shown that acupuncture significantly improves constipation symptoms, bowel movements, and comfort compared to sham or drug treatments and is well-tolerated. The mechanisms of action may involve regulating the gut microbiota and mucosal immunity to improve dysbiosis and gastrointestinal motility. However, more rigorous studies are required to optimize acupuncture protocols and determine long-term efficacy and safety. In summary, acupuncture shows promise as an adjunct therapy for PDC, but further research is needed to confirm its efficacy and safety.",Frontiers in neurology,2023,Jiale Zhang; Xiaolei Ge; Kaiqi Zhang; Yun Qi; Shuo Ren; Xu Zhai
37150399,Differences in the gut microbiome across typical ageing and in Parkinson's disease.,"The microbiota-gut-brain axis' role in Parkinson's disease (PD) pathophysiology, and how this differs from typical ageing, is poorly understood. Presently, gut-bacterial diversity, taxonomic abundance and metabolic bacterial pathways were compared across healthy young (n = 22, 18-35 years), healthy older (n = 33, 50-80 years), and PD groups (n = 18, 50-80 years) using shotgun sequencing and compositional data analysis. Associations between the gut-microbiome and PD symptoms, and between lifestyle factors (fibre intake, physical activity, and sleep) and the gut-microbiome were conducted. Alpha-diversity did not differ between PD participants and older adults, whilst beta-diversity differed between these groups. Lower abundance of Butyricimonas synergistica, a butyrate-producer, was associated with worse PD non-motor symptoms in the PD group. Regarding typical ageing, Bifidobacterium bifidum, was greater in the younger compared to older group, with no difference between the older and PD group. Abundance of metabolic pathways related to butyrate production did not differ among the groups, while other metabolic pathways differed among the three groups. Sleep efficiency was positively associated with Roseburia inulinivorans in the older group. These results highlight the relevance of gut-microbiota to PD and that reduced butyrate-production may be involved with PD pathophysiology. Future studies should account for lifestyle factors when investigating gut-microbiomes across ageing and in PD.

37508017,Urolithin A in Health and Diseases: Prospects for Parkinson's Disease Management.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a complex pathophysiology and a range of symptoms. The prevalence increases with age, putting the ageing population at risk. Disease management includes the improvement of symptoms, the comfort of the patient's life, and palliative care. As there is currently no cure, growing evidence points towards the beneficial role of polyphenols on neurodegeneration. Numerous studies indicate the health benefits of the family of urolithins, especially urolithin A (UA). UA is a bacterial metabolite produced by dietary ellagitannins and ellagic acid. An expanding body of literature explores the involvement of the compound in mitochondrial health, and its anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-apoptotic properties. The review organizes the existing knowledge on the role of UA in health and diseases, emphasizing neurodegenerative diseases, especially PD. We gathered data on the potential neuroprotective effect in in vivo and in vitro models. We discussed the possible mechanisms of action of the compound and related health benefits to give a broader perspective of potential applications of UA in neuroprotective strategies. Moreover, we projected the future directions of applying UA in PD management.","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,Olga Wojciechowska; Małgorzata Kujawska
38115597,Gut microbiota modification by diosgenin mediates antiepileptic effects in a mouse model of epilepsy.,"Diosgenin, a natural steroid saponin, holds promise as a multitarget therapeutic for various diseases, including neurodegenerative conditions. Its efficacy in slowing Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and stroke progression has been demonstrated. However, the role of diosgenin in anti-epilepsy and its potential connection to the modulation of the intestinal microbiota remain poorly understood. In this study, exogenous diosgenin significantly mitigated pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures, learning and memory deficits, and hippocampal neuronal injury. 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) sequencing revealed a reversal in the decrease of Bacteroides and Parabacteroides genera in the PTZ-induced mouse epileptic model following diosgenin treatment. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiments illustrated the involvement of diosgenin in modulating gut microbiota and providing neuroprotection against epilepsy. Our results further indicated the repression of enteric glial cells (EGCs) activation and the TLR4-MyD88 pathway, coupled with reduced production of inflammatory cytokines in the colonic lumen, and improved intestinal barrier function in epilepsy mice treated with diosgenin or FMT. This study suggests that diosgenin plays a role in modifying gut microbiota, contributing to the alleviation of intestinal inflammation and neuroinflammation, ultimately inhibiting epilepsy progression in a PTZ-induced mouse model. Diosgenin emerges as a potential therapeutic option for managing epilepsy and its associated comorbidities.",Journal of neurochemistry,2023,Xinyu Li; Jing Li; Jia Ji; Saisai Li; Xiaoyu Yao; Hongbin Fan; Ruiqin Yao
38287957,Causal relationship between gut microflora and dementia: a Mendelian randomization study.,"Numerous pertinent investigations have demonstrated a correlation between gut microflora (GM) and the occurrence of dementia. However, a causal connection between GM and dementia and its subtypes has not yet been clarified.To explore the causal association between GM and dementia, including its subtypes, a two-sample Mendelian randomization (TSMR) analysis was used.Our data comes from the Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS). The principal approach employed for the Mendelian randomization study was the inverse-variance weighted method, supplemented by four methods: MR-Egger, weighted median, simple mode, and weighted mode. This was followed by Cochrane's Q test, MR-Egger intercept test, MR-PRESSO global test, and leave-one-out as sensitivity analysis validation.Twenty-one GMs associated with any dementia, Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, Parkinson's disease, and dementia under other disease classifications were derived from the analysis, and 21 passed sensitivity tests.We confirmed the causal relationship between GM and dementia and its subtypes, derived specific flora associated with increased or decreased risk of dementia, and provided new ideas for preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic interventions for dementia mediated by gut microbiota.",Frontiers in microbiology,2023,Jinjie Fu; Yuan Qin; Lingyong Xiao; Xiaoyu Dai
36278467,Relationship Between Gut Bacteria and Levodopa Metabolism.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, characterized by the reduction of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra. Levodopa, as a dopamine supplement, is the gold-standard therapeutic drug for PD. The metabolism of levodopa in the periphery not only decreases its bioavailability but also affects its efficacy. Thus, it is necessary to investigate how levodopa is metabolized. A growing number of studies have shown that intestinal bacteria, such as Enterococcus faecalis, Eggerthella lenta and Clostridium sporogenes, could metabolize levodopa in different ways. In addition, several pathways to reduce levodopa metabolism by gut microbiota were confirmed to improve levodopa efficacy. These pathways include aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) inhibitors, antibiotics, pH and (S)-α-fluoromethyltyrosine (AFMT). In this review, we have summarized the metabolic process of levodopa by intestinal bacteria and analyzed potential approaches to reduce the metabolism of levodopa by gut microbiota, thus improving the efficacy of levodopa.",Current neuropharmacology,2023,Kaifei Xu; Shuo Sheng; Feng Zhang
37191418,Gut Microbiota is an Impact Factor based on the Brain-Gut Axis to Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative disease of the central nervous system. The pathogenesis of AD has been explained using cholinergic, β-amyloid toxicity, tau protein hyperphosphorylation, and oxidative stress theories. However, an effective treatment method has not been developed. In recent years, with the discovery of the brain-gut axis (BGA) and breakthroughs made in Parkinson's disease, depression, autism, and other diseases, BGA has become a hotspot in AD research. Several studies have shown that gut microbiota can affect the brain and behavior of patients with AD, especially their cognitive function. Animal models, fecal microbiota transplantation, and probiotic intervention also provide evidence regarding the correlation between gut microbiota and AD. This article discusses the relationship and related mechanisms between gut microbiota and AD based on BGA to provide possible strategies for preventing or alleviating AD symptoms by regulating gut microbiota.",Aging and disease,2023,Bin Zou; Jia Li; Rui-Xia Ma; Xiao-Yu Cheng; Rui-Yin Ma; Ting-Yuan Zhou; Zi-Qi Wu; Yao Yao; Juan Li
37782386,5-HT4 Receptor is Protective for MPTP-induced Parkinson's Disease Mice Via Altering Gastrointestinal Motility or Gut Microbiota.,"Serotonergic dysfunction is related to both motor and nonmotor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). As a 5-HT receptor, 5-HT4 receptor (5-HT4R) is well-studied and already-used in clinical therapy of constipation, which is a typical non-motor symptom in PD. In this study, we investigated the role of 5-HT4R as a regulator of gut function in MPTP-induced acute PD mice model. Daily intraperitoneal injection of GR 125487 (5-HT4R antagonist) was administered 3 days before MPTP treatment until sacrifice. Seven days post-MPTP treatment, feces were collected and gastrointestinal transit time (GITT) was measured, 8 days post-MPTP treatment, behavioral tests were performed, and then animals were sacrificed for the further analysis. We found GR 125487 pretreatment not only increased GITT, but also aggravated MPTP-induced motor bradykinesia. In addition, GR 125487 pretreatment exacerbated the loss of dopaminergic neurons probably by suppressing JAK2/PKA/CREB signaling pathway and increased reactive glia and neuroinflammation in the striatum. 16 S rRNA sequencing of fecal microbiota showed that GR 125487 pretreatment altered the composition of gut microbiota, in which the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila and Clostridium clostridioforme was increased, whereas that of Parabacteroides distasonis and Bacteroides fragilis was decreased, which are closely associated with inflammation condition. Taken together, we demonstrated that GR 125487 pretreatment exacerbates MPTP-induced striatal neurodegenerative processes possibly via the JAK2/PKA/CREB pathway and neuroinflammation by altering gut microbiota composition. In the microbiota-gut-brain axis of PD, 5-HT4R should be further explored and might serve as a target for PD diagnosis and treatment.",Journal of neuroimmune pharmacology : the official journal of the Society on NeuroImmune Pharmacology,2023,Chun Cui; Yun Shi; Hui Hong; Yu Zhou; Chenmeng Qiao; Liping Zhao; Xuebing Jia; Weijiang Zhao; Yanqin Shen
36993742,Gut microbiota and fecal short chain fatty acids differ with adiposity and country of origin: The METS-Microbiome Study.,"The relationship between the gut microbiota, short chain fatty acid (SCFA) metabolism, and obesity remains unclear due to conflicting reports from studies with limited statistical power. Additionally, this association has rarely been explored in large scale diverse populations. Here, we investigated associations between fecal microbial composition, predicted metabolic potential, SCFA concentrations, and obesity in a large ( <i>N</i> = 1,934) adult cohort of African-origin spanning the epidemiologic transition, from Ghana, South Africa, Jamaica, Seychelles, and the United States (US). The greatest gut microbiota diversity and total fecal SCFA concentration was found in the Ghanaian population, while the lowest levels were found in the US population, respectively representing the lowest and the highest end of the epidemiologic transition spectrum. Country-specific bacterial taxa and predicted-functional pathways were observed, including an increased prevalence of <i>Prevotella</i> , <i>Butyrivibrio</i> , <i>Weisella</i> and <i>Romboutsia</i> in Ghana and South Africa, while <i>Bacteroides</i> and <i>Parabacteroides</i> were enriched in Jamaican and the US populations. Importantly, 'VANISH' taxa, including <i>Butyricicoccus and Succinivibrio</i> , were significantly enriched in the Ghanaian cohort, reflecting the participants' traditional lifestyles. Obesity was significantly associated with lower SCFA concentrations, a decrease in microbial richness, and dissimilarities in community composition, and reduction in the proportion of SCFA synthesizing bacteria including <i>Oscillospira</i> , <i>Christensenella</i> , <i>Eubacterium</i> , <i>Alistipes</i> , <i>Clostridium</i> and <i>Odoribacter</i> . Further, the predicted proportions of genes in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) synthesis pathway were enriched in obese individuals, while genes associated with butyrate synthesis via the dominant pyruvate pathway were significantly reduced in obese individuals. Using machine learning, we identified features predictive of metabolic state and country of origin. Country of origin could accurately be predicted by the fecal microbiota (AUC = 0.97), whereas obesity could not be predicted as accurately (AUC = 0.65). Participant sex (AUC = 0.75), diabetes status (AUC = 0.63), hypertensive status (AUC = 0.65), and glucose status (AUC = 0.66) could all be predicted with different success. Interestingly, within country, the predictive accuracy of the microbiota for obesity was inversely correlated to the epidemiological transition, being greatest in Ghana (AUC = 0.57). Collectively, our findings reveal profound variation in the gut microbiota, inferred functional pathways, and SCFA synthesis as a function of country of origin. While obesity could be predicted accurately from the microbiota, the variation in accuracy in parallel with the epidemiological transition suggests that differences in the microbiota between obesity and non-obesity may be larger in low-to-middle countries compared to high-income countries. Further examination of independent study populations using multi-omic approaches will be necessary to determine the factors that drive this association.",bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,2023,Gertrude Ecklu-Mensah; Candice Choo-Kang; Maria Gjerstad Maseng; Sonya Donato; Pascal Bovet; Kweku Bedu-Addo; Jacob Plange-Rhule; Terrence E Forrester; Estelle V Lambert; Dale Rae; Amy Luke; Brian T Layden; Stephen O'Keefe; Jack A Gilbert; Lara R Dugas
38141735,Does gut brain axis has an impact on Parkinson's disease (PD)?,"Parkinson's Disease (PD) is becoming a growing global concern by being the second most prevalent disease next to Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Henceforth new exploration is needed in search of new aspects towards the disease mechanism and origin. Evidence from recent studies has clearly stated the role of Gut Microbiota (GM) in the maintenance of the brain and as a root cause of various diseases and disorders including other neurological conditions. In the case of PD, with an unknown etiology, the GM is said to have a larger impact on the disease pathophysiology. Although GM and its metabolites are crucial for maintaining the normal physiology of the host, it is an undeniable fact that there is an influence of GM in the pathophysiology of PD. As such the Enteroendocrine Cells (EECs) in the epithelium of the intestine are one of the significant regulators of the gut-brain axis and act as a communication mediator between the gut and the brain. The communication is established via the molecules of neuroendocrine which are said to have a crucial part in neurological diseases such as AD, PD, and other psychiatry-related disorders. This review is focused on understanding the proper role of GM and EECs in PD. Here, we also focus on some of the metabolites and compounds that can interact with the PD genes causing various dysfunctions in the cell and facilitating the disease conditions using bioinformatical tools. Various mechanisms concerning EECs and PD, their identification, the latest studies, and available current therapies have also been discussed.",Ageing research reviews,2024,Ajay Elangovan; Bhawna Dahiya; Laxmi Kirola; Mahalaxmi Iyer; Priyanka Jeeth; Sakshi Maharaj; Nikki Kumari; Vikas Lakhanpal; Tanja Maria Michel; K R S Sambasiva Rao; Ssang-Goo Cho; Mukesh Kumar Yadav; Abilash Valsala Gopalakrishnan; Saraboji Kadhirvel; Nachimuthu Senthil Kumar; Balachandar Vellingiri
37978405,Oral pathogens exacerbate Parkinson's disease by promoting Th1 cell infiltration in mice.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common chronic neurological disorder with a high risk of disability and no cure. Periodontitis is an infectious bacterial disease occurring in periodontal supporting tissues. Studies have shown that periodontitis is closely related to PD. However, direct evidence of the effect of periodontitis on PD is lacking. Here, we demonstrated that ligature-induced periodontitis with application of subgingival plaque (LIP-SP) exacerbated motor dysfunction, microglial activation, and dopaminergic neuron loss in 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mice.The 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that LIP-SP induced oral and gut dysbiosis. Particularly, Veillonella parvula (V. parvula) and Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) from oral ligatures were increased in the fecal samples of MPTP + LIP-SP treated mice. We further demonstrated that V. parvula and S. mutans played crucial roles in LIP-SP mediated exacerbation of motor dysfunction and neurodegeneration in PD mice. V. parvula and S. mutans caused microglial activation in the brain, as well as T helper 1 (Th1) cells infiltration in the brain, cervical lymph nodes, ileum and colon in PD mice. Moreover, we observed a protective effect of IFNγ neutralization on dopaminergic neurons in V. parvula- and S. mutans-treated PD mice.Our study demonstrates that oral pathogens V. parvula and S. mutans necessitate the existence of periodontitis to exacerbate motor dysfunction and neurodegeneration in MPTP-induced PD mice. The underlying mechanisms include alterations of oral and gut microbiota, along with immune activation in both brain and peripheral regions.

37850544,Influence of gut microbiota on the development of most prevalent neurodegenerative dementias and the potential effect of probiotics in elderly: A scoping review.,"Dementia is one of today's greatest public health challenges. Its high socio-economic impact and difficulties in diagnosis and treatment are of increasing concern to an aging world population. In recent years, the study of the relationship between gut microbiota and different neurocognitive disorders has gained a considerable interest. Several studies have reported associations between gut microbiota dysbiosis and some types of dementia. Probiotics have been suggested to restore dysbiosis and to improve neurocognitive symptomatology in these dementias. Based on these previous findings, the available scientific evidence on the gut microbiota in humans affected by the most prevalent dementias, as well as the probiotic trials conducted in these patients in recent years, have been here reviewed. Decreased concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and other bacterial metabolites appear to play a major role in the onset of neurocognitive symptoms in Alzheimer disease (AD) and Parkinson disease dementia (PDD). Increased abundance of proinflammatory taxa could be closely related to the more severe clinical symptoms in both, as well as in Lewy Bodies dementia. Important lack of information was noted in Frontotemporal dementia behavioral variant. Moreover, geographical differences in the composition of the gut microbiota have been reported in AD. Some potential beneficial effects of probiotics in AD and PDD have been reported. However, due to the controversial results further investigations are clearly necessary.","American journal of medical genetics.

37375632,The Impact of a Very-Low-Calorie Ketogenic Diet in the Gut Microbiota Composition in Obesity.,"The very-low-calorie KD (VLCKD) is characterized by a caloric intake of under 800 kcal/day divided into less than 50 g/day of carbohydrate (13%) and 1 to 1.5 g of protein/kg of body weight (44%) and 43% of fat. This low carbohydrate intake changes the energy source from glucose to ketone bodies. Moreover, clinical trials have consistently shown a beneficial effect of VLCKD in several diseases, such as heart failure, schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's, and obesity, among others. The gut microbiota has been associated with the metabolic conditions of a person and is regulated by diet interactions; furthermore, it has been shown that the microbiota has a role in body weight homeostasis by regulating metabolism, appetite, and energy. Currently, there is increasing evidence of an association between gut microbiota dysbiosis and the pathophysiology of obesity. In addition, the molecular pathways, the role of metabolites, and how microbiota modulation could be beneficial remain unclear, and more research is needed. The objective of the present article is to contribute with an overview of the impact that VLCKD has on the intestinal microbiota composition of individuals with obesity through a literature review describing the latest research regarding the topic and highlighting which bacteria phyla are associated with obesity and VLCKD.",Nutrients,2023,Ana Karina Zambrano; Santiago Cadena-Ullauri; Patricia Guevara-Ramírez; Evelyn Frias-Toral; Viviana A Ruiz-Pozo; Elius Paz-Cruz; Rafael Tamayo-Trujillo; Sebastián Chapela; Martha Montalván; Gerardo Sarno; Claudia V Guerra; Daniel Simancas-Racines
37674043,Gut microbiota-induced CXCL1 elevation triggers early neuroinflammation in the substantia nigra of Parkinsonian mice.,"Gut microbiota disturbance and systemic inflammation have been implicated in the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD). How the alteration of gut microbiota results in neuropathological events in PD remains elusive. In this study, we explored whether and how environmental insults caused early neuropathological events in the substantia nigra (SN) of a PD mouse model. Aged (12-month-old) mice were orally administered rotenone (6.25 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>·d<sup>-1</sup>) 5 days per week for 2 months. We demonstrated that oral administration of rotenone to ageing mice was sufficient to establish a PD mouse model and that microglial activation and iron deposition selectively appeared in the SN of the mice prior to loss of motor coordination and dopaminergic neurons, and these events could be fully blocked by microglial elimination with a PLX5622-formulated diet. 16 S rDNA sequencing analysis showed that the gut microbiota in rotenone-treated mice was altered, and mice receiving faecal microbial transplantation (FMT) from ageing mice treated with rotenone for 2 months exhibited the same pathology in the SN. We demonstrated that C-X-C motif chemokine ligand-1 (CXCL1) was an essential molecule, as intravenous injection of CXCL1 mimicked almost all the pathology in serum and SN induced by oral rotenone and FMT. Using metabolomics and transcriptomics analyses, we identified the PPAR pathway as a key pathway involved in rotenone-induced neuronal damage. Inhibition of the PPARγ pathway was consistent in the above models, whereas its activation by linoleic acid (60 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>·d<sup>-1</sup>, i.g. for 1 week) could block these pathological events in mice intravenously injected with CXCL1. Altogether, these results reveal that the altered gut microbiota resulted in neuroinflammation and iron deposition occurring early in the SN of ageing mice with oral administration of rotenone, much earlier than motor symptoms and dopaminergic neuron loss. We found that CXCL1 plays a crucial role in this process, possibly via PPARγ signalling inhibition. This study may pave the way for understanding the ""brain-gut-microbiota"" molecular regulatory networks in PD pathogenesis. The aged C57BL/6 male mice with rotenone intragastric administration showed altered gut microbiota, which caused systemic inflammation, PPARγ signalling inhibition and neuroinflammation, brain iron deposition and ferroptosis, and eventually dopaminergic neurodegeneration in PD.",Acta pharmacologica Sinica,2024,Xi-Zhen Ma; Lei-Lei Chen; Le Qu; Hui Li; Jun Wang; Ning Song; Jun-Xia Xie

37034781,Machine learning based gut microbiota pattern and response to fiber as a diagnostic tool for chronic inflammatory diseases.,"Gut microbiota has been implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple gastrointestinal (GI) and systemic metabolic and inflammatory disorders where disrupted gut microbiota composition and function (dysbiosis) has been found in multiple studies. Thus, human microbiome data has a potential to be a great source of information for the diagnosis and disease characteristics (phenotypes, disease course, therapeutic response) of diseases with dysbiotic microbiota community. However, multiple attempts to leverage gut microbiota taxonomic data for diagnostic and disease characterization have failed due to significant inter-individual variability of microbiota community and overlap of disrupted microbiota communities among multiple diseases. One potential approach is to look at the microbiota community pattern and response to microbiota modifiers like dietary fiber in different disease states. This approach is now feasible by availability of machine learning that is able to identify hidden patterns in the human microbiome and predict diseases. Accordingly, the aim of our study was to test the hypothesis that application of machine learning algorithms can distinguish stool microbiota pattern and microbiota response to fiber between diseases where overlapping dysbiotic microbiota have been previously reported. Here, we have applied machine learning algorithms to distinguish between Parkinson's disease, Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), human immune deficiency virus (HIV), and healthy control (HC) subjects in the presence and absence of fiber treatments. We have shown that machine learning algorithms can classify diseases with accuracy as high as 95%. Furthermore, machine learning methods applied to the microbiome data to predict UC vs CD led to prediction accuracy as high as 90%.",bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,2023,Miad Boodaghidizaji; Thaisa Jungles; Tingting Chen; Bin Zhang; Alan Landay; Ali Keshavarzian; Bruce Hamaker; Arezoo Ardekani
37561259,Compound Dihuang Granule Changes Gut Microbiota of MPTP-Induced Parkinson's Disease Mice via Inhibiting TLR4/NF-κB Signaling.,"Intestinal microbiota was connected to Parkinson's Disease (PD) pathology. The ancient Chinese medication for PD is Compound Dihuang Granule (CDG), and we found a neuroprotective function in treating the constipation of PD patients. Nevertheless, the mechanism of action still needs to be clarified. We predicted the probable targets of CDG against PD through Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) network pharmacology and verified the analysis through animal experiments in vivo. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis screened PD-related genes, including Toll-like receptor 4(TLR4), TANK-binding kinase 1(TBK1), Nuclear Factor- Kappa B (NF-κB), and Tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses proved that the NF-κB and toll-like receptor signaling pathways serve a key function in CDG therapy of PD. Molecular docking analysis demonstrated that CDG strongly connected to TLR4/NF-κB. Experiments findings indicated that CDG improved the damage of dopaminergic neurons and gut microbial dysbiosis, ameliorated motor impairments, and suppressed the PD-associated inflammation and oxidative stress in mice induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahy dropyridine (MPTP). CDG suppressed the inflammatory proteins in the colon and protected the intestinal barrier. Overall, CDG improved gut microbial in PD by blocking the pathway of TLR4/NF-κB.",Neurochemical research,2023,Zhu-Qing He; Peng-Fei Huan; Li Wang; Jian-Cheng He
36805171,The importance of gut-brain axis and use of probiotics as a treatment strategy for multiple sclerosis.,"It has been shown that the dysbiosis of the gut's microbes substantially impacts CNS illnesses, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, autism, and autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is a CNS-affected autoimmune demyelination condition. Through a two-way communication pathway known as the gut-brain axis, gut microbes communicate with the CNS. When there is a disruption in the gut microbiome, cytokines and other immune cells are secreted, which affects the BBB and gastrointestinal permeability. Recent research using animal models has revealed that the gut microbiota may greatly influence the pathophysiology of EAE/MS. Any change in the gut might increase inflammatory cytokinesand affect the quantity of SCFAs, and other metabolites that cause neuroinflammation and demyelination. In- vivo and in-vitro studies have concluded that probiotics affect the immune system and can be utilized to treat gastrointestinal dysbiosis. Any alteration in the gut microbial composition caused by probiotic intake may serve as a preventive and treatment strategy for MS. The major goal of this review is to emphasize an overview of recent research on the function of gut microbiota in the onset of MS and how probiotics have a substantial impact on gastrointestinal disruption in MS and other neuro disorders. It will be easier to develop new therapeutic approaches, particularly probiotic-based supplements, for treating multiple sclerosis (MS) if we know the link between the gut and CNS.",Multiple sclerosis and related disorders,2023,Nitish Kumar; Nalini Kanta Sahoo; Sidharth Mehan; Bharti Verma
37647997,Biomarkers of aging in frailty and age-associated disorders: State of the art and future perspective.,"According to the Geroscience concept that organismal aging and age-associated diseases share the same basic molecular mechanisms, the identification of biomarkers of age that can efficiently classify people as biologically older (or younger) than their chronological (i.e. calendar) age is becoming of paramount importance. These people will be in fact at higher (or lower) risk for many different age-associated diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, neurodegeneration, cancer, etc. In turn, patients suffering from these diseases are biologically older than healthy age-matched individuals. Many biomarkers that correlate with age have been described so far. The aim of the present review is to discuss the usefulness of some of these biomarkers (especially soluble, circulating ones) in order to identify frail patients, possibly before the appearance of clinical symptoms, as well as patients at risk for age-associated diseases. An overview of selected biomarkers will be discussed in this regard, in particular we will focus on biomarkers related to metabolic stress response, inflammation, and cell death (in particular in neurodegeneration), all phenomena connected to inflammaging (chronic, low-grade, age-associated inflammation). In the second part of the review, next-generation markers such as extracellular vesicles and their cargos, epigenetic markers and gut microbiota composition, will be discussed. Since recent progresses in omics techniques have allowed an exponential increase in the production of laboratory data also in the field of biomarkers of age, making it difficult to extract biological meaning from the huge mass of available data, Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches will be discussed as an increasingly important strategy for extracting knowledge from raw data and providing practitioners with actionable information to treat patients.",Ageing research reviews,2023,Stefano Salvioli; Maria Sofia Basile; Leonardo Bencivenga; Sara Carrino; Maria Conte; Sarah Damanti; Rebecca De Lorenzo; Eleonora Fiorenzato; Alessandro Gialluisi; Assunta Ingannato; Angelo Antonini; Nicola Baldini; Miriam Capri; Simone Cenci; Licia Iacoviello; Benedetta Nacmias; Fabiola Olivieri; Giuseppe Rengo; Patrizia Rovere Querini; Fabrizia Lattanzio

However, it is not clear yet how food additives are related to the development of Parkinson's disease. Therefore, in this review work, the food additive effects related to the gut microbiota-brain axis and the processes that are carried out to develop Parkinson's disease are studied. To this end, a systematic literature analysis is performed with the selected keywords and the food additive effects are studied to draw possible routes of action. This analysis leads to the proposition of a model that explains the pathways that relate the ingestion of food additives to the development of Parkinson's disease. This work motivates further research that ponders the safety of food additives by measuring their impacts over the gut microbiota-brain axis.",ACS chemical neuroscience,2023,Melanie Verónica Martinez-Vega; Sebastián Galván-Menéndez-Conde; Verónica Freyre-Fonseca
37630539,Personalized Response of Parkinson's Disease Gut Microbiota to Nootropic Medicinal Herbs In Vitro: A Proof of Concept.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons. Although the etiology of PD remains elusive, it has been hypothesized that initial dysregulation may occur in the gastrointestinal tract and may be accompanied by gut barrier defects. A strong clinical interest in developing therapeutics exists, including for the treatment of gut microbiota and physiology. We previously reported the impact of healthy fecal microbiota anaerobic cultures supplemented with nootropic herbs. Here, we evaluated the effect of nootropic Ayurvedic herbs on fecal microbiota derived from subjects with PD in vitro using 16S rRNA sequencing. The microbiota underwent substantial change in response to each treatment, comparable in magnitude to that observed from healthy subjects. However, the fecal samples derived from each participant displayed unique changes, consistent with a personalized response. We used genome-wide metabolic reconstruction to predict the community's metabolic potential to produce products relevant to PD pathology, including SCFAs, vitamins and amino acid degradation products. These results suggest the potential value of conducting in vitro cultivation and analyses of PD stool samples as a means of prescreening patients to select the medicinal herbs for which that individual is most likely to respond and derive benefit.",Microorganisms,2023,Christine Tara Peterson; Stanislav N Iablokov; Dmitry A Rodionov; Scott N Peterson
37267589,"A Low-Protein, High-Carbohydrate Diet Exerts a Neuroprotective Effect on Mice with 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-Induced Parkinson's Disease by Regulating the Microbiota-Metabolite-Brain Axis and Fibroblast Growth Factor 21.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is closely linked to lifestyle factors, particularly dietary patterns, which have attracted interest as potential disease-modifying factors. Eating a low-protein, high-carbohydrate (LPHC) diet is a promising dietary intervention against brain aging; however, its protective effect on PD remains elusive. Here, we found that an LPHC diet ameliorated 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrathydropyridine (MPTP)-induced motor deficits, decreased dopaminergic neuronal death, and increased the levels of striatal dopamine, serotonin, and their metabolites in PD mice. Levels of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF-21), a member of the fibroblast growth factor family, were elevated in PD mice following LPHC treatment. Furthermore, the administration of FGF-21 exerted a protective effect on MPTP-induced PC12 cells, similar to the effect of an LPHC diet in MPTP-induced mice. Sequencing of the 16S rDNA from fecal microbiota revealed that an LPHC diet normalized the gut bacterial composition imbalance in PD mice, as evidenced by the increased abundance of the genera <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, <i>Ileibacterium</i>, <i>Turicibacter</i>, and <i>Blautia</i> and decreased abundance of <i>Bilophila, Alistipes</i>, and <i>Bacteroides</i>. PICRUSt-predicted fecal microbiome function revealed that an LPHC diet suppressed lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and the citrate cycle (TCA cycle), biosynthesis of ubiquinone and other terpenoid-quinones, and oxidative phosphorylation pathways caused by MPTP, and enhanced the biosynthesis of amino acids, carbohydrate metabolism, and biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites. A nonmetabolomic analysis of the serum and feces showed that an LPHC diet significantly increased the levels of aromatic amino acids (AAAs), including tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine. In addition, an LPHC diet elevated the serum concentrations of bile acids (BAs), particularly tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) and taurine. Collectively, our current findings point to the potential mechanism of administering an LPHC diet in attenuating movement impairments in MPTP-induced PD mice, with AAAs, microbial metabolites (TUDCA and taurine), and FGF-21 as key mediators along the gut-microbiota-brain axis.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2023,Chuanqi Chu; Tiantian Li; Leilei Yu; Yiwen Li; Miaoyu Li; Min Guo; Jianxin Zhao; Qixiao Zhai; Fengwei Tian; Wei Chen
36676436,Latent Potential of Multifunctional Selenium Nanoparticles in Neurological Diseases and Altered Gut Microbiota.,"Neurological diseases remain a major concern due to the high world mortality rate and the absence of appropriate therapies to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Therefore, the major focus is on the development of such strategies that not only enhance the efficacy of drugs but also increase their permeability in the BBB. Currently, nano-scale materials seem to be an appropriate approach to treating neurological diseases based on their drug-loading capacity, reduced toxicity, targeted delivery, and enhanced therapeutic effect. Selenium (Se) is an essential micronutrient and has been of remarkable interest owing to its essential role in the physiological activity of the nervous system, i.e., signal transmission, memory, coordination, and locomotor activity. A deficiency of Se leads to various neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, and Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, owing to the neuroprotective role of Se (selenium) nanoparticles (SeNPs) are of particular interest to treat neurological diseases. To date, many studies investigate the role of altered microbiota with neurological diseases; thus, the current review focused not only on the recent advancement in the field of nanotechnology, considering SeNPs to cure neurological diseases, but also on investigating the potential role of SeNPs in altered microbiota.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,Hajra Ashraf; Davide Cossu; Stefano Ruberto; Marta Noli; Seyedesomaye Jasemi; Elena Rita Simula; Leonardo A Sechi
37458987,Dissecting the Relationship Between Neuropsychiatric and Neurodegenerative Disorders.,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) and neuropsychiatric disorders (NPDs) are two common causes of death in elderly people, which includes progressive neuronal cell death and behavioral changes. NDDs include Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and motor neuron disease, characterized by cognitive defects and memory impairment, whereas NPDs include depression, seizures, migraine headaches, eating disorders, addictions, palsies, major depressive disorders, anxiety, and schizophrenia, characterized by behavioral changes. Mounting evidence demonstrated that NDDs and NPDs share an overlapping mechanism, which includes post-translational modifications, the microbiota-gut-brain axis, and signaling events. Mounting evidence demonstrated that various drug molecules, namely, natural compounds, repurposed drugs, multitarget directed ligands, and RNAs, have been potentially implemented as therapeutic agents against NDDs and NPDs. Herein, we highlighted the overlapping mechanism, the role of anxiety/stress-releasing factors, cytosol-to-nucleus signaling, and the microbiota-gut-brain axis in the pathophysiology of NDDs and NPDs. We summarize the therapeutic application of natural compounds, repurposed drugs, and multitarget-directed ligands as therapeutic agents. Lastly, we briefly described the application of RNA interferences as therapeutic agents in the pathogenesis of NDDs and NPDs. Neurodegenerative diseases and neuropsychiatric diseases both share a common signaling molecule and molecular phenomenon, namely, pro-inflammatory cytokines, γCaMKII and MAPK/ERK, chemokine receptors, BBB permeability, and the gut-microbiota-brain axis. Studies have demonstrated that any alterations in the signaling mentioned above molecules and molecular phenomena lead to the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases, namely, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and neuropsychiatric disorders, such as bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, autism spectrum disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder.",Molecular neurobiology,2023,Rohan Gupta; Dia Advani; Divya Yadav; Rashmi K Ambasta; Pravir Kumar
37755674,Relationship Between Short-chain Fatty Acids and Parkinson's Disease: A Review from Pathology to Clinic.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complicated neurodegenerative disease, characterized by the accumulation of α-synuclein (α-syn) in Lewy bodies and neurites, and massive loss of midbrain dopamine neurons. Increasing evidence suggests that gut microbiota and microbial metabolites are involved in the development of PD. Among these, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), the most abundant microbial metabolites, have been proven to play a key role in brain-gut communication. In this review, we analyze the role of SCFAs in the pathology of PD from multiple dimensions and summarize the alterations of SCFAs in PD patients as well as their correlation with motor and non-motor symptoms. Future research should focus on further elucidating the role of SCFAs in neuroinflammation, as well as developing novel strategies employing SCFAs and their derivatives to treat PD.",Neuroscience bulletin,2024,Wen-Xiang Duan; Fen Wang; Jun-Yi Liu; Chun-Feng Liu
37460539,Neuroprotective effect of a medium-chain triglyceride ketogenic diet on MPTP-induced Parkinson's disease mice: a combination of transcriptomics and metabolomics in the substantia nigra and fecal microbiome.,"The ketogenic diet (KD) is a low carbohydrate and high-fat protein diet. It plays a protective role in neurodegenerative diseases by elevating the levels of ketone bodies in blood, regulating central and peripheral metabolism and mitochondrial functions, inhibiting neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, and altering the gut microbiota. However, studies on ketogenic therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD) are still in their infancy. Therefore, we examined the possible protective effect of KD in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse model, examined the mouse gut microbiota and its metabolites, and performed transcriptomics and metabolomics on the substantia nigra of mice. Our results showed that a long-term medium-chain triglyceride KD (MCT-KD) significantly reduced MPTP-induced damage to dopaminergic (DA) neurons, exerted antioxidant stress through the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 pathway, and reversed oxidative stress in DA neurons. The MCT-KD also reduced mitochondrial loss, promoted ATP production, and inhibited the activation of microglia to protect DA neurons in MPTP-induced PD mice. MCT-KD altered the gut microbiota and consequently changed the metabolism of substantia nigra neurons through gut microbiota metabolites. Compared to the MPTP group, MCT-KD increased the abundance of gut microbiota, including Blautia and Romboutsia. MCT-KD also affects purine metabolism in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) by altering fecal metabolites. This study shows that MCT-KD has multiple protective effects against PD.",Cell death discovery,2023,Wenlong Zhang; Shiyu Chen; Xingting Huang; Huichun Tong; Hongxin Niu; Lingli Lu
37107583,Role of Microbiota-Modified Bile Acids in the Regulation of Intracellular Organelles and Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Bile acids (BAs) are amphiphilic steroidal molecules generated from cholesterol in the liver and facilitate the digestion and absorption of fat-soluble substances in the gut. Some BAs in the intestine are modified by the gut microbiota. Because BAs are modified in a variety of ways by different types of bacteria present in the gut microbiota, changes in the gut microbiota can affect the metabolism of BAs in the host. Although most BAs absorbed from the gut are transferred to the liver, some are transferred to the systemic circulation. Furthermore, BAs have also been detected in the brain and are thought to migrate into the brain through the systemic circulation. Although BAs are known to affect a variety of physiological functions by acting as ligands for various nuclear and cell-surface receptors, BAs have also been found to act on mitochondria and autophagy in the cell. This review focuses on the BAs modified by the gut microbiota and their roles in intracellular organelles and neurodegenerative diseases.",Genes,2023,Yoshimitsu Kiriyama; Hiromi Nochi
37589449,"Communal interaction of glycation and gut microbes in diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease pathogenesis.","Diabetes and its complications, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD) are increasing gradually, reflecting a global threat vis-à-vis expressing the essentiality of a substantial paradigm shift in research and remedial actions. Protein glycation is influenced by several factors, like time, temperature, pH, metal ions, and the half-life of the protein. Surprisingly, most proteins associated with metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders are generally long-lived and hence susceptible to glycation. Remarkably, proteins linked with diabetes, AD, and PD share this characteristic. This modulates protein's structure, aggregation tendency, and toxicity, highlighting renovated attention. Gut microbes and microbial metabolites marked their importance in human health and diseases. Though many scientific shreds of evidence are proposed for possible change and dysbiosis in gut flora in these diseases, very little is known about the mechanisms. Screening and unfolding their functionality in metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders is essential in hunting the gut treasure. Therefore, it is imperative to evaluate the role of glycation as a common link in diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases, which helps to clarify if modulation of nonenzymatic glycation may act as a beneficial therapeutic strategy and gut microbes/metabolites may answer some of the crucial questions. This review briefly emphasizes the common functional attributes of glycation and gut microbes, the possible linkages, and discusses current treatment options and therapeutic challenges.",Medicinal research reviews,2024,Rahul Shivaji Patil; Rashmi Santosh Tupe
37496895,<i>Acanthopanax senticosus</i> Harms improves Parkinson's disease by regulating gut microbial structure and metabolic disorders.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, with an increasing prevalence as the population ages, posing a serious threat to human health, but the pathogenesis remains uncertain. <i>Acanthopanax senticosus</i> (Rupr. et Maxim.) Harms (ASH) (aqueous ethanol extract), a Chinese herbal medicine, provides obvious and noticeable therapeutic effects on PD. To further investigate the ASH's mechanism of action in treating PD, the structural and functional gut microbiota, as well as intestinal metabolite before and after ASH intervention in the PD mice model, were examined utilizing metagenomics and fecal metabolomics analysis. α-syn transgenic mice were randomly divided into a model and ASH groups, with C57BL/6 mice as a control. The ASH group was gavaged with ASH (45.5 mg/kg/d for 20d). The time of pole climbing and autonomous activity were used to assess motor ability. The gut microbiota's structure, composition, and function were evaluated using Illumina sequencing. Fecal metabolites were identified using UHPLC-MS/MS to construct intestinal metabolites. The findings of this experiment demonstrate that ASH may reduce the climbing time of PD model mice while increasing the number of autonomous movements. The results of metagenomics analysis revealed that ASH could up-regulated <i>Firmicutes</i> and down-regulated <i>Actinobacteria</i> at the phylum level, while <i>Clostridium</i> was up-regulated and <i>Akkermansia</i> was down-regulated at the genus level; it could also recall 49 species from the phylum <i>Firmicutes</i>, <i>Actinobacteria</i>, and <i>Tenericutes</i>. Simultaneously, metabolomics analysis revealed that alpha-Linolenic acid metabolism might be a key metabolic pathway for ASH to impact in PD. Furthermore, metagenomics function analysis and metabolic pathway enrichment analysis revealed that ASH might influence unsaturated fatty acid synthesis and purine metabolism pathways. These metabolic pathways are connected to ALA, Palmitic acid, Adenine, and 16 species of <i>Firmicutes</i>, <i>Actinobacteria</i>, and <i>Tenericutes</i>. Finally, these results indicate that ASH may alleviate the movement disorder of the PD model, which may be connected to the regulation of gut microbiota structure and function as well as the modulation of metabolic disorders by ASH.",Heliyon,2023,Yi Lu; Xin Gao; Yang Nan; Shadi A D Mohammed; Jiaqi Fu; Tianyu Wang; Chongzhi Wang; Chunsu Yuan; Fang Lu; Shumin Liu
36803806,Disease mechanisms as subtypes: Microbiome.,"Abnormalities in gut microbiota have been suggested to be involved in the pathophysiology and progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). Gastrointestinal nonmotor symptoms often precede the onset of motor features in PD, suggesting a role for gut dysbiosis in neuroinflammation and α-synuclein (α-syn) aggregation. In the first part of this chapter, we analyze critical features of healthy gut microbiota and factors (environmental and genetic) that modify its composition. In the second part, we focus on the mechanisms underlying the gut dysbiosis and how it alters anatomically and functionally the mucosal barrier, triggering neuroinflammation and subsequently α-syn aggregation. In the third part, we describe the most common alterations in the gut microbiota of PD patients, dividing the gastrointestinal system in higher and lower tract to examine the association between microbiota abnormalities and clinical features. In the final section, we report on current and future therapeutic approaches to gut dysbiosis aiming to either reduce the risk for PD, modify the disease course, or improve the pharmacokinetic profile of dopaminergic therapies. We also suggest that further studies will be needed to clarify the role of the microbiome in PD subtyping and of pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions in modifying specific microbiota profiles in individualizing disease-modifying treatments in PD.",Handbook of clinical neurology,2023,Salvatore Bonvegna; Roberto Cilia
36671785,"Parkinson's Disease, It Takes Guts: The Correlation between Intestinal Microbiome and Cytokine Network with Neurodegeneration.","Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with motor, physical and behavioral symptoms that can have a profound impact on the patient's quality of life. Most cases are idiopathic, and the exact mechanism of the disease's cause is unknown. The current hypothesis focuses on the gut-brain axis and states that gut microbiota dysbiosis can trigger inflammation and advances the development of Parkinson's disease. This systematic review presents the current knowledge of gut microbiota analysis and inflammation based on selected studies on Parkinson's patients and experimental animal models. Changes in gut microbiota correlate with Parkinson's disease, but only a few studies have considered inflammatory modulators as important triggers of the disease. Nevertheless, it is evident that proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines are induced in the gut, the circulation, and the brain before the development of the disease's neurological symptoms and exacerbate the disease. Increased levels of tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, interleukin-17A and interferon-γ can correlate with altered gut microbiota. Instead, treatment of gut dysbiosis is accompanied by reduced levels of inflammatory mediators in specific tissues, such as the colon, brain and serum and/or cerebrospinal fluid. Deciphering the role of the immune responses and the mechanisms of the PD-associated gut microbiota will assist the interpretation of the pathogenesis of Parkinson's and will elucidate appropriate therapeutic strategies.",Biology,2023,Georgia Xiromerisiou; Chrysoula Marogianni; Anastasia Androutsopoulou; Panagiotis Ntavaroukas; Dimitrios Mysiris; Stamatia Papoutsopoulou
38146566,Effectiveness of the Combination of Probiotic Supplementation on Motor Symptoms and Constipation in Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) reflects the second most common neurodegenerative disorder and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Besides the motor features, non-motor symptoms, such as constipation, are very common. There is accumulating evidence that neuroinflammation is associated with the PD pathological processes. Alterations of gut microbiota and microbial metabolites have been linked to the pathogenesis of PD. Previous research has shown that probiotic supplementation has beneficial effects on motor and non-motor symptoms and especially on constipation.In this study, we examine the effectiveness of a combination of probiotic supplementation (butyrate triglyceride 302.86 mg, <i>Crocus sativus L.</i> 30 mg, and vitamin D3 100 mcg), on constipation and motor symptoms in PD.The present study is a retrospective study that examined the existing medical records of patients with diagnosed PD, having chronic constipation and used the probiotic supplementation for its management. A total of 41 existing medical records were screened. Medical records were excluded in the case of participation in another study for PD, suffering from irritable bowel syndrome, organic constipation, long-term laxative use changes in the standard dopaminergic treatment, Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) score<24, hospitalization and antibiotic medication, and diarrheal syndrome. Nine medical records were excluded, and a final number of 32 medical records was finally examined. All 32 patients had evaluations carried out at baseline and three months after supplement administration. A stool diary questionnaire, the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III (UPDRS III), and the Schwab and England and the Hoehn and Yahr scales were used for the evaluation.The median defecation frequency was significantly improved. The supplementation administration significantly improved UPDRS III by 7.7% (from 35.72±15.51 to 32.97±15.71, p = 0.005) at month three, as compared to baseline. A positive effect was also seen in the Schwab and England scale. There was no effect on the Hoehn and Yahr scale.The enteric microbiome composition is altered in PD, and there is accumulating evidence that probiotic supplementation could alleviate disease symptoms in neuroinflammatory disorders.",Cureus,2023,Athanasia Alexoudi; Lydia Kesidou; Stylianos Gatzonis; Christos Charalampopoulos; Areti Tsoga
37298727,Zooming into Gut Dysbiosis in Parkinson's Disease: New Insights from Functional Mapping.,"Gut dysbiosis has been involved in the pathogenesis and progression of Parkinson's disease (PD), but the mechanisms through which gut microbiota (GM) exerts its influences deserve further study. Recently, we proposed a two-hit mouse model of PD in which ceftriaxone (CFX)-induced dysbiosis amplifies the neurodegenerative phenotype generated by striatal 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) injection in mice. Low GM diversity and the depletion of key gut colonizers and butyrate producers were the main signatures of GM alteration in this model. Here, we used the phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states (PICRUSt2) to unravel candidate pathways of cell-to-cell communication associated with dual-hit mice and potentially involved in PD progression. We focused our analysis on short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) metabolism and quorum sensing (QS) signaling. Based on linear discriminant analysis, combined with the effect size results, we found increased functions linked to pyruvate utilization and a depletion of acetate and butyrate production in 6-OHDA+CFX mice. The specific arrangement of QS signaling as a possible result of the disrupted GM structure was also observed. With this exploratory study, we suggested a scenario in which SCFAs metabolism and QS signaling might represent the effectors of gut dysbiosis potentially involved in the designation of the functional outcomes that contribute to the exacerbation of the neurodegenerative phenotype in the dual-hit animal model of PD.",International journal of molecular sciences,2023,Luigia Turco; Nicola Opallo; Elisabetta Buommino; Carmen De Caro; Claudio Pirozzi; Giuseppina Mattace Raso; Francesca Lembo; Lorena Coretti

37628082,Dietary Polysaccharides Exert Anti-Fatigue Functions via the Gut-Muscle Axis: Advances and Prospectives.,"Due to today's fast-paced lifestyle, most people are in a state of sub-health and face ""unexplained fatigue"", which can seriously affect their health, work efficiency, and quality of life. Fatigue is also a common symptom of several serious diseases such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, cancer, etc. However, the contributing mechanisms are not clear, and there are currently no official recommendations for the treatment of fatigue. Some dietary polysaccharides are often used as health care supplements; these have been reported to have specific anti-fatigue effects, with minor side effects and rich pharmacological activities. Dietary polysaccharides can be activated during food processing or during gastrointestinal transit, exerting unique effects. This review aims to comprehensively summarize and evaluate the latest advances in the biological processes of exercise-induced fatigue, to understand dietary polysaccharides and their possible molecular mechanisms in alleviating exercise-induced fatigue, and to systematically elaborate the roles of gut microbiota and the gut-muscle axis in this process. From the perspective of the gut-muscle axis, investigating the relationship between polysaccharides and fatigue will enhance our understanding of fatigue and may lead to a significant breakthrough regarding the molecular mechanism of fatigue. This paper will provide new perspectives for further research into the use of polysaccharides in food science and food nutrition, which could help develop potential anti-fatigue agents and open up novel therapies for sub-health conditions.","Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,Yaping Zhou; Zhongxing Chu; Yi Luo; Feiyan Yang; Fuliang Cao; Feijun Luo; Qinlu Lin
37747555,Diet-gut microbiome interaction and ferulic acid bioavailability: implications on neurodegenerative disorders.,"Ferulic acid (FA), which occurs naturally as the feruloylated sugar ester in grains, fruits, and vegetables, is critical for combating oxidative stress and alleviating neurodegenerative diseases resulting from free radical-generated protein aggregates in brain cells. However, FA cannot be absorbed in conjugated form. Therefore, strategies to improve the bioavailability of FA are gaining more importance. Ferulic acid esterases (FAE) of the gut microbiota are critical enzymes that facilitate FA release from feruloylated sugar ester conjugates and influence systemic health. This review provides insight into a nutrition-based approach to preventing neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's by altering the diversity of FAE-producing gut microbiota.The human gut is a niche for a highly dense microbial population. Nutrient components and the quality of food shape the gut microbiota. Microbiota-diet-host interaction primarily involves an array of enzymes that hydrolyse complex polysaccharides and release covalently attached moieties, thereby increasing their bio-accessibility. Moreover, genes encoding polysaccharide degrading enzymes are substrate inducible, giving selective microorganisms a competitive advantage in scavenging nutrients. Nutraceutical therapy using specific food components holds promise as a prophylactic agent and as an adjunctive treatment strategy in neurotherapeutics, as it results in upregulation of polysaccharide utilisation loci containing fae genes in the gut microbiota, thereby increasing the release of FA and other antioxidant molecules and combat neurodegenerative processes.",European journal of nutrition,2024,Saarika Pothuvan Kunnummal; Mahejibin Khan
37487923,Metals linked with the most prevalent primary neurodegenerative dementias in the elderly: A narrative review.,"The ageing population has been steadily increasing worldwide, leading to a higher risk of cognitive decline and dementia. Environmental toxicants, particularly metals, have been identified as modifiable risk factors for cognitive impairment. Continuous exposure to metals occurs mainly through dietary sources, with older adults being particularly vulnerable. However, imbalances in the gut microbiota, known as dysbiosis, have also been associated with dementia. A literature review was conducted to explore the potential role of metals in the development of cognitive decline and the most prevalent primary neurodegenerative dementias, as well as their interaction with the gut microbiota. High levels of iron (Fe) and copper (Cu) are associated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), while low selenium (Se) levels are linked to poor cognitive status. Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) is associated with elevated levels of iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and zinc (Zn), but the role of copper (Cu) remains unclear. The relationship between metals and Lewy body dementia (LBD) requires further investigation. High aluminium (Al) exposure is associated with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and elevated selenium (Se) levels may be linked to its onset. Challenges in comparing studies arise from the heterogeneity of metal analysis matrices and analytical techniques, as well as the limitations of small study cohorts. More research is needed to understand the influence of metals on cognition through the gut microbiota (GMB) and its potential relevance in the development of these diseases.",Environmental research,2023,David Mateo; Montse Marquès; Margarita Torrente
37851313,Gut-Brain Axis a Key Player to Control Gut Dysbiosis in Neurological Diseases.,"Parkinson's disease is a chronic neuropathy characterised by the formation of Lewy bodies (misfolded alpha-synuclein) in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra and other parts of the brain. Dopaminergic neurons play a vital role in generating both motor and non-motor symptoms. Finding therapeutic targets for Parkinson's disease (PD) is hindered due to an incomplete understanding of the disease's pathophysiology. Existing evidence suggests that the gut microbiota participates in the pathogenesis of PD via immunological, neuroendocrine, and direct neural mechanisms. Gut microbial dysbiosis triggers the loss of dopaminergic neurons via mitochondrial dysfunction. Gut dysbiosis triggers bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine, which increases the permeability barrier and induces systemic inflammation. It results in excessive stimulation of the innate immune system. In addition to that, activation of enteric neurons and enteric glial cells initiates the aggregation of alpha-synuclein. This alpha-synucleinopathy thus affects all levels of the brain-gut axis, including the central, autonomic, and enteric nervous systems. Though the neurobiological signaling cascade between the gut microbiome and the central nervous system is poorly understood, gut microbial metabolites may serve as a promising therapeutic strategy for PD. This article summarises all the known possible ways of bidirectional signal communication, i.e., the ""gut-brain axis,"" where microbes from the middle gut interact with the brain and vice versa, and highlights a unique way to treat neurodegenerative diseases by maintaining homeostasis. The tenth cranial nerve (vagus nerve) plays a significant part in this signal communication. However, the leading regulatory factor for this axis is a diet that helps with microbial colonisation and brain function. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), derived from microbially fermented dietary fibres, link host nutrition to maintain intestinal homeostasis. In addition to that, probiotics modulate cognitive function and the metabolic and behavioural conditions of the body. As technology advances, new techniques will emerge to study the tie-up between gut microbes and neuronal diseases.",Molecular neurobiology,2023,Ieshita Pan; Praveen Kumar Issac; Md Mostafizur Rahman; Ajay Guru; Jesu Arockiaraj
37579835,Unveiling the role of gut-brain axis in regulating neurodegenerative diseases: A comprehensive review.,"Emerging evidence have shown the importance of gut microbiota in regulating brain functions. The diverse molecular mechanisms involved in cross-talk between gut and brain provide insight into importance of this communication in maintenance of brain homeostasis. It has also been observed that disturbed gut microbiota contributes to neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and aging. Recently, gut microbiome-derived exosomes have also been reported to play an essential role in the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases and could thereby act as a therapeutic target. Further, pharmacological interventions including antibiotics, prebiotics and probiotics can influence gut microbiome-mediated management of neurological diseases. However, extensive research is warranted to better comprehend this interconnection in maintenance of brain homeostasis and its implication in neurological diseases. Thus, the present review is aimed to provide a detailed understanding of gut-brain axis followed by possibilities to target the gut microbiome for improving neurological health.",Life sciences,2023,Himanshi Yadav; Jaldhi; Rati Bhardwaj; Anamika; Amrita Bakshi; Suchi Gupta; Shashank Kumar Maurya
36708421,Gut Microbial Alteration in MPTP Mouse Model of Parkinson Disease is Administration Regimen Dependent.,"Parkinson Disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons involved in motor functions. Growing evidence indicates that gut microbiota communicates with the brain known as the gut-brain axis (GBA). Mitochondrial toxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) is commonly used in animal studies to investigate the GBA in PD. Various MPTP administration regimens are performed in PD mouse models involving one to multiple injections in 1 day or one injection per day for several days. The aim of this study is to investigate if the impact of MPTP on gut microbiota differs depending on the administration regimen. C57BL/6 mice were treated with acute or subchronic regimens of MPTP. Motor functions were assessed by open-field, catalepsy, and wire hanging tests. The cecum and the brain samples were obtained for microbiota and gene expression analyses, respectively. MPTP administration regimens differed in their ability to alter the gut microbiota. Firmicutes and Bacteroidota were both increased in subchronic mice while did not change and decreased, respectively, in acute mice. Verrucomicrobiota was elevated in acute MPTP mice but dropped in subchronic MPTP mice. Muribaculaceae was the predominant genus in all groups but acute mice. In acute mice, Akkermansia was increased and Colidextribacter was decreased; however, they showed an opposite trend in subchronic mice. These data suggest that MPTP mouse model cause a gut microbiota dysbiosis in an administration regimen dependent manner, and it is important to take consideration of mouse model to investigate the GBA in neurodegenerative diseases including PD.",Cellular and molecular neurobiology,2023,Busra Aktas
37102320,The protective role of microbiota in the prevention of MPTP/P-induced Parkinson's disease by resveratrol.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a tricky neurodegenerative disease characterized with motor deficits and gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction. Gut microbiota disturbance is reported to be involved in the clinical phenotypes of PD and its pathogenesis through the brain-gut-microbiota axis. Resveratrol is a natural polyphenol that possesses various biological activities in alleviating many diseases, including PD. The present study was aimed to investigate the role of gut microbiota in resveratrol-treated PD mice. A chronic mouse model of PD was generated <i>via</i> the injection of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and probenecid (MPTP/P) for 5 consecutive weeks. Resveratrol was orally administered once a day (30 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>) for a total of 8 weeks. From the 6<sup>th</sup> week to the 8<sup>th</sup> week, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) was performed from resveratrol-treated PD mice to PD mice to evaluate the contribution of resveratrol-shaped microbiota in the alleviation of PD. The results showed that FMT from resveratrol-shaped microbiota remarkably alleviated the mice phenotype from PD progression, including increased latency in the rotarod, shortened beam walking time, increased the number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and enriched TH-positive fiber density in the striatum. Further experiments revealed that FMT could ameliorate the GI dysfunction by increasing the small intestinal transport rate and the colon length, decreasing the relative abundances of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β) in colon epithelial tissue. The 16S rDNA sequencing indicated that FMT attenuated the gut microbial dysbiosis in PD mice by increasing the abundances of Prevotellaceae, Rikenellaceae, Erysipelotrichaceae, <i>Blautia</i> and <i>Alistipes</i>, lowering the ratio of Fimicutes/Bacteroidetes, and decreasing the abundances of Lachnospiraceae and <i>Akkermansia</i>. Therefore, results in this study demonstrated that gut microbiota played a vital role in the prevention of PD progression, and the shaping of the gut microbiota was the pharmacological mechanism of resveratrol in alleviating the phenotype of Parkinson's disease in PD mice.",Food & function,2023,Jing Tao; Yunying An; Lingyun Xu; Yuxin Wang; Chaowei Wang; Puze Li; Min Li; Dong Yan; Mingyong Wang; Genshen Zhong; Minna Wu
37968765,Compositional changes in fecal microbiota in a new Parkinson's disease model: C57BL/6-Tg(NSE-haSyn) mice.,"The gut-brain axis (GBA) in Parkinson's disease (PD) has only been investigated in limited mice models despite dysbiosis of the gut microbiota being considered one of the major treatment targets for neurodegenerative disease. Therefore, this study examined the compositional changes of fecal microbiota in novel transgenic (Tg) mice overexpressing human α-synuclein (hαSyn) proteins under the neuron-specific enolase (NSE) to analyze the potential as GBA model.The expression level of the αSyn proteins was significantly higher in the substantia nigra and striatum of NSE-hαSyn Tg mice than the Non-Tg mice, while those of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) were decreased in the same group. In addition, a decrease of 72.7% in the fall times and a 3.8-fold increase in the fall number was detected in NSE-hαSyn Tg mice. The villus thickness and crypt length on the histological structure of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract decreased in NSE-hαSyn Tg mice. Furthermore, the NSE-hαSyn Tg mice exhibited a significant increase in 11 genera, including Scatolibacter, Clostridium, Feifania, Lachnoclostridium, and Acetatifactor population, and a decrease in only two genera in Ligilactobacillus and Sangeribacter population during enhancement of microbiota richness and diversity.The motor coordination and balance dysfunction of NSE-hαSyn Tg mice may be associated with compositional changes in gut microbiota. In addition, these mice have potential as a GBA model.",Laboratory animal research,2023,Ji Eun Kim; Ki Chun Kwon; You Jeong Jin; Ayun Seol; Hee Jin Song; Yu Jeong Roh; Tae Ryeol Kim; Eun Seo Park; Gi Ho Park; Ji Won Park; Young Suk Jung; Joon Yong Cho; Dae Youn Hwang
37562867,Immunology and microbiome: Implications for motor systems.,"Immune-inflammatory mechanisms seem to play a relevant role in neurodegenerative disorders affecting motor systems, particularly Parkinson's disease, where activity changes in inflammatory cells and evidence of neuroinflammation in experimental models and patients is available. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is also characterized by neuroinflammatory changes that involve primarily glial cells, both microglia and astrocytes, as well as systemic immune dysregulation associated with more rapid progression. Similarly, the exploration of gut dysbiosis in these two prototypical neurodegenerative motor disorders is advancing rapidly. Altered composition of gut microbial constituents and related metabolic and putative functional pathways is supporting a pathophysiological link that is currently explored in preclinical, germ-free animal models. Less compelling, but still intriguing, evidence suggests that motor neurodevelopmental disorders, e.g., Tourette syndrome, are associated with abnormal trajectories of maturation that include also immune system development. Microglia has a key role also in these disorders, and new therapeutic avenues aiming at its modulation are exciting prospects. Preclinical and clinical research on the role of gut dysbiosis in Tourette syndrome and related behavioral disorders is still in its infancy, but early findings support the rationale to delve deeper into its contribution to neural and immune maturation abnormalities in its spectrum.",Handbook of clinical neurology,2023,Yasamin Mahjoub; Davide Martino
37266763,Orally Induced High Serum Level of Trimethylamine N-oxide Worsened Glial Reaction and Neuroinflammation on MPTP-Induced Acute Parkinson's Disease Model Mice.,"Neuroinflammation mediated by brain glial cells is one of the pathological drivers of Parkinson's disease (PD). Recent studies have shown that higher circulating trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO, a gut microbiota-derived metabolite) can induce neuroinflammation and are strongly related to a variety of central nervous system diseases and adverse brain events. Herein, we explored the effect of pre-existing higher circulating TMAO on dopamine system and neuroinflammation in acute PD model mice induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydroxypyridine (MPTP). TMAO pretreatment was given by adding 3% (w/v) TMAO to drinking water of mice for 21 days to induce higher circulating TMAO status, then mice were administered with MPTP (20 mg/kg, i.p) for four times in one day to construct an acute PD model mice and treated with TMAO continuously until the end of the experiment. Results demonstrated that TMAO treatment significantly increased serum TMAO levels. Moreover, high serum TMAO significantly increased activation of microglia and astrocytes both in striatum and in substantia nigra. And strikingly, high serum TMAO significantly promoted the metabolism of striatal dopamine (DA) of PD model mice, although it had no significant effect on the number of dopaminergic neurons or the content of DA. Furthermore, immunofluorescence, ELISA, and RT-qPCR results of the hippocampus also showed that high serum TMAO significantly promoted the activation of microglia and astrocytes in the dentate gyrus, increased the levels of TNF-α and IL-1β, and upregulated gene expression of M1 microglia-related markers (including CD16, CD32, and iNOS) and A2 astrocyte-related markers (including S100a10, Ptx3, and Emp1) in mRNA levels. In summary, we found that pre-existing high serum levels of TMAO worsened the PD-related brain pathology by promoting DA metabolism, aggravating neuroinflammation and regulating glial cell polarization.",Molecular neurobiology,2023,Chen-Meng Qiao; Wei Quan; Yu Zhou; Gu-Yu Niu; Hui Hong; Jian Wu; Li-Ping Zhao; Ting Li; Chun Cui; Wei-Jiang Zhao; Yan-Qin Shen
36824263,Effects of levodopa on gut bacterial antibiotic resistance in Parkinson's disease rat.,"The second most prevalent neurodegenerative ailment, Parkinson's disease (PD), is characterized by both motor and non-motor symptoms. Levodopa is the backbone of treatment for PD at the moment. However, levodopa-induced side effects, such as dyskinesia, are commonly seen in PD patients. Recently, several antibiotics were found to present neuroprotective properties against neurodegenerative and neuro-inflammatory processes, which might be developed to effective therapies against PD. In this study, we aimed to identify if levodopa treatment could influence the gut bacterial antibiotic resistance in PD rat. Fecal samples were collected from healthy rats and 6-OHDA induced PD rats treated with different doses of levodopa, metagenomic sequencing data showed that levodopa resulted in gut bacteria composition change, the biomarkers of gut bacteria analyzed by LEfSe changed as well. More interestingly, compared with levodopa (5 mg/kg)-treated or no levodopa-treated PD rats, levodopa (10 mg/kg) caused a significant decrease in the abundance of tetW and vanTG genes in intestinal bacteria, which were related to tetracycline and vancomycin resistance, while the abundance of AAC6-lb-Suzhou gene increased apparently, which was related to aminoglycosides resistance, even though the total quantity of Antibiotic Resistance Gene (ARG) and Antibiotic Resistance Ontology (ARO) among all groups did not significantly differ. Consequently, our results imply that the combination of levodopa and antibiotics, such as tetracycline and vancomycin, in the treatment of PD may decrease the amount of corresponding antibiotic resistance genes in gut bacteria, which would give a theoretical basis for treating PD with levodopa combined with tetracycline and vancomycin in the future.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2023,Shuo Sheng; Xianwei Li; Shuo Zhao; Changqing Zheng; Feng Zhang
38075226,Unveiling the neuroprotective potential of dietary polysaccharides: a systematic review.,"Central nervous system (CNS) disorders present a growing and costly global health challenge, accounting for over 11% of the diseases burden in high-income countries. Despite current treatments, patients often experience persistent symptoms that significantly affect their quality of life. Dietary polysaccharides have garnered attention for their potential as interventions for CNS disorders due to their diverse mechanisms of action, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects. Through an analysis of research articles published between January 5, 2013 and August 30, 2023, encompassing the intervention effects of dietary polysaccharides on Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, depression, anxiety disorders, autism spectrum disorder, epilepsy, and stroke, we have conducted a comprehensive review with the aim of elucidating the role and mechanisms of dietary polysaccharides in various CNS diseases, spanning neurodegenerative, psychiatric, neurodevelopmental disorders, and neurological dysfunctions. At least four categories of mechanistic bases are included in the dietary polysaccharides' intervention against CNS disease, which involves oxidative stress reduction, neuronal production, metabolic regulation, and gut barrier integrity. Notably, the ability of dietary polysaccharides to resist oxidation and modulate gut microbiota not only helps to curb the development of these diseases at an early stage, but also holds promise for the development of novel therapeutic agents for CNS diseases. In conclusion, this comprehensive review strives to advance therapeutic strategies for CNS disorders by elucidating the potential of dietary polysaccharides and advocating interdisciplinary collaboration to propel further research in this realm.",Frontiers in nutrition,2023,Rui Guo; Jingxi Pang; Junhe Zhao; Xiao Xiao; Jing Li; Jingmeng Li; Wenxiu Wang; Shuang Zhou; Yu Zhao; Zilong Zhang; Hongwang Chen; Tian Yuan; Shan Wu; Zhigang Liu

Miq. ex Havil, on Parkinson's disease based on metagenomics and metabolomics.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is a rapidly progressing neurological disorder. Currently, Medication for PD has numerous limitations. Baichanting Compound (BCT) is a Chinese herbal prescription, a Combination of Acanthopanax senticosus (Rupr. and Maxim.) Harms, Paeonia lactiflora Pall and Uncaria rhynchophylla (Miq.) Miq. ex Havil, that was developed to treat PD and holds a national patent (ZL, 201110260536.3).To clarify the therapeutic effect of BCT on PD and explore its possible mechanism based on metabolomics and metagenomics.C57BL/6 mice were used as a control group, and α-syn transgenic C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to the PD (without treatment) or BCT (with BCT treatment) group. UPLC-MS was performed to detect dopamine levels in brain tissue, while ELISA was used to determine inflammatory factors such as IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IFN-γ and NO, and oxidative stress indicators such as malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase enzyme activity. Fecal metabolomics was used to detect fecal metabolic profiles, screen differential metabolic markers, and predict metabolic pathways by KEGG enrichment analysis. Metagenomics was used to determine the intestinal microbial composition, and KO enrichment analysis was performed to predict the potential function of different gut microbiota. Finally, Spearman correlation analysis was used to find the possible relationships among intestinal flora, metabolic markers, inflammatory factors, oxidative stress and dopamine levels.BCT increased the superoxide dismutase activity of α-Syn transgenic C57BL/6 mice (P < 0.01), decreased the levels of TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, NO and malondialdehyde (P < 0.01, 0.05), and increased the release of dopamine (P < 0.01). Metabolomics results show that BCT could regulate Acetatifactor, Marvinbryantia, Faecalitalea, Anaeromassilibacillus, Anaerobium, Pseudobutyrivibrio and Lachnotalea and Acetatifactor_muris, Marvinbryantia_formatexigens, Lachnotalea_sp_AF33_28, Faecalitalea_sp_Marseille_P3755 and Anaerobium_acetethylicum, Gemmiger_sp_An120 abundance to restore intestinal flora function, and reverse fecal metabolism trend, restoring the content of α-D-glucose, cytidine, L-glutamate, L-glutamine, N-acetyl-L-glutamate, raffinose and uracil. In addition, it regulates arginine biosynthesis, D-glutamine and D-glutamate, pyrimidine, galactose and alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolic pathways.BCT may regulate the composition of the gut microbiota to reverse fecal metabolism in PD mice to protect the substantia nigra and striatum from oxidative stress and inflammatory factors and ultimately play an anti-PD role.",Journal of ethnopharmacology,2024,Yi Lu; Xin Gao; Shadi A D Mohammed; Tianyu Wang; Jiaqi Fu; Yu Wang; Yang Nan; Fang Lu; Shumin Liu

37436588,The critical role of gut-brain axis microbiome in mental disorders.,"The Gut-brain axis is a bidirectional neural and humoral signaling that plays an important role in mental disorders and intestinal health and connects them as well. Over the past decades, the gut microbiota has been explored as an important part of the gastrointestinal tract that plays a crucial role in the regulation of most functions of various human organs. The evidence shows several mediators such as short-chain fatty acids, peptides, and neurotransmitters that are produced by the gut may affect the brain's function directly or indirectly. Thus, dysregulation in this microbiome community can give rise to several diseases such as Parkinson's disease, depression, irritable bowel syndrome, and Alzheimer's disease. So, the interactions between the gut and the brain are significantly considered, and also it provides a prominent subject to investigate the causes of some diseases.

37750713,Oh my gut! Is the microbial origin of neurodegenerative diseases real?,"There is no cure or effective treatment for neurodegenerative protein conformational diseases (PCDs), such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's diseases, mainly because the etiology of these diseases remains elusive. Recent data suggest that unique changes in the gut microbial composition are associated with these ailments; however, our current understanding of the bacterial role in the pathogenesis of PCDs is hindered by the complexity of the microbial communities associated with specific microbiomes, such as the gut, oral, or vaginal microbiota. The composition of these specific microbiomes is regarded as a unique fingerprint affected by factors such as infections, diet, lifestyle, and antibiotics. All of these factors also affect the severity of neurodegenerative diseases. The majority of studies that reveal microbial contribution are correlational, and various models, including worm, fly, and mouse, are being utilized to decipher the role of individual microbes that may affect disease onset and progression. Recent evidence from across model organisms and humans shows a positive correlation between the presence of gram-negative enteropathogenic bacteria and the pathogenesis of PCDs. While these correlational studies do not provide a mechanistic explanation, they do reveal contributing bacterial species and provide an important basis for further investigation. One of the lurking concerns related to the microbial contribution to PCDs is the increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance and poor antibiotic stewardship, which ultimately select for proteotoxic bacteria, especially the gram-negative species that are known for intrinsic resistance. In this review, we summarize what is known about individual microbial contribution to PCDs and the potential impact of increasing antimicrobial resistance.",Infection and immunity,2023,Alyssa Walker; Daniel M Czyz
37579888,N-acetyl-L-leucine protects MPTP-treated Parkinson's disease mouse models by suppressing Desulfobacterota via the gut-brain axis.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, and communication between the gut and brain (the gut-brain axis) has been found to be essential in behavior and cognitive function. However, the exact mechanisms underlying microbiota dysbiosis in PD progression have not yet been elucidated. Our study aimed to investigate the correlation between gut microbiota disturbances and feces metabolic disorders in PD. We used 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to induce PD models and observed mice's motor symptoms, dopaminergic (DA) neuron death, and gastrointestinal dysfunction. To identify alterations in microbiota and metabolome, feces were collected from mice and analyzed using 16 S ribosomal RNA sequencing feces metabolomics. Pearson analysis was utilized to investigate correlations between the abundances of gut microbiota components and the levels of gut microbiota metabolites, displaying their interaction networks. Our findings revealed a significant increase in Desulfobacterota in the PD mouse model and 151 differentially expressed fecal metabolites between PD and vehicle mice. Moreover, Pearson correlation analysis suggested that the protective factor N-acetyl-L-leucine (NALL) may be associated with neuroinflammation in the striatum and substantia nigra, which also had a negative relationship with the concentration of Desulfobacterota. Additionally, we found that oral administration of NALL alleviated MPTP-induced Motor Impairments and DA neuronal deﬁcits. All in all, we concluded that the decrease of NALL might lead to a significant increase of Desulfobacterota in the MPTP model mouse and subsequently result in the damage of DA neurons via the gut-brain aix pathway.",Brain research bulletin,2023,Zhifeng Xu; Changlin Lian; Lixin Pan; Wenjie Lai; Fen Zhang; Lingmei Peng; Sijie Zhou; Guanghua Zhao; Xuezhu Yang; Guohua Zhang; Zefeng Tan; Yukai Wang
36983960,Infectious Microorganisms Seen as Etiologic Agents in Parkinson's Disease.,"Infections represent a possible risk factor for parkinsonism and Parkinson's disease (PD) based on information from epidemiology and fundamental science. The risk is unclear for the majority of agents. Moreover, the latency between infection and PD seems to be very varied and often lengthy. In this review, the evidence supporting the potential involvement of infectious microorganisms in the development of Parkinson's disease is examined. Consequently, it is crucial to determine the cause and give additional treatment accordingly. Infection is an intriguing suggestion regarding the cause of Parkinson's disease. These findings demonstrate that persistent infection with viral and bacterial microorganisms might be a cause of Parkinson's disease. As an initiating factor, infection may generate a spectrum of gut microbiota dysbiosis, engagement of glial tissues, neuroinflammation, and alpha-synuclein accumulation, all of which may trigger and worsen the onset in Parkinson's disease also contribute to its progression. Still uncertain is the primary etiology of PD with infection. The possible pathophysiology of PD infection remains a matter of debate. Furthermore, additional study is required to determine if PD patients develop the disease due to infectious microorganisms or solely since they are more sensitive to infectious causes.","Life (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,Stuparu Alina Zorina; Sanda Jurja; Mihaela Mehedinti; Ana-Maria Stoica; Dana Simona Chita; Stuparu Alexandru Floris; Any Axelerad
37321369,Casein Reactivates Dopaminergic Nerve Injury and Intestinal Inflammation with Disturbing Intestinal Microflora and Fecal Metabolites in a Convalescent Parkinson's Disease Mouse Model.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the fastest-growing neurodegenerative disease, with pathogenic causes elusive and short of effective treatment options. Investigations have found that dairy products positively correlate with the onset of PD, but the mechanisms remain unexplored. As casein is an antigenic component in dairy products, this study assessed if casein could exacerbate PD-related symptoms by stimulating intestinal inflammation and unbalanced intestinal flora and be a risk factor for PD. Using a convalescent PD mouse model induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), the results showed casein reduced motor coordination, caused gastrointestinal dysfunction, reduced dopamine content, and induced intestinal inflammation. Meanwhile, casein disturbed gut microbiota homeostasis by increasing the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, decreasing α-diversity, and caused abnormal alterations in fecal metabolites. However, these adverse effects of casein attenuated much when it had hydrolyzed by acid or when antibiotics inhibited the intestinal microbiota of the mice. Therefore, our results suggested that casein could reactivate dopaminergic nerve injury and intestinal inflammation and exacerbate intestinal flora disorder and its metabolites in convalescent PD mice. These damaging effects might be related to disordered protein digestion and gut microbiota in these mice. These findings will provide new insights into the impact of milk/dairy products on PD progression and supply information on dietary options for PD patients.",Neuroscience,2023,Zhengjia Pu; Shuya Liu; Zeming Guo; Xuemei Zhang; Jie Yan; Yong Tang; Hong Xiao; Jieying Gao; Yingli Li; Qunhua Bai
37932328,A novel pathway of levodopa metabolism by commensal Bifidobacteria.,"The gold-standard treatment for Parkinson's disease is levodopa (L-DOPA), which is taken orally and absorbed intestinally. L-DOPA must reach the brain intact to exert its clinical effect; peripheral metabolism by host and microbial enzymes is a clinical management issue. The gut microbiota is altered in PD, with one consistent and unexplained observation being an increase in Bifidobacterium abundance among patients. Recently, certain Bifidobacterium species were shown to have the ability to metabolize L-tyrosine, an L-DOPA structural analog. Using both clinical cohort data and in vitro experimentation, we investigated the potential for commensal Bifidobacteria to metabolize this drug. In PD patients, Bifidobacterium abundance was positively correlated with L-DOPA dose and negatively with serum tyrosine concentration. In vitro experiments revealed that certain species, including B. bifidum, B. breve, and B. longum, were able to metabolize this drug via deamination followed by reduction to the compound 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl lactic acid (DHPLA) using existing tyrosine-metabolising genes. DHPLA appears to be a waste product generated during regeneration of NAD +. This metabolism occurs at low levels in rich medium, but is significantly upregulated in nutrient-limited minimal medium. Discovery of this novel metabolism of L-DOPA to DHPLA by a common commensal may help inform medication management in PD.",Scientific reports,2023,M S Cirstea; A Creus-Cuadros; C Lo; A C Yu; A Serapio-Palacios; S Neilson; S Appel-Cresswell; B B Finlay
37537902,Neurodevelopmental toxicity induced by PM2.5 Exposure and its possible role in Neurodegenerative and mental disorders.,"Recent extensive evidence suggests that ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5, with an aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 μm) may be neurotoxic to the brain and cause central nervous system damage, contributing to neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, and mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder. PM2.5 can enter the brain via various pathways, including the blood-brain barrier, olfactory system, and gut-brain axis, leading to adverse effects on the CNS. Studies in humans and animals have revealed that PM2.5-mediated mechanisms, including neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, and gut flora dysbiosis, play a crucial role in CNS damage. Additionally, PM2.5 exposure can induce epigenetic alterations, such as hypomethylation of DNA, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of some CNS damage. Through literature analysis, we suggest that promising therapeutic targets for alleviating PM2.5-induced neurological damage include inhibiting microglia overactivation, regulating gut microbiota with antibiotics, and targeting signaling pathways, such as PKA/CREB/BDNF and WNT/β-catenin. Additionally, several studies have observed an association between PM2.5 exposure and epigenetic changes in neuropsychiatric disorders.

36662412,Neuroprotective and Immunomodulatory Effects of Probiotics in a Rat Model of Parkinson's Disease.,"It is now well recognized that a bidirectional relationship between gut microbiota and the brain, referred to as the gut-brain axis, plays a prominent role in maintaining homeostasis and that a disruption in this axis can result in neuroinflammatory response and neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). The protective action of probiotics such as Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis Bb12 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG in various animal models of PD has been reported. Therefore, in this study, we used an inflammatory model of PD to assess the effects of a combination of these two probiotics (Microbiot<sup>®</sup>) on motor behavior as well as on the response of microglia, including microglia morphology, to gain a better understanding of their mechanism of action. Microbiot<sup>®</sup> (300 µL) was administered orally once daily for 15 days in a lipopolysaccharide-induced PD model using male Wistar rats. Although LPS-induced motor asymmetry in cylinder test was not affected by Microbiot<sup>®</sup>, impairment of motor coordination in the narrow-beam test was significantly reduced by this probiotic. Moreover, Microbiot<sup>®</sup> treatment reduced microglial activation suggesting an anti-inflammatory effect.

Preclinical and clinical reports showed that gut dysbiosis might play a major regulatory role in neurological diseases such as epilepsy, Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease. Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disease that causes recurrent and unprovoked seizures, and numerous risk factors are implicated in developing epilepsy. Advanced consideration of the gut-microbiota-brain axis can reduce ambiguity about epilepsy pathology, antiepileptic drugs, and effective therapeutic targets. Gut microbiota sequencing analysis reported that the level of Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Fusobacteria, and Firmicutes was increased and the level of Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes was decreased in epilepsy patients. Clinical and preclinical studies also indicated that probiotics, ketogenic diet, faecal microbiota transplantation, and antibiotics can improve gut dysbiosis and alleviate seizure by enhancing the abundance of healthy biota.

Therefore, understanding the changes in different segments of the GI tract and how they relate to altered responses to PD treatment can guide both diagnostic and pharmacological interventions. Gut microbiota plays a critical role in immune activity and modulation of the enteric and central nervous systems.

38008403,Calprotectin in Parkinsonian disease: Anticipation and dedication.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease due to degeneration of dopaminergic neurons (DNs) in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). PD is characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms. Non-motor symptoms such as constipation and dysfunction of gastrointestinal tract (GIT) motility together with medications used in the management of PD affect gut microbiota. Alterations of gut microbiota with development of gut dyspiosis can induce momentous changes in gut barrier with subsequent systemic inflammation and induction of neuroinflammation. It has been shown that calprotectin which reflect intestinal inflammation and gut barrier injury are augmented in PD. Therefore, this review aims to elucidate the possible role of gut barrier injury and associated dysbiois in PD neuropathology, and how calprotectin reflects gut barrier injury in PD. Benefit of this review was to elucidate that high fecal calprotectin level in PD patients indicated gut dysbiosis and intestinal inflammation. Early increment of fecal calprotectin indicates the development of gut dysbiosis and/or gut-barrier injury which may precede motor symptoms by decades. Thus, fecal calprotectin could be a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in PD. preclinical and clinical studies are warranted in this regard to emphasize the potential role of fecal calprotectin in PD neuropathology.",Ageing research reviews,2024,Hayder M Al-Kuraishy; Ali I Al-Gareeb; Ayah Talal Zaidalkiani; Athanasios Alexiou; Marios Papadakis; Mostafa M Bahaa; Ammar Al-Faraga; Gaber El-Saber Batiha

At present, engineered microorganisms are attracting increasing attention. In this study, we constructed an engineered strain of <i>Clostridium butyricum</i>-GLP-1, a <i>C. butyricum</i> (a probiotic) that consistently expresses glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1, a peptide-based hormone with neurological advantage) in anticipation of its use in PD treatment. We further investigated the neuroprotective mechanism of <i>C. butyricum</i>-GLP-1 on PD mice models induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. The results indicated that <i>C. butyricum</i>-GLP-1 could improve motor dysfunction and ameliorate neuropathological changes by increasing TH expression and reducing the expression of α-syn. Moreover, we confirmed that <i>C. butyricum</i>-GLP-1 improved microbiome imbalance of PD mice by decreasing the relative abundance of <i>Bifidobacterium</i> at the genus level, improved gut integrity, and upregulated the levels of GPR41/43. Surprisingly, we found it could exert its neuroprotective effects via promoting PINK1/Parkin mediated mitophagy and attenuating oxidative stress. Together, our work showed that <i>C. butyricum</i>-GLP-1 improves PD by promoting mitophagy, which provides an alternative therapeutic modality for PD.",Bioengineering & translational medicine,2023,Yun Wang; Wen-Jie Chen; Yi-Yang Han; Xuan Xu; Ai-Xia Yang; Jing Wei; Dao-Jun Hong; Xin Fang; Ting-Tao Chen

Purified proteins were given to mice intraperitoneally (20 μg/animal/day) for one week. Behavioral tests were conducted, and brain homogenates of the treated animals were subjected to immunoassays. After treatment with PMU, the levels of TNF-α and IL-1β were measured in Caco2 cells and cellular permeability was assayed in Hek 293. The proteins were incubated in vitro with α-synuclein and examined via transmission electron microscopy. Our results showed that PMU treatment induced depressive-like behavior in mice. No motor deficits were observed. The brain homogenates had an increased content of caspase-9, while the levels of α-synuclein and tyrosine hydroxylase decreased. PMU increased the pro-inflammatory cytokines and altered the cellular permeability in cultured cells. The urease, but not the PmUreβ, altered the morphology of α-synuclein aggregates in vitro, forming fragmented aggregates. We concluded that PMU promotes pro-inflammatory effects in cultured cells. In vivo, PMU induces neuroinflammation and a depressive-like phenotype compatible with the first stages of PD development.",Microorganisms,2023,Matheus V C Grahl; Brenda da Silva Andrade; Ana Paula A Perin; Gilda A Neves; Laura de Souza Duarte; Augusto Frantz Uberti; Kelvin Siqueira Hohl; Cristian Follmer; Celia Regina Carlini
37374030,A Critical Perspective on the Supplementation of <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i>: Benefits and Harms.,"<i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> is a mucin-degrading bacterium of the intestinal niche, exerting beneficial effects on the host metabolic profile. Accumulating evidence indicated <i>Akkermansia</i> as a promising therapeutic probiotic against metabolic disorders such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. However, in specific intestinal microenvironments, its excessive enrichment may be not beneficial. Conditions like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i> infection or post-antibiotic reconstitution may not benefit from <i>Akkermansia</i> supplementation. Furthermore, using <i>Akkermansia</i> in patients with endocrine and gynecological disorders-such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or endometriosis-that have a higher risk of developing IBD, should be critically evaluated. In addition, a cautionary note comes from the neurological field, as the gut microbiota of patients suffering from Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis exhibits a characteristic signature of <i>Akkermansia municiphila</i> abundance. Overall, considering these controversial points, the use of <i>Akkermansia</i> should be evaluated on an individual basis, avoiding risking unexpected effects.","Life (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,Vito Chiantera; Antonio Simone Laganà; Sabrina Basciani; Maurizio Nordio; Mariano Bizzarri
37827233,TLR2 deficiency is beneficial at the late phase in MPTP-induced Parkinson' disease mice.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. The etiology of PD is still elusive but neuroinflammation is proved to be an important contributor. Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) involves in the release of several inflammatory cytokines. Whether TLR2 serves as a mediator contributing to the damage of DA system in PD remain unclear.Tlr2 knockout (Tlr2<sup>-/-</sup>) and wild-type (WT) mice were treated with a subacute regimen of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). At 3, 7 and 14 days after MPTP injection, the behavioral performance, including the Pole test, the Rotarod test, the Rearing test and the Wire hang test was evaluated. Moreover, the PD-like phenotypes, including dopaminergic degeneration, the activation of glial cells and the α-Syn expression were systematically analyzed in the nigrostriatal pathway. Finally, the composition of gut microbiota in the MPTP-treated groups were assessed.TLR2 deficiency had no obvious impact on the dopaminergic injury at 3 and 7 days following MPTP administration. On the contrary, at 14 days post injection, TLR2 deficiency not only significantly attenuated motor deficits in the Pole test and the Rotarod test, and the nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration, but also mitigated α-Syn abnormality, astrocyte activation and neuroinflammation through the suppressed TLR2/MyD88/TRAF6/NF-κB signaling pathways. Additionally, the alteration of gut microbiota was also detected in the mutant mice.These findings highlight the neuroprotective effect of TLR2-pathways at the late phase in the MPTP-induced PD mouse model.",Life sciences,2023,Yongtao He; Jiayin Zhao; Hongtian Dong; Xiaoshuang Zhang; Yufei Duan; Yuanyuan Ma; Mei Yu; Jian Fei; Fang Huang
36694359,Elevated serum anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody accompanied by gut mycobiota dysbiosis as a biomarker of diagnosis in patients with de novo Parkinson disease.,"Intestinal inflammation and gut microbiota dysbiosis contribute to Parkinson disease (PD) pathogenesis, and growing evidence suggests associations between inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and PD. Considered as markers of chronic gastrointestinal inflammation, elevated serum anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody (ASCA) levels, against certain gut fungal components, are related to IBD, but their effect on PD is yet to be investigated.Serum ASCA IgG and IgA levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the gut mycobiota communities were investigated using ITS2 sequencing and analyzed using the Qiime pipeline.The study included 393 subjects (148 healthy controls [HCs], 140 with PD, and 105 with essential tremor [ET]). Both serum ASCA IgG and IgA levels were significantly higher in the PD group than in the ET and HC groups. Combining serum ASCA levels and the occurrence of constipation could discriminate patients with PD from controls (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.76-0.86) and from patients with ET (AUC = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.79-0.89). Furthermore, the composition of the gut fungal community differed between the PD and HC groups. The relative abundances of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Aspergillus, Candida solani, Aspergillus flavus, ASV601_Fungi, ASV866_Fungi, and ASV755_Fungi were significantly higher in the PD group, and enriched Malassezia restricta was found in the HC group.Our study identified elevated serum ASCA levels and enriched gut Saccharomyces cerevisiae in de novo PD.",European journal of neurology,2023,Ying Chen; Li-Ying Zhang; Yi Fang; Chuan Li; Dan-Dan Xia; Gong Zhang; Yi Wen; Song-Zhao Zhang; Liu Hu; Lu-Yan Gu; Yi Liu; Jun Tian; Ya-Ping Yan; Xin-Zhen Yin; Zhi-Hua Tao; Bao-Rong Zhang; Jia-Li Pu
37239262,Trimethylamine N-Oxide Exacerbates Neuroinflammation and Motor Dysfunction in an Acute MPTP Mice Model of Parkinson's Disease.,"Observational studies have shown abnormal changes in trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) levels in the peripheral circulatory system of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. TMAO is a gut microbiota metabolite that can cross the blood-brain barrier and is strongly related to neuroinflammation. Neuroinflammation is one of the pathological drivers of PD. Herein, we investigated the effect of TMAO on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD model mice. TMAO pretreatment was given by adding 1.5% (<i>w</i>/<i>v</i>) TMAO to the drinking water of the mice for 21 days; then, the mice were administered MPTP (20 mg/kg, i.p.) four times a day to construct an acute PD model. Their serum TMAO concentrations, motor function, dopaminergic network integrity, and neuroinflammation were then assayed. The results showed that TMAO partly aggravated the motor dysfunction of the PD mice. Although TMAO had no effect on the dopaminergic neurons, TH protein content, and striatal DA level in the PD mice, it significantly reduced the striatal 5-HT levels and aggravated the metabolism of DA and 5-HT. Meanwhile, TMAO significantly activated glial cells in the striatum and the hippocampi of the PD mice and promoted the release of inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus. In summary, higher-circulating TMAO had adverse effects on the motor capacity, striatum neurotransmitters, and striatal and hippocampal neuroinflammation in PD mice.",Brain sciences,2023,Wei Quan; Chen-Meng Qiao; Gu-Yu Niu; Jian Wu; Li-Ping Zhao; Chun Cui; Wei-Jiang Zhao; Yan-Qin Shen

To improve our understanding of this tripartite interplay, we investigated community and functional dynamics between the murine protist <i>Tritrichomonas musculus</i> ( <i>T. mu</i> ) and intestinal bacteria in healthy and B cell-deficient mice. We identified dramatic, protist-driven remodeling of resident microbiome growth and activities, in parallel with <i>T. mu</i> functional changes, accelerated in the absence of B cells. Metatranscriptomic data revealed nutrient-based competition between bacteria and the protist. Single cell transcriptomics identified distinct <i>T. mu</i> life stages, providing new evidence for trichomonad sexual replication and the formation of pseudocysts.

37224894,Antiparkinsonian effects of polyphenols: A narrative review with a focus on the modulation of the gut-brain axis.,"Polyphenols, which are naturally occurring bioactive compounds in fruits and vegetables, are emerging as potential therapeutics for neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Polyphenols have diverse biological activities, such as anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and α-synuclein aggregation inhibitory effects, which could ameliorate PD pathogenesis. Studies have shown that polyphenols are capable of regulating the gut microbiota (GM) and its metabolites; in turn, polyphenols are extensively metabolized by the GM, resulting in the generation of bioactive secondary metabolites. These metabolites may regulate various physiological processes, including inflammatory responses, energy metabolism, intercellular communication, and host immunity. With increasing recognition of the importance of the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) in PD etiology, polyphenols have attracted growing attention as MGBA regulators. In order to address the potential therapeutic role of polyphenolic compounds in PD, we focused on MGBA.",Pharmacological research,2023,Wei Zhang; Xiaoyu Dong; Rui Huang
37158925,"The PROB-PD trial: a pilot, randomised, placebo-controlled study protocol to evaluate the feasibility and potential efficacy of probiotics in modulating peripheral immunity in subjects with Parkinson's disease.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease. No disease-modifying treatment is available, and therapy is symptomatic. The histopathologic hallmark is the loss of dopaminergic neurons and accumulation of α-synuclein (α-syn) in surviving neurons, but the underlying pathophysiology is unclear. Inflammatory mechanisms seem to play a prominent role, with an imbalance of immune functions and neurotoxicity caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Involvement of peripheral adaptive immunity, with an imbalance in T cell subpopulations and in the expression of transcriptional factors in CD4+ T cells, has also been reported. Although clinical presentation is defined by motor symptoms, patients also report non-motor symptoms, often before the onset of a clinically established disease. Etiopathogenesis of PD is unknown, but an initial aggregation of α-syn in the gut, with subsequent propagation along the vagus nerve to the brain has been hypothesised. Interestingly, in an α-syn overexpressing murine model, the absence of gut microbiota prevented both microglia activation and motor impairment, thus pointing to a fundamental role of microbiota in the development of PD. Magistrelli et al. showed that in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of PD patients, probiotics modulate the in vitro production of cytokines toward an anti-inflammatory profile and reduce the production of ROS.This is a pilot randomised placebo-controlled clinical trial protocol for a 12-week treatment with probiotics. At least 80 patients affected by PD will be recruited and randomly allocated to either the treatment or placebo group in a 1:1 ratio. General inclusion criteria will be the onset of PD 2 to 5 years before the trial and absence of autoimmune comorbidities or immunomodulating therapy. Our primary endpoint is the assessment of changes in extracellular cytokine levels (Interferon (IFN)-γ, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-4, and IL-10) and ROS production. Secondary outcomes include changes in lymphocyte subpopulations and transcriptional factors mRNA levels.This study is designed to highlight the potential beneficial role of probiotics administration on peripheral immunity through the modulation of gut microbiota. Explorative outcomes will be evaluated to assess variations in motor and non-motor symptoms and the possible correlation with probiotics administration.ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT05173701.

38045857,Metabolomic analysis of serum short-chain fatty acid concentrations in a mouse of MPTP-induced Parkinson's disease after dietary supplementation with branched-chain amino acids.,"The gut microbiota and microbial metabolites influence the enteric nervous system and the central nervous system via the microbial-gut-brain axis. Increasing body of evidence suggests that disturbances in the metabolism of peripheral branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) can contribute to the development of neurodegenerative diseases through neuroinflammatory signaling. Preliminary research has shown that longitudinal changes in serum amino acid levels in mouse models of Parkinson's disease (PD) are negatively correlated with disease progression. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine the changes in serum levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in a mouse model of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD after dietary BCAA supplementation. In our research, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to detect serum SCFA concentrations. The data were then analyzed with principal component analysis and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis. Finally, the correlations of serum SCFA levels with gut and motor function in MPTP-induced PD mice were explored. Propionic acid, acetic acid, butyric acid, and isobutyric acid concentrations were elevated in MPTP + H-BCAA mice compared with MPTP mice. Propionic acid concentration was increased the most, while the isovaleric acid concentration was decreased. Propionic acid concentration was positively correlated with fecal weight and water content and negatively correlated with the pole-climbing duration. In conclusion, these results not only suggest that propionic acid may be a potential biomarker for PD, but also indicate the possibility that PD may be treated by altering circulating levels of SCFA.","Open medicine (Warsaw, Poland)",2023,Na Mi; Lili Ma; Xueying Li; Jia Fu; Xinxin Bu; Fei Liu; Fan Yang; Yali Zhang; Lifen Yao
36776226,"A review article on neuroprotective, immunomodulatory, and anti-inflammatory role of vitamin-D3 in elderly COVID-19 patients.","Vitamin D3 is a secosteroid, broad-spectrum immunomodulatory, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory hormone produced either by the internal subcutaneous pathway in the presence of ultraviolet B (UVB) rays or by the external pathway in the form of supplements. Vitamin D3 deficiency is a common and reversible contributor to mortality and morbidity among critically ill patients, including Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and other viral infections. The major functions of vitamin D3 are inhibiting the proinflammatory pathways, including nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB), inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (ILs-6), interleukin-18 (ILs-18), and tumour necrosis factor (TNF), preventing the loss of neural sensation in COVID-19, maintaining respiratory homeostasis, and acting as an antiviral, antimalarial, and antihypertensive agent. Vitamin D3 has an important role in reversing the COVID-19 infection in patients who have previously suffered from a neurological disease, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson disease, motor neuron disease, multiple sclerosis, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, stroke, cardiovascular problems, headache, sleep-associated disorder, and others. Moreover, vitamin D3 plays a key role in regulating the gene expression of different pro-inflammatory cytokines. In addition to the information provided above, the current review article provides the most recent information on Vitamin D against COVID-19 with comorbid neurological disorders. Furthermore, we present the most recent advancement and molecular mechanism of action of vitamin D3. Diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and neurological disorders are comorbid conditions, and vitamin D3 is a critical regulator of COVID-19 infection during these conditions. In the midst of the COVID-19 epidemic, factors such as sex, latitudes, nutrition, demography, pollution, and gut microbiota warrants for additional research on vitamin D supplements.","The Egyptian journal of neurology, psychiatry and neurosurgery",2023,Amit Kumar Tripathi; Sunil Kumar Mishra
37596429,Fecal Microbiota Transplantation from Aged Mice Render Recipient Mice Resistant to MPTP-Induced Nigrostriatal Degeneration Via a Neurogenesis-Dependent but Inflammation-Independent Manner.,"Accumulating data support a crucial role of gut microbiota in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, gut microbiota vary with age and, thus, will affect PD in an age-dependent, but unknown manner. We examined the effects of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) pretreatment, using fecal microbiota from young (7 weeks) or aged mice (23 months), on MPTP-induced PD model. Motor function, pathological changes, striatal neurotransmitters, neuroinflammation, gut inflammation and gut permeability were examined. Gut microbiota composition and metabolites, namely short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), were analyzed. Neurogenesis was also evaluated by measuring the number of doublecortin-positive (DCX<sup>+</sup>) neurons and Ki67-positive (Ki67<sup>+</sup>) cells in the hippocampus. Expression of Cd133 mRNA, a cellular stemness marker, in the hippocampus was also examined. Mice who received FMT from young mice showed MPTP-induced motor dysfunction, and reduction of striatal dopamine (DA), dopaminergic neurons and striatal tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) levels. Interestingly and unexpectedly, mice that received FMT from aged mice showed recovery of motor function and rescue of dopaminergic neurons and striatal 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), as well as decreased DA metabolism after MPTP challenge. Further, they showed improved metabolic profiling and a decreased amount of fecal SCFAs. High-throughput sequencing revealed that FMT remarkably reshaped the gut microbiota of recipient mice. For instance, levels of genus Akkermansia and Candidatus Saccharimonas were elevated in fecal samples of recipient mice receiving aged microbiota (AM + MPTP mice) than YM + MPTP mice. Intriguingly, both young microbiota and aged microbiota had no effect on neuroinflammation, gut inflammation or gut permeability. Notably, AM + MPTP mice showed a marked increase in DCX<sup>+</sup> neurons, as well as Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells and Cd133 expression in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) compared to YM + MPTP mice. These results suggest that FMT from aged mice augments neurogenesis, improves motor function and restores dopaminergic neurons and neurotransmitters in PD model mice, possibly through increasing neurogenesis.",Neurotherapeutics : the journal of the American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics,2023,Chen-Meng Qiao; Yu Zhou; Wei Quan; Xiao-Yu Ma; Li-Ping Zhao; Yun Shi; Hui Hong; Jian Wu; Gu-Yu Niu; Yu-Nuo Chen; Shan Zhu; Chun Cui; Wei-Jiang Zhao; Yan-Qin Shen
37961318,Identification of proteotoxic and proteoprotective bacteria that non-specifically affect proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases.,"Neurodegenerative protein conformational diseases (PCDs), such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's, are a leading cause of death and disability worldwide and have no known cures or effective treatments. Emerging evidence suggests a role for the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative PCDs; however, the influence of specific bacteria on the culprit proteins associated with each of these diseases remains elusive, primarily due to the complexity of the microbiota. In the present study, we employed a single-strain screening approach to identify human bacterial isolates that enhance or suppress the aggregation of culprit proteins and the associated toxicity in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> expressing Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>, α-synuclein, and polyglutamine tracts. Here, we reveal the first comprehensive analysis of the human microbiome for its effect on proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Our results suggest that bacteria affect the aggregation of metastable proteins by modulating host proteostasis rather than selectively targeting specific disease-associated proteins.

37895965,Profiling Analysis of Tryptophan Metabolites in the Urine of Patients with Parkinson's Disease Using LC-MS/MS.,"Although Parkinson's disease (PD) is a representative neurodegenerative disorder and shows characteristic motor impediments, the pathophysiological mechanisms and treatment targets for PD have not yet been clearly identified. Since several tryptophan metabolites produced by gut microbiota could pass the blood-brain barrier and, furthermore, might influence the central nervous system, tryptophan metabolites within the indole, kynurenine, and serotonin metabolic pathways might be the most potent targets for PD development. Furthermore, most metabolites are circulated via the blood, play roles in and/or are metabolized via the host organs, and finally are excreted into the urine. Therefore, profiling the overall tryptophan metabolic pathways in urine samples of patients with PD is important to understanding the pathological mechanisms, finding biomarkers, and discovering therapeutic targets for PD. However, the development of profiling analysis based on tryptophan metabolism pathways in human urine samples is still challenging due to the wide physiological ranges, the varied signal response, and the structural diversity of tryptophan metabolites in complicated urine matrices. In this study, an LC-MS/MS method was developed to profile 21 tryptophan metabolites within the indole, kynurenine, and serotonin metabolic pathways in human urine samples using ion-pairing chromatography and multiple reaction monitoring determination. The developed method was successfully applied to urine samples of PD patients (<i>n</i> = 41) and controls (<i>n</i> = 20). Further, we investigated aberrant metabolites to find biomarkers for PD development and therapeutic targets based on the quantitative results. Unfortunately, most tryptophan metabolites in the urine samples did not present significant differences between control and PD patients, except for indole-3-acetic acid. Nonetheless, indole-3-acetic acid was reported for the first time for its aberrant urinary levels in PD patients and tentatively selected as a potential biomarker for PD. This study provides accurate quantitative results for 21 tryptophan metabolites in biological samples and will be helpful in revealing the pathological mechanisms of PD development, discovering biomarkers for PD, and further providing therapeutic targets for various PD symptoms. In the near future, to further investigate the relationship between gut microbial metabolites and PD, we will employ studies on microbial metabolites using plasma and stool samples from control and PD patients.","Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,So Hyeon Chung; Dallah Yoo; Tae-Beom Ahn; Wonwoong Lee; Jongki Hong
37196855,Kanamycin treatment in the pre-symptomatic stage of a Drosophila PD model prevents the onset of non-motor alterations.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor alterations, which is preceded by a prodromal stage where non-motor symptoms are observed. Over recent years, it has become evident that this disorder involves other organs that communicate with the brain like the gut. Importantly, the microbial community that lives in the gut plays a key role in this communication, the so-called microbiota-gut-brain axis. Alterations in this axis have been associated to several disorders including PD. Here we proposed that the gut microbiota is different in the presymptomatic stage of a Drosophila model for PD, the Pink1<sup>B9</sup> mutant fly, as compared to that observed in control animals. Our results show this is the case: there is basal dysbiosis in mutant animals evidenced by substantial difference in the composition of midgut microbiota in 8-9 days old Pink1<sup>B9</sup> mutant flies as compared with control animals. Further, we fed young adult control and mutant flies kanamycin and analyzed motor and non-motor behavioral parameters in these animals. Data show that kanamycin treatment induces the recovery of some of the non-motor parameters altered in the pre-motor stage of the PD fly model, while there is no substantial change in locomotor parameters recorded at this stage. On the other hand, our results show that feeding young animals the antibiotic, results in a long-lasting improvement of locomotion in control flies. Our data support that manipulations of gut microbiota in young animals could have beneficial effects on PD progression and age-dependent motor impairments.

38106542,Sex Differences in the Allele Distribution of <i>PGLYRP2</i> Variant rs892145 in Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex multifactorial disease, involving genetic susceptibility, environmental risk factors, and gene-environmental interactions. The microbiota-gut-brain axis is hypothesized to play a role in the pathophysiology of PD, and peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGLYRPs), which modulate the gut microbiota, are, therefore, relevant candidate genes for PD.Using quantitative real-time PCR, we genotyped three <i>PGLYRP</i> variants (rs892145, rs959117, and rs10888557) and performed an association analysis in 508 PD patients and 585 control individuals. We further conducted a meta-analysis of rs892145 and analyzed <i>PGLYRP2</i> gene expression in lymphocytes from patients with PD and controls.Although initial analysis of the three variants rs892145, rs959117, and rs10888557 and a meta-analysis of rs892145 did not reveal any association between the selected variants and PD, we found an interaction between sex and genotype for rs892145, with a marked difference in the allele distribution of rs892145 between male and female patients. As compared to controls, the T allele was less common in female patients (odds ratio = 0.76, <i>P</i> = 0.04) and more common in male patients (odds ratio = 1.29, <i>P</i> = 0.04). No difference was found in <i>PGLYRP2</i> gene expression between PD patients and controls (<i>P</i> = 0.38), nor between sexes (<i>P</i> = 0.07). <i>Discussion</i>. Overall, this genetic screening in Swedish PD patients does not support previous results demonstrating associations of <i>PGLYRP</i> variants with the risk of PD. Meta-analysis of rs892145 revealed pronounced heterogeneity between previously published studies which is likely to have influenced the results. Taken together, the genetic and gene expression analyses suggest a possible link between genetic variants in <i>PGLYRP2</i> and sex differences in PD.

36918961,NEMoE: a nutrition aware regularized mixture of experts model to identify heterogeneous diet-microbiome-host health interactions.,"Unrevealing the interplay between diet, the microbiome, and the health state could enable the design of personalized intervention strategies and improve the health and well-being of individuals. A common approach to this is to divide the study population into smaller cohorts based on dietary preferences in the hope of identifying specific microbial signatures. However, classification of patients based solely on diet is unlikely to reflect the microbiome-host health relationship or the taxonomic microbiome makeup.We present a novel approach, the Nutrition-Ecotype Mixture of Experts (NEMoE) model, for establishing associations between gut microbiota and health state that accounts for diet-specific cohort variability using a regularized mixture of experts model framework with an integrated parameter sharing strategy to ensure data-driven diet-cohort identification consistency across taxonomic levels. The success of our approach was demonstrated through a series of simulation studies, in which NEMoE showed robustness with regard to parameter selection and varying degrees of data heterogeneity. Further application to real-world microbiome data from a Parkinson's disease cohort revealed that NEMoE is capable of not only improving predictive performance for Parkinson's Disease but also for identifying diet-specific microbial signatures of disease.In summary, NEMoE can be used to uncover diet-specific relationships between nutritional-ecotype and patient health and to contextualize precision nutrition for different diseases.

38958636,Pesticides and the Gut Microbiota: Implications for Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) affects more people worldwide than just aging alone can explain. This is likely due to environmental influences, genetic makeup, and changes in daily habits. The disease develops in a complex way, with movement problems caused by Lewy bodies and the loss of dopamine-producing neurons. Some research suggests Lewy bodies might start in the gut, hinting at a connection between these structures and gut health in PD patients. These patients often have different gut bacteria and metabolites. Pesticides are known to increase the risk of PD, with evidence showing they harm more than just dopamine neurons. Long-term exposure to pesticides in food might affect the gut barrier, gut bacteria, and the blood-brain barrier, but the exact link is still unknown. This review looks at how pesticides and gut bacteria separately influence PD development and progression, highlighting the harmful effects of pesticides and changes in gut bacteria.

Human studies with no restriction on language or publication date, examining associations between MedDiet adherence and the symptoms of PD, were included. We employed standard methodological procedures for data extraction and evidence synthesis and used the Quality Criteria Checklist for assessing the studies included.Four studies from three unique cohorts, including two observational studies (n = 1213) and one RCT (n = 70), met the inclusion criteria. Despite the short study duration reported in all included reports, high MedDiet adherence was associated with changes in the gut microbiota (e.g., increased abundance of short-chain fatty acids producers). These outcomes correlated with a significant improvement in several non-motor symptoms including cognitive dysfunction, dyspepsia and constipation. However, there were no significant changes in diarrhoea, gastrointestinal reflux, abdominal pain and motor symptoms.High MedDiet adherence may be associated with significant improvement in global cognition and several gastrointestinal symptoms, possibly associated to changes in gut microbiota composition.

38652236,Modulation of Gut Microbiota Through Dietary Intervention in Neuroinflammation and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases.,"The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of neuroinflammation and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. One of the main modulators of the gut microbiota is the diet, which directly influences host homeostasis and biological processes. Some dietary patterns can affect neurodegenerative diseases' progression through gut microbiota composition, gut permeability, and the synthesis and secretion of microbial-derived neurotrophic factors and neurotransmitters. This comprehensive review critically assesses existing studies investigating the impact of dietary interventions on the modulation of the microbiota in relation to neurodegenerative diseases and neuroinflammation.There are limited studies on the effects of specific diets, such as the ketogenic diet, Mediterranean diet, vegetarian diet, and Western diet, on the progression of neuroinflammation and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases through the gut-brain axis. The ketogenic diet displays promising potential in ameliorating the clinical trajectory of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. However, conflicting outcomes were observed among various studies, highlighting the need to consider diverse types of ketogenic diets and their respective effects on clinical outcomes and gut microbiota composition. Vegetarian and Mediterranean diets, known for their anti-inflammatory properties, can be effective against Parkinson's disease, which is related to inflammation in the gut environment. On the other hand, the westernization of dietary patterns was associated with reduced gut microbial diversity and metabolites, which ultimately contributed to the development of neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment. Various studies examining the impact of dietary interventions on the gut-brain axis with regard to neuroinflammation and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases are thoroughly reviewed in this article. A strong mechanistic explanation is required to fully understand the complex interactions between various dietary patterns, gut microbiota, and microbial metabolites and the effects these interactions have on cognitive function and the progression of these diseases.",Current nutrition reports,2024,Şerife Ayten; Saniye Bilici
37843219,Correlation between the gut microbiome and neurodegenerative diseases: a review of metagenomics evidence.,"A growing body of evidence suggests that the gut microbiota contributes to the development of neurodegenerative diseases via the microbiota-gut-brain axis. As a contributing factor, microbiota dysbiosis always occurs in pathological changes of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. High-throughput sequencing technology has helped to reveal that the bidirectional communication between the central nervous system and the enteric nervous system is facilitated by the microbiota's diverse microorganisms, and for both neuroimmune and neuroendocrine systems. Here, we summarize the bioinformatics analysis and wet-biology validation for the gut metagenomics in neurodegenerative diseases, with an emphasis on multi-omics studies and the gut virome. The pathogen-associated signaling biomarkers for identifying brain disorders and potential therapeutic targets are also elucidated. Finally, we discuss the role of diet, prebiotics, probiotics, postbiotics and exercise interventions in remodeling the microbiome and reducing the symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases.",Neural regeneration research,2024,Xiaoyan Liu; Yi Liu; Junlin Liu; Hantao Zhang; Chaofan Shan; Yinglu Guo; Xun Gong; Mengmeng Cui; Xiubin Li; Min Tang
38867886,The interplay between gut microbiota and the brain-gut axis in Parkinson's disease treatment.,"This study delves into the pivotal role of the gut microbiota and the brain-gut axis in Parkinson's Disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder with significant motor and non-motor implications. It posits that disruptions in gut microbiota-dysbiosis-and alterations in the brain-gut axis contribute to PD's pathogenesis. Our findings highlight the potential of the gastrointestinal system's early involvement in PD, suggested by the precedence of gastrointestinal symptoms before motor symptoms emerge. This observation implies a possible gut-originated disease pathway. The analysis demonstrates that dysbiosis in PD patients leads to increased intestinal permeability and systemic inflammation, which in turn exacerbates neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Such insights into the interaction between gut microbiota and the brain-gut axis not only elucidate PD's underlying mechanisms but also pave the way for novel therapeutic interventions. We propose targeted treatment strategies, including dietary modifications and fecal microbiota transplantation, aimed at modulating the gut microbiota. These approaches hold promise for augmenting current PD treatment modalities by alleviating both motor and non-motor symptoms, thereby potentially improving patient quality of life. This research underscores the significance of the gut microbiota in the progression and treatment of PD, advocating for an integrated, multidisciplinary approach to develop personalized, efficacious management strategies for PD patients, combining insights from neurology, microbiology, and nutritional science.",Frontiers in neurology,2024,Xi Jia; Qin Wang; Meilingzi Liu; Jia-Yuan Ding
38570412,The Gut Microbiota in Parkinson Disease: Interactions with Drugs and Potential for Therapeutic Applications.,"The concept of a 'microbiota-gut-brain axis' has recently emerged as an important player in the pathophysiology of Parkinson disease (PD), not least because of the reciprocal interaction between gut bacteria and medications. The gut microbiota can influence levodopa kinetics, and conversely, drugs administered for PD can influence gut microbiota composition. Through a two-step enzymatic pathway, gut microbes can decarboxylate levodopa to dopamine in the small intestine and then dehydroxylate it to m-tyramine, thus reducing availability. Inhibition of bacterial decarboxylation pathways could therefore represent a strategy to increase levodopa absorption. Other bacterial perturbations common in PD, such as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and Helicobacter pylori infection, can also modulate levodopa metabolism, and eradication therapies may improve levodopa absorption. Interventions targeting the gut microbiota offer a novel opportunity to manage disabling motor complications and dopa-unresponsive symptoms. Mediterranean diet-induced changes in gut microbiota composition might improve a range of non-motor symptoms. Prebiotics can increase levels of short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria and decrease pro-inflammatory species, with positive effects on clinical symptoms and levodopa kinetics. Different formulations of probiotics showed beneficial outcomes on constipation, with some of them improving dopamine levels; however, the most effective dosage and duration and long-term effects of these treatments remain unknown. Data from faecal microbiota transplantation studies are preliminary, but show encouraging trends towards improvement in both motor and non-motor outcomes.This article summarises the most up-to-date knowledge in pharmacomicrobiomics in PD, and discusses how the manipulation of gut microbiota represents a potential new therapeutic avenue for PD.",CNS drugs,2024,Elisa Menozzi; Anthony H V Schapira
38999791,"Gut-Brain Axis in Focus: Polyphenols, Microbiota, and Their Influence on α-Synuclein in Parkinson's Disease.","With the recognition of the importance of the gut-brain axis in Parkinson's disease (PD) etiology, there is increased interest in developing therapeutic strategies that target α-synuclein, the hallmark abhorrent protein of PD pathogenesis, which may originate in the gut. Research has demonstrated that inhibiting the aggregation, oligomerization, and fibrillation of α-synuclein are key strategies for disease modification. Polyphenols, which are rich in fruits and vegetables, are drawing attention for their potential role in this context. In this paper, we reviewed how polyphenols influence the composition and functional capabilities of the gut microbiota and how the resulting microbial metabolites of polyphenols may potentially enhance the modulation of α-synuclein aggregation. Understanding the interaction between polyphenols and gut microbiota and identifying which specific microbes may enhance the efficacy of polyphenols is crucial for developing therapeutic strategies and precision nutrition based on the microbiome.",Nutrients,2024,Elizabeth Riegelman; Kathy S Xue; Jia-Sheng Wang; Lili Tang
38279293,From the Gut to the Brain: The Role of Enteric Glial Cells and Their Involvement in the Pathogenesis of Parkinson's Disease.,"The brain-gut axis has been identified as an important contributor to the physiopathology of Parkinson's disease. In this pathology, inflammation is thought to be driven by the damage caused by aggregation of α-synuclein in the brain. Interestingly, the Braak's theory proposes that α-synuclein misfolding may originate in the gut and spread in a ""prion-like"" manner through the vagus nerve into the central nervous system. In the enteric nervous system, enteric glial cells are the most abundant cellular component. Several studies have evaluated their role in Parkinson's disease. Using samples obtained from patients, cell cultures, or animal models, the studies with specific antibodies to label enteric glial cells (GFAP, Sox-10, and S100β) seem to indicate that activation and reactive gliosis are associated to the neurodegeneration produced by Parkinson's disease in the enteric nervous system. Of interest, Toll-like receptors, which are expressed on enteric glial cells, participate in the triggering of immune/inflammatory responses, in the maintenance of intestinal barrier integrity and in the configuration of gut microbiota; thus, these receptors might contribute to Parkinson's disease. External factors like stress also seem to be relevant in its pathogenesis. Some authors have studied ways to reverse changes in EGCs with interventions such as administration of Tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase inhibitors, nutraceuticals, or physical exercise. Some researchers point out that beyond being activated during the disease, enteric glial cells may contribute to the development of synucleinopathies. Thus, it is still necessary to further study these cells and their role in Parkinson's disease.",International journal of molecular sciences,2024,Alba Montalbán-Rodríguez; Raquel Abalo; Laura López-Gómez
39403202,Trends and hotspots on the relationship between gut microbiota and Parkinson's Disease: a bibliometric analysis.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that significantly impacts patients' quality of life. Recent evidence has highlighted a complex relationship between the gut microbiota (GM) and PD. Understanding this relationship is crucial for potentially targeting GM in PD treatment and expanding therapeutic options. This study aimed to comprehensively analyze the global landscape, trends, and research focus on GM and PD using bibliometric analysis. Utilizing publications from the Web of Science Core Collection (WsSCC), bibliometric tools such as the R package 'Bibliometrix,' VOS viewer, and CiteSpace software were employed to assess parameters like yearly publications, countries/regions, institutions, and authors. Research trends and hotspots were identified through keyword analysis. The results revealed 1,161 articles published between 2013-2023, with China leading in publications (n=352, 30.31% of total), while the United States had a higher influence (H-index=58). The University of California System was the top institution in terms of publications (n=35), with the National Natural Science Foundation of China funding the most projects (n=172). Keshavarzian A and Sampson TR were the authors with the highest publication and co-citation counts, respectively. The <i>International Journal of Molecular Sciences</i> had the most articles published (n=48). Keyword analysis identified parkinson's disease, gut microbiota, short-chain fatty acids, inflammation, and probiotics as main research topics. Biomarkers, ketogenic diet, and NF-κB were recent research hotspots and trends (2021-2023). The current study conducts an objective and comprehensive analysis of these publications, identifying trends and hotspots in the field of research. The findings offer valuable insights to scholars globally and in-vestigate potential therapeutic strategies for Parkinson's Disease.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2024,Xuefeng Li; Xiaogang Hao; Chunhai Chen; Chao Zhai; Ting Pan; Xue Zhou; Yang Liu; Dalong Wu; Xinhua Chen
38587699,The Interaction Between Nutraceuticals and Gut Microbiota: a Novel Therapeutic Approach to Prevent and Treatment Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons, leading to motor and non-motor symptoms. Emerging research has shed light on the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis and progression of PD. Nutraceuticals such as curcumin, berberine, phytoestrogens, polyphenols (e.g., resveratrol, EGCG, and fisetin), dietary fibers have been shown to influence gut microbiota composition and function, restoring microbial balance and enhancing the gut-brain axis. The mechanisms underlying these benefits involve microbial metabolite production, restoration of gut barrier integrity, and modulation of neuroinflammatory pathways. Additionally, probiotics and prebiotics have shown potential in promoting gut health, influencing the gut microbiome, and alleviating PD symptoms. They can enhance the gut's antioxidant capacity of the gut, reduce inflammation, and maintain immune homeostasis, contributing to a neuroprotective environment. This paper provides an overview of the current state of knowledge regarding the potential of nutraceuticals and gut microbiota modulation in the prevention and management of Parkinson's disease, emphasizing the need for further research and clinical trials to validate their effectiveness and safety. The findings suggest that a multifaceted approach involving nutraceuticals and gut microbiota may open new avenues for addressing the challenges of PD and improving the quality of life for affected individuals.",Molecular neurobiology,2024,Liyan Yao; Yong Yang; Xiaowei Yang; Mohammad J Rezaei
38852651,Study on the mechanism of gut microbiota in the pathogenetic interaction between depression and Parkinson 's disease.,"Depression and Parkinson's disease share pathogenetic characteristics, meaning that they can impact each other and exacerbate their respective progression. From a pathogenetic perspective, depression can develop into Parkinson's disease and is a precursor symptom of Parkinson's disease; Parkinson's disease is also often accompanied by depression. From a pharmacological perspective, the use of antidepressants increases the risk of developing Parkinson's disease, and therapeutic medications for Parkinson's disease can exacerbate symptoms of depression. Therefore, identifying how Parkinson's disease and depression impact each other in their development is key to formulating preventive measures and targeted treatment. One commonality in the pathogenesis of depression and Parkinson's disease are alterations in the gut microbiota, with mechanisms interacting in neural, immune inflammatory, and neuroendocrine pathways. This paper reviews the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of depression and Parkinson's disease; conducts a study of the relationship between both conditions and medication; and suggests that dysregulated gut microbiota may be a key factor in explaining the relationship between Parkinson's disease and depression. Finally, on the basis of these findings, this article hopes to provide suggestions that new ideas for the prevention and treatment of depression and Parkinson's disease.",Brain research bulletin,2024,Peiyun Zhang; Wei Jin; Zhaoshun Lyu; Xinxuan Lyu; Lihong Li
38785512,The Effect of Gut Microbiota-Targeted Interventions on Neuroinflammation and Motor Function in Parkinson's Disease Animal Models-A Systematic Review.,"Gut microbiome-targeted interventions such as fecal transplant, prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics, and antibiotic gut depletion are speculated to be of potential use in delaying the onset and progression of Parkinson's disease by rebalancing the gut microbiome in the context of the gut-brain axis. Our study aims to organize recent findings regarding these interventions in Parkinson's disease animal models to identify how they affect neuroinflammation and motor outcomes. A systematic literature search was applied in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and SCOPUS for gut microbiome-targeted non-dietary interventions. Studies that investigated gut-targeted interventions by using in vivo murine PD models to follow dopaminergic cell loss, motor tests, and neuroinflammatory markers as outcomes were considered to be eligible. A total of 1335 studies were identified in the databases, out of which 29 were found to be eligible. A narrative systematization of the resulting data was performed, and the effect direction for the outcomes was represented. Quality assessment using the SYRCLE risk of bias tool was also performed. Out of the 29 eligible studies, we found that a significant majority report that the intervention reduced the dopaminergic cell loss (82.76%, 95% CI [64.23%, 94.15%]) produced by the induction of the disease model. Also, most studies reported a reduction in microglial (87.5%, 95% CI [61.65%, 98.45%]) and astrocytic activation (84,62%, 95% CI [54.55%, 98.08%]) caused by the induction of the disease model. These results were also mirrored in the majority (96.4% 95% CI [81.65%, 99.91%]) of the studies reporting an increase in performance in behavioral motor tests. A significant limitation of the study was that insufficient information was found in the studies to assess specific causes of the risk of bias. These results show that non-dietary gut microbiome-targeted interventions can improve neuroinflammatory and motor outcomes in acute Parkinson's disease animal models. Further studies are needed to clarify if these benefits transfer to the long-term pathogenesis of the disease, which is not yet fully understood. The study had no funding source, and the protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database with the ID number CRD42023461495.",Current issues in molecular biology,2024,Paul-Ștefan Panaitescu; Vlad Răzniceanu; Ștefania-Maria Mocrei-Rebrean; Vlad Sever Neculicioiu; Hanna-Maria Dragoș; Carmen Costache; Gabriela Adriana Filip
39177611,"The Associations Among Gut Microbiota, Branched Chain Amino Acids, and Parkinson's Disease: Mendelian Randomization Study.","In experimental and observational studies, the characteristics of gut microbiota have been associated with Parkinson's disease (PD), among which metabolic pathways played an important role. However, the causality remained unclear.Herein, we aimed to determine the potential impact of gut microbiota and gut microbiota-derived metabolites on PD risk using a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach.We included as exposures gut microbial taxa abundance and gut-derived metabolites (branched chain amino acids [BCAAs]), with PD as the outcome. In addition, we explored whether BCAAs act as a mediating factor in the pathway from gut microbiota to PD.We found evidence of a causality of 15 microbial taxa and PD before and after sensitivity analyses, but not after multiple testing correction. There was significant association between BCAAs levels and the risk of PD, especially isoleucine (OR = 0.995, 95% CI 0.992-0.999, p = 0.004, pFDR = 0.012). In addition, the causality of gut microbiota and BCAAs was also explored that the increased g_Coprococcus abundance can result in the decrease in isoleucine level (OR = 1.046; 95% CI, 1.009-1.085; p = 0.016).Our findings indicated suggestive association between gut microbiota and its metabolites and PD. Furthermore, higher BCAAs levels were associated with the decreased PD risk. This study may provide new targets for PD treatment, such as dietary BCAAs supplementation.",Journal of Parkinson's disease,2024,Zhenzhen Yan; Guohua Zhao
39168575,Coffee and Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disease marked by dopaminergic neuronal loss and misfolded alpha-synuclein (α-syn) accumulation, which results in both motor and cognitive symptoms. Its occurrence grows with age, with a larger prevalence among males. Despite substantial study, effective medicines to reduce or stop the progression of diseases remain elusive. Interest has grown in examining dietary components, such as caffeine present in coffee, for potential medicinal effects. Epidemiological studies imply a lower incidence of PD with coffee drinking, attributable to caffeine's neuroprotective abilities. Beyond caffeine, coffee constituent like chlorogenic acid and cafestol have anti-Parkinsonian benefits. Moreover, coffee use has been related with variations in gut microbiota composition, which may reduce intestinal inflammation and prevent protein misfolding in enteric nerves, perhaps through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. This review gives a summary of the neuroprotective effects of coffee, investigating both its motor and non-motor advantages in individuals with PD as well as in experimental models of PD. We reviewed some bioactive constituents of coffee, their respective interactions with misfolded α-syn accumulation, and its emerging mechanisms associated to the gut microbiome.",Progress in brain research,2024,Abraham Olufemi Asuku; Maryam Tayo Ayinla; Tobiloba Samuel Olajide; Toheeb O Oyerinde; Joshua Ayodele Yusuf; Adedamola Aminat Bayo-Olugbami; Grace Ayobami Fajemidagba
38974034,Gut-directed therapy in Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common and slow-progressing neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms, including gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunctions. Over the last years, the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis is emerging as a bacterial-neuro-immune ascending pathway that contributes to the progression of PD. Indeed, PD patients are characterized by changes in gut microbiota composition, alterations of intestinal epithelial barrier (IEB) and enteric neurogenic/inflammatory responses that, besides determining intestinal disturbances, contribute to brain pathology. In this context, despite the causal relationship between gut dysbiosis, impaired MGB axis and PD remains to be elucidated, emerging evidence shows that MGB axis modulation can represent a suitable therapeutical strategy for the treatment of PD. This review provides an overview of the available knowledge about the beneficial effects of gut-directed therapies, including dietary interventions, prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), in both PD patients and animal models. In this context, particular attention has been devoted to the mechanisms by which the modulation of MGB axis could halt or slow down PD pathology and, most importantly, how these approaches can be included in the clinical practice.",Frontiers in pharmacology,2024,Laura Benvenuti; Clelia Di Salvo; Gabriele Bellini; Luisa Seguella; Francesco Rettura; Giuseppe Esposito; Luca Antonioli; Roberto Ceravolo; Nunzia Bernardini; Carolina Pellegrini; Matteo Fornai
39036341,The gut microbiota-brain axis in neurological disorders.,"Previous studies have shown a bidirectional communication between human gut microbiota and the brain, known as the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA). The MGBA influences the host's nervous system development, emotional regulation, and cognitive function through neurotransmitters, immune modulation, and metabolic pathways. Factors like diet, lifestyle, genetics, and environment shape the gut microbiota composition together. Most research have explored how gut microbiota regulates host physiology and its potential in preventing and treating neurological disorders. However, the individual heterogeneity of gut microbiota, strains playing a dominant role in neurological diseases, and the interactions of these microbial metabolites with the central/peripheral nervous systems still need exploration. This review summarizes the potential role of gut microbiota in driving neurodevelopmental disorders (autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder), neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease), and mood disorders (anxiety and depression) in recent years and discusses the current clinical and preclinical gut microbe-based interventions, including dietary intervention, probiotics, prebiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation.

37307829,Relationships Between Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder and Parkinson's Disease: Indication from Gut Microbiota Alterations.,"Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) has a close relationship with Parkinson's disease (PD) and was even regarded as the most reliable hallmark of prodromal PD. RBD might have similar changes in gut dysbiosis to PD, but the relationship between RBD and PD in gut microbial alterations is rarely studied. In this study, we aim to investigate whether there were consistent changes between RBD and PD in gut microbiota, and found some specific biomarkers in RBD that might indicate phenoconversion to PD. Alpha-diversity showed no remarkable difference and beta-diversity showed significant differences based on the unweighted (R = 0.035, P = 0.037) and weighted (R = 0.0045, P = 0.008) UniFrac analysis among idiopathic RBD (iRBD), PD with RBD, PD without RBD and normal controls (NC). Enterotype distribution indicated iRBD, PD with RBD and PD without RBD were Ruminococcus-dominant while NC were Bacteroides-dominant. 7 genera (4 increased: Aerococcus, Eubacterium, Gordonibacter and Stenotrophomonas, 3 decreased: Butyricicoccus, Faecalibacterium and Haemophilus) were consistently changed in iRBD and PD with RBD. Among them, 4 genera (Aerococcus, Eubacterium, Butyricicoccus, Faecalibacterium) remained distinctive in the comparison between PD with RBD and PD without RBD. Through clinical correlation analysis, Butyricicoccus and Faecalibacterium were found negatively correlated with the severity of RBD (RBD-HK). Functional analysis showed iRBD had similarly increased staurosporine biosynthesis to PD with RBD. Our study indicates that RBD had similar gut microbial changes to PD. Decreased Butyricicoccus and Faecalibacterium might be potential hallmarks of phenoconversion of RBD to PD.",Aging and disease,2024,Pingchen Zhang; Pei Huang; Yuanyuan Li; Juanjuan Du; Ningdi Luo; Yixi He; Jin Liu; Guiying He; Shishuang Cui; Weishan Zhang; Gen Li; Xin Shen; Liu Jun; Shengdi Chen
39134825,Gut Microbiota-Induced Modulation of the Central Nervous System Function in Parkinson's Disease Through the Gut-Brain Axis and Short-Chain Fatty Acids.,"Recent insights into Parkinson's disease (PD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, suggest a significant influence of the gut microbiome on its pathogenesis and progression through the gut-brain axis. This study integrates 16S rRNA sequencing, high-throughput transcriptomic sequencing, and animal model experiments to explore the molecular mechanisms underpinning the role of gut-brain axis in PD, with a focus on short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) mediated by the SCFA receptors FFAR2 and FFAR3. Our findings highlighted prominent differences in the gut microbiota composition between PD patients and healthy individuals, particularly in taxa such as Escherichia_Shigella and Bacteroidetes, which potentially impact SCFA levels through secondary metabolite biosynthesis. Notably, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from healthy to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse models significantly improved motor function, enhanced dopamine and serotonin levels in the striatum, and increased the number of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra while reducing glial cell activation. This therapeutic effect was associated with increased levels of SCFAs such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate in the gut of MPTP-lesioned mice. Moreover, transcriptomic analyses revealed upregulated expression of FFAR2 and FFAR3 in MPTP-lesioned mice, indicating their crucial role in mediating the benefits of FMT on the central nervous system. These results provide compelling evidence that gut microbiota and SCFAs play a critical role in modulating the gut-brain axis, offering new insights into PD's etiology and potential targets for therapeutic intervention.",Molecular neurobiology,2024,Yiting Ni; Qiaowen Tong; Mengying Xu; Jiayi Gu; Hua Ye
38989933,Gut microbiota-astrocyte axis: new insights into age-related cognitive decline.,"With the rapidly aging human population, age-related cognitive decline and dementia are becoming increasingly prevalent worldwide. Aging is considered the main risk factor for cognitive decline and acts through alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota, microbial metabolites, and the functions of astrocytes. The microbiota-gut-brain axis has been the focus of multiple studies and is closely associated with cognitive function. This article provides a comprehensive review of the specific changes that occur in the composition of the gut microbiota and microbial metabolites in older individuals and discusses how the aging of astrocytes and reactive astrocytosis are closely related to age-related cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases. This article also summarizes the gut microbiota components that affect astrocyte function, mainly through the vagus nerve, immune responses, circadian rhythms, and microbial metabolites. Finally, this article summarizes the mechanism by which the gut microbiota-astrocyte axis plays a role in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Our findings have revealed the critical role of the microbiota-astrocyte axis in age-related cognitive decline, aiding in a deeper understanding of potential gut microbiome-based adjuvant therapy strategies for this condition.",Neural regeneration research,2025,Lan Zhang; Jingge Wei; Xilei Liu; Dai Li; Xiaoqi Pang; Fanglian Chen; Hailong Cao; Ping Lei
38344171,The interplay between microbiota and brain-gut axis in epilepsy treatment.,"The brain-gut axis plays a vital role in connecting the cognitive and emotional centers of the brain with the intricate workings of the intestines. An imbalance in the microbiota-mediated brain-gut axis extends far beyond conditions like Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and obesity, playing a critical role in the development and progression of various neurological disorders, including epilepsy, depression, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD). Epilepsy, a brain disorder characterized by unprovoked seizures, affects approximately 50 million people worldwide. Accumulating evidence suggests that rebuilding the gut microbiota through interventions such as fecal microbiota transplantation, probiotics, and ketogenic diets (KD) can benefit drug-resistant epilepsy. The disturbances in the gut microbiota could contribute to the toxic side effects of antiepileptic drugs and the development of drug resistance in epilepsy patients. These findings imply the potential impact of the gut microbiota on epilepsy and suggest that interventions targeting the microbiota, such as the KD, hold promise for managing and treating epilepsy. However, the full extent of the importance of microbiota in epilepsy treatment is not yet fully understood, and many aspects of this field remain unclear. Therefore, this article aims to provide an overview of the clinical and animal evidence supporting the regulatory role of gut microbiota in epilepsy, and of potential pathways within the brain-gut axis that may be influenced by the gut microbiota in epilepsy. Furthermore, we will discuss the recent advancements in epilepsy treatment, including the KD, fecal microbiota transplantation, and antiseizure drugs, all from the perspective of the gut microbiota.",Frontiers in pharmacology,2024,Hanxiao Zhu; Wei Wang; Yun Li
38237031,The contribution of age-related changes in the gut-brain axis to neurological disorders.,"Trillions of microbes live symbiotically in the host, specifically in mucosal tissues such as the gut. Recent advances in metagenomics and metabolomics have revealed that the gut microbiota plays a critical role in the regulation of host immunity and metabolism, communicating through bidirectional interactions in the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA). The gut microbiota regulates both gut and systemic immunity and contributes to the neurodevelopment and behaviors of the host. With aging, the composition of the microbiota changes, and emerging studies have linked these shifts in microbial populations to age-related neurological diseases (NDs). Preclinical studies have demonstrated that gut microbiota-targeted therapies can improve behavioral outcomes in the host by modulating microbial, metabolomic, and immunological profiles. In this review, we discuss the pathways of brain-to-gut or gut-to-brain signaling and summarize the role of gut microbiota and microbial metabolites across the lifespan and in disease. We highlight recent studies investigating 1) microbial changes with aging; 2) how aging of the maternal microbiome can affect offspring health; and 3) the contribution of the microbiome to both chronic age-related diseases (e.g., Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and cerebral amyloidosis), and acute brain injury, including ischemic stroke and traumatic brain injury.",Gut microbes,2024,Romeesa Khan; Claudia M Di Gesù; Juneyoung Lee; Louise D McCullough
38848023,The connection between gut microbiota and its metabolites with neurodegenerative diseases in humans.,"The aging of populations is a global phenomenon that follows a possible increase in the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases. Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Multiple Sclerosis, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and Huntington's diseases are some neurodegenerative disorders that aging could initiate or aggravate. Recent research has indicated that intestinal microbiota dysbiosis can trigger metabolism and brain functioning, contributing to the etiopathogenesis of those neurodegenerative diseases. The intestinal microbiota and its metabolites show significant functions in various aspects, such as the immune system modulation (development and maturation), the maintenance of the intestinal barrier integrity, the modulation of neuromuscular functions in the intestine, and the facilitation of essential metabolic processes for both the microbiota and humans. The primary evidence supporting the connection between intestinal microbiota and its metabolites with neurodegenerative diseases are epidemiological observations and animal models experimentation. This paper reviews up-to-date evidence on the correlation between the microbiota-gut-brain axis and neurodegenerative diseases, with a specially focus on gut metabolites. Dysbiosis can increase inflammatory cytokines and bacterial metabolites, altering intestinal and blood-brain barrier permeability and causing neuroinflammation, thus facilitating the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Clinical data supporting this evidence still needs to be improved. Most of the works found are descriptive and associated with the presence of phyla or species of bacteria with neurodegenerative diseases. Despite the limitations of recent research, the potential for elucidating clinical questions that have thus far eluded clarification within prevailing pathophysiological frameworks of health and disease is promising through investigation of the interplay between the host and microbiota.",Metabolic brain disease,2024,João Paulo Fabi
39113894,Exploring Causal Links Between Gut Microbiota and Geriatric Syndromes: A Two-Sample Mendelian Randomization Analysis.,"<b>Background:</b> Both observational studies and clinical trials have demonstrated a link between the gut microbiota and the geriatric syndrome. Nevertheless, the exact nature of this relationship, particularly concerning causality, remains elusive. Mendelian randomization (MR) is a method of inference based on genetic variation to assess the causal relationship between an exposure and an outcome. In this study, we conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (TSMR) study to fully reveal the potential genetic causal effects of gut microbiota on geriatric syndromes. <b>Methods:</b> This study used data from genome wide association studies (GWAS) to investigate causal relationships between the gut microbiota and geriatric syndromes, including frailty, Parkinson's disease (PD), delirium, insomnia, and depression. The primary causal relationships were evaluated using the inverse-variance weighted method, MR Egger, simple mode, weighted mode and weighted median. To assess the robustness of the results, horizontal pleiotropy was examined through MR-Egger intercept and MR-presso methods. Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran's Q test, and sensitivity was evaluated via the leave-one-out method. <b>Results:</b> We identified 41 probable causal relationships between gut microbiota and five geriatric syndrome-associated illnesses using the inverse-variance weighted method. Frailty showed five positive and two negative causal relationships, while PD revealed three positive and four negative causal connections.

38409641,Neuroprotective Effects of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis NJ241 in a Mouse Model of Parkinson's Disease: Implications for Gut Microbiota and PGC-1α.,"Intestinal dysbiosis plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), and probiotics have emerged as potential modulators of central nervous system function through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. This study aimed to elucidate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of the probiotic strain Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis NJ241 (NJ241) in a mouse model of PD induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). The impact of NJ241 was comprehensively assessed in PD mice through behavioral tests, immunofluorescence, Western blotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), 16S rRNA sequencing, and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) detection. NJ241 exhibited notable efficacy in mitigating MPTP-induced weight loss, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and behavioral deficits in mice. Furthermore, it demonstrated protected against MPTP-induced dopaminergic neuron death and inhibited the activation of glial cells in the substantia nigra (SN). NJ241 demonstrated the ability to normalized dysbiosis in the intestinal microbiota and elevate SCFA levels in PD mice. Additionally, NJ241 reversed MPTP-induced reductions in colonic GLP-1 levels and the expression of GLP-1R and PGC-1α in the SN. Notably, GLP-1R antagonists partially reversed the inhibitory effects of NJ241 on the activation of glial cells in the SN. In summary, NJ241 exerts a neuroprotective effect against MPTP-induced neuroinflammation by enhancing intestinal GLP-1 levels and activating nigral PGC-1α signaling. These findings provide a rationale for the exploration and development of probiotic-based therapeutic strategies for PD.",Molecular neurobiology,2024,Yuxuan Dong; Yueyan Qi; Jinhu Chen; Siyuan Han; Wenjing Su; Xin Ma; Yang Yu; Yanqin Wang
38385354,<i>Gastrodia elata</i> polysaccharide alleviates Parkinson's disease <i>via</i> inhibiting apoptotic and inflammatory signaling pathways and modulating the gut microbiota.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common, chronic, and progressive degenerative disease of the central nervous system for which there is no effective treatment. <i>Gastrodia elata</i> is a well-known food and medicine homologous resource with neuroprotective potential. <i>Gastrodia elata</i> polysaccharide (GEP), which is a highly active and safe component in <i>Gastrodia elata</i>, is an important ingredient in the development of functional products. In this study, GEP was administered to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced mice over 3 weeks to investigate its neuroprotective effects. The results showed that GEP significantly alleviated the motor dysfunction of PD mice, inhibited the accumulation of α-synuclein, and reduced the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the brain. Moreover, GEP increased the Bcl-2/Bax ratio and decreased the cleaved-caspase-3 level, suggesting that GEP may ameliorate PD by preventing MPTP-induced mitochondrial apoptosis. GEP also significantly inhibited the increase of GFAP and decreased the levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in the brain of PD mice, which may be the result of the inhibition of neuroinflammation by the inactivation of the TLR4/NF-κB pathway. Furthermore, the neuroprotective effects of GEP involve the gut-brain axis, as it has been shown that GEP regulated the dysbiosis of PD-related gut microbiota such as <i>Akkermansia</i>, <i>Lactobacillus</i>, <i>Bacteroides</i>, <i>Prevotella</i>, and <i>Faecalibacterium</i>, increased the content of microbial metabolites SCFAs in the colon and increased the level of occludin that repairs the intestinal barrier of PD mice. In conclusion, this study is expected to provide a theoretical basis for the development and application of functional products with GEP from the perspective of neuroprotective effects.",Food & function,2024,Qing-Xia Gan; Mao-Yao Peng; Hao-Bo Wei; Lin-Lin Chen; Xiao-Yan Chen; Zi-Han Li; Guang-Qin An; Yun-Tong Ma

Our study identified a deficiency in the microbiota genus Blautia and a reduction in fecal short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) butyrate level in PD patients compared to healthy controls. The abundance of Blautia correlated with the clinical severity of PD. Supplementation with butyrate-producing bacterium B. producta demonstrated neuroprotective effects, attenuating neuroinflammation and dopaminergic neuronal death in mice, consequently ameliorating motor dysfunction. A pivotal inflammatory signaling pathway, the RAS-related pathway, modulated by butyrate, emerged as a key mechanism inhibiting microglial activation in PD. The change of RAS-NF-κB pathway in PD patients was observed. Furthermore, B. producta-derived butyrate demonstrated the inhibition of microglial activation in PD through regulation of the RAS-NF-κB pathway. These findings elucidate the causal relationship between specific gut microbiota and PD, presenting a novel microbiota-based treatment perspective for PD.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2024,Jiaming Liu; Xinhuang Lv; Tao Ye; Ming Zhao; Zhibo Chen; Yang Zhang; Wenwen Yang; Huijia Xie; Lu Zhan; Liuzhu Chen; Wen-Chun Liu; Kuan-Pin Su; Jing Sun
38755164,Gut microbiota produces biofilm-associated amyloids with potential for neurodegeneration.,"Age-related neurodegenerative diseases involving amyloid aggregation remain one of the biggest challenges of modern medicine. Alterations in the gastrointestinal microbiome play an active role in the aetiology of neurological disorders. Here, we dissect the amyloidogenic properties of biofilm-associated proteins (BAPs) of the gut microbiota and their implications for synucleinopathies. We demonstrate that BAPs are naturally assembled as amyloid-like fibrils in insoluble fractions isolated from the human gut microbiota. We show that BAP genes are part of the accessory genomes, revealing microbiome variability. Remarkably, the abundance of certain BAP genes in the gut microbiome is correlated with Parkinson's disease (PD) incidence. Using cultured dopaminergic neurons and Caenorhabditis elegans models, we report that BAP-derived amyloids induce α-synuclein aggregation. Our results show that the chaperone-mediated autophagy is compromised by BAP amyloids. Indeed, inoculation of BAP fibrils into the brains of wild-type mice promote key pathological features of PD. Therefore, our findings establish the use of BAP amyloids as potential targets and biomarkers of α-synucleinopathies.",Nature communications,2024,Ariadna Fernández-Calvet; Leticia Matilla-Cuenca; María Izco; Susanna Navarro; Miriam Serrano; Salvador Ventura; Javier Blesa; Maite Herráiz; Gorka Alkorta-Aranburu; Sergio Galera; Igor Ruiz de Los Mozos; María Luisa Mansego; Alejandro Toledo-Arana; Lydia Alvarez-Erviti; Jaione Valle
38518598,Gut microbiota in neurological diseases: Melatonin plays an important regulatory role.,"Melatonin is a highly conserved molecule produced in the human pineal gland as a hormone. It is known for its essential biological effects, such as antioxidant activity, circadian rhythm regulator, and immunomodulatory effects. The gut is one of the primary known sources of melatonin. The gut microbiota helps produce melatonin from tryptophan, and melatonin has been shown to have a beneficial effect on gut barrier function and microbial population. Dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota is associated with bacterial imbalance and decreased beneficial microbial metabolites, including melatonin. In this way, low melatonin levels may be related to several human diseases. Melatonin has shown both preventive and therapeutic effects against various conditions, including neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. This review was aimed to discuss the role of melatonin in the body, and to describe the possible relationship between gut microbiota and melatonin production, as well as the potential therapeutic effects of melatonin on neurological diseases.",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2024,Somayeh Ahmadi; Mohammad Taghizadieh; Elham Mehdizadehfar; Alka Hasani; Javad Khalili Fard; Hadi Feizi; Hammed Hamishehkar; Masood Ansarin; Mina Yekani; Mohammad Yousef Memar
38244807,Potential effects of the most prescribed drugs on the microbiota-gut-brain-axis: A review.,"The link between drug-induced dysbiosis and its influence on brain diseases through gut-residing bacteria and their metabolites, named the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA), remains largely unexplored. This review investigates the effects of commonly prescribed drugs (metformin, statins, proton-pump-inhibitors, NSAIDs, and anti-depressants) on the gut microbiota, comparing the findings with altered bacterial populations in major brain diseases (depression, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's). The report aims to explore whether drugs can influence the development and progression of brain diseases via the MGBA. Central findings indicate that all explored drugs induce dysbiosis. These dysbiosis patterns were associated with brain disorders. The influence on brain diseases varied across different bacterial taxa, possibly mediated by direct effects or through bacterial metabolites. Each drug induced both positive and negative changes in the abundance of bacteria, indicating a counterbalancing effect. Moreover, the above-mentioned drugs exhibited similar effects, suggesting that they may counteract or enhance each other's effects on brain diseases when taken together by comorbid patients. In conclusion, the interplay of bacterial species and their abundances may have a greater impact on brain diseases than individual drugs or bacterial strains. Future research is needed to better understand drug-induced dysbiosis and the implications for brain disease pathogenesis, with the potential to develop more effective therapeutic options for patients with brain-related diseases.",Brain research bulletin,2024,Kirti Garg; M Hasan Mohajeri
38435303,Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota and its effect on α-synuclein and prion protein misfolding: consequences for neurodegeneration.,"Abnormal behavior of α-synuclein and prion proteins is the hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD) and prion illnesses, respectively, being complex neurological disorders. A primary cause of protein aggregation, brain injury, and cognitive loss in prion illnesses is the misfolding of normal cellular prion proteins (PrP<sup>C</sup>) into an infectious form (PrP<sup>Sc</sup>). Aggregation of α-synuclein causes disruptions in cellular processes in Parkinson's disease (PD), leading to loss of dopamine-producing neurons and motor symptoms. Alteration in the composition or activity of gut microbes may weaken the intestinal barrier and make it possible for prions to go from the gut to the brain. The gut-brain axis is linked to neuroinflammation; the metabolites produced by the gut microbiota affect the aggregation of α-synuclein, regulate inflammation and immunological responses, and may influence the course of the disease and neurotoxicity of proteins, even if their primary targets are distinct proteins. This thorough analysis explores the complex interactions that exist between the gut microbiota and neurodegenerative illnesses, particularly Parkinson's disease (PD) and prion disorders. The involvement of the gut microbiota, a complex collection of bacteria, archaea, fungi, viruses etc., in various neurological illnesses is becoming increasingly recognized. The gut microbiome influences neuroinflammation, neurotransmitter synthesis, mitochondrial function, and intestinal barrier integrity through the gut-brain axis, which contributes to the development and progression of disease. The review delves into the molecular mechanisms that underlie these relationships, emphasizing the effects of microbial metabolites such as bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in regulating brain functioning. Additionally, it looks at how environmental influences and dietary decisions affect the gut microbiome and whether they could be risk factors for neurodegenerative illnesses. This study concludes by highlighting the critical role that the gut microbiota plays in the development of Parkinson's disease (PD) and prion disease. It also provides a promising direction for future research and possible treatment approaches. People afflicted by these difficult ailments may find hope in new preventive and therapeutic approaches if the role of the gut microbiota in these diseases is better understood.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2024,Nasir Uddin Mahbub; Md Minarul Islam; Seong-Tshool Hong; Hea-Jong Chung
39019779,Exercise perspective: Benefits and mechanisms of gut microbiota on the body.,"Gut microbiota refers to the vast and diverse community of microorganisms residing in the intestines. Factors such as genetics, environmental influences (e.g., exercise, diet), and early life experiences (e.g., infant feeding methods) can all affect the ecological balance of gut microbiota within the body. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota is associated with extra-intestinal diseases such as Parkinson's syndrome, osteoporosis, and autoimmune diseases, suggesting that disturbances in gut microbiota may be one of the causes of these diseases. Exercise benefits various diseases, with gut microbiota playing a role in regulating the nervous, musculoskeletal, and immune systems. Gut microbiota can impact the body's health status through the gut-brain axis, gut-muscle axis, and immune pathways. Moderate-intensity aerobic exercise can increase the quantity of gut microbiota and change microbial abundance, although short-term exercise does not significantly affect the alpha diversity of the microbiota. Resistance exercise also does not have a significant regulatory effect on gut microbiota.",Zhong nan da xue xue bao. Yi xue ban = Journal of Central South University.

Despite the numerous connections it remains unclear how the gut and the brain communicate and whether gut dysbiosis is the cause or consequence of these pathologies. Importantly, several reports highlight the importance of mitochondria in the gut-brain axis, as well as in mechanisms like gut epithelium self-renewal, differentiation, and homeostasis. Herein we comprehensively address the important role of mitochondria as a cellular hub in infection and inflammation and as a link between inflammation and neurodegeneration in the gut-brain axis. The role of mitochondria in gut homeostasis and as well the crosstalk between mitochondria and gut microbiota is discussed. Significantly, we also review studies highlighting how gut microbiota can ultimately affect the central nervous system.

In light of this, the current review assesses the effectiveness of neuromodulation techniques in treating neurological and gastrointestinal disorders by modulating the GBA, involving key elements such as gut microbiota, neurotrophic factors, and proinflammatory cytokines. Through a comprehensive literature review encompassing PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library, this research highlights the role played by the GBA in neurological and gastrointestinal diseases, in addition to the impact of neuromodulation on the management of these conditions which include both gastrointestinal (irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)) and neurological disorders (Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and neuropsychiatric disorders).

These communications occur between the central nervous system (CNS), the enteric nervous system (ENS), and the emotional and cognitive centres of the brain. The field of research on the gut-brain axis has grown significantly during the past two decades. Signalling occurs between the gut microbiota and the brain through the neural, endocrine, immune, and humoral pathways. A substantial body of evidence indicates that the MGBA plays a pivotal role in various neurological diseases. These include Alzheimer's disease (AD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Rett syndrome, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), non-Alzheimer's neurodegeneration and dementias, fronto-temporal lobe dementia (FTLD), Wilson-Konovalov disease (WD), multisystem atrophy (MSA), Huntington's chorea (HC), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), depression, and schizophrenia (SCZ). Furthermore, the bidirectional correlation between therapeutics and the gut-brain axis will be discussed.

Furthermore, 16S rRNA gene sequencing combined with metabolomics analysis was conducted to assess the impacts of fecal delivery on the fecal microbiota and metabolism in recipient mice.The fecal microbiota from PD patients increased intestinal inflammation, deteriorated intestinal barrier function, intensified microglia and astrocyte activation, abnormal deposition of α-Synuclein, and dopaminergic neuronal loss in the brains of A53T mice. A mechanistic study revealed that the fecal microbiota of PD patients stimulated the TLR4/NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway in both the brain and colon. Additionally, multiomics analysis found that transplantation of fecal microbiota from PD patients not only altered the composition of the gut microbiota but also influenced the fecal metabolic profile of the recipient mice.The fecal microbiota from PD patients intensifies inflammation and neurodegeneration in A53T mice.

38314132,"Relationship among Parkinson's disease, constipation, microbes, and microbiological therapy.","This comprehensive review elucidates the complex interplay between gut microbiota and constipation in Parkinson's disease (PD), a prevalent non-motor symptom contributing significantly to patients' morbidity. A marked alteration in the gut microbiota, predominantly an increase in the abundance of <i>Proteobacteria</i> and <i>Bacteroidetes</i>, is observed in PD-related constipation. Conventional treatments, although safe, have failed to effectively alleviate symptoms, thereby necessitating the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Microbiological interventions such as prebiotics, probiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) hold therapeutic potential. While prebiotics improve bowel movements, probiotics are effective in enhancing stool consistency and alleviating abdominal discomfort. FMT shows potential for significantly alleviating constipation symptoms by restoring gut microbiota balance in patients with PD.

39064171,"The Brain-Gut Axis, an Important Player in Alzheimer and Parkinson Disease: A Narrative Review.","Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), are severe age-related disorders with complex and multifactorial causes. Recent research suggests a critical link between neurodegeneration and the gut microbiome, via the gut-brain communication pathway. This review examines the role of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a gut microbiota-derived metabolite, in the development of AD and PD, and investigates its interaction with microRNAs (miRNAs) along this bidirectional pathway. TMAO, which is produced from dietary metabolites like choline and carnitine, has been linked to increased neuroinflammation, protein misfolding, and cognitive decline. In AD, elevated TMAO levels are associated with amyloid-beta and tau pathologies, blood-brain barrier disruption, and neuronal death. TMAO can cross the blood-brain barrier and promote the aggregation of amyloid and tau proteins. Similarly, TMAO affects alpha-synuclein conformation and aggregation, a hallmark of PD. TMAO also activates pro-inflammatory pathways such as NF-kB signaling, exacerbating neuroinflammation further. Moreover, TMAO modulates the expression of various miRNAs that are involved in neurodegenerative processes. Thus, the gut microbiome-miRNA-brain axis represents a newly discovered mechanistic link between gut dysbiosis and neurodegeneration. MiRNAs regulate the key pathways involved in neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and neuronal death, contributing to disease progression. As a direct consequence, specific miRNA signatures may serve as potential biomarkers for the early detection and monitoring of AD and PD progression. This review aims to elucidate the complex interrelationships between the gut microbiota, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), microRNAs (miRNAs), and the central nervous system, and the implications of these connections in neurodegenerative diseases. In this context, an overview of the current neuroradiology techniques available for studying neuroinflammation and of the animal models used to investigate these intricate pathologies will also be provided. In summary, a bulk of evidence supports the concept that modulating the gut-brain communication pathway through dietary changes, the manipulation of the microbiome, and/or miRNA-based therapies may offer novel approaches for implementing the treatment of debilitating neurological disorders.",Journal of clinical medicine,2024,Eugenio Caradonna; Raffaello Nemni; Angelo Bifone; Patrizia Gandolfo; Lucy Costantino; Luca Giordano; Elisabetta Mormone; Anna Macula; Mariarosa Cuomo; Rossana Difruscolo; Camilla Vanoli; Emilio Vanoli; Fulvio Ferrara

Clinically, PD is characterized as a movement disorder, exhibiting an incidence and mortality rate that is increasing faster than any other neurological condition. In recent years, there has been a growing interest concerning the role of the gut microbiota in the etiology and pathophysiology of PD. The establishment of a brain-gut microbiota axis is now real, with evidence denoting a bidirectional communication between the brain and the gut microbiota through metabolic, immune, neuronal, and endocrine mechanisms and pathways. Among these, the vagus nerve represents the most direct form of communication between the brain and the gut. Given the potential interactions between bacteria and drugs, it has been observed that the therapies for PD can have an impact on the composition of the microbiota.

38817603,The microbiota-gut-brain-immune interface in the pathogenesis of neuroinflammatory diseases: a narrative review of the emerging literature.,"Research is beginning to elucidate the sophisticated mechanisms underlying the microbiota-gut-brain-immune interface, moving from primarily animal models to human studies. Findings support the dynamic relationships between the gut microbiota as an ecosystem (microbiome) within an ecosystem (host) and its intersection with the host immune and nervous systems. Adding this to the effects on epigenetic regulation of gene expression further complicates and strengthens the response. At the heart is inflammation, which manifests in a variety of pathologies including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Multiple Sclerosis (MS).Generally, the research to date is limited and has focused on bacteria, likely due to the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of 16s rRNA sequencing, despite its lower resolution and inability to determine functional ability/alterations. However, this omits all other microbiota including fungi, viruses, and phages, which are emerging as key members of the human microbiome. Much of the research has been done in pre-clinical models and/or in small human studies in more developed parts of the world. The relationships observed are promising but cannot be considered reliable or generalizable at this time. Specifically, causal relationships cannot be determined currently. More research has been done in Alzheimer's disease, followed by Parkinson's disease, and then little in MS. The data for MS is encouraging despite this.While the research is still nascent, the microbiota-gut-brain-immune interface may be a missing link, which has hampered our progress on understanding, let alone preventing, managing, or putting into remission neurodegenerative diseases. Relationships must first be established in humans, as animal models have been shown to poorly translate to complex human physiology and environments, especially when investigating the human gut microbiome and its relationships where animal models are often overly simplistic. Only then can robust research be conducted in humans and using mechanistic model systems.",Frontiers in immunology,2024,Alison Warren; Yvonne Nyavor; Nikkia Zarabian; Aidan Mahoney; Leigh A Frame
38873926,Associations between gut microbiota characteristics and non-motor symptoms following pharmacological and surgical treatments in Parkinson's disease patients.,"The gut microbiota has been implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD), with alterations observed in microbial composition and reduced microbial species richness, which may influence gastrointestinal symptoms in PD patients. It remains to be determined whether the severity of gastrointestinal symptoms correlates with microbiota variations in PD patients treated pharmacologically or with subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) therapy. This study aims to explore how these treatments affect gut microbiota and gastrointestinal symptoms in PD, identifying specific microbial differences associated with each treatment modality.A total of 42 individuals diagnosed with PD, along with 38 age-matched household control participants, contributed stool samples for microbiota characterization. Differences in the gut microbiota across various groups of PD patients and their households were identified through comprehensive sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing.Differences in microbial communities were observed between PD patients and controls, as well as between PD patients receiving pharmacological treatment and those with STN-DBS. Pharmacologically treated advanced PD patients have higher gastrointestinal dysfunctions. Gut microbiota profile linked to STN-DBS and reduced levodopa consumption, characterized by its anti-inflammatory properties, might play a role in diminishing gastrointestinal dysfunction relative to only pharmacological treatments.Advanced PD patients on medication exhibit more gastrointestinal issues, despite relatively stable microbial diversity, indicating a complex interaction between gut microbiota, PD progression, and treatment effects. An imbalanced gut-brain axis, particularly due to reduced butyrate production, may lead to constipation by affecting the enteric nervous system, which emphasizes the need to incorporate gut microbiome insights into treatment strategies.",Neurogastroenterology and motility,2024,Agnieszka Gorecka-Mazur; Anna Krygowska-Wajs; Agata Furgala; Jiaqi Li; Benjamin Misselwitz; Wojciech Pietraszko; Borys Kwinta; Bahtiyar Yilmaz
38694925,Buty and the beast: the complex role of butyrate in Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease which is often associated with gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction. The GI tract is home to a wide range of microorganisms, among which bacteria, that can influence the host through various mechanisms. Products produced by these bacteria can act in the gut but can also exert effects in the brain via what is now well established to be the microbiota-gut-brain axis. In those with PD the gut-bacteria composition is often found to be different to that of non-PD individuals. In addition to compositional changes, the metabolic activity of the gut-microbiota is also changed in PD. Specifically, it is often reported that key producers of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) as well as the concentration of SCFAs themselves are altered in the stool and blood of those with PD. These SCFAs, among which butyrate, are essential nutrients for the host and are a major energy source for epithelial cells of the GI tract. Additionally, butyrate plays a key role in regulating various host responses particularly in relation to inflammation. Studies have demonstrated that a reduction in butyrate levels can have a critical role in the onset and progression of PD. Furthermore, it has been shown that restoring butyrate levels in those with PD through methods such as probiotics, prebiotics, sodium butyrate supplementation, and fecal transplantation can have a beneficial effect on both motor and non-motor outcomes of the disease. This review presents an overview of evidence for the altered gut-bacteria composition and corresponding metabolite production in those with PD, with a particular focus on the SCFA butyrate. In addition to presenting current studies regarding SCFA in clinical and preclinical reports, evidence for the possibility to target butyrate production using microbiome based approaches in a therapeutic context is discussed.",Frontiers in pharmacology,2024,Joshua D Elford; Nanette Becht; Johan Garssen; Aletta D Kraneveld; Paula Perez-Pardo
38449863,Protective effects of fecal microbiota transplantation against ischemic stroke and other neurological disorders: an update.,"The bidirectional communication between the gut and brain or gut-brain axis is regulated by several gut microbes and microbial derived metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids, trimethylamine N-oxide, and lipopolysaccharides. The Gut microbiota (GM) produce neuroactives, specifically neurotransmitters that modulates local and central neuronal brain functions. An imbalance between intestinal commensals and pathobionts leads to a disruption in the gut microbiota or dysbiosis, which affects intestinal barrier integrity and gut-immune and neuroimmune systems. Currently, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is recommended for the treatment of recurrent <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> infection. FMT elicits its action by ameliorating inflammatory responses through the restoration of microbial composition and functionality. Thus, FMT may be a potential therapeutic option in suppressing neuroinflammation in post-stroke conditions and other neurological disorders involving the neuroimmune axis. Specifically, FMT protects against ischemic injury by decreasing IL-17, IFN-γ, Bax, and increasing Bcl-2 expression. Interestingly, FMT improves cognitive function by lowering amyloid-β accumulation and upregulating synaptic marker (PSD-95, synapsin-1) expression in Alzheimer's disease. In Parkinson's disease, FMT was shown to inhibit the expression of TLR4 and NF-κB. In this review article, we have summarized the potential sources and methods of administration of FMT and its impact on neuroimmune and cognitive functions.

A critical component of neurodegenerative disease pathologies is the imbalance between pro-oxidant and antioxidant mechanisms, culminating in oxidative stress. The brain's high oxygen consumption and lipid-rich environment make it particularly vulnerable to oxidative damage. Pro-oxidants such as reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are continuously generated during normal metabolism, counteracted by enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant defenses. In neurodegenerative diseases, this balance is disrupted, leading to neuronal damage. This systematic review explores the roles of oxidative stress, gut microbiota, and epigenetic modifications in neurodegenerative diseases, aiming to elucidate the interplay between these factors and identify potential therapeutic strategies. We conducted a comprehensive search of articles published in 2024 across major databases, focusing on studies examining the relationships between redox homeostasis, gut microbiota, and epigenetic changes in neurodegeneration. A total of 161 studies were included, comprising clinical trials, observational studies, and experimental research. Our findings reveal that oxidative stress plays a central role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, with gut microbiota composition and epigenetic modifications significantly influencing redox balance. Specific bacterial taxa and epigenetic markers were identified as potential modulators of oxidative stress, suggesting novel avenues for therapeutic intervention. Moreover, recent evidence from human and animal studies supports the emerging concept of targeting redox homeostasis through microbiota and epigenetic therapies. Future research should focus on validating these targets in clinical settings and exploring the potential for personalized medicine strategies based on individual microbiota and epigenetic profiles.","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2024,Constantin Munteanu; Anca Irina Galaction; Marius Turnea; Corneliu Dan Blendea; Mariana Rotariu; Mădălina Poștaru
38227539,Gut microbiota dysbiosis contributes to α-synuclein-related pathology associated with C/EBPβ/AEP signaling activation in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease.,"JOURNAL/nrgr/04.03/01300535-202409000-00042/figure1/v/2024-01-16T170235Z/r/image-tiff Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor and gastrointestinal dysfunction. Gastrointestinal dysfunction can precede the onset of motor symptoms by several years. Gut microbiota dysbiosis is involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease, whether it plays a causal role in motor dysfunction, and the mechanism underlying this potential effect, remain unknown. CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β/asparagine endopeptidase (C/EBPβ/AEP) signaling, activated by bacterial endotoxin, can promote α-synuclein transcription, thereby contributing to Parkinson's disease pathology. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of the gut microbiota in C/EBPβ/AEP signaling, α-synuclein-related pathology, and motor symptoms using a rotenone-induced mouse model of Parkinson's disease combined with antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion and fecal microbiota transplantation. We found that rotenone administration resulted in gut microbiota dysbiosis and perturbation of the intestinal barrier, as well as activation of the C/EBP/AEP pathway, α-synuclein aggregation, and tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neuron loss in the substantia nigra in mice with motor deficits. However, treatment with rotenone did not have any of these adverse effects in mice whose gut microbiota was depleted by pretreatment with antibiotics. Importantly, we found that transplanting gut microbiota derived from mice treated with rotenone induced motor deficits, intestinal inflammation, and endotoxemia. Transplantation of fecal microbiota from healthy control mice alleviated rotenone-induced motor deficits, intestinal inflammation, endotoxemia, and intestinal barrier impairment. These results highlight the vital role that gut microbiota dysbiosis plays in inducing motor deficits, C/EBPβ/AEP signaling activation, and α-synuclein-related pathology in a rotenone-induced mouse model of Parkinson's disease. Additionally, our findings suggest that supplementing with healthy microbiota may be a safe and effective treatment that could help ameliorate the progression of motor deficits in patients with Parkinson's disease.",Neural regeneration research,2024,Xiaoli Fang; Sha Liu; Bilal Muhammad; Mingxuan Zheng; Xing Ge; Yan Xu; Shu Kan; Yang Zhang; Yinghua Yu; Kuiyang Zheng; Deqin Geng; Chun-Feng Liu
38840699,Correlation between dietary factors and Parkinson's disease revealed by the analysis of Mendelian randomization.,"The intricate interplay between dietary habits and the development of Parkinson's Disease (PD) has long been a subject of scientific inquiry. Mendelian Randomization (MR) emerges as a potent tool, harnessing genetic variants to infer causality in observational data. While evidence links diet to Parkinson's Disease (PD) etiology, a thorough MR exploration of dietary impacts on PD, particularly involving gut microbiota, is still emerging.This research leverages the IEU Open GWAS project's vast GWAS database to address the knowledge gap in understanding diet's influence on PD, employing a diverse range of dietary variables. Our holistic dataset includes various foods like processed fava beans, bap, red wine, to cheese, reflecting a commitment to untangling dietary complexities in PD etiology. Advancing from initial dietary-PD associations, we innovatively explore the gut microbiota, focusing on <i>Parabacteroides goldsteinii,</i> in relation to bap intake and PD, employing MR. Utilizing weighted median, MR-Egger, and inverse variance weighting methods, we ensure rigorous causality assessments, meticulously mitigating pleiotropy and heterogeneity biases to uphold finding validity.Our findings indicate red wine (OR: 1.031; 95% CI 1.001-1.062; <i>p</i> = 0.044) and dried fruit consumption (OR: 2.019; 95% CI 1.052-3.875; <i>p</i> = 0.035) correlate with increased PD risk, whereas broad beans (OR: 0.967; 95% CI 0.939-0.996; <i>p</i> = 0.024) and bap intake (OR: 0.922; 95% CI 0.860-0.989; <i>p</i> = 0.023) show protective effects against PD. Employing MR, specifically the IVW method, revealed a significant inverse association between bap intake and gut microbiota, marked by an 8.010-fold decrease in <i>Parabacteroides goldsteinii</i> per standard deviation increase in bap intake (95% CI 1.005-63.818, <i>p</i> = 0.049). Furthermore, a connection between PD and <i>Parabacteroides goldsteinii</i> was observed (OR: 0.810; 95% CI 0.768-0.999; <i>p</i> = 0.049), suggesting a potential microbiota-mediated pathway in PD etiology.Our study links dietary habits to PD risk, showing higher PD risk with red wine and dried fruit consumption, and a protective effect from broad beans and bap. Using MR, we found bap intake inversely correlates with <i>Parabacteroides goldsteinii</i> in the gut, suggesting bap influences microbiota. Further, higher <i>Parabacteroides goldsteinii</i> levels correlate with lower PD risk, highlighting a complex interplay of diet, gut microbiome, and neurological health. These insights shed light on potential dietary interventions for PD.",Frontiers in nutrition,2024,Shan Zeng; Aishanjiang Yusufujiang; Chunli Zhang; Chen Yang; Hongyan Li
38957302,Mild cognitive impairment and microbiota: what is known and future perspectives.,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a heterogeneous condition definable as the intermediate clinical state between normal aging and dementia. As a pre-dementia condition, there is a recent growing interest in the identification of non-invasive markers able to predict the progression from MCI to a more advanced stage of the disease. Previous evidence showed the close link between gut microbiota and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Conversely, the actual relationship between gut microbiota and MCI is yet to be clarified. In this work, we provide an overview about the current knowledge regarding the role of gut microbiota in the context of MCI, also assessing the potential for microbiota-targeted therapies. Through the review of the most recent studies focusing on this topic, we found evidence of an increase of Bacteroidetes at phylum level and Bacteroides at genus level in MCI subjects with respect to healthy controls and patients with AD. Despite such initial evidence, the definitive identification of a typical microbiota profile associated with MCI is still far from being achieved. These preliminary results, however, are growingly encouraging research on the role of gut microbiota modulation in improving the cognitive status of pre-dementia subjects. To date, few studies evaluated the role of probiotics in MCI subjects, and they showed favorable results, although still biased by small sample size, heterogeneity of study design and short follow-up.",Frontiers in medicine,2024,Antonella Gallo; Anna Maria Martone; Rosa Liperoti; Maria Camilla Cipriani; Francesca Ibba; Sara Camilli; Fiammetta Maria Rognoni; Francesco Landi; Massimo Montalto
38773112,Meta-analysis of shotgun sequencing of gut microbiota in Parkinson's disease.,"We aimed to identify gut microbial features in Parkinson's disease (PD) across countries by meta-analyzing our fecal shotgun sequencing dataset of 94 PD patients and 73 controls in Japan with five previously reported datasets from USA, Germany, China1, China2, and Taiwan. GC-MS and LC-MS/MS assays were established to quantify fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and fecal polyamines, respectively. α-Diversity was increased in PD across six datasets. Taxonomic analysis showed that species Akkermansia muciniphila was increased in PD, while species Roseburia intestinalis and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were decreased in PD. Pathway analysis showed that genes in the biosyntheses of riboflavin and biotin were markedly decreased in PD after adjusting for confounding factors. Five out of six categories in carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) were decreased in PD. Metabolomic analysis of our fecal samples revealed that fecal SCFAs and polyamines were significantly decreased in PD. Genes in the riboflavin and biotin biosyntheses were positively correlated with the fecal concentrations of SCFAs and polyamines. Bacteria that accounted for the decreased riboflavin biosynthesis in Japan, the USA, and Germany were different from those in China1, China2, and Taiwan. Similarly, different bacteria accounted for decreased biotin biosynthesis in the two country groups. We postulate that decreased SCFAs and polyamines reduce the intestinal mucus layer, which subsequently facilitates the formation of abnormal α-synuclein fibrils in the intestinal neural plexus in PD, and also cause neuroinflammation in PD.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2024,Hiroshi Nishiwaki; Jun Ueyama; Mikako Ito; Tomonari Hamaguchi; Keiichi Takimoto; Tetsuya Maeda; Kenichi Kashihara; Yoshio Tsuboi; Hiroshi Mori; Ken Kurokawa; Masahisa Katsuno; Masaaki Hirayama; Kinji Ohno
39377830,Gut-Brain Axis and Neuroinflammation: The Role of Gut Permeability and the Kynurenine Pathway in Neurological Disorders.,"The increasing prevalence of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and multiple sclerosis presents a significant global health challenge. Despite extensive research, the precise mechanisms underlying these conditions remain elusive, with current treatments primarily addressing symptoms rather than root causes. Emerging evidence suggests that gut permeability and the kynurenine pathway are involved in the pathogenesis of these neurological conditions, offering promising targets for novel therapeutic and preventive strategies. Gut permeability refers to the intestinal lining's ability to selectively allow essential nutrients into the bloodstream while blocking harmful substances. Various factors, including poor diet, stress, infections, and genetic predispositions, can compromise gut integrity, leading to increased permeability. This condition facilitates the translocation of toxins and bacteria into systemic circulation, triggering widespread inflammation that impacts neurological health via the gut-brain axis. The gut-brain axis (GBA) is a complex communication network between the gut and the central nervous system. Dysbiosis, an imbalance in the gut microbiota, can increase gut permeability and systemic inflammation, exacerbating neuroinflammation-a key factor in neurological disorders. The kynurenine pathway, the primary route for tryptophan metabolism, is significantly implicated in this process. Dysregulation of the kynurenine pathway in the context of inflammation leads to the production of neurotoxic metabolites, such as quinolinic acid, which contribute to neuronal damage and the progression of neurological disorders. This narrative review highlights the potential and progress in understanding these mechanisms. Interventions targeting the kynurenine pathway and maintaining a balanced gut microbiota through diet, probiotics, and lifestyle modifications show promise in reducing neuroinflammation and supporting brain health. In addition, pharmacological approaches aimed at modulating the kynurenine pathway directly, such as inhibitors of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, offer potential avenues for new treatments. Understanding and targeting these interconnected pathways are crucial for developing effective strategies to prevent and manage neurological disorders.",Cellular and molecular neurobiology,2024,Rowan Kearns
39071627,Gut-brain axis: A cutting-edge approach to target neurological disorders and potential synbiotic application.,"The microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) represents a sophisticated communication network between the brain and the gut, involving immunological, endocrinological, and neural mediators. This bidirectional interaction is facilitated through the vagus nerve, sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers, and is regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Evidence shows that alterations in gut microbiota composition, or dysbiosis, significantly impact neurological disorders (NDs) like anxiety, depression, autism, Parkinson's disease (PD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Dysbiosis can affect the central nervous system (CNS) via neuroinflammation and microglial activation, highlighting the importance of the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) in disease pathogenesis. The microbiota influences the immune system by modulating chemokines and cytokines, impacting neuronal health. Synbiotics have shown promise in treating NDs by enhancing cognitive function and reducing inflammation. The gut microbiota's role in producing neurotransmitters and neuroactive compounds, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), is critical for CNS homeostasis. Therapeutic interventions targeting the MGBA, including dietary modulation and synbiotic supplementation, offer potential benefits for managing neurodegenerative disorders. However, more in-depth clinical studies are necessary to fully understand and harness the therapeutic potential of the MGBA in neurological health and disease.",Heliyon,2024,Sumel Ashique; Sourav Mohanto; Mohammed Gulzar Ahmed; Neeraj Mishra; Ashish Garg; Dinesh Kumar Chellappan; Timothy Omara; Shabnoor Iqbal; Ivan Kahwa
39449004,Gut-first Parkinson's disease is encoded by gut dysbiome.,"In Parkinson's patients, intestinal dysbiosis can occur years before clinical diagnosis, implicating the gut and its microbiota in the disease. Recent evidence suggests the gut microbiota may trigger body-first Parkinson Disease (PD), yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aims to elucidate how a dysbiotic microbiome through intestinal immune alterations triggers PD-related neurodegeneration.To determine the impact of gut dysbiosis on the development and progression of PD pathology, wild-type male C57BL/6 mice were transplanted with fecal material from PD patients and age-matched healthy donors to challenge the gut-immune-brain axis.This study demonstrates that patient-derived intestinal microbiota caused midbrain tyrosine hydroxylase positive (TH +) cell loss and motor dysfunction. Ileum-associated microbiota remodeling correlates with a decrease in Th17 homeostatic cells. This event led to an increase in gut inflammation and intestinal barrier disruption. In this regard, we found a decrease in CD4 + cells and an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines in the blood of PD transplanted mice that could contribute to an increase in the permeabilization of the blood-brain-barrier, observed by an increase in mesencephalic Ig-G-positive microvascular leaks and by an increase of mesencephalic IL-17 levels, compatible with systemic inflammation. Furthermore, alpha-synuclein aggregates can spread caudo-rostrally, causing fragmentation of neuronal mitochondria. This mitochondrial damage subsequently activates innate immune responses in neurons and triggers microglial activation.We propose that the dysbiotic gut microbiome (dysbiome) in PD can disrupt a healthy microbiome and Th17 homeostatic immunity in the ileum mucosa, leading to a cascade effect that propagates to the brain, ultimately contributing to PD pathophysiology. Our landmark study has successfully identified new peripheral biomarkers that could be used to develop highly effective strategies to prevent the progression of PD into the brain.",Molecular neurodegeneration,2024,Mário F Munoz-Pinto; Emanuel Candeias; Inês Melo-Marques; A Raquel Esteves; Ana Maranha; João D Magalhães; Diogo Reis Carneiro; Mariana Sant'Anna; A Raquel Pereira-Santos; António E Abreu; Daniela Nunes-Costa; Susana Alarico; Igor Tiago; Ana Morgadinho; João Lemos; Pedro N Figueiredo; Cristina Januário; Nuno Empadinhas; Sandra Morais Cardoso
36200211,Targeting Gut Dysbiosis and Microbiome Metabolites for the Development of Therapeutic Modalities for Neurological Disorders.,"The gut microbiota, composed of numerous species of microbes, works in synergy with the various organ systems in the body to bolster our overall health and well-being. The most well-known function of the gut microbiome is to facilitate the metabolism and absorption of crucial nutrients, such as complex carbohydrates, while also generating vitamins. In addition, the gut microbiome plays a crucial role in regulating the functioning of the central nervous system (CNS). Host genetics, including specific genes and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), have been implicated in the pathophysiology of neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The gut microbiome dysbiosis also plays a role in the pathogenesis of these neurodegenerative disorders, thus perturbing the gut-brain axis. Overproduction of certain metabolites synthesized by the gut microbiome, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and p-cresyl sulfate, are known to interfere with microglial function and trigger misfolding of alpha-synuclein protein, which can build up inside neurons and cause damage. By determining the association of the gut microbiome and its metabolites with various diseases, such as neurological disorders, future research will pave the way for the development of effective preventive and treatment modalities.",Current neuropharmacology,2024,Matthew D Wiefels; Emily Furar; Rebecca S Eshraghi; Jeenu Mittal; Idil Memis; Moeed Moosa; Rahul Mittal; Adrien A Eshraghi
38265387,"Bridging the Mind and Gut: Uncovering the Intricacies of Neurotransmitters, Neuropeptides, and their Influence on Neuropsychiatric Disorders.","The gut-brain axis (GBA) is a bidirectional signaling channel that facilitates communication between the gastrointestinal tract and the brain. Recent research on the gut-brain axis demonstrates that this connection enables the brain to influence gut function, which in turn influences the brain and its cognitive functioning. It is well established that malfunctioning of this axis adversely affects both systems' ability to operate effectively.Dysfunctions in the GBA have been associated with disorders of gut motility and permeability, intestinal inflammation, indigestion, constipation, diarrhea, IBS, and IBD, as well as neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders like depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, autism, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease. Multiple research initiatives have shown that the gut microbiota, in particular, plays a crucial role in the GBA by participating in the regulation of a number of key neurochemicals that are known to have significant effects on the mental and physical well-being of an individual.Several studies have investigated the relationship between neuropsychiatric disorders and imbalances or disturbances in the metabolism of neurochemicals, often leading to concomitant gastrointestinal issues and modifications in gut flora composition. The interaction between neurological diseases and gut microbiota has been a focal point within this research. The novel therapeutic interventions in neuropsychiatric conditions involving interventions such as probiotics, prebiotics, and dietary modifications are outlined in this review.The findings of multiple studies carried out on mice show that modulating and monitoring gut microbiota can help treat symptoms of such diseases, which raises the possibility of the use of probiotics, prebiotics, and even dietary changes as part of a new treatment strategy for neuropsychiatric disorders and their symptoms.The bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain through the gut-brain axis has revealed profound implications for both gastrointestinal and neurological health. Malfunctions in this axis have been connected to a range of disorders affecting gut function as well as cognitive and neuropsychiatric well-being. The emerging understanding of the role of gut microbiota in regulating key neurochemicals opens up possibilities for novel treatment approaches for conditions like depression, anxiety, and neurodegenerative diseases.",Central nervous system agents in medicinal chemistry,2024,Saumya Gupta; Susha Dinesh; Sameer Sharma
38965287,A neurotherapeutic approach with Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus E9 on gut microbiota and intestinal barrier in MPTP-induced mouse model of Parkinson's disease.,"The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in neural development and progression of neural disorders like Parkinson's disease (PD). Probiotics have been suggested to impact neurodegenerative diseases via gut-brain axis. This study aims to investigate the therapeutic potential of Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus E9, a high exopolysaccharide producer, on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine(MPTP)-induced mouse model of PD. C57BL/6 mice subjected to MPTP were fed L. rhamnosus E9 for fifteen days and sacrificed after the last administration. Motor functions were determined by open-field, catalepsy, and wire-hanging tests. The ileum and the brain tissues were collected for ELISA, qPCR, and immunohistochemistry analyses. The cecum content was obtained for microbiota analysis. E9 supplementation alleviated MPTP-induced motor dysfunctions accompanied by decreased levels of striatal TH and dopamine. E9 also reduced the level of ROS in the striatum and decreased the DAT expression while increasing the DR1. Furthermore, E9 improved intestinal integrity by enhancing ZO-1 and Occludin levels and reversed the dysbiosis of the gut microbiota induced by MPTP. In conclusion, E9 supplementation improved the MPTP-induced motor deficits and neural damage as well as intestinal barrier by modulating the gut microbiota in PD mice. These findings suggest that E9 supplementation holds therapeutic potential in managing PD through the gut-brain axis.",Scientific reports,2024,Busra Aktas; Belma Aslim; Deniz Ates Ozdemir
39042202,Semaglutide Attenuates Anxious and Depressive-Like Behaviors and Reverses the Cognitive Impairment in a Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Mouse Model Via the Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis.,"Newly conducted research suggests that metabolic disorders, like diabetes and obesity, play a significant role as risk factors for psychiatric disorders. This connection presents a potential avenue for creating novel antidepressant medications by repurposing drugs originally developed to address antidiabetic conditions. Earlier investigations have shown that GLP-1 (Glucagon-like Peptide-1) analogs exhibit neuroprotective qualities in various models of neurological diseases, encompassing conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and stroke. Moreover, GLP-1 analogs have demonstrated the capability to enhance neurogenesis, a process recognized for its significance in memory formation and the cognitive and emotional aspects of information processing. Nonetheless, whether semaglutide holds efficacy as both an antidepressant and anxiolytic agent remains uncertain. To address this, our study focused on a mouse model of depression linked to type 2 diabetes induced by a High Fat Diet (HFD). In this model, we administered semaglutide (0.05 mg/Kg intraperitoneally) on a weekly basis to evaluate its potential as a therapeutic option for depression and anxiety. Diabetic mice had higher blood glucose, lipidic profile, and insulin resistance. Moreover, mice fed HFD showed higher serum interleukin (IL)-1β and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) associated with impaired humor and cognition. The analysis of behavioral responses revealed that the administration of semaglutide effectively mitigated depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors, concurrently demonstrating an enhancement in cognitive function. Additionally, semaglutide treatment protected synaptic plasticity and reversed the hippocampal neuroinflammation induced by HFD fed, improving activation of the insulin pathway, demonstrating the protective effects of semaglutide. We also found that semaglutide treatment decreased astrogliosis and microgliosis in the dentate gyrus region of the hippocampus. In addition, semaglutide prevented the DM2-induced impairments of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), and G-protein-coupled receptor 43 (GPR43) and simultaneously increased the NeuN + and Glucagon-like Peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R+) neurons in the hippocampus. Our data also showed that semaglutide increased the serotonin (5-HT) and serotonin transporter (5-HTT) and glutamatergic receptors in the hippocampus. At last, semaglutide changed the gut microbiota profile (increasing Bacterioidetes, Bacteroides acidifaciens, and Blautia coccoides) and decreased leaky gut, improving the gut-brain axis. Taken together, semaglutide has the potential to act as a therapeutic tool for depression and anxiety.",Journal of neuroimmune pharmacology : the official journal of the Society on NeuroImmune Pharmacology,2024,Igor Henrique Rodrigues de Paiva; Rodrigo Soares da Silva; Ingrid Prata Mendonça; José Roberto Botelho de Souza; Christina Alves Peixoto
39189380,"Allantoin ameliorates dopaminergic neuronal damage in MPTP-induced Parkinson's disease mice <i>via</i> regulating oxidative damage, inflammation, and gut microbiota disorder.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic progressive neurodegenerative disease that often occurs in older people. Neuroinflammation and oxidative stress are important factors in the development of PD. Gastrointestinal dysfunction is the most common non-motor symptom, and inflammation of the gut, which activates the gut-brain axis, maybe a pathogenic factor. Previous studies have attributed anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects to Allantoin, but its function and mechanism of action in PD are unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effect and mechanism of Allantoin on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD in mice. Our results showed that Allantoin administration ameliorated motor dysfunction and neuronal damage in mice injected with MPTP by inhibiting neuroinflammation and oxidative damage. Mechanistic studies showed that Allantoin suppresses inflammatory responses by inhibiting the overactivation of the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways, as well as oxidative stress by regulating the AKT/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. Notably, Allantoin also restored intestinal barrier function by modulating the gut microbiota and improving antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacities to alleviate MPTP-induced motor deficits. In conclusion, the present study shows that the administration of Allantoin attenuated neurodegeneration in mice injected with MPTP by inhibiting neuroinflammation and oxidative stress and modulating the composition of the gut microbiome.",Food & function,2024,Shuo Yang; Xiaojia Sun; Dianfeng Liu; Yiming Zhang; Xiyu Gao; Jiangmei He; Mingchi Cui; Shoupeng Fu; Dewei He

39070266,Gut microbiota from patients with Parkinson's disease causes motor deficits in honeybees.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is possibly caused by genetic factors, environmental factors, and gut microbiota dysbiosis. This study aims to explore whether the microbiota contributes to the behavior abnormalities of PD.We transplanted gut microbiota from patients with PD or healthy controls (HC) into microbiota-free honeybees. We also established two more groups, namely the rotenone (ROT) group, in which PD-like symptoms of honeybees were induced by rotenone, and the conventional (CV) group, in which honeybees were colonized with conventional gut microbiota. The climbing assay was performed to assess the motor capabilities of honeybees. Histopathological examination was conducted to evaluate the integrity of gut mucosa. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene expression levels and dopamine (DA) concentrations in the brain were also examined. Additionally, metagenomics and full-length 16S rRNA analyses were performed to identify alterations in gut microbiota profiles, both in PD patients and honeybees.Honeybees in the PD and ROT groups exhibited slower climbing speeds, downregulated TH gene expression, and impaired gut barriers. Both the HC and PD groups of honeybees successfully harbored a portion of gut microbiota from corresponding human donors, and differences in microbial composition were identified. <i>Morganella morganii</i> and <i>Erysipelatoclostridium ramosum</i> exhibited significantly increased relative abundance in the HC group, while <i>Dorea longicatena</i>, <i>Collinsella aerofaciens</i>, <i>Lactococcus garvieae</i>, <i>Holdemanella biformis</i>, <i>Gemmiger formicilis</i>, and <i>Blautia obeum</i> showed significantly increased relative abundance in the PD group. Functional predictions of microbial communities in the PD group indicated an increased synthesis of hydrogen sulfide and methane.A novel PD model was induced in honeybees with rotenone and gut microbiota from PD patients. This study linked PD-related behaviors to altered gut microbiota, highlighting a potential gut microbiota-brain axis involvement in PD pathogenesis. We identify previously unrecognized associations of <i>Dorea longicatena</i>, <i>Collinsella aerofaciens</i>, <i>Lactococcus garvieae</i>, <i>Holdemanella biformis</i>, <i>Gemmiger formicilis</i>, and <i>Blautia obeum</i> with PD. Additionally, pathways related to hydrogen sulfide and methane synthesis have been previously suggested as potential contributors to the development of PD, and our research further supports this hypothesis.",Frontiers in microbiology,2024,Jiaqi Zeng; Yiyuan Li; Jingshuang Yan; Ruqi Chang; Mengqi Xu; Guanzhou Zhou; Jie Meng; Di Liu; Zhiqi Mao; Yunsheng Yang
39065820,Sika Deer Velvet Antler Peptide Exerts Neuroprotective Effect in a Parkinson's Disease Model via Regulating Oxidative Damage and Gut Microbiota.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder globally. Recognizing the potential of velvet antler in the nervous system, as shown in numerous studies, this research was aimed at evaluating the neuroprotective effects of Sika Deer velvet antler peptide (VAP), along with the underlying mechanisms in neurotoxin-induced PD models. Initially, a peptidomic analysis of the VAP, which comprised 189 varieties of peptides, was conducted using LC-MS. Nine sequences were identified as significant using Proteome Discoverer 2.5 software. In a cellular model of PD, where PC12 cells are treated with the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP<sup>+</sup>), the administration of the VAP reduced the cell damage and apoptosis induced by MPP<sup>+</sup>. This protective effect was associated with a decrease in oxidative stress. This protective mechanism was found to be mediated through the activation of the SIRT1-dependent Akt/Nrf2/HO-1-signaling pathway. In animal models, specifically in mice with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD, the administration of the VAP effectively reduced the dopaminergic neuron damage and reversed the neurobehavioral deficits. They also diminished microglia activation and apoptosis, all without any noticeable adverse effects. Additionally, the VAP was observed to beneficially alter the gut microbiota, as marked by an increase in the abundances of <i>Prevotellaceae</i>, <i>Helicobacteraceae</i>, and <i>Prevotella</i>. These findings suggest that VAP exerts its neuroprotective effect against neurodegeneration by inhibiting oxidative stress and modulating gut microbiota.","Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)",2024,Ying Liu; Hongyuan Li; Min Yang; Jia Guo; Zepeng Sun; Shuyue Wang; Ru Li; Xin Pang; Yumi Kim; Xiaohui Wang; Yinghua Peng

Using interpretable machine learning and differential abundance analysis, our findings reinforce the generalization of binary classifiers for Crohn's disease (CD) and colorectal cancer (CRC) to hold-out cohorts and highlight the key microbes driving these classifications. We identified high microbial similarity in disease pairs like CD vs ulcerative colitis (UC), CD vs CRC, Parkinson's disease vs type 2 diabetes (T2D), and schizophrenia vs T2D. We also found strong inverse correlations in Alzheimer's disease vs CD and UC. These findings, detected by our pipeline, provide valuable insights into these diseases.Assessing disease similarity is an essential initial step preceding a disease-based approach for drug repositioning. Our study provides a modest first step in underscoring the potential of integrating microbiome insights into the disease similarity assessment. Recent microbiome research has predominantly focused on analyzing individual diseases to understand their unique characteristics, which by design excludes comorbidities in individuals. We analyzed shotgun metagenomic data from existing studies and identified previously unknown similarities between diseases. Our research represents a pioneering effort that utilizes both interpretable machine learning and differential abundance analysis to assess microbial similarity between diseases.",mSystems,2024,Dong-Min Jin; James T Morton; Richard Bonneau
38450172,Electroacupuncture at ST25 corrected gut microbial dysbiosis and SNpc lipid peroxidation in Parkinson's disease rats.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) remains one kind of a complex, progressive neurodegenerative disease. Levodopa and dopamine agonists as widely utilized PD therapeutics have not shown significant positive long-term outcomes. Emerging evidences indicate that electroacupuncture (EA) have potential effects on the therapy of nervous system disorders, particularly PD, but its specific underlying mechanism(s) remains poorly understood, leading to the great challenge of clinical application and management. Previous study has shown that acupuncture ameliorates PD motor symptoms and dopaminergic neuron damage by modulating intestinal dysbiosis, but its intermediate pathway has not been sufficiently investigated.A rat model of PD was induced using rotenone. The therapeutic effect of EA on PD was assessed using the pole and rotarod tests and immunohistostaining for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the substantia nigra (SN) of brain. The role of gut microbiota was explored using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metabonomic analysis. PICRUSt2 analysis, lipidomic analysis, LPS and inflammatory factor assays were used for subsequent exploration and validation. Correlation analysis was used to identify the key bacteria that EA regulates lipid metabolism to improve PD.The present study firstly reappeared the effects of EA on protecting motor function and dopaminergic neurons and modulation of gut microbial dysbiosis in rotenone-induced PD rat model. EA improved motor dysfunction (via the pole and rotarod tests) and protected TH+ neurons in PD rats. EA increased the abundance of beneficial bacteria such as Lactobacillus, Dubosiella and Bifidobacterium and decreased the abundance of Escherichia-Shigella and Morganella belonging to Pseudomonadota, suggesting that the modulation of gut microbiota by EA improving the symptoms of PD motility via alleviating LPS-induced inflammatory response and oxidative stress, which was also validated by various aspects such as microbial gene functional analysis, fecal metabolomics analysis, LPS and inflammatory factor assays and SNpc lipidomics analysis. Moreover, correlation analyses also verified strong correlations of Escherichia-Shigella and Morganella with motor symptoms and SNpc lipid peroxidation, explicating targets and intermediate pathways through which EA improve PD exercise symptom.Our results indicate that the improvement of motor function in PD model by EA may be mediated in part by restoring the gut microbiota, which intermediate processes involve circulating endotoxins and inflammatory mediators, SNpc oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. The gut-microbiome - brain axis may be a potential mechanism of EA treatment for the PD.",Frontiers in microbiology,2024,Xuan-Ming Hu; Li-Zhe-Xiong Song; Zhi-Zi Zhang; Xi Ruan; Hai-Chang Li; Zhi Yu; Lin Huang
39417117,Toxic Metals Impact Gut Microbiota and Metabolic Risk in Five African-Origin Populations.,"Exposure to toxic metals impacts obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) risk. Yet, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Gut microbiota has been strongly associated with progression of cardiometabolic risk. To determine whether high metal exposures and gut dysbiosis interact to promote metabolic dysregulation and cardiometabolic risk, we assessed relationships between these factors. We analyzed cross-sectional associations between arsenic, lead, mercury, cadmium, and cardiometabolic health markers in 178 randomly selected African-origin adults (52% female, 51% obese, mean age=43.0±6.4 years) from Ghana, South Africa, Seychelles, Jamaica, and USA. Metal levels were dichotomized to high or low at the median level of each metal. We analyzed associations between gut microbiome taxa, metal levels, clinical measures (BMI, fasting blood glucose, and blood pressure) and diagnoses (hypertension, obesity, and diabetes status). High vs. low lead and arsenic exposures had a significant effect on beta diversity (p <0.05). 71 taxa were associated with high lead levels: 30 with elevated BMI, 22 with T2DM, and 23 with elevated fasting blood glucose (p<0.05). 115 taxa were associated with high arsenic levels: 32 with elevated BMI, 33 with T2DM, and 26 with elevated blood glucose (p<0.05). Of the taxa associated with high lead and arsenic exposure and either elevated BMI or fasting blood glucose, porphyrin metabolism was the most enriched metabolic pathway. These data collectively provide the first findings in a human study that the gut microbiome may drive the association between lead and arsenic exposure and obesity and T2DM risk.",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,2024,Julianne A Jorgensen; Candice Choo-Kang; Luyu Wang; Lina Issa; Jack A Gilbert; Gertrude Ecklu-Mensah; Amy Luke; Kweku Bedu-Addo; Terrence Forrester; Pascal Bovet; Estelle V Lambert; Dale Rae; Maria Argos; Tanika N Kelly; Robert M Sargis; Lara R Dugas; Yang Dai; Brian T Layden

Technological advancements in high-throughput sequencing and multi-omics have unveiled significant alterations in gut microbiota and their metabolites in various neurological disorders. This review provides a thorough analysis of the role of microbiome-gut-brain axis in neurodegenerative disease pathology, linking it to reduced age-associated proteostasis. We discuss evidences that substantiate the existence of a gut-brain cross talk ranging from early clinical accounts of James Parkinson to Braak's hypothesis. In addition to understanding of microbes, the review particularly entails specific metabolites which are altered in neurodegenerative diseases. The regulatory effects of microbial metabolites on protein clearance mechanisms, proposing their potential therapeutic implications, are also discussed. By integrating this information, we advocate for a combinatory therapeutic strategy that targets early intervention, aiming to restore proteostasis and ameliorate disease progression. This approach not only provides a new perspective on the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases but also highlights innovative strategies to combat the increasing burden of these age-related disorders.",Ageing research reviews,2024,Mahmood Akbar; Pranoy Toppo; Aamir Nazir
38898687,Gut Microbiota Metabolite Messengers in Brain Function and Pathology at a View of Cell Type-Based Receptor and Enzyme Reaction.,"The human gastrointestinal (GI) tract houses a diverse microbial community, known as the gut microbiome comprising bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa. The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in maintaining the body's equilibrium and has recently been discovered to influence the functioning of the central nervous system (CNS). The communication between the nervous system and the GI tract occurs through a two-way network called the gut-brain axis. The nervous system and the GI tract can modulate each other through activated neuronal cells, the immune system, and metabolites produced by the gut microbiome. Extensive research both in preclinical and clinical realms, has highlighted the complex relationship between the gut and diseases associated with the CNS, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This review aims to delineate receptor and target enzymes linked with gut microbiota metabolites and explore their specific roles within the brain, particularly their impact on CNS-related diseases.",Biomolecules & therapeutics,2024,Bada Lee; Soo Min Lee; Jae Won Song; Jin Woo Choi
38774094,Electroacupuncture blocked motor dysfunction and gut barrier damage by modulating intestinal NLRP3 inflammasome in MPTP-induced Parkinson's disease mice.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder commonly accompanied by gut dysfunction. EA has shown anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. Here, we aim to explore whether EA can treat Parkinson's disease by restoring the intestinal barrier and modulating NLRP3 inflammasome. We applied 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to establish a PD mouse model and EA at the GV16, LR3, and ST36 for 12 consecutive days. The open-field test results indicated that EA alleviated depression and behavioral defects, upregulated the expressions of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and blocked the accumulation of α-synuclein (α-syn) in the midbrain. Moreover, EA blocked the damage to intestinal tissues of PD mice, indicative of suppressed NLRP3 inflammasome activation and increased gut barrier integrity. Notably, the antibiotic-treated mouse experiment validated that the gut microbiota was critical in alleviating PD dyskinesia and intestinal inflammation by EA. In conclusion, this study suggested that EA exhibited a protective effect against MPTP-induced PD by alleviating behavioral defects, reversing the block of motor dysfunction, and improving the gut barrier by modulating intestinal NLRP3 inflammasome. Above all, this study could provide novel insights into the pathogenesis and therapy of PD.",Heliyon,2024,Lei Guo; Haiming Hu; Nan Jiang; Huabing Yang; Xiongjie Sun; Hui Xia; Jun Ma; Hongtao Liu
38447734,Melatonin mitigates manganese-induced neural damage via modulation of gut microbiota-metabolism in mice.,"Manganese (Mn), a common environmental and occupational risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD), can cause central nervous system damage and gastrointestinal dysfunction. The melatonin has been shown to effectively improve neural damage and intestinal microbiota disturbances in animal models. This research investigated the mechanism by which exogenous melatonin prevented Mn-induced neurogenesis impairment and neural damage. Here, we established subchronic Mn-exposed mice model and melatonin supplement tests to evaluate the role of melatonin in alleviating Mn-induced neurogenesis impairment. Mn induced neurogenesis impairment and microglia overactivation, behavioral dysfunction, gut microbiota dysbiosis and serum metabolic disorder in mice. All these events were reversed with the melatonin supplement. The behavioral tests revealed that melatonin group showed approximately 30 % restoration of motor activity. According to quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) results, melatonin group showed remarkable restoration of the expression of dopamine neurons and neurogenesis markers, approximately 46.4 % (TH), 68.4 % (DCX in hippocampus) and 48 % (DCX in striatum), respectively. Interestingly, melatonin increased neurogenesis probably via the gut microbiota and metabolism modulation. The correlation analysis of differentially expressed genes associated with hippocampal neurogenesis indicated that Firmicutes-lipid metabolism might mediate the critical repair role of melatonin in neurogenesis in Mn-exposed mice. In conclusion, exogenous melatonin supplementation can promote neurogenesis, and restore neuron loss and neural function in Mn-exposed mice, and the multi-omics results provide new research ideas for future mechanistic studies.",The Science of the total environment,2024,Weifeng He; Xueting Wang; Xin Yang; Gaoman Zhang; Junrou Zhang; Li Chen; Piye Niu; Tian Chen

The gut microbiota could play a crucial role in PD development by modulating the human immune system.This study aims to explore the relationship between gut microbiota and PD, focusing on how immune characteristics may both directly and indirectly influence their interaction.Utilizing cumulative data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), our research conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to clarify the association between the gut microbiome and PD. Additionally, by employing a two-step MR approach, we assessed the impact of gut microbiota on PD development via immune characteristics and quantified HLA-DR mediation effect on plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs).We discovered significant associations between PD and microbiota, comprising one class, one order, two families, and two genera. Furthermore, we explored the extent to which HLA-DR on pDCs mediates the effect of Butyrivibrio gut microbiota on PD.Our study emphasizes the complex interactions between the gut microbiota, immune characteristics, and PD.

39173756,Fecal microbiome transplantation alleviates manganese-induced neurotoxicity by altering the composition and function of the gut microbiota via the cGAS-STING/NLRP3 pathway.,"Manganese (Mn) is an environmental pollutant, and overexposure can cause neurodegenerative disorders similar to Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease that are characterized by β-amyloid (Aβ) overexpression, Tau hyperphosphorylation and neuroinflammation. However, the mechanisms of Mn neurotoxicity are not clearly defined. In our study, a knockout mouse model of Mn exposure combined with gut flora-induced neurotoxicity was constructed to investigate the effect of gut flora on Mn neurotoxicity. The results showed that the levels of Tau, p-Tau and Aβ in the hippocampus of C57BL/6 mice were greater than those in the hippocampus of control mice after 5 weeks of continuous exposure to manganese chloride (Mn content of 200 mg/L). Transplanted normal and healthy fecal microbiota from mice significantly downregulated Tau, p-Tau and Aβ expression and ameliorated brain pathology. Moreover, Mn exposure activated the cGAS-STING pathway and altered the cecal microbiota profile, characterized by an increase in Clostridiales, Pseudoflavonifractor, Ligilactobacillus and Desulfovibrio, and a decrease in Anaerotruncus, Eubacterium_ruminantium_group, Fusimonas and Firmicutes, While fecal microbiome transplantation (FMT) treatment inhibited this pathway and restored the microbiota profile. FMT alleviated Mn exposure-induced neurotoxicity by inhibiting activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome triggered by overactivation of the cGAS-STING pathway. Deletion of the cGAS and STING genes and FMT altered the gut microbiota composition and its predictive function. Phenotypic prediction revealed that FMT markedly decreased the abundances of anaerobic and stress-tolerant bacteria and significantly increased the abundances of facultative anaerobic bacteria and biofilm-forming bacteria after blocking the cGAS-STING pathway compared to the Mn-exposed group. FMT from normal and healthy mice ameliorated the neurotoxicity of Mn exposure, possibly through alterations in the composition and function of the microbiome associated with the cGAS-STING/NLRP3 pathway. This study provides a prospective direction for future research on the mechanism of Mn neurotoxicity.",The Science of the total environment,2024,Jingjing Liu; Zhimin Zhang; Shiyin Zhong; Xin Zhang; Jirui Yang; Qiongli Zhou; Diya Wang; Xuhong Chang; Hui Wang
39043489,Evolving insights into erythrocytes in synucleinopathies.,"Synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple system atrophy (MSA), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), are characterized by neuronal loss accompanied by α-synuclein (α-syn) accumulation in the brain. While research conventionally focused on brain pathology, there is growing interest in peripheral alterations. Erythrocytes, which are rich in α-syn, have emerged as a compelling site for synucleinopathies-related alterations. Erythrocyte-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs), containing pathological α-syn species, can traverse the blood-brain barrier (BBB) under certain conditions and the gastrointestinal tract, where α-syn and gut microbiota interact extensively. This review explores the accumulating evidence of erythrocyte involvement in synucleinopathies, as well as their potential in disease pathogenesis and diagnosis. Given their unique properties, erythrocytes and erythrocyte-derived EVs may also serve as an ideal therapeutic platform for treating synucleinopathies and beyond.",Trends in neurosciences,2024,Ying Yang; Xiaoqian Nie; Yajie Wang; Jie Sun; Xiaofei Gao; Jing Zhang
38399728,Changes in Bacterial Gut Composition in Parkinson's Disease and Their Metabolic Contribution to Disease Development: A Gut Community Reconstruction Approach.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disease with the major symptoms comprising loss of movement coordination (motor dysfunction) and non-motor dysfunction, including gastrointestinal symptoms. Alterations in the gut microbiota composition have been reported in PD patients vs. controls. However, it is still unclear how these compositional changes contribute to disease etiology and progression. Furthermore, most of the available studies have focused on European, Asian, and North American cohorts, but the microbiomes of PD patients in Latin America have not been characterized. To address this problem, we obtained fecal samples from Colombian participants (<i>n</i> = 25 controls, <i>n</i> = 25 PD idiopathic cases) to characterize the taxonomical community changes during disease via 16S rRNA gene sequencing. An analysis of differential composition, diversity, and personalized computational modeling was carried out, given the fecal bacterial composition and diet of each participant. We found three metabolites that differed in dietary habits between PD patients and controls: carbohydrates, trans fatty acids, and potassium. We identified six genera that changed significantly in their relative abundance between PD patients and controls, belonging to the families <i>Lachnospiraceae</i>, <i>Lactobacillaceae</i>, <i>Verrucomicrobioaceae</i>, <i>Peptostreptococcaceae</i>, and <i>Streptococcaceae</i>. Furthermore, personalized metabolic modeling of the gut microbiome revealed changes in the predicted production of seven metabolites (Indole, tryptophan, fructose, phenylacetic acid, myristic acid, 3-Methyl-2-oxovaleric acid, and N-Acetylneuraminic acid). These metabolites are associated with the metabolism of aromatic amino acids and their consumption in the diet. Therefore, this research suggests that each individual's diet and intestinal composition could affect host metabolism. Furthermore, these findings open the door to the study of microbiome-host interactions and allow us to contribute to personalized medicine.",Microorganisms,2024,Johanna Forero-Rodríguez; Johannes Zimmermann; Jan Taubenheim; Natalia Arias-Rodríguez; Juan David Caicedo-Narvaez; Lena Best; Cindy V Mendieta; Julieth López-Castiblanco; Laura Alejandra Gómez-Muñoz; Janneth Gonzalez-Santos; Humberto Arboleda; William Fernandez; Christoph Kaleta; Andrés Pinzón
39155987,HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder: key implications of the microbiota-gut-brain axis.,"HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) is now recognized to be relatively common in people living with HIV (PLWH), and remains a common cause of cognitive impairment. Unfortunately, the fundamental pathogenic processes underlying this specific outcome of HIV infection have not as yet been fully elucidated. With increased interest in research related to the microbiota-gut-brain axis, the gut-brain axis has been shown to play critical roles in regulating central nervous system disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. PLWH are characterized by a particular affliction, referred to as gut-associated dysbiosis syndrome, which provokes an alteration in microbial composition and diversity, and of their associated metabolite composition within the gut. Interestingly, the gut microbiota has also been recognized as a key element, which both positively and negatively influences human brain health, including the functioning and development of the central nervous system (CNS). In this review, based on published evidence, we critically discuss the relevant interactions between the microbiota-gut-brain axis and the pathogenesis of HAND in the context of HIV infection. It is likely that HAND manifestation in PLWH mainly results from (i) gut-associated dysbiosis syndrome and a leaky gut on the one hand and (ii) inflammation on the other hand. In other words, the preceding features of HIV infection negatively alter the composition of the gut microbiota (microbes and their associated metabolites) and promote proinflammatory immune responses which singularly or in tandem damage neurons and/or induce inadequate neuronal signaling. Thus, HAND is fairly prevalent in PLWH. This work aims to demonstrate that in the quest to prevent and possibly treat HAND, the gut microbiota may ultimately represent a therapeutically targetable ""host factor.""",Frontiers in microbiology,2024,Aizhen Hu; Silvere D Zaongo; Vijay Harypursat; Xin Wang; Jing Ouyang; Yaokai Chen

These processes are integral to the development of PD. This article examines the potential therapeutic implications of SCFAs in the management of PD, encompassing their capacity to modulate gastrointestinal permeability, neuroinflammation, and neuronal survival, by conducting an extensive literature review.

38287859,The Neuroprotective Effects of Electroacupuncture on Parkinson's Disease and the Underlying Molecular Mechanisms.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease whose main pathological features are the degeneration of dopamine neurons and deposition of α-synuclein in neurons. At present, the most important treatment strategy for PD is drugs, and one of the most used drugs is levodopa. However, this therapy shows many problems, such as tolerance and long-term effects, so other treatment strategies need to be explored. As a traditional Chinese medicine treatment method with effective and few side effects, electroacupuncture is considered a non-drug therapy. It serves as a novel, promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of PD. In this review, the application and the effects of electroacupuncture on PD have been described. Besides, the underlying molecular mechanisms of electroacupuncture on PD that contribute to protecting dopaminergic neurons and reducing α-synuclein levels have been illustrated, including ① anti-oxidant stress response, ② anti-neuroinflammatory response, ③ up-regulation of neurotrophic factors and reduction of nerve cell apoptosis, ④ down-regulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress and improvement of mitochondrial function, ⑤ improvement of the function of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, ⑥ anti-excitatory toxicity response, ⑦ activation of autophagy, and ⑧ modulation of gut microbiota. Achieving a better understanding of the neuroprotective effects of electroacupuncture on PD will provide a theoretical basis and facilitate the application of electroacupuncture on PD.",Journal of integrative neuroscience,2024,Qiuqin Han; Peiqing Chen; Xiaorong Chen; Lijuan Wang; Renyan Huang; Wenhui Li; Guobin Liu

This review summarizes information on the basic mechanisms of gut-brain communication. We then discuss the roles of the gut microbiome as a neuroprotective factor in neurodegeneration. The gut microbiota is extremely important in maintaining the body's homeostasis, shaping the human immune system and the proper functioning of the brain. The intestinal microflora affects the processes of neuroplasticity, synaptogenesis, and neuronal regeneration. This review aims to explain changes in the composition of the bacterial population of the intestinal microflora among patients with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Abnormalities in gut microflora composition are also noted in stress, depression, or autism spectrum development. New observations on psychobiotic supplementation in alleviating the symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases are also presented.",AIMS neuroscience,2024,Mgr Natalia Białoń; Dr Hab N O Zdr Dariusz Górka; Mgr Mikołaj Górka
39408276,Oral Trehalose Intake Modulates the Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis and Is Neuroprotective in a Synucleinopathy Mouse Model.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal and gastrointestinal tracts, causing both motor and non-motor symptoms. This study examined the neuroprotective effects of trehalose. This sugar is confined in the gut due to the absence of transporters, so we hypothesized that trehalose might exert neuroprotective effects on PD through its action on the gut microbiota. We used a transgenic mouse model of PD (PrP-A53T G2-3) overexpressing human α-synuclein and developing GI dysfunctions. Mice were given water with trehalose, maltose, or sucrose (2% <i>w</i>/<i>v</i>) for 6.5 m. Trehalose administration prevented a reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the substantia nigra (-25%), striatum (-38%), and gut (-18%) in PrP-A53T mice. It also modulated the gut microbiota, reducing the loss of diversity seen in PrP-A53T mice and promoting bacteria negatively correlated with PD in patients. Additionally, trehalose treatment increased the intestinal secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) by 29%. Maltose and sucrose, which break down into glucose, did not show neuroprotective effects, suggesting glucose is not involved in trehalose-mediated neuroprotection. Since trehalose is unlikely to cross the intestinal barrier at the given dose, the results suggest its effects are mediated indirectly through the gut microbiota and GLP-1.",Nutrients,2024,Solène Pradeloux; Katherine Coulombe; Alexandre Jules Kennang Ouamba; Amandine Isenbrandt; Frédéric Calon; Denis Roy; Denis Soulet
38770370,"Iron toxicity, ferroptosis and microbiota in Parkinson's disease: Implications for novel targets.","Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Iron (Fe)-dependent programmed cell death known as ferroptosis, plays a crucial role in the etiology and progression of PD. Since SNpc is particularly vulnerable to Fe toxicity, a central role for ferroptosis in the etiology and progression of PD is envisioned. Ferroptosis, characterized by reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent accumulation of lipid peroxides, is tightly regulated by a variety of intracellular metabolic processes. Moreover, the recently characterized bi-directional interactions between ferroptosis and the gut microbiota, not only provides another window into the mechanistic underpinnings of PD but could also suggest novel interventions in this devastating disease. Here, following a brief discussion of PD, we focus on how our expanding knowledge of Fe-induced ferroptosis and its interaction with the gut microbiota may contribute to the pathophysiology of PD and how this knowledge may be exploited to provide novel interventions in PD.",Advances in neurotoxicology,2024,Fernanda Vidal Carvalho; Harold E Landis; Bruk Getachew; Victor Diogenes Amaral Silva; Paulo R Ribeiro; Michael Aschner; Yousef Tizabi
38311217,"Supplementation of probiotic Bifidobacterium breve Bif11 reverses neurobehavioural deficits, inflammatory changes and oxidative stress in Parkinson's disease model.","Human gut microbiota are thought to affect different physiological processes in the body, including brain functions. Gut dysbiosis has been linked to the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD) and thus, restoring the healthy gut microbiota with supplementation of putative probiotic strains can confer some benefits in PD. In the current study, we explored the neuroprotective potential of Bifidobacterium breve Bif11 supplementation in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine hydrochloride (MPTP) treated female Sprague Dawley rats. This study investigated the behavioural, molecular and biochemical parameters in the MPTP rat model. A pharmacological intervention of Bif11 at doses of 1 × 10<sup>10</sup> CFU and 2 × 10<sup>10</sup> CFU for 21 days was found to attenuate the cognitive and motor changes in the MPTP rat model. Furthermore, it also increased the tyrosine hydroxylase levels, reduced pro-inflammatory markers and decreased oxidative and nitrosative stress in the mid brain of MPTP-lesioned rats. Bif11 supplementation even restored the levels of short-chain fatty acids and decreased intestinal epithelial permeability in MPTP-induced PD model rats. In summary, these findings demonstrate that B. breve Bif11 has the potential to ameliorate symptoms of PD. However, this therapy needs to be further investigated with in-depth mechanistic insights in the future for the treatment of PD.",Neurochemistry international,2024,Sonali Valvaikar; Bhupesh Vaidya; Shikha Sharma; Mahendra Bishnoi; Kanthi Kiran Kondepudi; Shyam S Sharma

38554664,Association of intestinal inflammation and permeability markers with clinical manifestations of Parkinson's disease.,"Intestinal inflammation and gut microbiota dysbiosis can stimulate degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and development of Parkinson's disease (PD) via the gut-brain axis in certain patients.In a case-control study, fecal markers of intestinal inflammation and permeability were measured using the ELISA method in PD patients and healthy controls. Motor and nonmotor symptoms were assessed using the Movement Disorder Society (MDS) Unified PD Rating Scale, Hoehn & Yahr scale, MDS Non-Motor Symptom Scale, Scales for Outcomes in PD - Autonomic Dysfunction, PD Sleep Scale - 2, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Beck Depression Inventory-II. A correlation was established between the intestinal inflammation and permeability markers and PD symptoms.Higher levels of beta-defensin 2, zonulin and lactoferrin were recorded in PD patients compared to controls. Calprotectin and secretory immunoglobulin A showed no significant differences. Regression analysis indicated the roles of beta-defensin 2 and lactoferrin in predicting PD likelihood. Calprotectin yielded positive correlations with disease duration, depression, motor fluctuations, and gastrointestinal symptoms; beta defensin 2 with thermoregulation; and secretory immunoglobulin A with depression. Secretory immunoglobulin A showed negative correlation with age and age at disease onset, while zonulin showed negative correlation with the MDS Unified PD Rating Scale total score.Fecal markers differed in PD patients compared to controls and correlated with age, disease duration, and some nonmotor symptoms.

Fecal short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) changes in iRBD and the relationships with synucleinopathies have never been investigated.To investigate fecal SCFA changes among iRBD, multiple system atrophy (MSA), and Parkinson's disease (PD), and evaluate their relationships.Fecal SCFAs and gut microbiota were measured in 29 iRBD, 42 MSA, 40 PD, and 35 normal controls (NC) using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and 16S rRNA gene sequencing.Compared with NC, fecal SCFA levels (propionic, acetic, and butyric acid) were lower in iRBD, MSA, and PD. Combinations of these SCFAs could differentiate NC from iRBD (AUC 0.809), MSA (AUC 0.794), and PD (AUC 0.701). Decreased fecal SCFAs were associated with the common reducing SCFA-producing gut microbiota in iRBD, MSA, and PD.iRBD shares similar fecal SCFA alterations with MSA and PD, and the combination of these SCFAs might be a potential synucleinopathies-related biomarker. © 2024 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society,2024,Juanjuan Du; Pingchen Zhang; Yuyan Tan; Chao Gao; Jin Liu; Maoxin Huang; Hongxia Li; Xin Shen; Pei Huang; Shengdi Chen
39062985,Exploring Fecal Microbiota Transplantation for Modulating Inflammation in Parkinson's Disease: A Review of Inflammatory Markers and Potential Effects.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by numerous motor and non-motor symptoms. Recent data highlight a potential interplay between the gut microbiota and the pathophysiology of PD. The degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in PD leads to motor symptoms (tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia), with antecedent gastrointestinal manifestations, most notably constipation. Consequently, the gut emerges as a plausible modulator in the neurodegenerative progression of PD. Key molecular changes in PD are discussed in the context of the gut-brain axis. Evidence suggests that the alterations in the gut microbiota composition may contribute to gastroenteric inflammation and influence PD symptoms. Disturbances in the levels of inflammatory markers, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF α), interleukin -1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), have been observed in PD patients. These implicate the involvement of systemic inflammation in disease pathology. Fecal microbiota transplantation emerges as a potential therapeutic strategy for PD. It may mitigate inflammation by restoring gut homeostasis. Preclinical studies in animal models and initial clinical trials have shown promising results. Overall, understanding the interplay between inflammation, the gut microbiota, and PD pathology provides valuable insights into potential therapeutic interventions. This review presents recent data about the bidirectional communication between the gut microbiome and the brain in PD, specifically focusing on the involvement of inflammatory biomarkers.",International journal of molecular sciences,2024,Karol Sadowski; Weronika Zając; Łukasz Milanowski; Dariusz Koziorowski; Monika Figura
38490348,Dietary polyphenols represent a phytotherapeutic alternative for gut dysbiosis associated neurodegeneration: A systematic review.,"Globally, neurodegeneration and cerebrovascular disease are common and growing causes of morbidity and mortality. Pathophysiology of this group of diseases encompasses various factors from oxidative stress to gut microbial dysbiosis. The study of the etiology and mechanisms of oxidative stress as well as gut dysbiosis-induced neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, autism spectrum disorder, and Huntington's disease has recently received a lot of attention. Numerous studies lend credence to the notion that changes in the intestinal microbiota and enteric neuroimmune system have an impact on the initiation and severity of these diseases. The prebiotic role of polyphenols can influence the makeup of the gut microbiota in neurodegenerative disorders by modulating intracellular signalling pathways. Metabolites of polyphenols function directly as neurotransmitters by crossing the blood-brain barrier or indirectly via influencing the cerebrovascular system. This assessment aims to bring forth an interlink between the consumption of polyphenols biotransformed by gut microbiota which in turn modulate the gut microbial diversity and biochemical changes in the brain. This systematic review will further augment research towards the association of dietary polyphenols in the management of gut dysbiosis-associated neurodegenerative diseases.",The Journal of nutritional biochemistry,2024,Amrita Chatterjee; Satish Kumar; Suparna Roy Sarkar; Ritabrata Halder; Rashmi Kumari; Sugato Banerjee; Biswatrish Sarkar
39191336,Metformin: From diabetes to cancer to prolongation of life.,"The metformin molecule dates back to over a century, but its clinical use started in the '50s. Since then, its use in diabetics has grown constantly, with over 150 million users today. The therapeutic profile also expanded, with improved understanding of novel mechanisms. Metformin has a major activity on insulin resistance, by acting on the insulin receptors and mitochondria, most likely by activation of the adenosine monophosphate-activated kinase. These and associated mechanisms lead to significant lipid lowering and body weight loss. An anti-cancer action has come up in recent years, with mechanisms partly dependent on the mitochondrial activity and also on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase resistance occurring in some malignant tumors. The potential of metformin to raise life-length is the object of large ongoing studies and of several basic and clinical investigations. The present review article will attempt to investigate the basic mechanisms behind these diverse activities and the potential clinical benefits. Metformin may act on transcriptional activity by histone modification, DNA methylation and miRNAs. An activity on age-associated inflammation (inflammaging) may occur via activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor and changes in gut microbiota. A senolytic activity, leading to reduction of cells with the senescent associated secretory phenotype, may be crucial in lifespan prolongation as well as in ancillary properties in age-associated diseases, such as Parkinson's disease. Telomere prolongation may be related to the activity on mitochondrial respiratory factor 1 and on peroxisome gamma proliferator coactivator 1-alpha. Very recent observations on the potential to act on the most severe neurological disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia, have raised considerable hope.",Pharmacological research,2024,Cesare R Sirtori; Sofia Castiglione; Chiara Pavanello
38939650,Modulatory Effects of Phytochemicals on Gut-Brain Axis: Therapeutic Implication.,"This article explores the potential therapeutic implications of phytochemicals on the gut-brain axis (GBA), which serves as a communication network between the central nervous system and the enteric nervous system. Phytochemicals, which are compounds derived from plants, have been shown to interact with the gut microbiota, immune system, and neurotransmitter systems, thereby influencing brain function. Phytochemicals such as polyphenols, carotenoids, flavonoids, and terpenoids have been identified as having potential therapeutic implications for various neurological disorders. The GBA plays a critical role in the development and progression of various neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, depression, anxiety, and autism spectrum disorders. Dysbiosis, or an imbalance in gut microbiota composition, has been associated with a range of neurological disorders, suggesting that modulating the gut microbiota may have potential therapeutic implications for these conditions. Although these findings are promising, further research is needed to elucidate the optimal use of phytochemicals in neurological disorder treatment, as well as their potential interactions with other medications. The literature review search was conducted using predefined search terms such as phytochemicals, gut-brain axis, neurodegenerative, and Parkinson in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane library.",Current developments in nutrition,2024,Khojasteh Rahimi Jaberi; Vahab Alamdari-Palangi; Amir Savardashtaki; Pooya Vatankhah; Tannaz Jamialahmadi; Amir Tajbakhsh; Amirhossein Sahebkar
38008941,Intestinal Barrier Function and Neurodegenerative Disease.,"Neurodegenerative diseases are caused by the loss of neurons and/or their myelin sheaths, which deteriorate over time and become dysfunctional. Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis are among the most prominent neurodegenerative diseases that affect millions of older adults worldwide. Despite extensive research over several decades, controversies still surround the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases, and many of them remain incurable. Meanwhile, an increasing number of new mechanistic studies related to the microbiota-gut-brain axis have emerged, among which the relationship between the function of the intestinal barrier and neurodegenerative diseases has received widespread attention. As one of the first lines of defense between the body and the external environment, the impaired function of the intestinal barrier is closely related to the development of neurodegenerative pathologies. Among them, the microbiota-gut-brain axis disorder characterized by intestinal barrier disruption mainly includes impaired function of the intestinal microbial barrier, chemical barrier, mechanical barrier, and immune barrier. This review focuses on the structure and molecular mechanisms of the various layers of the intestinal barrier as well as their relationship with neurodegenerative lesions. In recent years, intestinal barrier repair therapies have provided new ideas for the studied disease treatment modalities. We believe that a better understanding of the role of the intestinal barrier in neurodegenerative diseases would provide new insights for the development of viable therapeutic strategies for patients.",CNS & neurological disorders drug targets,2024,Shijing Wu; Liangfang Yang; Yiwei Fu; Zhimin Liao; De Cai; Zhou Liu
38261717,Gastrointestinal dysmotility in rodent models of Parkinson's disease.,"Multiple studies describe prodromal, nonmotor dysfunctions that affect the quality of life of patients who subsequently develop Parkinson's disease (PD). These prodromal dysfunctions comprise a wide array of autonomic issues, including severe gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders such as dysphagia, delayed gastric emptying, and chronic constipation. Indeed, strong evidence from studies in humans and animal models suggests that the GI tract and its neural, mainly vagal, connection to the central nervous system (CNS) could have a major role in the etiology of PD. In fact, misfolded α-synuclein aggregates that form Lewy bodies and neurites, i.e., the histological hallmarks of PD, are detected in the enteric nervous system (ENS) before clinical diagnosis of PD. The aim of the present review is to provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of GI dysmotility in PD, focusing our attention on functional, neurochemical, and molecular alterations in animal models.",American journal of physiology.

39175504,The aryl hydrocarbon receptor pathway: a linking bridge between the gut microbiome and neurodegenerative diseases.,"The Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a cytosolic receptor and ligand-activated transcription factor widely expressed across various cell types in the body. Its signaling is vital for host responses at barrier sites, regulating epithelial renewal, barrier integrity, and the activities of several types of immune cells. This makes AHR essential for various cellular responses during aging, especially those governing inflammation and immunity. In this review, we provided an overview of the mechanisms by which the AHR mediates inflammatory response at gut and brain level through signals from intestinal microbes. The age-related reduction of gut microbiota functions is perceived as a trigger of aberrant immune responses linking gut and brain inflammation to neurodegeneration. Thus, we explored gut microbiome impact on the nature and availability of AHR ligands and outcomes for several signaling pathways involved in neurodegenerative diseases and age-associated decline of brain functions, with an insight on Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, the most common neurodegenerative diseases in the elderly. Specifically, we focused on microbial tryptophan catabolism responsible for the production of several AHR ligands. Perspectives for the development of microbiota-based interventions targeting AHR activity are presented for a healthy aging.",Frontiers in cellular neuroscience,2024,Lorena Coretti; Elisabetta Buommino; Francesca Lembo
38227477,Integrated multi-omics profiling highlights the benefits of resveratrol hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin inclusion complex for A53T transgenic mice through the microbiota-gut-brain axis.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological disorder characterized by motor and gastrointestinal dysfunctions. Resveratrol is a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory phytoalexin known for its health-promoting benefits. However, little is known about its potential in treating PD by modulating the microbial gut-brain axis, and its clinical application has been limited due to poor water solubility, rapid metabolism, and limited systemic bioavailability. Our study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of RHSD, a resveratrol-cyclodextrin inclusion complex, in treating PD through the gut-brain axis in human SNCA-transgenic (A53T) mice PD models. Building on our previous study, we prepared RHSD and compared its efficacy with uncoated resveratrol for PD treatment. The study results demonstrated that RHSD exhibited several advantages in improving motor function, alleviating cognitive impairment, restoring intestinal barrier function, and inhibiting neuropathy. Subsequently, a series of analyses, including fecal microbiota metagenomic sequencing, non-target metabolic assays, host transcriptome sequencing, and integrative analysis were performed to reveal the potential therapeutic pathways of RHSD in A53T mice. The metagenomic sequencing results indicated a significant increase in the levels of <i>Lactobacillus murinus</i>, <i>Lactobacillus reuteri</i>, <i>Enterorhabduscaecimuris</i>, <i>Lactobacillus taiwanensis</i>, and <i>Lactobacillus animals</i> following RHSD administration. Furthermore, metabolomics profiling showed that the levels of gut microbiome metabolites were reversed after RHSD treatment, and differential metabolites were significantly correlated with motor function and intestinal function in PD mice. The integrated analysis of microbial metabolites and host transcriptomics suggested that abnormal amino acid metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation in the PD model were associated with the diffusion of abnormal metabolites. This study illustrates the profound impact of RHSD administration on rectifying gut microbiota dysbiosis and improving the A53T mouse model. Notably, we observed significant alterations in the proliferation and metabolism of multiple probiotic strains of Lactobacillus. Furthermore, our research supports the hypothesis that microbiota-related metabolites may regulate the transcription of host genes, including dopamine receptors and calcium stabilization. Consequently, our findings underscore the potential of RHSD as a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of PD through the modulation of several signaling pathways within the microbiota-gut-brain axis.",Food & function,2024,Xiaodong Sun; Shenglan Feng; Bingqing Qin; Junjie Ye; Lixia Xie; Jianjun Gui; Ming Sang
38610012,Peripheral extracellular vesicles in neurodegeneration: pathogenic influencers and therapeutic vehicles.,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis epitomize a class of insidious and relentless neurological conditions that are difficult to cure. Conventional therapeutic regimens often fail due to the late onset of symptoms, which occurs well after irreversible neurodegeneration has begun. The integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) further impedes efficacious drug delivery to the central nervous system, presenting a formidable challenge in the pharmacological treatment of NDDs. Recent scientific inquiries have shifted focus toward the peripheral biological systems, investigating their influence on central neuropathology through the lens of extracellular vesicles (EVs). These vesicles, distinguished by their ability to breach the BBB, are emerging as dual operatives in the context of NDDs, both as conveyors of pathogenic entities and as prospective vectors for therapeutic agents. This review critically summarizes the burgeoning evidence on the role of extracerebral EVs, particularly those originating from bone, adipose tissue, and gut microbiota, in modulating brain pathophysiology. It underscores the duplicity potential of peripheral EVs as modulators of disease progression and suggests their potential as novel vehicles for targeted therapeutic delivery, positing a transformative impact on the future landscape of NDD treatment strategies. Search strategy A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus from January 2000 to December 2023. The search combined the following terms using Boolean operators: ""neurodegenerative disease"" OR ""Alzheimer's disease"" OR ""Parkinson's disease"" OR ""Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis"" AND ""extracellular vesicles"" OR ""exosomes"" OR ""outer membrane vesicles"" AND ""drug delivery systems"" AND ""blood-brain barrier"". MeSH terms were employed when searching PubMed to refine the results. Studies were included if they were published in English, involved human subjects, and focused on the peripheral origins of EVs, specifically from bone, adipose tissue, and gut microbiota, and their association with related diseases such as osteoporosis, metabolic syndrome, and gut dysbiosis. Articles were excluded if they did not address the role of EVs in the context of NDDs or did not discuss therapeutic applications. The titles and abstracts of retrieved articles were screened using a dual-review process to ensure relevance and accuracy. The reference lists of selected articles were also examined to identify additional relevant studies.",Journal of nanobiotechnology,2024,Xixi Liu; Lu Shen; Meidan Wan; Hui Xie; Zhenxing Wang
38786584,Optimization of the Preparation Process of Glucuronomannan Oligosaccharides and Their Effects on the Gut Microbiota in MPTP-Induced PD Model Mice.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, and accumulating evidence suggests a link between dysbiosis of the gut microbiota and the onset and progression of PD. In our previous investigations, we discovered that intraperitoneal administration of glucuronomannan oligosaccharides (GMn) derived from <i>Saccharina japonica</i> exhibited neuroprotective effects in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse model. However, the complicated preparation process, difficulties in isolation, and remarkably low yield have constrained further exploration of GMn. In this study, we optimized the degradation conditions in the preparation process of GMn through orthogonal experiments. Subsequently, an MPTP-induced PD model was established, followed by oral administration of GMn. Through a stepwise optimization, we successfully increased the yield of GMn, separated from crude fucoidan, from 1~2/10,000 to 4~8/1000 and indicated the effects on the amelioration of MPTP-induced motor deficits, preservation of dopamine neurons, and elevation in striatal neurotransmitter levels. Importantly, GMn mitigated gut microbiota dysbiosis induced by MPTP in mice. In particular, GM2 significantly reduced the levels of <i>Akkermansia</i>, Verrucomicrobiota, and <i>Lactobacillus</i>, while promoting the abundance of <i>Roseburia</i> and <i>Prevotella</i> compared to the model group. These findings suggest that GM2 can potentially suppress PD by modulating the gut microbiota, providing a foundation for the development of a novel and effective anti-PD marine drug.",Marine drugs,2024,Baoxiang Wang; Lihua Geng; Jing Wang; Yuxi Wei; Changhui Yan; Ning Wu; Yang Yue; Quanbin Zhang
38316462,Stability of gut microbiome after COVID-19 vaccination in healthy and immuno-compromised individuals.,"Bidirectional interactions between the immune system and the gut microbiota are key contributors to various physiological functions. Immune-associated diseases such as cancer and autoimmunity, and efficacy of immunomodulatory therapies, have been linked to microbiome variation. Although COVID-19 infection has been shown to cause microbial dysbiosis, it remains understudied whether the inflammatory response associated with vaccination also impacts the microbiota. Here, we investigate the temporal impact of COVID-19 vaccination on the gut microbiome in healthy and immuno-compromised individuals; the latter included patients with primary immunodeficiency and cancer patients on immunomodulating therapies. We find that the gut microbiome remained remarkably stable post-vaccination irrespective of diverse immune status, vaccine response, and microbial composition spanned by the cohort. The stability is evident at all evaluated levels including diversity, phylum, species, and functional capacity. Our results indicate the resilience of the gut microbiome to host immune changes triggered by COVID-19 vaccination and suggest minimal, if any, impact on microbiome-mediated processes. These findings encourage vaccine acceptance, particularly when contrasted with the significant microbiome shifts observed during COVID-19 infection.",Life science alliance,2024,Rebecca H Boston; Rui Guan; Lajos Kalmar; Sina Beier; Emily C Horner; Nonantzin Beristain-Covarrubias; Juan Carlos Yam-Puc; Pehuén Pereyra Gerber; Luisa Faria; Anna Kuroshchenkova; Anna E Lindell; Sonja Blasche; Andrea Correa-Noguera; Anne Elmer; Caroline Saunders; Areti Bermperi; Sherly Jose; Nathalie Kingston; ; Sofia Grigoriadou; Emily Staples; Matthew S Buckland; Sara Lear; Nicholas J Matheson; Vladimir Benes; Christine Parkinson; James Ed Thaventhiran; Kiran R Patil

The therapeutic potential of probiotics, due to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and gut microbiota modulatory properties, is explored herein as a means to improve gut health and influence the gut-brain-microbiota axis in the context of PD. In this study, we investigated the role and possible mechanism of <i>Bifidobacterium animalis</i> subsp. <i>lactis</i> MH-022 (<i>B. lactis</i> MH-022) supplementation in a 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced rat model of PD. Findings demonstrated that <i>B. lactis</i> MH-022 supplementation markedly ameliorated motor deficits, preserved dopaminergic neurons, enhanced the antioxidant capacity, and mitigated inflammation through restoring mitochondrial function. Furthermore, <i>B. lactis</i> MH-022 supplementation significantly altered the gut microbiota composition, augmenting the production of short-chain fatty acids and promoting the proliferation of beneficial bacterial taxa, thereby reinforcing their anti-inflammatory properties. Correlation analyses established strong associations between specific bacterial taxa and improvements in motor function, antioxidant levels, and reductions in inflammation markers. These insights emphasize the therapeutic potential of <i>B. lactis</i> MH-022 in modulating diverse aspects of PD, particularly highlighting its role in reducing inflammation, restoring mitochondrial function, enhancing antioxidant capacity, and reshaping the gut microbiota. This multifaceted approach underscores the probiotic's potential in reducing neuroinflammation and protecting dopaminergic neurons, thus offering a promising avenue for PD treatment.",Food & function,2024,Shu-Ping Tsao; Tu-Hsueh Yeh; Ya-Tin Lin; Chun-Hsu Pan; Yuan-Kun Lee; Chieh-Hsi Wu; Hui-Yu Huang
39273435,Psychobiotic Properties of <i>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</i> in Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Neurodegenerative disorders are the main cause of cognitive and physical disabilities, affect millions of people worldwide, and their incidence is on the rise. Emerging evidence pinpoints a disturbance of the communication of the gut-brain axis, and in particular to gut microbial dysbiosis, as one of the contributors to the pathogenesis of these diseases. In fact, dysbiosis has been associated with neuro-inflammatory processes, hyperactivation of the neuronal immune system, impaired cognitive functions, aging, depression, sleeping disorders, and anxiety. With the rapid advance in metagenomics, metabolomics, and big data analysis, together with a multidisciplinary approach, a new horizon has just emerged in the fields of translational neurodegenerative disease. In fact, recent studies focusing on taxonomic profiling and leaky gut in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders are not only shedding light on an overlooked field but are also creating opportunities for biomarker discovery and development of new therapeutic and adjuvant strategies to treat these disorders. <i>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</i> (LBP) strains are emerging as promising psychobiotics for the treatment of these diseases. In fact, LBP strains are able to promote eubiosis, increase the enrichment of bacteria producing beneficial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids, boost the production of neurotransmitters, and support the homeostasis of the gut-brain axis. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the role of the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders with a particular focus on the benefits of LBP strains in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, autism, anxiety, and depression.",International journal of molecular sciences,2024,Mariagiovanna Di Chiano; Fabio Sallustio; Daniela Fiocco; Maria Teresa Rocchetti; Giuseppe Spano; Paola Pontrelli; Antonio Moschetta; Loreto Gesualdo; Raffaella Maria Gadaleta; Anna Gallone

39331469,Orally Administered Ginkgolide C Alleviates MPTP-Induced Neurodegeneration by Suppressing Neuroinflammation and Oxidative Stress through Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis in Mice.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, the etiology of which remains unclear. Studies have shown that neuroinflammation and oxidative stress (OS) play an important role in neuronal damage in patients with PD. Disturbances in the gut microbiota influence neuroinflammation and OS through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Ginkgolide C (GC), a traditional Chinese medicine extracted from the leaves of <i>Ginkgo biloba</i>, has been reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory effects and the ability to modulate intestinal microbial composition. However, the potential of GC to positively impact PD by modulating the gut microbiota remains unexplored. This study aimed to explore the effects of GC on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD in mice and elucidate its underlying mechanisms. Our findings elucidated that GC treatment significantly ameliorates behavioral deficits as well as pathological damage via restoring gut microbial homeostasis to downgrade OS and neuroinflammation in MPTP-induced PD mice. Mechanistically, GC treatment exerts antioxidant effects via activating the AKT/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway in MPP<sup>+</sup>-exposed SN4741 neuronal cells and significantly downregulates the expression of inflammatory mediators via regulating NF-κB and MAPK signaling in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV2 microglial cells. Overall, our study demonstrates that GC administration alleviates MPTP-induced neurodegeneration via rebuilding gut microbial homeostasis to inhibit OS and neuroinflammation in mice, indicating that GC might serve as a promising candidate medicine for PD.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2024,Xiyu Gao; Shoupeng Fu; Jingru Wen; Aohan Yan; Shuo Yang; Yiming Zhang; Dianfeng Liu; Dewei He
39344226,Research Progress on the Relationship between Parkinson's Disease and REM Sleep Behavior Disorder.,"An individual's quality of life is greatly affected by Parkinson's disease (PD), a prevalent neurological degenerative condition. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a prominent non-motor symptom commonly associated with PD. Previous studies have shown a close relationship between PD and RBD. In addition to being a prodromal symptom of PD, RBD has a major negative impact on the prognosis of PD patients. This intrinsic connection indicates that there is a bidirectional relationship between PD and RBD. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the pathological mechanism related to PD and RBD, including the α-synuclein pathological deposition, abnormal iron metabolism, neuroinflammation, glymphatic system dysfunction and dysbiosis of the gut microbiota. Increasing evidence has shown that RBD patients have the same pathogenic mechanisms that underlie PD, but relatively little research has been done on how RBD contributes to PD progression. Therefore, a more thorough investigation is warranted to characterise how RBD affects the course of PD, in order to prepare for future therapeutic trials.",Journal of integrative neuroscience,2024,Yu Zhou; Xiaoli Liu; Bin Xu
39201684,Implications of Butyrate Signaling Pathways on the Motor Symptomatology of Parkinson's Disease and Neuroprotective Effects-Therapeutic Approaches: A Systematic Review.,"Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms. Emerging evidence suggests that gut microbiota alterations, specifically involving short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) like butyrate, may influence PD pathogenesis and symptomatology. This Systematic Review aims to synthesize current research on the role of butyrate in modulating motor symptoms and its neuroprotective effects in PD, providing insights into potential therapeutic approaches. A systematic literature search was conducted in April 2024 across databases, including ScienceDirect, Scopus, Wiley, and Web of Science, for studies published between 2000 and 2024. Keywords used were ""neuroprotective effects AND butyrate AND (Parkinson disease OR motor symptoms)"". Four authors independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts, applying inclusion criteria focused on studies investigating butyrate regulation and PD motor symptoms. A total of 1377 articles were identified, with 40 selected for full-text review and 14 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Data extraction was performed on the study population, PD models, methodology, intervention details, and outcomes. Quality assessment using the SYRCLE RoB tool highlighted variability in study quality, with some biases noted in allocation concealment and blinding. Findings indicate that butyrate regulation has a significant impact on improving motor symptoms and offers neuroprotective benefits in PD models. The therapeutic modulation of gut microbiota to enhance butyrate levels presents a promising strategy for PD symptom management.",International journal of molecular sciences,2024,Jorge Missiego-Beltrán; Eva María Olalla-Álvarez; Ana González-Brugera; Ana Isabel Beltrán-Velasco
38267447,Unravelling the mechanisms of underweight in Parkinson's disease by investigating into the role of gut microbiome.,"Approximately half of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) suffer from unintentional weight loss and are underweight, complicating the clinical course of PD patients. Gut microbiota alteration has been proven to be associated with PD, and recent studies have shown that gut microbiota could lead to muscle wasting, implying a possible role of gut microbiota in underweight PD. In this study, we aimed to (1) investigate the mechanism underlying underweight in PD patients with respect to gut microbiota and (2) estimate the extent to which gut microbiota may mediate PD-related underweight through mediation analysis. The data were adapted from Hill-Burns et al., in which 330 participants (199 PD, 131 controls) were enrolled in the study. Fecal samples were collected from participants for microbiome analysis. 16S rRNA gene sequence data were processed using DADA2. Mediation analysis was performed to quantify the effect of intestinal microbial alteration on the causal effect of PD on underweight and to identify the key bacteria that significantly mediated PD-related underweight. The results showed that the PD group had significantly more underweight patients (body mass index (BMI) < 18.5) after controlling for age and sex. Ten genera and four species were significantly different in relative abundance between the underweight and non-underweight individuals in the PD group. Mediation analysis showed that 42.29% and 37.91% of the effect of PD on underweight was mediated through intestinal microbial alterations at the genus and species levels, respectively. Five genera (Agathobacter, Eisenbergiella, Fusicatenibacter, Roseburia, Ruminococcaceae_UCG_013) showed significant mediation effects. In conclusion, we found that up to 42.29% of underweight PD cases are mediated by gut microbiota, with increased pro-inflammatory bacteria and decreased SCFA-producing bacteria, which indicates that the pro-inflammatory state, disturbance of metabolism, and interference of appetite regulation may be involved in the mechanism of underweight PD.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2024,Ling-Chieh Shih; Ru-Jen Lin; Yan-Lin Chen; Shih-Chen Fu
38891863,From Gut to Brain: Uncovering Potential Serum Biomarkers Connecting Inflammatory Bowel Diseases to Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are characterized by chronic gastrointestinal inflammation due to abnormal immune responses to gut microflora. The gut-brain axis is disrupted in IBDs, leading to neurobiological imbalances and affective symptoms. Systemic inflammation in IBDs affects the brain's inflammatory response system, hormonal axis, and blood-brain barrier integrity, influencing the gut microbiota. This review aims to explore the association between dysregulations in the gut-brain axis, serum biomarkers, and the development of cognitive disorders. Studies suggest a potential association between IBDs and the development of neurodegeneration. The mechanisms include systemic inflammation, nutritional deficiency, GBA dysfunction, and the effect of genetics and comorbidities. The objective is to identify potential correlations and propose future research directions to understand the impact of altered microbiomes and intestinal barrier functions on neurodegeneration. Serum levels of vitamins, inflammatory and neuronal damage biomarkers, and neuronal growth factors have been investigated for their potential to predict the development of neurodegenerative diseases, but current results are inconclusive and require more studies.",International journal of molecular sciences,2024,Oliviu-Florentiu Sarb; Adriana-Daniela Sarb; Maria Iacobescu; Irina-Maria Vlad; Mircea-Vasile Milaciu; Lorena Ciurmarnean; Vitalie Vacaras; Alina-Ioana Tantau

Thus, elucidation of how the gut microbiota-brain axis plays a role in health and disease conditions is a potential novel approach to prevent and treat brain disorders. The zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) is an invaluable vertebrate model that possesses conserved brain and intestinal features with those of humans, thus making zebrafish a valued model to investigate the interplay between the gut microbiota and host health. This chapter describes current findings on the utility of zebrafish in understanding molecular mechanisms of neurotoxicity mediated via the gut microbiota-brain axis. Specifically, it highlights the utility of zebrafish as a model organism for understanding how anthropogenic chemicals, pharmaceuticals and bacteria exposure affect animals and human health via the gut-brain axis.",Advances in neurotoxicology,2024,Isaac A Adedara; Khadija A Mohammed; Julia Canzian; Babajide O Ajayi; Ebenezer O Farombi; Tatiana Emanuelli; Denis B Rosemberg; Michael Aschner

39002442,Pharmacological mechanisms of puerarin in the treatment of Parkinson's disease: An overview.,"Puerarin, a monomer of traditional Chinese medicine, is a key component of Pueraria radix. Both clinical and experimental researches demonstrated that puerarin has therapeutic effects on Parkinson's disease (PD). Puerarin's pharmacological mechanisms include: 1) Anti-apoptosis. Puerarin inhibits cell apoptosis through the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathways. Puerarin also exerts a hormone-like effect against cell apoptosis; 2) Anti-oxidative stress injury. Puerarin inhibits the Nrf2 nuclear exclusion through the GSK-3β/Fyn pathway to promote the Nrf2 accumulation in the nucleus, and then promotes the antioxidant synthesis through the Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway to protect against oxidative stress; 3) Neuroprotective effects by intervening in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP). Puerarin significantly enhances the activity of chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), which downregulates the expression of α-synuclein, reduces its accumulation, and thus improves the function of damaged neurons. Additionally, puerarin increases proteasome activity and decreases ubiquitin-binding proteins, thereby preventing toxic accumulation of intracellular proteins; 4) Alleviating inflammatory response. Puerarin inhibits the conversion of microglia to the M1 phenotype while inducing the transition of microglia to the M2 phenotype. Furthermore, puerarin promotes the secretion of anti-inflammatory factor and inhibits the expression of pro-inflammatory factors; 5) Increasing the levels of dopamine and its metabolites. Puerarin could increase the levels of dopamine, homovanillic acid (HVA) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) in the striatum; 6) Promoting neurotrophic factor expression and neuronal repair. Puerarin increases the expression of glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF), thereby exerting a neuroprotective effect. Moreover, the regulation of the gut microbiota by puerarin may be a potential mechanism for the treatment of PD. The current review discusses the molecular mechanisms of puerarin, which may provide insight into the active components of traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of PD.",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2024,Nianping Zhang; Peng Guo; Yan Zhao; Xiao Qiu; Shuai Shao; Zhenzhong Liu; Zong Gao
37855342,The Role of the Vagus Nerve in the Microbiome and Digestive System in Relation to Epilepsy.,"The Enteric Nervous System (ENS) is described as a division of the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS), located within the gut wall and it is formed by two main plexuses: the myenteric plexus (Auerbach's) and the submucosal plexus (Meissner's). The contribution of the ENS to the pathophysiology of various neurological diseases such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease has been described in the literature, while some other studies have found a connection between epilepsy and the gastrointestinal tract. The above could be explained by cholinergic neurons and neurotransmission systems in the myenteric and submucosal plexuses, regulating the vagal excitability effect. It is also understandable, as the discharges arising in the amygdala are transmitted to the intestine through projections the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, giving rise to efferent fibers that stimulate the gastrointestinal tract and consequently the symptoms at this level. Therefore, this review's main objective is to argue in favor of the existing relationship of the ENS with the Central Nervous System (CNS) as a facilitator of epileptogenic or ictogenic mechanisms. The gut microbiota also participates in this interaction; however, it depends on many individual factors of each human being. The link between the ENS and the CNS is a poorly studied epileptogenic site with a big impact on one of the most prevalent neurological conditions such as epilepsy.",Current medicinal chemistry,2024,Carmen Rubio; Ernesto Ochoa; Fernando Gatica; Alonso Portilla; David Vázquez; Moisés Rubio-Osornio

The existence of gut microbiota dysbiosis has been associated with systemic inflammatory processes present in neurodegenerative disease, creating the opportunity for new treatment strategies. This involves modifying the strains that constitute the gut microbiota to enhance synaptic function through the gut-brain axis. Recent studies have evaluated the beneficial effects of the use of <i>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</i> on motor and cognitive symptomatology, alone or in combination. This systematic review includes 20 research articles (<i>n</i> = 3 in human and <i>n</i> = 17 in animal models). The main result of this research was that the use of <i>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</i> alone or in combination produced improvements in symptomatology related to neurodegenerative disease. However, one of the studies included reported negative effects after the administration of <i>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</i>. This systematic review provides current and relevant information about the use of this probiotic in pathologies that present neurodegenerative processes such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Multiple Sclerosis.",International journal of molecular sciences,2024,Ana Isabel Beltrán-Velasco; Manuel Reiriz; Sara Uceda; Víctor Echeverry-Alzate
39060267,Multiomics of parkinsonism cynomolgus monkeys highlights significance of metabolites in interaction between host and microbiota.,"The gut microbiota has been demonstrated to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, conflicting findings regarding specific microbial species have been reported, possibly due to confounding factors within human populations. Herein, our current study investigated the interaction between the gut microbiota and host in a non-human primate (NHP) PD model induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) using a multi-omic approach and a self-controlled design. Our transcriptomic sequencing of peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) identified key genes involved in pro-inflammatory cytokine dysregulation, mitochondrial function regulation, neuroprotection activation, and neurogenesis associated with PD, such as IL1B, ATP1A3, and SLC5A3. The metabolomic profiles in serum and feces consistently exhibited significant alterations, particularly those closely associated with inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunctions and neurodegeneration in PD, such as TUDCA, ethylmalonic acid, and L-homophenylalanine. Furthermore, fecal metagenome analysis revealed gut dysbiosis associated with PD, characterized by a significant decrease in alpha diversity and altered commensals, particularly species such as Streptococcus, Butyrivibrio, and Clostridium. Additionally, significant correlations were observed between PD-associated microbes and metabolites, such as sphingomyelin and phospholipids. Importantly, PDPC significantly reduced in both PD monkey feces and serum, exhibiting strong correlation with PD-associated genes and microbes, such as SLC5A3 and Butyrivibrio species. Moreover, such multi-omic differential biomarkers were linked to the clinical rating scales of PD monkeys. Our findings provided novel insights into understanding the potential role of key metabolites in the host-microbiota interaction involved in PD pathogenesis.",NPJ biofilms and microbiomes,2024,Jiang-Mei Gao; Shou-Yue Xia; Geoff Hide; Bi-Hai Li; Yi-Yan Liu; Zhi-Yuan Wei; Xiao-Ji Zhuang; Qing Yan; Yun Wang; Wei Yang; Jian-Huan Chen; Jun-Hua Rao
39064687,"Postbiotics as Molecules Targeting Cellular Events of Aging Brain-The Role in Pathogenesis, Prophylaxis and Treatment of Neurodegenerative Diseases.","Aging is the most prominent risk factor for neurodegeneration occurrence. The most common neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's (PD) diseases, are characterized by the incidence of proteinopathy, abnormal activation of glial cells, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, impaired autophagy and cellular senescence excessive for the patient's age. Moreover, mitochondrial disfunction, epigenetic alterations and neurogenesis inhibition, together with increased blood-brain barrier permeability and gut dysbiosis, have been linked to ND pathogenesis. Since NDs still lack curative treatment, recent research has sought therapeutic options in restoring gut microbiota and supplementing probiotic bacteria-derived metabolites with beneficial action to the host-so called postbiotics. The current review focuses on literature explaining cellular mechanisms involved in ND pathogenesis and research addressing the impact that postbiotics as a whole mixture and particular metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), lactate, polyamines, polyphenols, tryptophan metabolites, exopolysaccharides and bacterial extracellular vesicles, have on the ageing-associated processes underlying ND occurrence. The review also discusses the issue of implementing postbiotics into ND prophylaxis and therapy, depicting them as compounds addressing senescence-triggered dysfunctions that are worth translating from bench to pharmaceutical market in response to ""silver consumers"" demands.",Nutrients,2024,Pola Głowacka; Katarzyna Oszajca; Agnieszka Pudlarz; Janusz Szemraj; Monika Witusik-Perkowska
39145619,Oral aged garlic (<i>Allium sativum</i>) alleviates ulcerative colitis in mice by improving gut homeostasis.,"Aged garlic, obtained by heating raw garlic (<i>Allium sativum</i>) under high temperature and controlled humidity for a period, possesses a wide range of bioactivities, but its role in ulcerative colitis and its mechanism are not fully elucidated. We investigated the bioactive constituents in aged garlic (AG) and explored the effect of oral AG delivery on DSS-induced murine colitis. The results revealed that the aging process up-regulated anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial compounds such as dihydrocaffeic acid, 5-acetylsalicylic acid, verticine, <i>S</i>-allyl-L-cysteine and D-fucose. Oral AG obviously alleviated colitis, reducing colon damage and enhancing anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Streptococcus equinus</i> dramatically were enriched in the colon of mice with colitis that were strongly associated with Parkinson's disease, bacterial invasion of epithelial cells, aerobactin biosynthesis, and heme biosynthesis, but a distinct AG-mediated alteration in the colon due to increasing abundance of <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i>, <i>Lactobacillus</i> sp. <i>L-YJ</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium breve</i>, <i>Blautia wexlerae</i>, <i>Desulfomicrobium</i> sp. <i>P100A</i>, and <i>Lentilactobacillus hilgardii</i> was observed. Next, we demonstrated that colonic microbiome reconstruction by oral AG significantly increased the production of short-chain fatty acids such as acetic acid, propionic acid, isobutyric acid, and isovaleric acid. This study provides the first data indicating that oral AG ameliorates colonic inflammation in a gut microbiota-dependent manner. Our findings provide novel insights into the AG-mediated remission of colitis and AG as a functional food for modulating the gut microbiota to prevent and treat colitis.",Food & function,2024,Deping Han; Xuke Guan; Fengxia Zhu; Qing Yang; Dingding Su
38500273,"Gastrointestinal Issues in Depression, Anxiety, and Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Systematic Review on Pathways and Clinical Targets Implications.","Multiple illnesses commonly involve both the Central Nervous System (CNS) and the Gastrointestinal Tract (GI) simultaneously. Consistent evidence suggests that neurological disorders impair GI tract function and worsen the symptomatology and pathophysiology of digestive disorders. On the other hand, it has been proposed that early functional changes in the GI tract contribute to the genesis of several CNS illnesses. Additionally, the role played by the gut in these diseases can be seen as a paradigm for how the gut and the brain interact.We mentioned significant GI symptoms and discussed how the GI tract affects central nervous system illnesses, including depression, anxiety, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease in this study. We also explored potential pathophysiological underpinnings and novel targets for the creation of future therapies targeted at gut-brain connections.In this situation, modulating the gut microbiota through the administration of fecal microbiota transplants or probiotics may represent a new therapeutic option for this population, not only to treat GI problems but also behavioral problems, given the role that dysbiosis and leaky gut play in many neurological disorders.Accurate diagnosis and treatment of co-existing illnesses also require coordination between psychiatrists, neurologists, gastroenterologists, and other specialties, as well as a thorough history and thorough physical examination.",CNS & neurological disorders drug targets,2024,Ian Richard Lucena Andriolo; Bruna Longo; Dayse Machado de Melo; Márcia Maria de Souza; Rui Daniel Prediger; Luisa Mota da Silva
39021576,Potential value and research frontiers of virus in neuroinflammation: a bibliometric and visualized analysis.,"Neuroinflammation represents the immune response of the central nervous system to nerve injury, infection, toxin stimulation, or autoimmunity and is implicated in a wide range of neurological disorders. Viruses play a pivotal role as extrinsic biological drivers in neuroinflammation; however, numerous aspects remain unexplored. In this study, we employed bibliometric analysis to assess the current status of viral research in neuroinflammation and anticipate future research directions and emerging trends.Conduct a comprehensive search for scholarly publications within the Web of Science Core Collection database, with search terms on neuroinflammation and virus.

39309265,Effect of <i>BF</i>839 + earthworm protein supplement on motor and some non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease: a randomized clinical trial.,"Some studies have found that probiotics have the potential to treat PD, and earthworm protein is a traditional Chinese medicine used for the treatment of PD. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of <i>Bacteroides fragilis</i> 839 (<i>BF</i>839) + earthworm protein supplement as an adjunctive therapy for PD and to observe changes in the gut microbiota.Forty-six patients with PD were recruited for a 12-week 1:1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate changes in motor and some non-motor symptom scores and detect metagenomic changes in the gut microbiota.From baseline to 12 weeks, compared with placebo, the trial group showed significant reductions in the United Parkinson's Disease Rate Scale (UPDRS) total score (-7.74 ± 5.92 vs. -1.83 ± 4.14, <i>p</i> < 0.001), UPDRS part I (-0.72 ± 0.81 vs. -0.20 ± 0.72, <i>p</i> = 0.026), UPDRS part II (-2.50 ± 2.24 vs. -0.22 ± 1.98, <i>p</i> = 0.001), UPDRS part III (-3.43 ± 3.42 vs. -1.33 ± 2.65, <i>p</i> = 0.024), and UPDRS part IV (-1.13 ± 1.19 vs. -0.15 ± 0.57, <i>p</i> = 0.001). Significant reductions in the Hamilton Depression Scale-24 score (-3.91 ± 3.99 vs. +1.15 ± 3.42, <i>p</i> < 0.001), Self-Rating Anxiety Scale scores (-7.04 ± 5.71 vs. -1.23 ± 2.34, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and Constipation scoring system scores (-8.59 ± 4.75 vs. 0.27 ± 1.24, <i>p</i> < 0.001), were also noted. In the trial group, one patient experienced mild eczema and one suffered low blood pressure, which could not be conclusively attributed to supplementation. Compared to the placebo group, the trial group showed a marked increase in <i>Enterococcus faecium</i> and a decrease in <i>Klebsiella.</i>This study is the first to report that probiotics plus earthworm protein can remarkably improve the motor and some non-motor symptoms of PD without serious adverse effects.

38366179,Commensal protist Tritrichomonas musculus exhibits a dynamic life cycle that induces extensive remodeling of the gut microbiota.,"Commensal protists and gut bacterial communities exhibit complex relationships, mediated at least in part through host immunity. To improve our understanding of this tripartite interplay, we investigated community and functional dynamics between the murine protist Tritrichomonas musculus and intestinal bacteria in healthy and B-cell-deficient mice. We identified dramatic, protist-driven remodeling of resident microbiome growth and activities, in parallel with Tritrichomonas musculus functional changes, which were accelerated in the absence of B cells. Metatranscriptomic data revealed nutrient-based competition between bacteria and the protist. Single-cell transcriptomics identified distinct Tritrichomonas musculus life stages, providing new evidence for trichomonad sexual replication and the formation of pseudocysts. Unique cell states were validated in situ through microscopy and flow cytometry. Our results reveal complex microbial dynamics during the establishment of a commensal protist in the gut, and provide valuable data sets to drive future mechanistic studies.",The ISME journal,2024,Ana Popovic; Eric Y Cao; Joanna Han; Nirvana Nursimulu; Eliza V C Alves-Ferreira; Kyle Burrows; Andrea Kennard; Noor Alsmadi; Michael E Grigg; Arthur Mortha; John Parkinson
39143178,Metagenome-assembled microbial genomes from Parkinson's disease fecal samples.,"The human gut microbiome composition has been linked to Parkinson's disease (PD). However, knowledge of the gut microbiota on the genome level is still limited. Here we performed deep metagenomic sequencing and binning to build metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from 136 human fecal microbiomes (68 PD samples and 68 control samples). We constructed 952 non-redundant high-quality MAGs and compared them between PD and control groups. Among these MAGs, there were 22 different genomes of Collinsella and Prevotella, indicating high variability of those genera in the human gut environment. Microdiversity analysis indicated that Ruminococcus bromii was statistically significantly (p < 0.002) more diverse on the strain level in the control samples compared to the PD samples. In addition, by clustering all genes and performing presence-absence analysis between groups, we identified several control-specific (p < 0.05) related genes, such as speF and Fe-S oxidoreductase. We also report detailed annotation of MAGs, including Clusters of Orthologous Genes (COG), Cas operon type, antiviral gene, prophage, and secondary metabolites biosynthetic gene clusters, which can be useful for providing a reference for future studies.",Scientific reports,2024,Ilhan Cem Duru; Alexandre Lecomte; Tânia Keiko Shishido; Pia Laine; Joni Suppula; Lars Paulin; Filip Scheperjans; Pedro A B Pereira; Petri Auvinen

Valeric acid, a postbiotic material produced by gut microbiota and some plant species like valerian, has been explored to have diverse pharmacological activities.This narrative review aims to summarise the beneficial role of valeric acid for different health conditions along with its underlying mechanism. In order to get ample scientific evidence, various databases like Science Direct, PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar and Google were exhaustively explored to collect relevant information. Collected data were arranged and analyzed to reach a meaningful conclusion regarding the bioactivity profiling of valeric acid, its mechanism, and future prospects.Valeric acid belongs to short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) compounds like acetate, propionate, butyrate, pentanoic (valeric) acid, and hexanoic (caproic) acid. Valeric acid has been identified as one of the potent histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. In different preclinical in -vitro and in-vivo studies, valeric acid has been found to have anti-cancer, anti-diabetic, antihypertensive, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory activity and affects molecular pathways of different diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and epilepsy.These findings highlight the role of valeric acid as a potential novel therapeutic agent for endocrine, metabolic and immunity-related health conditions, and it must be tested under clinical conditions to develop as a promising drug.","Endocrine, metabolic & immune disorders drug targets",2024,Bindu Kumari; Usha Kumari; Dhananjay Kumar Singh; Gulam Mohammed Husain; Dinesh Kumar Patel; Anshul Shakya; Ravi Bhushan Singh; Gyan Prakash Modi; Gireesh Kumar Singh
39406307,Lactiplantibacillus plantarum SG5 inhibits neuroinflammation in MPTP-induced PD mice through GLP-1/PGC-1α pathway.,"Mounting evidence suggests that alterations in gut microbial composition play an active role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Probiotics are believed to modulate gut microbiota, potentially influencing PD development through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. However, the potential beneficial effects of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum SG5 (formerly known as Lactobacillus plantarum, abbreviated as L. plantarum) on PD and its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we employed immunofluorescence, Western blotting, ELISA, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to investigate the neuroprotective effects of L. plantarum SG5 against neuroinflammation in an MPTP-induced PD model and to explore the underlying mechanisms. Our results demonstrated that L. plantarum SG5 ameliorated MPTP-induced motor deficits, dopaminergic neuron loss, and elevated α-synuclein protein levels. Furthermore, SG5 inhibited MPTP-triggered overactivation of microglia and astrocytes in the substantia nigra (SN), attenuated disruption of both blood-brain and intestinal barriers, and suppressed the release of inflammatory factors in the colon and SN. Notably, SG5 modulated the composition and structure of the gut microbiota in mice. The MPTP-induced decrease in colonic GLP-1 secretion was reversed by SG5 treatment, accompanied by increased expression of GLP-1R and PGC-1α in the SN. Importantly, the GLP-1R antagonist Exendin 9-39 and PGC-1α inhibitor SR18292 attenuated the protective effects of SG5 in PD mice. In conclusion, we demonstrate a neuroprotective role of L. plantarum SG5 in the MPTP-induced PD mouse model, which likely involves modulation of the gut microbiota and, significantly, the GLP-1/PGC-1α signaling pathway.",Experimental neurology,2024,Yueyan Qi; Yuxuan Dong; Jinhu Chen; Siyou Xie; Xin Ma; Xueping Yu; Yang Yu; Yanqin Wang
38539626,"<i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> Is Beneficial to a Mouse Model of Parkinson's Disease, via Alleviated Neuroinflammation and Promoted Neurogenesis, with Involvement of SCFAs.","Increasing evidence suggests that the gut microbiota may represent potential strategies for Parkinson's disease (PD) treatment. Our previous research revealed a decreased abundance of <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> (Akk) in PD mice; however, whether Akk is beneficial to PD is unknown. To answer this question, the mice received MPTP intraperitoneally to construct a subacute model of PD and were then supplemented with Akk orally for 21 consecutive days. Motor function, dopaminergic neurons, neuroinflammation, and neurogenesis were examined. In addition, intestinal inflammation, and serum and fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) analyses, were assessed. We found that Akk treatment effectively inhibited the reduction of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and partially improved the motor function in PD mice. Additionally, Akk markedly alleviated neuroinflammation in the striatum and hippocampus and promoted hippocampal neurogenesis. It also decreased the level of colon inflammation. Furthermore, these aforementioned changes are mainly accompanied by alterations in serum and fecal isovaleric acid levels, and lower intestinal permeability. Our research strongly suggests that Akk is a potential neuroprotective agent for PD therapy.",Brain sciences,2024,Chen-Meng Qiao; Wen-Yan Huang; Yu Zhou; Wei Quan; Gu-Yu Niu; Ting Li; Mei-Xuan Zhang; Jian Wu; Li-Ping Zhao; Wei-Jiang Zhao; Chun Cui; Yan-Qin Shen
39367119,Synbiotic supplementation may globally improve non-motor symptoms in patients with stable Parkinson's disease: results from an open label single-arm study.,"Gut microbiota changes and brain-gut-axis (BGA) dysregulation are common in people with Parkinson's Disease (PD). Probiotics and prebiotics are emerging as a potential therapeutic approach for PD patients. The aim of this paper was to assess the neurological and gastroenterological effects in PD patients with constipation after the administration of a synbiotic product, with a focus on behavioral and cognitive symptoms. We enrolled patients with stable PD who met diagnostic criteria for functional constipation and/or irritable bowel syndrome with constipation according to Rome IV Criteria. Patients received a synbiotic treatment (Enterolactis Duo, containing the probiotic strain Lacticaseibacillus paracasei DG and the prebiotic fiber inulin) for 12 weeks. A neurological and a gastroenterological evaluation were collected before and after the treatment. In addition, 16S rRNA gene profiling and short chain fatty acid quantification were performed to characterize the microbial ecosystem of fecal samples collected before (n = 22) and after (n = 9) the synbiotic administration. 30 patients were consecutively enrolled. After treatment, patients performed better in MDS-UPDRS part 1 (p = 0.000), SCOPA-AUT (p = 0.001), TAS-20 (p = 0.014), HAM-D (p = 0.026), DIFt (p = 0.003), PAS-A (p = 0.048). Gastroenterological evaluations showed improvements in PAC-SYM score (p < 0.001), number of complete bowel movement (p < 0.001) and BSFS (p < 0.001). After the synbiotic administration, we observed a significant increase in the abundance of the order Oscillospirales, as well as the Oscillospiraceae family and the species Faecalibacterium prausnitzii within this order in fecal samples.

38796044,Rosmarinic acid mitigates intestinal inflammation and oxidative stress in bullfrogs (Lithobates catesbeiana) fed high soybean meal diets.,"High proportions of soybean meal in aquafeed have been confirmed to induce various intestinal pathologies. This study aims to investigate the regulatory effects of rosmarinic acid (RA), an antioxidant with anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, when added to high soybean meal feeds in different doses, (0, 0.5, 1, and 4 g/kg). During the 56-day feeding trial, results indicated that, compared to the control group without RA (0 g/kg), the 1 g/kg and 4 g/kg RA groups increased bullfrog survival rates and total weight gain while reducing feed coefficient. Additionally, these doses markedly suppressed the expression of key intestinal inflammatory markers (tlr5, myd88, tnfα, il1β, cxcl8, cxcl12) and the activity and content of intestinal antioxidants (CAT, MDA, GSH, GPX). Concurrently, RA significantly downregulated the transcription levels of antioxidant-related genes (cat, gpx5, cyba, cybb, mgst, gclc, gsta, gstp), suggesting RA's potential to alleviate intestinal inflammation and oxidative stress induced by high soybean meal and to help downregulate and restore normal expression of antioxidant enzyme genes. However, the 0.5 g/kg RA group did not show a significant improvement in survival rates; instead, it upregulated the transcription of some antioxidant genes (cat, gpx5, cyba, cybb), revealing the complexity and dose-dependency of RA's antioxidant action. Furthermore, RA supplementation significantly reshaped the intestinal microbial community structure and relative abundance in bullfrogs, particularly affecting the genera Hafnia, Phascolarctobacterium, and Lactococcus. Notably, high doses of RA (1 g/kg, 4 g/kg) were able to downregulate pathways associated with the enrichment of gut microbiota in diseases such as Parkinson's, Staphylococcus aureus infection, and Systemic lupus erythematosus, suggesting its potential in anti-inflammatory action and health maintenance to prevent potential diseases.",Fish & shellfish immunology,2024,Bo Zhu; Shude Xu; Junzhi Zhang; Shuhui Xiang; Yi Hu

MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) was injected intraperitoneally into male C57BL/6 mice to establish a PD model, and WEG was given via oral gavage. The results indicated that WEG could protect the damaged neuronal cells of the mice brain, inhibit the aggregation of α-synuclein (α-Syn) in the brain, and increase the positive expression rate of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). WEG significantly improved intestinal damage and regulated intestinal disorders (P<0.05). WEG intervention increased the levels of beneficial bacteria, such as Lactobacillus, and normalized the abundance and diversity of colonies in the intestine of mice. Our results suggested that WEG protected neurons in the brain of PD mice via inhibiting the aggregation of α-Syn in the brain and increasing the positive expression level of TH in the brain.

38997651,Identification of volatile metabolites produced from levodopa metabolism by different bacteria strains of the gut microbiome.,"Interspecies pathways in the gut microbiome have been shown to metabolize levodopa, the primary treatment for Parkinson's disease, and reduce its bioavailability. While the enzymatic reactions have been identified, the ability to establish the resulting macromolecules as biomarkers of microbial metabolism remains technically challenging. In this study, we leveraged an untargeted mass spectrometry-based approach to investigate volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced during levodopa metabolism by Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium sporogenes, and Eggerthella lenta. We cultured these organisms with and without their respective bioactive metabolites and detected levodopa-induced shifts in VOC profiles. We then utilized bioinformatics to identify significant differences in 2,6-dimethylpyrazine, 4,6-dimethylpyrimidine, and 4,5-dimethylpyrimidine associated with its biotransformation. Supplementing cultures with inhibitors of levodopa-metabolizing enzymes revealed specific modulation of levodopa-associated diazines, verifying their relationship to its metabolism. Furthermore, functional group analysis depicts strain-specific VOC profiles that reflect interspecies differences in metabolic activity that can be leveraged to assess microbiome functionality in individual patients. Collectively, this work identifies previously uncharacterized metabolites of microbe-mediated levodopa metabolism to determine potential indicators of this activity and further elucidate the metabolic capabilities of different gut bacteria.",BMC microbiology,2024,Taylor Pennington; Jarrett Eshima; Barbara S Smith
39310761,Identification of proteotoxic and proteoprotective bacteria that non-specifically affect proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases.,"There are no cures for neurodegenerative protein conformational diseases (PCDs), such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD). Emerging evidence suggests the gut microbiota plays a role in their pathogenesis, though the influences of specific bacteria on disease-associated proteins remain elusive. Here, we reveal the effects of 229 human bacterial isolates on the aggregation and toxicity of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>, α-synuclein, and polyglutamine tracts in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> expressing these culprit proteins. Our findings demonstrate that bacterial effects on host protein aggregation are consistent across different culprit proteins, suggesting that microbes affect protein stability by modulating host proteostasis rather than selectively targeting disease-associated proteins. Furthermore, we found that feeding <i>C. elegans</i> proteoprotective <i>Prevotella corporis</i> activates the heat shock response, revealing an unexpected discovery of a microbial influence on host proteostasis. Insight into how individual bacteria affect PCD proteins could open new strategies for prevention and treatment by altering the abundance of microbes.",iScience,2024,Alyssa C Walker; Rohan Bhargava; Michael J Bucher; Yoan M Argote; Amanda S Brust; Daniel M Czyż
