33860090,Probiotics for Parkinson's disease: Current evidence and future directions.,"The gut-brain axis is a hot topic in Parkinson's disease (PD). It has been postulated that gut pathogens and dysbiosis can contribute to peripheral inflammatory states or trigger downstream metabolic effects that exacerbate the neurodegenerative process in PD. Several preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated disrupted intestinal permeability, intestinal inflammation, altered gut microbiome, and reduced fecal short-chain fatty acids in PD. In this regard, microbial-directed therapies such as probiotics are emerging as potential therapeutic options. Probiotic supplementation is postulated to confer a variety of health benefits due to the diverse functions of these live microorganisms, including inhibition of pathogen colonization, modulation/""normalization"" of the microbiome and/or its function, immunomodulatory effects (e.g. reducing inflammation), and improved host epithelial barrier function. Interestingly, several PD animal model studies have demonstrated the potential neuroprotective effects of probiotics in reducing dopaminergic neuronal degeneration. Notably, two randomized placebo-controlled trials have provided class I evidence for probiotics as a treatment for constipation in PD. However, the effects of probiotics on other PD aspects, such as motor disability and cognitive function, and its long-term efficacy (including effects on PD drug absorption in the gut) have not been investigated adequately. Further targeted animal and human studies are also warranted to understand the mechanisms of actions of probiotics in PD and to tailor probiotic therapy based on individual host profiles to improve patient outcomes in this disabling disorder.",JGH open : an open access journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,2021,Ai Huey Tan; Jia Wei Hor; Chun Wie Chong; Shen-Yang Lim
33488420,Bibliometric and Visual Analysis of Research on the Links Between the Gut Microbiota and Depression From 1999 to 2019.,"<b>Background:</b> There is a crucial link between the gut microbiota and the host central nervous system, and the communication between them occurs <i>via</i> a bidirectional pathway termed the ""microbiota-gut-brain axis."" The gut microbiome in the modern environment has markedly changed in response to environmental factors. These changes may affect a broad range of host psychiatric disorders, such as depression, by interacting with the host through metabolic, immune, neural, and endocrine pathways. Nevertheless, the general aspects of the links between the gut microbiota and depression have not been systematically investigated through bibliometric analysis. <b>Aim:</b> This study aimed to analyze the current status and developing trends in gut microbiota research in the depression field through bibliometric and visual analysis. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 1,962 publications published between 1999 and 2019 were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection. CiteSpace (5.6 R5) was used to perform collaboration network analysis, co-citation analysis, co-occurrence analysis, and citation burst detection. <b>Results:</b> The number of publications has been rapidly growing since 2010. The collaboration network analysis revealed that the USA, University College Cork, and John F. Cryan were the most influential country, institute, and scholar, respectively. The most productive and co-cited journals were <i>Brain Behavior and Immunity</i> and <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</i>, respectively. The co-citation analysis of references revealed that the most recent research focus was in the largest theme cluster, ""cytokines,"" thus reflecting the important research foundation in this field. The co-occurrence analysis of keywords revealed that ""fecal microbiota"" and ""microbiome"" have become the top two research hotspots since 2013. The citation burst detection for keywords identified several keywords, including ""Parkinson's disease,"" ""microbiota-gut-brain axis,"" ""microbiome,"" ""dysbiosis,"" ""bipolar disorder,"" ""impact,"" ""C reactive protein,"" and ""immune system,"" as new research frontiers, which have currently ongoing bursts. <b>Conclusions:</b> These results provide an instructive perspective on the current research and future directions in the study of the links between the gut microbiota and depression, which may help researchers choose suitable cooperators or journals, and promote their research illustrating the underlying molecular mechanisms of depression, including its etiology, prevention, and treatment.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2020,Xiuqing Zhu; Jinqing Hu; Shuhua Deng; Yaqian Tan; Chang Qiu; Ming Zhang; Xiaojia Ni; Haoyang Lu; Zhanzhang Wang; Lu Li; Hongzhen Chen; Shanqing Huang; Tao Xiao; Dewei Shang; Yuguan Wen
33240722,Gut-Brain Axis and its Neuro-Psychiatric Effects: A Narrative Review.,"The gut microbiota regulates the function and health of the human gut. Preliminary evidence suggests its impact on multiple human systems including the nervous and immune systems. A major area of research has been the directional relationship between intestinal microbiota and the central nervous system (CNS), called the microbiota-gut-brain axis. It is hypothesized that the intestinal microbiota affects brain activity and behavior via endocrine, neural, and immune pathways. An alteration in the composition of the gut microbiome has been linked to a variety of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. The connection between gut microbiome and several CNS disorders indicates that the focus of research in the future should be on the bacterial and biochemical targets.Â Through this review, we outline the established knowledge regarding the gut microbiome and gut-brain axis. In addition to gut microbiome in neurological and psychiatry diseases, we have briefly discussed microbial metabolites affecting the blood-brain barrier (BBB), immune dysregulation, modification of autonomic sensorimotor connections, and hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis.",Cureus,2020,Likhita Shaik; Rahul Kashyap; Sahith Reddy Thotamgari; Romil Singh; Sahil Khanna
33092203,Clustering on Human Microbiome Sequencing Data: A Distance-Based Unsupervised Learning Model.,"Modeling and analyzing human microbiome allows the assessment of the microbial community and its impacts on human health. Microbiome composition can be quantified using 16S rRNA technology into sequencing data, which are usually skewed and heavy-tailed with excess zeros. Clustering methods are useful in personalized medicine by identifying subgroups for patients stratification. However, there is currently a lack of standardized clustering method for the complex microbiome sequencing data. We propose a clustering algorithm with a specific beta diversity measure that can address the presence-absence bias encountered for sparse count data and effectively measure the sample distances for sample stratification. Our distance measure used for clustering is derived from a parametric based mixture model producing sample-specific distributions conditional on the observed operational taxonomic unit (OTU) counts and estimated mixture weights. The method can provide accurate estimates of the true zero proportions and thus construct a precise beta diversity measure. Extensive simulation studies have been conducted and suggest that the proposed method achieves substantial clustering improvement compared with some widely used distance measures when a large proportion of zeros is presented. The proposed algorithm was implemented to a human gut microbiome study on Parkinson's diseases to identify distinct microbiome states with biological interpretations.",Microorganisms,2020,Dongyang Yang; Wei Xu
33076930,Gut bacterial deamination of residual levodopa medication for Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by both motor and non-motor symptoms. Gastrointestinal tract dysfunction is one of the non-motor features, where constipation is reported as the most common gastrointestinal symptom. Aromatic bacterial metabolites are attracting considerable attention due to their impact on gut homeostasis and host's physiology. In particular, Clostridium sporogenes is a key contributor to the production of these bioactive metabolites in the human gut.Here, we show that C. sporogenes deaminates levodopa, the main treatment in Parkinson's disease, and identify the aromatic aminotransferase responsible for the initiation of the deamination pathway. The deaminated metabolite from levodopa, 3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)propionic acid, elicits an inhibitory effect on ileal motility in an ex vivo model. We detected 3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)propionic acid in fecal samples of Parkinson's disease patients on levodopa medication and found that this metabolite is actively produced by the gut microbiota in those stool samples.Levodopa is deaminated by the gut bacterium C. sporogenes producing a metabolite that inhibits ileal motility ex vivo. Overall, this study underpins the importance of the metabolic pathways of the gut microbiome involved in drug metabolism not only to preserve drug effectiveness, but also to avoid potential side effects of bacterial breakdown products of the unabsorbed residue of medication.",BMC biology,2020,Sebastiaan P van Kessel; Hiltje R de Jong; Simon L Winkel; Sander S van Leeuwen; Sieger A Nelemans; Hjalmar Permentier; Ali Keshavarzian; Sahar El Aidy
33046051,Using data science for medical decision making case: role of gut microbiome in multiple sclerosis.,"A decade ago, the advancements in the microbiome data sequencing techniques initiated the development of research of the microbiome and its relationship with the host organism. The development of sophisticated bioinformatics and data science tools for the analysis of large amounts of data followed. Since then, the analyzed gut microbiome data, where microbiome is defined as a network of microorganisms inhabiting the human intestinal system, has been associated with several conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome - IBS, colorectal cancer, diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome, and lately in the study of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases as well. This paper aims to provide an understanding of differences between microbial data of individuals who have been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and those who were not by exploiting data science techniques on publicly available data.This study examines the relationship between multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune central nervous system disease, and gut microbial community composition, using the samples acquired by 16s rRNA sequencing technique. We have used three different sets of MS samples sequenced during three independent studies (Jangi et al, Nat Commun 7:1-11, 2016), (Miyake et al, PLoS ONE 10:0137429, 2015), (McDonald et al, Msystems 3:00031-18, 2018) and this approach strengthens our results. Analyzed sequences were from healthy control and MS groups of sequences. The extracted set of statistically significant bacteria from the (Jangi et al, Nat Commun 7:1-11, 2016) dataset samples and their statistically significant predictive functions were used to develop a Random Forest classifier. In total, 8 models based on two criteria: bacteria abundance (at six taxonomic levels) and predictive functions (at two levels), were constructed and evaluated. These include using taxa abundances at different taxonomy levels as well as predictive function analysis at different hierarchical levels of KEGG pathways.The highest accuracy of the classification model was obtained at the genus level of taxonomy (76.82%) and the third hierarchical level of KEGG pathways (70.95%). The second dataset's 18 MS samples (Miyake et al, PLoS ONE 10:0137429, 2015) and 18 self-reported healthy samples from the (McDonald et al, Msystems 3:00031-18, 2018) dataset were used to validate the developed classification model. The significance of this step is to show that the model is not overtrained for a specific dataset but can also be used on other independent datasets. Again, the highest classification model accuracy for both validating datasets combined was obtained at the genus level of taxonomy (70.98%) and third hierarchical level of KEGG pathways (67.24%). The accuracy of the independent set remained very relevant.Our results demonstrate that the developed classification model provides a good tool that can be used to suggest the presence or absence of MS condition by collecting and analyzing gut microbiome samples. The accuracy of the model can be further increased by using sequencing methods that allow higher taxa resolution (i.e. shotgun metagenomic sequencing).",BMC medical informatics and decision making,2020,Jasminka Hasic Telalovic; Azra Music
32999308,"DJ-1 (Park7) affects the gut microbiome, metabolites and the development of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs).","The proper communication between gut and brain is pivotal for the maintenance of health and, dysregulation of the gut-brain axis can lead to several clinical disorders. In Parkinson's disease (PD) 85% of all patients experienced constipation many years before showing any signs of motor phenotypes. For differential diagnosis and preventive treatment, there is an urgent need for the identification of biomarkers indicating early disease stages long before the disease phenotype manifests. DJ-1 is a chaperone protein involved in the protection against PD and genetic mutations in this protein have been shown to cause familial PD. However, how the deficiency of DJ-1 influences the risk of PD remains incompletely understood. In the present study, we provide evidence that DJ-1 is implicated in shaping the gut microbiome including; their metabolite production, inflammation and innate immune cells (ILCs) development. We revealed that deficiency of DJ-1 leads to a significant increase in two specific genera/species, namely Alistipes and Rikenella. In DJ-1 knock-out (DJ-1<sup>-/-</sup>) mice the production of fecal calprotectin and MCP-1 inflammatory proteins were elevated. Fecal and serum metabolic profile showed that malonate which influences the immune system was significantly more abundant in DJ-1<sup>-/-</sup> mice. DJ-1 appeared also to be involved in ILCs development. Further, inflammatory genes related to PD were augmented in the midbrain of DJ-1<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Our data suggest that metabolites and inflammation produced in the gut could be used as biomarkers for PD detection. Perhaps, these metabolites and inflammatory mediators could be involved in triggering inflammation resulting in PD pathology.",Scientific reports,2020,Yogesh Singh; Christoph Trautwein; Achal Dhariwal; Madhuri S Salker; Md Alauddin; Laimdota Zizmare; Lisann Pelzl; Martina Feger; Jakob Admard; Nicolas Casadei; Michael FÃ¶ller; Vivek Pachauri; David S Park; Tak W Mak; Julia-Stefanie Frick; Diethelm Wallwiener; Sara Y Brucker; Florian Lang; Olaf Riess
32987656,The Pathology of Parkinson's Disease and Potential Benefit of Dietary Polyphenols.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by a loss of dopaminergic neurons, leading to bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor at rest, and postural instability, as well as non-motor symptoms such as olfactory impairment, pain, autonomic dysfunction, impaired sleep, fatigue, and behavioral changes. The pathogenesis of PD is believed to involve oxidative stress, disruption to mitochondria, alterations to the protein Î±-synuclein, and neuroinflammatory processes. There is currently no cure for the disease. Polyphenols are secondary metabolites of plants, which have shown benefit in several experimental models of PD. Intake of polyphenols through diet is also associated with lower PD risk in humans. In this review, we provide an overview of the pathology of PD and the data supporting the potential neuroprotective capacity of increased polyphenols in the diet. Evidence suggests that the intake of dietary polyphenols may inhibit neurodegeneration and the progression of PD. Polyphenols appear to have a positive effect on the gut microbiome, which may decrease inflammation that contributes to the disease. Therefore, a diet rich in polyphenols may decrease the symptoms and increase quality of life in PD patients.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2020,Sunisha Aryal; Taylor Skinner; Bronwyn Bridges; John T Weber
32982910,Gut-Brain Axis: Potential Factors Involved in the Pathogenesis of Parkinson's Disease.,"Increasing evidence suggests an association between gastrointestinal (GI) disorders and susceptibility and progress of Parkinson's disease (PD). Gut-brain axis has been proposed to play important roles in the pathogenesis of PD, though the exact pathophysiologic mechanism has yet to be elucidated. Here, we discuss the common factors involved in both PD and GI disorders, including genes, altered gut microbiota, diet, environmental toxins, and altered mucosal immunity. Large-scale prospective clinical studies are needed to define the exact relationship between dietary factors, microbiome, and genetic factors in PD. Identification of early diagnostic markers and demonstration of the efficacy of diet modulation and regulation of gut microbiome through specific therapeutics can potentially change the treatment paradigm for PD.",Frontiers in neurology,2020,Yin-Xia Chao; Muhammad Yaaseen Gulam; Nicholas Shyh Jenn Chia; Lei Feng; Olaf Rotzschke; Eng-King Tan
32834004,Predictive analysis methods for human microbiome data with application to Parkinson's disease.,"Microbiome data consists of operational taxonomic unit (OTU) counts characterized by zero-inflation, over-dispersion, and grouping structure among samples. Currently, statistical testing methods are commonly performed to identify OTUs that are associated with a phenotype. The limitations of statistical testing methods include that the validity of p-values/q-values depend sensitively on the correctness of models and that the statistical significance does not necessarily imply predictivity. Predictive analysis using methods such as LASSO is an alternative approach for identifying associated OTUs and for measuring the predictability of the phenotype variable with OTUs and other covariate variables. We investigate three strategies of performing predictive analysis: (1) LASSO: fitting a LASSO multinomial logistic regression model to all OTU counts with specific transformation; (2) screening+GLM: screening OTUs with q-values returned by fitting a GLMM to each OTU, then fitting a GLM model using a subset of selected OTUs; (3) screening+LASSO: fitting a LASSO to a subset of OTUs selected with GLMM. We have conducted empirical studies using three simulation datasets generated using Dirichlet-multinomial models and a real gut microbiome data related to Parkinson's disease to investigate the performance of the three strategies for predictive analysis. Our simulation studies show that the predictive performance of LASSO with appropriate variable transformation works remarkably well on zero-inflated data. Our results of real data analysis show that Parkinson's disease can be predicted based on selected OTUs after the binary transformation, age, and sex with high accuracy (Error Rate = 0.199, AUC = 0.872, AUPRC = 0.912). These results provide strong evidences of the relationship between Parkinson's disease and the gut microbiome.",PloS one,2020,Mei Dong; Longhai Li; Man Chen; Anthony Kusalik; Wei Xu
32791113,The Microbiome as a Modifier of Neurodegenerative Disease Risk.,"The gut microbiome is increasingly implicated in modifying susceptibility to and progression of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). In this review, we discuss roles for the microbiome in aging and in NDs. In particular, we summarize findings from human studies on microbiome alterations in Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington's disease. We assess animal studies of genetic and environmental models for NDs that investigate how manipulations of the microbiome causally impact the development of behavioral and neuropathological endophenotypes of disease. We additionally evaluate the likely immunological, neuronal, and metabolic mechanisms for how the gut microbiota may modulate risk for NDs. Finally, we speculate on cross-cutting features for microbial influences across multiple NDs and consider the potential for microbiome-targeted interventions for NDs.",Cell host & microbe,2020,P Fang; S A Kazmi; K G Jameson; E Y Hsiao
32600151,Rapid improvement in Alzheimer's disease symptoms following fecal microbiota transplantation: a case report.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is a leading cause of death and a major cause of morbidity in older people. The disease is characterized by progressive memory loss, cognitive impairment, and the cerebral accumulation of amyloid-Î² peptide. Given the health and economic impacts of AD, treatments that target the underlying etiology of AD or modify the course of the disease are of significant interest. The gut microbiome has been increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, emerging evidence has demonstrated that there are alterations in gut microbiome composition in patients with AD, suggesting involvement of the microbiome-gut-brain axis. We present symptom improvement in a patient with AD following fecal microbiota transplantation for a <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> infection.",The Journal of international medical research,2020,Sabine Hazan
32572814,Butyrate Protects Against Salsolinol-Induced Toxicity in SH-SY5Y Cells: Implication for Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is associated with the destruction of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and the formation of Lewy bodies in basal ganglia. Risk factors for PD include aging, as well as environmental and genetic factors. Recent converging reports suggest a role for the gut microbiome and epigenetic factors in the onset and/or progression of PD. Of particular relevance and potential therapeutic targets in this regard are histone deacetylases (HDACs), enzymes that are involved in chromatin remodeling. Butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid (FA) produced in the gut and presumably acting via several G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) including FA3 receptors (FA3Rs), is a well-known HDAC inhibitor that plays an important role in maintaining homeostasis of the gut-brain axis. Recently, its significance in regulation of some critical brain functions and usefulness in neurodegenerative diseases such as PD has been suggested. In this study we sought to determine whether butyrate may have protective effects against salsolionl (SALS)-induced toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. SALS, an endogenous product of aldehyde and dopamine condensation, may be selectively toxic to dopaminergic neurons. SH-SY5Y cells, derived from human neuroblastoma cells, are used as a model of these neurons. Exposure of SH-SY5Y cells for 24Â h to 400Â Î¼M SALS resulted in approximately 60% cell death, which was concentration-dependently prevented by butyrate. The effects of butyrate in turn were significantly attenuated by beta-hydroxy butyrate (BHB), a selective FA3R antagonist. Moreover, a selective FA3R agonist (AR 420626) also provided protective effects against SALS, which was totally blocked by BHB. These findings provide further support that butyrate or an agonist of FA3R may be of therapeutic potential in PD.",Neurotoxicity research,2020,Bruk Getachew; Antonei B Csoka; Amna Bhatti; Robert L Copeland; Yousef Tizabi
32566740,Characterizing dysbiosis of gut microbiome in PD: evidence for overabundance of opportunistic pathogens.,"In Parkinson's disease (PD), gastrointestinal features are common and often precede the motor signs. Braak and colleagues proposed that PD may start in the gut, triggered by a pathogen, and spread to the brain. Numerous studies have examined the gut microbiome in PD; all found it to be altered, but found inconsistent results on associated microorganisms. Studies to date have been small (<i>N</i>â=â20 to 306) and are difficult to compare or combine due to varied methodology. We conducted a microbiome-wide association study (MWAS) with two large datasets for internal replication (<i>N</i>â=â333 and 507). We used uniform methodology when possible, interrogated confounders, and applied two statistical tests for concordance, followed by correlation network analysis to infer interactions. Fifteen genera were associated with PD at a microbiome-wide significance level, in both datasets, with both methods, with or without covariate adjustment. The associations were not independent, rather they represented three clusters of co-occurring microorganisms. Cluster 1 was composed of opportunistic pathogens and all were elevated in PD. Cluster 2 was short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria and all were reduced in PD. Cluster 3 was carbohydrate-metabolizing probiotics and were elevated in PD. Depletion of anti-inflammatory SCFA-producing bacteria and elevated levels of probiotics are confirmatory. Overabundance of opportunistic pathogens is an original finding and their identity provides a lead to experimentally test their role in PD.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2020,Zachary D Wallen; Mary Appah; Marissa N Dean; Cheryl L Sesler; Stewart A Factor; Eric Molho; Cyrus P Zabetian; David G Standaert; Haydeh Payami
32545788,Focus on the Role of NLRP3 Inflammasome in Diseases.,"Inflammation is a protective reaction activated in response to detrimental stimuli, such as dead cells, irritants or pathogens, by the evolutionarily conserved immune system and is regulated by the host. The inflammasomes are recognized as innate immune system sensors and receptors that manage the activation of caspase-1 and stimulate inflammation response. They have been associated with several inflammatory disorders. The NLRP3 inflammasome is the most well characterized. It is so called because NLRP3 belongs to the family of nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain-like receptors (NLRs). Recent evidence has greatly improved our understanding of the mechanisms by which the NLRP3 inflammasome is activated. Additionally, increasing data in animal models, supported by human studies, strongly implicate the involvement of the inflammasome in the initiation or progression of disorders with a high impact on public health, such as metabolic pathologies (obesity, type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis), cardiovascular diseases (ischemic and non-ischemic heart disease), inflammatory issues (liver diseases, inflammatory bowel diseases, gut microbiome, rheumatoid arthritis) and neurologic disorders (Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other neurological disorders), compared to other molecular platforms. This review will provide a focus on the available knowledge about the NLRP3 inflammasome role in these pathologies and describe the balance between the activation of the harmful and beneficial inflammasome so that new therapies can be created for patients with these diseases.",International journal of molecular sciences,2020,Roberta Fusco; Rosalba Siracusa; Tiziana Genovese; Salvatore Cuzzocrea; Rosanna Di Paola
32538869,Crosstalk Between Alpha-Synuclein and Other Human and Non-Human Amyloidogenic Proteins: Consequences for Amyloid Formation in Parkinson's Disease.,"It was recently shown (Sampson et al., Elife9, 2020) that an amyloidogenic protein, CsgA, present in E. coli biofilms in the gut can trigger Parkinson's disease in mice. This study emphasizes the possible role of the gut microbiome in modulation (and even initiation) of human neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease. As the CsgA protein was found to accelerate alpha-synuclein (the key amyloidogenic protein in Parkinson's disease) amyloid formation in vitro, this result suggests that also other amyloidogenic proteins from gut bacteria, and even from the diet (such as stable allergenic proteins), may be able to affect human protein conformations and thereby modulate amyloid-related diseases. In this review, we summarize what has been reported in terms of in vitro cross-reactivity studies between alpha-synuclein and other amyloidogenic human and non-human proteins. It becomes clear from the limited data that exist that there is a fine line between acceleration and inhibition, but that cross-reactivity is widespread, and it is more common for other proteins (among the studied cases) to accelerate alpha-synuclein amyloid formation than to block it. It is of high importance to expand investigations of cross-reactivity between amyloidogenic proteins to both reveal underlying mechanisms and links between human diseases, as well as to develop new treatments that may be based on an altered gut microbiome.",Journal of Parkinson's disease,2020,Tony Werner; Istvan Horvath; Pernilla Wittung-Stafshede

To date, no disease modifying treatment for PD exists. Here, the study protocol of the Dutch Parkinson Cohort (DUPARC) is described. DUPARC is a longitudinal cohort study aimed at deeply phenotyping de novo PD patients who are treatment-naÃ¯ve at baseline, to discover and validate biomarkers for PD progression, subtypes and pathophysiology.DUPARC is a prospective cohort study in which 150 de novo PD subjects will be recruited through a collaborative network of PD treating neurologists in the northern part of the Netherlands (Parkinson Platform Northern Netherlands, PPNN). Participants will receive follow-up assessments after 1âyear and 3âyears, with the intention of an extended follow-up with 3âyear intervals. Subjects are extensively characterized to primarily assess objectives within three major domains of PD: cognition, gastrointestinal function and vision. This includes brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); brain cholinergic PET-imaging with fluoroethoxybenzovesamicol (FEOBV-PET); brain dopaminergic PET-imaging with fluorodopa (FDOPA-PET); detailed neuropsychological assessments, covering all cognitive domains; gut microbiome composition; intestinal wall permeability; optical coherence tomography (OCT); genotyping; motor and non-motor symptoms; overall clinical status and lifestyle factors, including a dietary assessment; storage of blood and feces for additional analyses of inflammation and metabolic parameters. Since the start of the inclusion, at the end of 2017, over 100 PD subjects with a confirmed dopaminergic deficit on FDOPA-PET have been included.DUPARC is the first study to combine data within, but not limited to, the non-motor domains of cognition, gastrointestinal function and vision in PD subjects over time.

32517799,Parkinson's disease-associated alterations of the gut microbiome predict disease-relevant changes in metabolic functions.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a systemic disease clinically defined by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the brain. While alterations in the gut microbiome composition have been reported in PD, their functional consequences remain unclear. Herein, we addressed this question by an analysis of stool samples from the Luxembourg Parkinson's Study (nâ=â147 typical PD cases, nâ=â162 controls).All individuals underwent detailed clinical assessment, including neurological examinations and neuropsychological tests followed by self-reporting questionnaires. Stool samples from these individuals were first analysed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.Â Second, we predicted the potential secretion for 129 microbial metabolites through personalised metabolic modelling using the microbiome data and genome-scale metabolic reconstructions of human gut microbes. Our key results include the following. Eight genera and seven species changed significantly in their relative abundances between PD patients and healthy controls. PD-associated microbial patterns statistically depended on sex, age, BMI, and constipation. Particularly,Â the relative abundances of Bilophila and Paraprevotella were significantly associated with the Hoehn and Yahr staging after controlling for the disease duration. Furthermore, personalised metabolic modelling of the gut microbiomes revealed PD-associated metabolic patterns in the predicted secretion potential of nine microbial metabolites in PD, including increased methionine and cysteinylglycine. The predicted microbial pantothenic acid production potential was linked to the presence of specific non-motor symptoms.Our results suggest that PD-associated alterations of the gut microbiome can translate into substantial functional differences affecting host metabolism and disease phenotype.",BMC biology,2020,Federico Baldini; Johannes Hertel; Estelle Sandt; Cyrille C Thinnes; Lorieza Neuberger-Castillo; Lukas Pavelka; Fay Betsou; Rejko KrÃ¼ger; Ines Thiele; 
32459513,The dichotomous role of the gut microbiome in exacerbating and ameliorating neurodegenerative disorders.,"Age related neurodegenerative disorders affect millions of people around the world. The role of the gut microbiome (GM) in neurodegenerative disorders has been elucidated over the past few years. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiome ultimately results in neurodegeneration. However, the gut microbiome can be modulated to promote neuro-resilience.This review is focused on demonstrating the role of the gut microbiome in host physiology in Parkinson's disease (PD) and other neurodegenerative disorders. We will discuss how the microbiome will impact neurodegeneration in PD, Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Multiple sclerosis (MS), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), and finally discuss how the gut microbiome can be influenced through diet and lifestyle.Currently, much of the focus has been to study the mechanisms by which the microbiome induces neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in PD, AD, MS, ALS. In particular, the role of certain dietary flavonoids in regulation of gut microbiome to promote neuro-resilience.

32456274,Anti-aggregation Effects of Phenolic Compounds on Î±-synuclein.,"The aggregation and deposition of Î±-synuclein (Î±S) are major pathologic features of Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and other Î±-synucleinopathies. The propagation of Î±S pathology in the brain plays a key role in the onset and progression of clinical phenotypes. Thus, there is increasing interest in developing strategies that attenuate Î±S aggregation and propagation. Based on cumulative evidence that Î±S oligomers are neurotoxic and critical species in the pathogenesis of Î±-synucleinopathies, we and other groups reported that phenolic compounds inhibit Î±S aggregation including oligomerization, thereby ameliorating Î±S oligomer-induced cellular and synaptic toxicities. Heterogeneity in gut microbiota may influence the efficacy of dietary polyphenol metabolism. Our recent studies on the brain-penetrating polyphenolic acids 3-hydroxybenzoic acid (3-HBA), 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (3,4-diHBA), and 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (3-HPPA), which are derived from gut microbiota-based metabolism of dietary polyphenols, demonstrated an in vitro ability to inhibit Î±S oligomerization and mediate aggregated Î±S-induced neurotoxicity. Additionally, 3-HPPA, 3,4-diHBA, 3-HBA, and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid significantly attenuated intracellular Î±S seeding aggregation in a cell-based system. This review focuses on recent research developments regarding neuroprotective properties, especially anti-Î±S aggregation effects, of phenolic compounds and their metabolites by the gut microbiome, including our findings in the pathogenesis of Î±-synucleinopathies.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2020,Kenjiro Ono; Mayumi Tsuji; Tritia R Yamasaki; Giulio M Pasinetti

The spread of Î±-syn pathology across brain regions is thought to play a key role in the onset and progression of clinical phenotypes. Thus, there is increasing interest in developing strategies that target and attenuate Î±-syn aggregation and spread. Recent studies of brain-penetrating polyphenolic acids, namely, 3-hydroxybenzoic acid (3-HBA), 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (3,4-diHBA), and 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid (3-HPPA) that are derived from gut microbiota metabolism of dietary polyphenols, show <i>in vitro</i> ability to effectively modulate Î±-syn misfolding, oligomerization, and mediate aggregated Î±-syn neurotoxicity. Here we investigate whether 3-HBA, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4-HBA), 3,4-diHBA, or 3-HPPA interfere with Î±-syn spreading in a cell-based system. Using HEK293 cells overexpressing Î±-syn-A53T-CFP/YFP, we assessed Î±-syn seeding activity using Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) to detect and quantify Î±-syn aggregation. We demonstrated that 3-HPPA, 3,4-diHBA, 3-HBA, and 4-HBA significantly attenuated intracellular Î±-syn seeding aggregation. To determine whether our compounds could inhibit brain-derived seeding activity, we utilized insoluble Î±-syn extracted from post-mortem MSA or PD brain specimens. We found that 3-HPPA effectively attenuated MSA-induced aggregation of monomer into high molecular weight aggregates capable of inducing intracellular aggregation. Outcomes from our studies suggest interactions between gut microbiome and certain dietary factors may form the basis for effective therapies that modulate pathologic Î±-syn propagation. Collectively, our findings provide the basis for future developments of probiotic, prebiotic, or synbiotic approaches for modulating the onset and/or progression of Î±-synucleinopathies.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2020,Tritia R Yamasaki; Kenjiro Ono; Lap Ho; Giulio M Pasinetti
32399169,Long-Term Use of Antibiotics and Risk of Parkinson's Disease in the Nurses' Health Study.,"Antibiotic use is one of the strongest environmental predictors of an altered and less diverse gut microbiome, which has been linked to Parkinson's disease. To our knowledge, no prior study has examined the association between long-term antibiotic use and Parkinson's disease.We conducted a prospective study of 59,637 women in the Nurses' Health Study who reported total duration of antibiotic use at ages 20-39, 40-59, 60â+, or during the past 4 years. We used Cox Proportional Hazard regression to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the association between categories of antibiotic use and risk of PD.One hundred and eighty cases of PD were confirmed during the follow-up. Self-reported antibiotic use at ages 20-39, 40-59, and 60â+, as assessed in 2004, was not significantly associated with PD risk in our cohort. The hazard ratio comparing participants who used antibiotics for 2 or more months vs. 1-14 days at age 20-39 was 0.98 (95% CI: 0.54, 1.78), at age 40-59 was 1.44 (95% CI: 0.88, 2.33), and at age 60â+was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.53, 1.47). Antibiotic use during the past four years, as assessed in 2008, was also not associated with future risk of PD (HR: 1.14, 95% CI: 0.62, 2.10).In this cohort study, we did not observe a significant association between antibiotic use and incidence PD. A major limitation of our study is assessment of exposure, which required many participants to recall their antibiotic use decades in the past. Thus, although the results of this study do not support an effect of antibiotic use on PD risk, larger investigations relying on records of antibiotic prescriptions would provide more definitive evidence.",Parkinson's disease,2020,Natalia Palacios; Ãilis J O'Reilly; Michael A Schwarzschild; Alberto Ascherio
32155131,Effects of the probiotic formulation SLAB51 in <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> Parkinson's disease models.,"Parkinson is a common neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms, including abnormalities in the gut function, which may appear before the motor sign. To date, there are treatments that can help relieve Parkinson' disease (PD)-associated symptoms, but there is no cure to control the onset and progression of this disorder. Altered components of the gut could represent a key role in gut-brain axis, which is a bidirectional system between the central nervous system and the enteric nervous system. Diet can alter the microbiota composition, affecting gut-brain axis function. Gut microbiome restoration through selected probiotics' administration has been reported. In this study, we investigated the effects of the novel formulation SLAB51 in PD. Our findings indicate that this probiotic formulation can counteract the detrimental effect of 6-OHDA <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> models of PD. The results suggest that SLAB51 can be a promising candidate for the prevention or as coadjuvant treatment of PD.",Aging,2020,Vanessa Castelli; Michele d'Angelo; Francesca Lombardi; Margherita Alfonsetti; Andrea Antonosante; Mariano Catanesi; Elisabetta Benedetti; Paola Palumbo; Maria Grazia Cifone; Antonio Giordano; Giovambattista Desideri; Annamaria Cimini

Although whole metagenome sequencing promises enough raw data to study those changes, existing tools are limited in their ability to directly compare microbial metabolic function across samples and studies. We introduce Carnelian, an end-to-end pipeline for metabolic functional profiling uniquely suited to finding functional trends across diverse datasets. Carnelian is able to find shared metabolic pathways, concordant functional dysbioses, and distinguish Enzyme Commission (EC) terms missed by existing methodologies.

32041265,Interventional Influence of the Intestinal Microbiome Through Dietary Intervention and Bowel Cleansing Might Improve Motor Symptoms in Parkinson's Disease.,"The impact of the gut microbiome is being increasingly appreciated in health and in various chronic diseases, among them neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). In the pathogenesis of PD, the role of the gut has been previously established. In conjunction with a better understanding of the intestinal microbiome, a link to the misfolding and spread of alpha-synuclein via inflammatory processes within the gut is discussed. In a case-control study, we assessed the gut microbiome of 54 PD patients and 32 healthy controls (HC). Additionally, we tested in this proof-of-concept study whether dietary intervention alone or additional physical colon cleaning may lead to changes of the gut microbiome in PD. 16 PD patients underwent a well-controlled balanced, ovo-lacto vegetarian diet intervention including short fatty acids for 14 days. 10 of those patients received additional treatment with daily fecal enema over 8 days. Stool samples were collected before and after 14 days of intervention. In comparison to HC, we could confirm previously reported PD associated microbiome changes. The UDPRS III significantly improved and the levodopa-equivalent daily dose decreased after vegetarian diet and fecal enema in a one-year follow-up. Additionally, we observed a significant association between the gut microbiome diversity and the UPDRS III and the abundance of <i>Ruminococcaceae</i>. Additionally, the abundance of <i>Clostridiaceae</i> was significantly reduced after enema. Dietary intervention and bowel cleansing may provide an additional non-pharmacologic therapeutic option for PD patients.",Cells,2020,Tobias Hegelmaier; Marco Lebbing; Alexander Duscha; Laura Tomaske; Lars TÃ¶nges; Jacob Bak Holm; Henrik BjÃ¸rn Nielsen; SÃ¶ren G Gatermann; Horst Przuntek; Aiden Haghikia
31998605,The gut microbiome: an orchestrator of xenobiotic metabolism.,"Microbes inhabiting the intestinal tract of humans represent a site for xenobiotic metabolism. The gut microbiome, the collection of microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract, can alter the metabolic outcome of pharmaceuticals, environmental toxicants, and heavy metals, thereby changing their pharmacokinetics. Direct chemical modification of xenobiotics by the gut microbiome, either through the intestinal tract or re-entering the gut <i>via</i> enterohepatic circulation, can lead to increased metabolism or bioactivation, depending on the enzymatic activity within the microbial niche. Unique enzymes encoded within the microbiome include those that reverse the modifications imparted by host detoxification pathways. Additionally, the microbiome can limit xenobiotic absorption in the small intestine by increasing the expression of cell-cell adhesion proteins, supporting the protective mucosal layer, and/or directly sequestering chemicals. Lastly, host gene expression is regulated by the microbiome, including CYP450s, multi-drug resistance proteins, and the transcription factors that regulate them. While the microbiome affects the host and pharmacokinetics of the xenobiotic, xenobiotics can also influence the viability and metabolism of the microbiome. Our understanding of the complex interconnectedness between host, microbiome, and metabolism will advance with new modeling systems, technology development and refinement, and mechanistic studies focused on the contribution of human and microbial metabolism.",Acta pharmaceutica Sinica.

31954994,Dysbiosis in Parkinson's disease might be triggered by certain antibiotics.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative amyloid disorder with debilitating motor symptoms due to the loss of dopamine-synthesizing, basal ganglia-projecting neurons in the substantia nigra. An interesting feature of the disease is that most of PD patients have gastrointestinal problems and bacterial dysbiosis, years before the full expression of motor symptoms. We hypothesized that antibiotic consumption might be a contributing factor of gut microbiome dysbiosis in PD, favoring curli-producing Enterobacteria. Curli is a bacterial Î±-synuclein (Î±Syn) which is deposited first in the enteric nervous system and amyloid deposits are propagated in a prion like manner to the central nervous system. In addition, antibiotics result in a low-grade systemic inflammation, which also contributes to damage of neurons in enteric- and central nervous system. To support our hypothesis, by comparing PD prevalence change with antibiotic consumption data in EU countries, we found significant positive correlation between use narrow spectrum penicillinÂ +Â penicillinase resistant penicillin and increased prevalence of the disease.",Medical hypotheses,2020,GÃ¡bor TernÃ¡k; DÃ¡niel Kuti; Krisztina J KovÃ¡cs
31952509,The progress of gut microbiome research related to brain disorders.,"There is increasing evidence showing that the dynamic changes in the gut microbiota can alter brain physiology and behavior. Cognition was originally thought to be regulated only by the central nervous system. However, it is now becoming clear that many non-nervous system factors, including the gut-resident bacteria of the gastrointestinal tract, regulate and influence cognitive dysfunction as well as the process of neurodegeneration and cerebrovascular diseases. Extrinsic and intrinsic factors including dietary habits can regulate the composition of the microbiota. Microbes release metabolites and microbiota-derived molecules to further trigger host-derived cytokines and inflammation in the central nervous system, which contribute greatly to the pathogenesis of host brain disorders such as pain, depression, anxiety, autism, Alzheimer's diseases, Parkinson's disease, and stroke. Change of blood-brain barrier permeability, brain vascular physiology, and brain structure are among the most critical causes of the development of downstream neurological dysfunction.

Here, we report that the Bacillus subtilis probiotic strain PXN21 inhibits Î±-synuclein aggregation and clears preformed aggregates in an established Caenorhabditis elegans model of synucleinopathy. This protection is seen in young and aging animals and is partly mediated by DAF-16. Multiple B.Â subtilis strains trigger the protective effect via both spores and vegetative cells, partly due to a biofilm formation in the gut of the worms and the release of bacterial metabolites. We identify several host metabolic pathways differentially regulated in response to probiotic exposure, including sphingolipid metabolism. We further demonstrate functional roles of the sphingolipid metabolism genes lagr-1, asm-3, and sptl-3 in the anti-aggregation effect.

In recent years, more attention has been given to the gut as a key player in the initiation and progression of PD pathology. Several studies characterizing changes in the microbiome, particularly the gut microbiome, have been conducted. Although many studies found a decrease in the bacterial family Prevotellaceae and in butyrate-producing bacterial genera such as Roseburia and Faecalibacteria, and an increase in the genera Akkermansia many of the studies reported contradictory findings.

Gut bacteria produce neuroactive compounds and can modulate neuronal function, plasticity and behavior. Furthermore, intestinal microorganisms impact the host's metabolism and immune status which in turn affect neuronal pathways in the enteric and central nervous systems.

31749671,Enriched Environmental Conditions Modify the Gut Microbiome Composition and Fecal Markers of Inflammation in Parkinson's Disease.,"Recent findings suggest an implication of the gut microbiome in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. PD onset and progression has also been linked with various environmental factors such as physical activity, exposure to pesticides, head injury, nicotine, and dietary factors. In this study, we used a mouse model, overexpressing the complete human SNCA gene (SNCA-TG mice) modeling familial and sporadic forms of PD to study whether environmental conditions such as standard <i>vs.</i> enriched environment changes the gut microbiome and influences disease progression. We performed 16S rRNA DNA sequencing on fecal samples for microbiome analysis and studied fecal inflammatory calprotectin from the colon of control and SNCA-TG mice kept under standard environment (SE) and enriched environment (EE) conditions. The overall composition of the gut microbiota was not changed in SNCA-TG mice compared with WT in EE with respect to SE. However, individual gut bacteria at genus level such as <i>Lactobacillus</i> sp. was a significant changed in the SNCA-TG mice. EE significantly reduced colon fecal inflammatory calprotectin protein in WT and SNCA-TG EE compared to SE. Moreover, EE reduces the pro-inflammatory cytokines in the feces and inflammation inducing genes in the colon. Our data suggest that an enriched social environment has a positive effect on the induction of SNCA mediated inflammation in the intestine and by modulating anti-inflammatory gut bacteria.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2019,Yogesh Singh; Mohamed El-Hadidi; Jakob Admard; Zinah Wassouf; Julia M Schulze-Hentrich; Ursula Kohlhofer; Leticia Quintanilla-Martinez; Daniel Huson; Olaf Riess; Nicolas Casadei
31745471,Gut Vibes in Parkinson's Disease: The Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis.,"The complexity of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD) is attributable to multifactorial changes occurring at a molecular level, influenced by genetics and environmental interactions. However, what causes the main hallmarks of PD is not well understood. Recent data increasingly suggest that imbalances in the gut microbiome composition might trigger and/or exacerbate the progression of PD.The present review aims to (1) report emerging literature showing changes in microbiota composition of PD patients compared to healthy individuals and (2) discuss how these changes may initiate and/or perpetuate PD pathology.We analyzed 13 studies published from 2015 and included in this review. Altered microbial taxa were compiled in a detailed table summarizing bacterial changes in fecal/mucosal samples. The methodology was systematically reviewed across the articles and was also included in a table to facilitate comparisons between studies.Multiple studies found a reduction in short-chain fatty-acid-producing bacteria that can rescue neuronal damage through epigenetic mechanisms. Overall, the studies showed that changes in the gut microbiota composition might influence colonic inflammation, gut permeability, and Î±-synuclein aggregation, contributing to the neurogenerative process.Further studies with larger cohorts and high-resolution sequencing methods are required to better define gut microbiota changes in PD. Furthermore, additional longitudinal studies are required to determine the causal link between these changes and PD pathogenesis as well as to study the potential of the intestinal microbiota as a biomarker.",Movement disorders clinical practice,2019,Clara Bullich; Ali Keshavarzian; Johan Garssen; Aletta Kraneveld; Paula Perez-Pardo

31609697,The Appendix in Parkinson's Disease: From Vestigial Remnant to Vital Organ?,"Parkinson's disease (PD) has long been considered a brain disease, but studies now point to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract as a potential starting point for PD. In particular, the human vermiform appendix has been implicated in PD. The appendix is a tissue rich in immune cells, serving as part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue and as a storehouse for the gut microbiome. The functions of the appendix converge with recent evidence demonstrating that gut inflammation and shifts in the microbiome are linked to PD. Some epidemiological studies have linked removal of the appendix to lowered PD risk, though there is controversy among these associations. What is apparent is that there is an abundance of aggregated forms of Î±-synuclein in the appendix relevant to PD pathology. Î±-Synuclein pathology is thought to propagate from gut to brain via the vagus nerve, which innervates GI tract locations, including the appendix. Remarkably, Î±-synuclein aggregates in the appendix occur not only in PD patients, but are also present in healthy individuals. This has led to the proposal that in the appendix Î±-synuclein aggregates are not unique to PD. Moreover, the molecular events leading to PD and the mechanisms by which Î±-synuclein aggregates transfers from gut to brain may be identifiable in the human appendix. The influence of the appendix on GI inflammation, autoimmunity, microbiome storage, and the lymphatic system may be yet unexplored mechanisms by which the appendix contributes to PD. Overall, the appendix represents a promising tissue site to advance our understanding of PD pathobiology.",Journal of Parkinson's disease,2019,Bryan Killinger; Viviane Labrie
31596658,"""Photobiomics"": Can Light, Including Photobiomodulation, Alter the Microbiome?","<b><i>Objective</i>:</b> The objective of this review is to consider the dual effects of microbiome and photobiomodulation (PBM) on human health and to suggest a relationship between these two as a novel mechanism. <b><i>Background</i>:</b> PBM describes the use of low levels of visible or near-infrared (NIR) light to heal and stimulate tissue, and to relieve pain and inflammation. In recent years, PBM has been applied to the head as an investigative approach to treat diverse brain diseases such as stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI), Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and psychiatric disorders. Also, in recent years, increasing attention has been paid to the total microbial population that colonizes the human body, chiefly in the gut and the mouth, called the microbiome. It is known that the composition and health of the gut microbiome affects many diseases related to metabolism, obesity, cardiovascular disorders, autoimmunity, and even brain disorders. <b><i>Materials and methods</i>:</b> A literature search was conducted for published reports on the effect of light on the microbiome. <b><i>Results</i>:</b> Recent work by our research group has demonstrated that PBM (red and NIR light) delivered to the abdomen in mice, can alter the gut microbiome in a potentially beneficial way. This has also now been demonstrated in human subjects. <b><i>Conclusions</i>:</b> In consideration of the known effects of PBM on metabolomics, and the now demonstrated effects of PBM on the microbiome, as well as other effects of light on the microbiome, including modulating circadian rhythms, the present perspective introduces a new term ""photobiomics"" and looks forward to the application of PBM to influence the microbiome in humans.

31519175,The endotoxin hypothesis of neurodegeneration.,"The endotoxin hypothesis of neurodegeneration is the hypothesis that endotoxin causes or contributes to neurodegeneration. Endotoxin is a lipopolysaccharide (LPS), constituting much of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, present at high concentrations in gut, gums and skin and in other tissue during bacterial infection. Blood plasma levels of endotoxin are normally low, but are elevated during infections, gut inflammation, gum disease and neurodegenerative disease. Adding endotoxin at such levels to blood of healthy humans induces systemic inflammation and brain microglial activation. Adding high levels of endotoxin to the blood or body of rodents induces microglial activation, priming and/or tolerance, memory deficits and loss of brain synapses and neurons. Endotoxin promotes amyloid Î² and tau aggregation and neuropathology, suggesting the possibility that endotoxin synergises with different aggregable proteins to give different neurodegenerative diseases. Blood and brain endotoxin levels are elevated in Alzheimer's disease, which is accelerated by systemic infections, including gum disease. Endotoxin binds directly to APOE, and the APOE4 variant both sensitises to endotoxin and predisposes to Alzheimer's disease. Intestinal permeability increases early in Parkinson's disease, and injection of endotoxin into mice induces Î±-synuclein production and aggregation, as well as loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. The gut microbiome changes in Parkinson's disease, and changing the endotoxin-producing bacterial species can affect the disease in patients and mouse models. Blood endotoxin is elevated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and endotoxin promotes TDP-43 aggregation and neuropathology. Peripheral diseases that elevate blood endotoxin, such as sepsis, AIDS and liver failure, also result in neurodegeneration. Endotoxin directly and indirectly activates microglia that damage neurons via nitric oxide, oxidants and cytokines, and by phagocytosis of synapses and neurons. The endotoxin hypothesis is unproven, but if correct, then neurodegeneration may be reduced by decreasing endotoxin levels or endotoxin-induced neuroinflammation.",Journal of neuroinflammation,2019,Guy C Brown
31505196,MitoPark transgenic mouse model recapitulates the gastrointestinal dysfunction and gut-microbiome changes of Parkinson's disease.,"Gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances are one of the earliest symptoms affecting most patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). In many cases, these symptoms are observed years before motor impairments become apparent. Hence, the molecular and cellular underpinnings that contribute to this early GI dysfunction in PD have actively been explored using a relevant animal model. The MitoPark model is a chronic, progressive mouse model recapitulating several key pathophysiological aspects of PD. However, GI dysfunction and gut microbiome changes have not been categorized in this model. Herein, we show that decreased GI motility was one of the first non-motor symptoms to develop, evident as early as 8 weeks with significantly different transit times from 12 weeks onwards. These symptoms were observed well before motor symptoms developed, thereby paralleling PD progression in humans. At age 24 weeks, we observed increased colon transit time and reduced fecal water content, indicative of constipation. Intestinal inflammation was evidenced with increased expression of iNOS and TNFÎ± in the small and large intestine. Specifically, iNOS was observed mainly in the enteric plexi, indicating enteric glial cell activation. A pronounced loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons occurred at 24 weeks both in the mid-brain region as well as the gut, leading to a corresponding decrease in dopamine (DA) production. We also observed decreased DARPP-32 expression in the colon, validating the loss of DAergic neurons in the gut. However, the total number of enteric neurons did not significantly differ between the two groups. Metabolomic gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of fecal samples showed increased sterol, glycerol, and tocopherol production in MitoPark mice compared to age-matched littermate controls at 20 weeks of age while 16â¯s microbiome sequencing showed a transient temporal increase in the genus Prevotella. Altogether, the data shed more light on the role of the gut dopaminergic system in maintaining intestinal health. Importantly, this model recapitulates the chronology and development of GI dysfunction along with other non-motor symptoms and can become an attractive translational animal model for pre-clinical assessment of the efficacy of new anti-Parkinsonian drugs that can alleviate GI dysfunction in PD.",Neurotoxicology,2019,Shivani Ghaisas; Monica R Langley; Bharathi N Palanisamy; Somak Dutta; Kirthi Narayanaswamy; Paul J Plummer; Souvarish Sarkar; Muhammet Ay; Huajun Jin; Vellareddy Anantharam; Arthi Kanthasamy; Anumantha G Kanthasamy
31498131,Increasing Comparability and Utility of Gut Microbiome Studies in Parkinson's Disease: A Systematic Review.,"Gut microbiota have been studied in relation to the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) due to the early gastrointestinal symptomatology and presence of alpha-synuclein pathology in the enteric nervous system, hypothesized to ascend via the vagal nerve to the central nervous system. Accordingly, sixteen human case-control studies have published gut microbiome composition changes in PD and reported over 100 differentially abundant taxa covering all taxonomic levels from phylum to genus or species, depending on methodology. While certain findings were replicated across several studies, various contradictory findings were reported. Here, differences in methodologies and the presence of possible confounders in the study populations are assessed for their potential to confound the results of gut microbiome studies in PD. Gut microbiome studies in PD exhibited considerable variability with respect to the study population, sample transport conditions, laboratory protocols and sequencing, bioinformatics pipelines, and biostatistical methods. To move from the current heterogeneous dataset towards clinically relevant biomarkers and the identification of putative therapeutic targets, recommendations are derived from the limitations of the available studies to increase the future comparability of microbiome studies in PD. In addition, integration of currently available data on the gut microbiome in PD is proposed to identify robust gut microbiome profiles in PD. Furthermore, expansion of the current dataset with atypical parkinsonism cohorts, prodromal and treatment-naÃ¯ve de novo PD subjects, measurements of fecal microbial concentrations and multi-omics assessments are required to provide clinically relevant biomarkers and reveal therapeutic targets within the gut microbiome of PD.",Journal of Parkinson's disease,2019,Jeffrey M Boertien; Pedro A B Pereira; Velma T E Aho; Filip Scheperjans
31440136,Altered Gut Microbiome in Parkinson's Disease and the Influence of Lipopolysaccharide in a Human Î±-Synuclein Over-Expressing Mouse Model.,"The interaction between the gut microbiota and alpha-synuclein (Î±Syn) aggregation in Parkinson's disease (PD) is receiving increasing attention. The objective of this study was to investigate gut microbiota, and effects of an inflammatory lipopolysaccharide (LPS) trigger in a human Î±Syn over-expressing mouse model of PD (Thy1-Î±Syn). Stool samples from patients with confirmed PD and Thy1-Î±Syn mice were analyzed using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. Compared to healthy controls, the relative abundance of mucin-degrading Verrucomicrobiae and LPS-producing Gammaproteobacteria were greater in PD patients. In mice, the abundance of Gammaproteobacteria was negligible in both Thy1-Î±Syn and wild-type (WT) animals, while Verrucomicrobiae were reduced in Thy1-Î±Syn mice. The effect of LPS on intestinal barrier function was investigated <i>in vitro</i> using intestinal epithelial (IEC-6) cells, and <i>in vivo</i> via administration of LPS in drinking water to Thy1-Î±Syn mice. Acute exposure to LPS <i>in vitro</i> resulted in a reduction and altered distribution of the tight junction markers ZO-1 and e-Cadherin around the cell membrane in IEC-6 cells, as shown by immunohistochemistry. LPS administration in Thy1-Î±Syn mice resulted in the emergence of early motor manifestations at 10 weeks, compared to untreated mice who were still asymptomatic at this age.

31327219,"Parkinson's Disease: The Emerging Role of Gut Dysbiosis, Antibiotics, Probiotics, and Fecal Microbiota Transplantation.","The role of the microbiome in health and human disease has emerged at the forefront of medicine in the 21st century. Over the last 2 decades evidence has emerged to suggest that inflammation-derived oxidative damage and cytokine induced toxicity may play a significant role in the neuronal damage associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). Presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines and T cell infiltration has been observed in the brain parenchyma of patients with PD. Furthermore, evidence for inflammatory changes has been reported in the enteric nervous system, the vagus nerve branches and glial cells. The presence of Î±-synuclein deposits in the post-mortem brain biopsy in patients with PD has further substantiated the role of inflammation in PD. It has been suggested that the Î±-synuclein misfolding might begin in the gut and spread ""prion like"" via the vagus nerve into lower brainstem and ultimately to the midbrain; this is known as the Braak hypothesis. It is noteworthy that the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms (constipation, dysphagia, and hypersalivation), altered gut microbiota and leaky gut have been observed in PD patients several years prior to the clinical onset of the disease. These clinical observations have been supported by in vitro studies in mice as well, demonstrating the role of genetic (Î±-synuclein overexpression) and environmental (gut dysbiosis) factors in the pathogenesis of PD.

Cell therapy has emerged as an experimental treatment, but current cell sources such as human umbilical cord blood (hUCB) stem cells display only partial recapitulation of mature dopaminergic neuron phenotype and function. Nonetheless, stem cell grafts ameliorate PD-associated histological and behavioral deficits likely through stem cell graft-secreted therapeutic substances. We recently demonstrated the potential of hUCB-derived plasma in enhancing motor capabilities and gastrointestinal function, as well as preventing dopaminergic neuronal cell loss, in an 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-pyridine (MPTP) rodent model of PD. Recognizing the translational need to test in another PD model, we now examined here the effects of an intravenously transplanted combination of hUCB and plasma into the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesioned adult rats. Animals received three separate doses of 4âÃâ10<sup>6</sup> hUCB cells with plasma beginning at 7Â days after stereotaxic 6-OHDA lesion, then behaviorally and immunohistochemically evaluated over 56Â days post-lesion. Whereas vehicle-treated lesioned animals exhibited the typical 6-OHDA neurobehavioral symptoms, hUCB and plasma-treated lesioned animals showed significant attenuation of motor function, gut motility, and nigral dopaminergic neuronal survival, combined with diminished pro-inflammatory microbiomes not only in the nigra, but also in the gut. Altogether these data support a regenerative medicine approach for PD by sequestering inflammation and neurotoxicity through correction of gut dysbiosis.",Stem cell reviews and reports,2019,Jea-Young Lee; Julian P Tuazon; Sydney Corey; Brooke Bonsack; Sandra Acosta; Jared Ehrhart; Paul R Sanberg; Cesario V Borlongan
31275138,The Gut-Brain Axis in Neurodegenerative Diseases and Relevance of the Canine Model: A Review.,"Identifying appropriate animal models is critical in developing translatable <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> systems for therapeutic drug development and investigating disease pathophysiology. These animal models should have direct biological and translational relevance to the underlying disease they are supposed to mimic. Aging dogs not only naturally develop a cognitive decline in many aspects including learning and memory deficits, but they also exhibit human-like individual variability in the aging process. Neurodegenerative processes that can be observed in both human and canine brains include the progressive accumulation of Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) found as diffuse plaques in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), including the <i>gyrus proreus (i.e., medial orbital PFC)</i>, as well as the hippocampus and the cerebral vasculature. Tau pathology, a marker of neurodegeneration and dementia progression, was also found in canine hippocampal synapses. Various epidemiological data show that human patients with neurodegenerative diseases have concurrent intestinal lesions, and histopathological changes in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract occurs decades before neurodegenerative changes. Gut microbiome alterations have also been reported in many neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's diseases, as well as inflammatory central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Interestingly, the dog gut microbiome more closely resembles human gut microbiome in composition and functional overlap compared to rodent models. This article reviews the physiology of the gut-brain axis (GBA) and its involvement with neurodegenerative diseases in humans. Additionally, we outline the advantages and weaknesses of current <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> models and discuss future research directions investigating major human neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and Parkinson's diseases using dogs.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2019,Yoko M Ambrosini; Dana Borcherding; Anumantha Kanthasamy; Hyun Jung Kim; Auriel A Willette; Albert Jergens; Karin Allenspach; Jonathan P Mochel
31248424,Altered gut microbiota and inflammatory cytokine responses in patients with Parkinson's disease.,"Emerging evidence suggests that gut microbiome composition alterations affect neurodegeneration through neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we evaluate gut microbiota alterations and host cytokine responses in a population of Taiwanese patients with PD.Fecal microbiota communities from 80 patients with PD and 77 age and gender-matched controls were assessed by sequencing the V3-V4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Diet and comorbidities were controlled in the analyses. Plasma concentrations of IL-1Î², IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-13, IL-18, GM-CSF, IFNÎ³, and TNFÎ± were measured by a multiplex immunoassay and relationships between microbiota, clinical characteristics, and cytokine levels were analyzed in the PD group. We further examined the cytokine changes associated with the altered gut microbiota seen in patients with PD in another independent cohort of 120 PD patients and 120 controls.Microbiota from patients with PD was altered relative to controls and dominated by Verrucomicrobia, Mucispirillum, Porphyromonas, Lactobacillus, and Parabacteroides. In contrast, Prevotella was more abundant in controls. The abundances of Bacteroides were more increased in patients with non-tremor PD subtype than patients with tremor subtype. Bacteroides abundance was correlated with motor symptom severity defined by UPDRS part III motor scores (rhoâ=â0.637 [95% confidence interval 0.474 to 0.758], Pâ<â0.01). Altered microbiota was correlated with plasma concentrations of IFNÎ³ and TNFÎ±. There was a correlation between Bacteroides and plasma level of TNFÎ± (rhoâ=â0.638 [95% CI: 0.102-0.887], Pâ=â0.02); and a correlation between Verrucomicrobia abundance and plasma concentrations of IFNÎ³ (rhoâ=â0.545 [95% CI -â0.043-0.852], Pâ=â0.05). The elevated plasma cytokine responses were confirmed in an additional independent 120 patients with PD and 120 controls (TNFÎ±: PD vs. control 8.51Â Â±Â 4.63âpg/ml vs. 4.82Â Â±Â 2.23âpg/ml, Pâ<â0.01; and IFNÎ³: PD vs. control: 38.45Â Â±Â 7.12âpg/ml vs. 32.79Â Â±Â 8.03âpg/ml, Pâ=â0.03).This study reveals altered gut microbiota in PD and its correlation with clinical phenotypes and severity in our population.

31214110,The Gut and Parkinson's Disease-A Bidirectional Pathway.,"Humans evolved a symbiotic relationship with their gut microbiome, a complex microbial community composed of bacteria, archaea, protists, and viruses, including bacteriophages. The enteric nervous system (ENS) is a gateway for the bidirectional communication between the brain and the gut, mostly through the vagus nerve (VN). Environmental exposure plays a pivotal role in both the composition and functionality of the gut microbiome and may contribute to susceptibility to neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD). The neuropathological hallmark of PD is the widespread appearance of alpha-synuclein aggregates in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, including the ENS. Many studies suggest that gut toxins can induce the formation of Î±-syn aggregates in the ENS, which may then be transmitted in a prion-like manner to the CNS through the VN. PD is strongly associated with aging and its negative effects on homeostatic mechanisms protecting from inflammation, oxidative stress, and protein malfunction. In this mini-review, we revisit some landmark discoveries in the field of Parkinson's research and focus on the gut-brain axis. In the process, we highlight evidence showing gut-associated dysbiosis and related microbial-derived components as important players and risk factors for PD. Therefore, the gut microbiome emerges as a potential target for protective measures aiming to prevent PD onset.",Frontiers in neurology,2019,Susanne Fonseca Santos; Hadassa Loth de Oliveira; Elizabeth Sumi Yamada; Bianca Cruz Neves; Antonio Pereira
31158941,Altered Gut Microbiome and Intestinal Pathology in Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder arising from an interplay between genetic and environmental risk factors. Studies have suggested that the pathological hallmarks of intraneuronal Î±-synuclein aggregations may start from the olfactory bulb and the enteric nervous system of the gut and later propagate to the brain via the olfactory tract and the vagus nerve. This hypothesis correlates well with clinical symptoms, such as constipation, that may develop up to 20 years before the onset of PD motor symptoms. Recent interest in the gut-brain axis has led to vigorous research into the gastrointestinal pathology and gut microbiota changes in patients with PD. In this review, we provide current clinical and pathological evidence of gut involvement in PD by summarizing the changes in gut microbiota composition and gut inflammation associated with its pathogenesis.",Journal of movement disorders,2019,Han-Lin Chiang; Chin-Hsien Lin
31148353,Gutting the brain of inflammation: A key role of gut microbiome in human umbilical cord blood plasma therapy in Parkinson's disease model.,"Current therapies for Parkinson's disease (PD), including L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), and clinical trials investigating dopaminergic cell transplants, have generated mixed results with the eventual induction of dyskinetic side effects. Although human umbilical cord blood (hUCB) stem/progenitor cells present with no or minimal capacity of differentiation into mature dopaminergic neurons, their transplantation significantly attenuates parkinsonian symptoms likely via bystander effects, specifically stem cell graft-mediated secretion of growth factors, anti-inflammatory cytokines, or synaptic function altogether promoting brain repair. Recognizing this non-cell replacement mechanism, we examined here the effects of intravenously transplanted combination of hUCB-derived plasma into the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced rat model of PD. Animals received repeated dosing of either hUCB-derived plasma or vehicle at 3, 5 and 10Â days after induction into MPTP lesion, then behaviourally and immunohistochemically evaluated over 56Â days post-lesion. Compared to vehicle treatment, transplantation with hUCB-derived plasma significantly improved motor function, gut motility and dopaminergic neuronal survival in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), which coincided with reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines in both the SNpc and the intestinal mucosa and dampened inflammation-associated gut microbiota. These novel data directly implicate a key pathological crosstalk between gut and brain ushering a new avenue of therapeutically targeting the gut microbiome with hUCB-derived stem cells and plasma for PD.",Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,2019,Jea-Young Lee; Julian P Tuazon; Jared Ehrhart; Paul R Sanberg; Cesario V Borlongan
30890906,Common miRNA Patterns of Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease and Their Putative Impact on Commensal Gut Microbiota.,"With the rise of Next-Generation-Sequencing (NGS) methods, Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) have achieved an important position in the research landscape and have been found to present valuable diagnostic tools in various diseases such as multiple sclerosis or lung cancer. There is also emerging evidence that miRNAs play an important role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) or Parkinson's disease (PD). Apparently, these diseases come along with changes in miRNA expression patterns which led to attempts from researchers to use these small RNA species from several body fluids for a better diagnosis and in order to observe disease progression. Additionally, it became evident that microbial commensals might play an important role for pathology development and were shown to have a significantly different composition in patients suffering from neurodegeneration compared with healthy controls. As it could recently be shown that secreted miRNAs are able to enter microbial organisms, it is conceivable that the host's miRNA might affect the gut microbial ecosystem. As such, miRNAs may inherit a central role in shaping the ""diseased microbiome"" and thereby mutually act on the characteristics of these neurodegenerative diseases. We have therefore (1) compiled a list of miRNAs known to be associated with AD and/or PD, (2) performed an <i>in silico</i> target screen for binding sites of these miRNA on human gut metagenome sequences and (3) evaluated the hit list for interesting matches potentially relevant to the etiology of AD and or PD. The examination of protein identifiers connected to bacterial secretion system, lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and biofilm formation revealed an overlap of 37 bacterial proteins that were targeted by human miRNAs. The identified links of miRNAs to the biological processes of bacteria connected to AD and PD have yet to be validated via <i>in vivo</i> experiments. However, our results show a promising new approach for understanding aspects of these neurodegenerative diseases in light of the regulation of the microbiome.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2019,Charlotte Hewel; Julia Kaiser; Anna Wierczeiko; Jan Linke; Christoph Reinhardt; Kristina Endres; Susanne Gerber

30258234,Microglia in neurodegeneration.,"The neuroimmune system is involved in development, normal functioning, aging, and injury of the central nervous system. Microglia, first described a century ago, are the main neuroimmune cells and have three essential functions: a sentinel function involved in constant sensing of changes in their environment, a housekeeping function that promotes neuronal well-being and normal operation, and a defense function necessary for responding to such changes and providing neuroprotection. Microglia use a defined armamentarium of genes to perform these tasks. In response to specific stimuli, or with neuroinflammation, microglia also have the capacity to damage and kill neurons. Injury to neurons in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, and prion diseases, as well as in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, results from disruption of the sentinel or housekeeping functions and dysregulation of the defense function and neuroinflammation. Pathways associated with such injury include several sensing and housekeeping pathways, such as the Trem2, Cx3cr1 and progranulin pathways, which act as immune checkpoints to keep the microglial inflammatory response under control, and the scavenger receptor pathways, which promote clearance of injurious stimuli. Peripheral interference from systemic inflammation or the gut microbiome can also alter progression of such injury. Initiation or exacerbation of neurodegeneration results from an imbalance between these microglial functions; correcting such imbalance may be a potential mode for therapy.",Nature neuroscience,2018,Suzanne Hickman; Saef Izzy; Pritha Sen; Liza Morsett; Joseph El Khoury
30099552,Making Sense of â¦ the Microbiome in Psychiatry.,"Microorganisms can be found almost anywhere, including in and on the human body. The collection of microorganisms associated with a certain location is called a microbiota, with its collective genetic material referred to as the microbiome. The largest population of microorganisms on the human body resides in the gastrointestinal tract; thus, it is not surprising that the most investigated human microbiome is the human gut microbiome. On average, the gut hosts microbes from more than 60 genera and contains more cells than the human body. The human gut microbiome has been shown to influence many aspects of host health, including more recently the brain.Several modes of interaction between the gut and the brain have been discovered, including via the synthesis of metabolites and neurotransmitters, activation of the vagus nerve, and activation of the immune system. A growing body of work is implicating the microbiome in a variety of psychological processes and neuropsychiatric disorders. These include mood and anxiety disorders, neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia, and even neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Moreover, it is probable that most psychotropic medications have an impact on the microbiome.Here, an overview will be provided for the bidirectional role of the microbiome in brain health, age-associated cognitive decline, and neurological and psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, a primer on the common microbiological and bioinformatics techniques used to interrogate the microbiome will be provided. This review is meant to equip the reader with a primer to this exciting research area that is permeating all areas of biological psychiatry research.",The international journal of neuropsychopharmacology,2019,Thomaz F S Bastiaanssen; Caitlin S M Cowan; Marcus J Claesson; Timothy G Dinan; John F Cryan
30072879,Effects of Sub-Chronic MPTP Exposure on Behavioral and Cognitive Performance and the Microbiome of Wild-Type and mGlu8 Knockout Female and Male Mice.,"Motor dysfunction is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD); however, non-motor symptoms such as gastrointestinal dysfunction often arise prior to motor symptoms. Alterations in the gut microbiome have been proposed as the earliest event in PD pathogenesis. PD symptoms often demonstrate sex differences. Glutamatergic neurotransmission has long been linked to PD pathology. Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGlu), a family of G protein-coupled receptors, are divided into three groups, with group III mGlu receptors mainly localized presynaptically where they can inhibit glutamate release in the CNS as well as in the gut. Additionally, the gut microbiome can communicate with the CNS via the gut-brain axis. Here, we assessed whether deficiency of metabotropic glutamate receptor 8 (mGlu8), group III mGlu, modulates the effects of the neurotoxin, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), on behavioral and cognitive performance in female and male mice. We studied whether these effects are associated with changes in striatal tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) levels and the gut microbiome. Two-week sub-chronic MPTP increased activity of female and male wild-type (WT) and mGlu8 knockout (KO) mice in the open field. MPTP also showed genotype- and sex-dependent effects. MPTP increased the time WT, but not KO, females and males spent exploring objects. In WT mice, MPTP improved sensorimotor function in males but impaired it in females. Further, MPTP impaired cued fear memory in WT, but not KO, male mice. MPTP reduced striatal TH levels in WT and KO mice but these effects were only pronounced in males. MPTP treatment and genotype affected the diversity of the gut microbiome. In addition, there were significant associations between microbiome Î±-diversity and sensorimotor performance, as well as microbiome composition and fear learning. These results indicate that specific taxa may directly affect motor and fear learning or that the same physiological effects that enhance both forms of learning also alter diversity of the gut microbiome. MPTP's effect on motor and cognitive performance may then be, at least in part, be mediated by the gut microbiome. These data also support mGlu8 as a novel therapeutic target for PD and highlight the importance of including both sexes in preclinical studies.",Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience,2018,Eileen Ruth S Torres; Tunde Akinyeke; Keaton Stagaman; Robert M Duvoisin; Charles K Meshul; Thomas J Sharpton; Jacob Raber
29867531,The Microbiome-Mitochondria Dance in Prodromal Parkinson's Disease.,"The brain is an immunologically active organ where neurons and glia cells orchestrate complex innate immune responses against infections and injuries. Neuronal responses involve Toll-like or Nod-like receptors and the secretion of antimicrobial peptides and cytokines. The endosymbiotic theory for the evolutionary origin of mitochondria from primitive bacteria, suggests that they may have also retained the capacity to activate neuronal innate immunity. In fact, it was shown that mitochondrial damage-associated molecular patterns could signal and activate innate immunity and inflammation. Moreover, the mitochondrial cascade hypothesis for sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD) argues that altered mitochondrial metabolism and function can drive neurodegeneration. Additionally, a neuroinflammatory signature with increased levels of pro-inflammatory mediators in PD affected brain areas was recently detected. Herein, we propose that a cascade of events initiating in a dysbiotic gut microbiome drive the production of toxins or antibiotics that target and damage mitochondria. This in turn activates neuronal innate immunity and triggers sterile inflammation phenomena that culminate in the neurodegenerative processes observed in the enteric and in the central nervous systems and that ultimately lead to Parkinson's disease.",Frontiers in physiology,2018,Sandra M Cardoso; Nuno Empadinhas
29857583,Changes of Colonic Bacterial Composition in Parkinson's Disease and Other Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"In recent years evidence has emerged that neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are strongly associated with the microbiome composition in the gut. Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most intensively studied neurodegenerative disease in this context. In this review, we performed a systematic evaluation of the published literature comparing changes in colonic microbiome in PD to the ones observed in other NDs including Alzheimer's disease (AD), multiple system atrophy (MSA), multiple sclerosis (MS), neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). To enhance the comparability of different studies, only human case-control studies were included. Several studies showed an increase of <i>Lactobacillus</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, Verrucomicrobiaceae and <i>Akkermansia</i> in PD. A decrease of <i>Faecalibacterium</i> spp., <i>Coprococcus</i> spp., <i>Blautia</i> spp., <i>Prevotella</i> spp. and Prevotellaceae was observed in PD. On a low taxonomic resolution, like the phylum level, the changes are not disease-specific and are inconsistent. However, on a higher taxonomic resolution like genus or species level, a minor overlap was observed between PD and MSA, both alpha synucleinopathies. We show that standardization of sample collection and analysis is necessary for ensuring the reproducibility and comparability of data. We also provide evidence that assessing the microbiota composition at high taxonomic resolution reveals changes in relative abundance that may be specific to or characteristic of one disease or disease group, and might evolve discriminative power. The interactions between bacterial species and strains and the co-abundances must be investigated before assumptions about the effects of specific bacteria on the host can be made with certainty.",Nutrients,2018,Sara Gerhardt; M Hasan Mohajeri
29802603,"Gut, Microbiome, and Brain Regulatory Axis: Relevance to Neurodegenerative and Psychiatric Disorders.","It has become apparent that the molecular and biochemical integrity of interactive families, genera, and species of human gut microflora is critically linked to maintaining complex metabolic and behavioral processes mediated by peripheral organ systems and central nervous system neuronal groupings. Relatively recent studies have established intrinsic ratios of enterotypes contained within the human microbiome across demographic subpopulations and have empirically linked significant alterations in the expression of bacterial enterotypes with the initiation and persistence of several major metabolic and psychiatric disorders. Accordingly, the goal of our review is to highlight potential thematic/functional linkages of pathophysiological alterations in gut microbiota and bidirectional gut-brain signaling pathways with special emphasis on the potential roles of gut dysbiosis on the pathophysiology of psychiatric illnesses. We provide critical discussion of putative thematic linkages of Parkinson's disease (PD) data sets to similar pathophysiological events as potential causative factors in the development and persistence of diverse psychiatric illnesses. Finally, we include a concise review of preclinical paradigms that involve immunologically-induced GI deficits and dysbiosis of maternal microflora that are functionally linked to impaired neurodevelopmental processes leading to affective behavioral syndromes in the offspring.",Cellular and molecular neurobiology,2018,G B Stefano; N Pilonis; R Ptacek; J Raboch; M Vnukova; R M Kream
29358918,Longitudinal Analysis of Fecal Microbiome and Pathologic Processes in a Rotenone Induced Mice Model of Parkinson's Disease.,"Recent studies reported an association between gut microbiota composition and Parkinson's disease (PD). However, we know little about the relationship between microbiome dysbiosis and the pathogenesis of PD. The objective of this study was to describe the evolution of fecal microbiota using an oral rotenone model of PD from a longitudinal study over a period of 4 weeks. Gastrointestinal function was assessed by measuring fecal pellet output, motor functions was assessed by open-field and pole tests every week. Î±-synuclein pathology, inflammation and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) neuron loss from the middle brain were also analyzed. Fecal samples were collected every week followed by 16S rRNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. We reported that chronically oral administered rotenone caused gastrointestinal dysfunction and microbiome dysbiosis prior to motor dysfunction and central nervous system (CNS) pathology. 16S rRNA sequencing of fecal microbiome showed rotenone-treated mice exhibited fecal microbiota dysbiosis characterized by an overall decrease in bacterial diversity and a significant change of microbiota composition, notably members of the phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, with an increase in Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio after 3 weeks of rotenone treatment. Moreover, rotenone-induced gastrointestinal and motor dysfunctions were observed to be robustly correlated with changes in the composition of fecal microbiota. Our results demonstrated that gut microbiome perturbation might contribute to rotenone toxicity in the initiation of PD and brought a new insight in the pathogenesis of PD. Novel therapeutic options aimed at modifying the gut microbiota composition might postpone the onset and following cascade of neurodegeneration.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2017,Xiaodong Yang; Yiwei Qian; Shaoqing Xu; Yanyan Song; Qin Xiao
29315562,HFE Genotype Restricts the Response to Paraquat in a Mouse Model of Neurotoxicity.,"Parkinson's disease is marked clinically by motor dysfunction and pathologically by dopaminergic cell loss in the substantia nigra and iron accumulation in the substantia nigra. The driver underlying iron accumulation remains unknown and could be genetic or environmental. The HFE protein is critical for the regulation of cellular iron uptake. Mutations within this protein are associated with increased iron accumulation including in the brain. We have focused on the commonly occurring H63D variant of the HFE gene as a disease modifier in a number of neurodegenerative diseases. To investigate the role of H63D HFE genotype, we generated a mouse model in which the wild-type (WT) HFE gene is replaced by the H67D gene variant (mouse homolog of the human H63D gene variant). Using paraquat toxicity as the model for Parkinson's disease, we found that WT mice responded as expected with significantly greater motor function, loss of tyrosine hydroxylase staining and increase microglial staining in the substantia nigra, and an increase in R<sub>2</sub> relaxation rate within the substantia nigra of the paraquat-treated mice compared to their saline-treated counterparts. In contrast, the H67D mice showed a remarkable resistance to paraquat treatment; specifically differing from the WT mice with no changes in motor function or changes in R<sub>2</sub> relaxation rates following paraquat exposure. At baseline, there were differences between the H67D HFE mice and WT mice in gut microbiome profile and increased L-ferritin staining in the substantia nigra that could account for the resistance to paraquat. Of particular note, the H67D HFE mice regardless of whether or not they were treated with paraquat had significantly less tyrosine hydroxylase immunostaining than WT. Our results clearly demonstrate that the HFE genotype impacts the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase in the substantia nigra, the gut microbiome and the response to paraquat providing additional support that the HFE genotype is a disease modifier for Parkinson's disease. Moreover, the finding that the HFE mutant mice are resistant to paraquat may provide a model in which to study resistant mechanisms to neurotoxicants.",Journal of neurochemistry,2018,Anne M Nixon; Mark D Meadowcroft; Elizabeth B Neely; Amanda M Snyder; Carson J Purnell; Justin Wright; Regina Lamendella; Wint Nandar; Xuemei Huang; James R Connor

28843021,The nasal and gut microbiome in Parkinson's disease and idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder.,"Increasing evidence connects the gut microbiota and the onset and/or phenotype of Parkinson's disease (PD). Differences in the abundances of specific bacterial taxa have been reported in PD patients. It is, however, unknown whether these differences can be observed in individuals at high risk, for example, with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, a prodromal condition of Î±-synuclein aggregation disorders including PD.To compare microbiota in carefully preserved nasal wash and stool samples of subjects with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, manifest PD, and healthy individuals.Microbiota of flash-frozen stool and nasal wash samples from 76 PD patients, 21 idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder patients, and 78 healthy controls were assessed by 16S and 18S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing. Seventy variables, related to demographics, clinical parameters including nonmotor symptoms, and sample processing, were analyzed in relation to microbiome variability and controlled differential analyses were performed.Differentially abundant gut microbes, such as Akkermansia, were observed in PD, but no strong differences in nasal microbiota. Eighty percent of the differential gut microbes in PD versus healthy controls showed similar trends in idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, for example, Anaerotruncus and several Bacteroides spp., and correlated with nonmotor symptoms. Metagenomic sequencing of select samples enabled the reconstruction of genomes of so far uncharacterized differentially abundant organisms.Our study reveals differential abundances of gut microbial taxa in PD and its prodrome idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder in comparison to the healthy controls, and highlights the potential of metagenomics to identify and characterize microbial taxa, which are enriched or depleted in PD and/or idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder.

In order to identify areas of potential exploration and intervention, we simultaneously characterized age-related alterations in gut microbiome, muscle physiology and serum proteomic and lipidomic profiles in aged rats to define an integrated signature of the aging phenotype. We demonstrate that aging skews the composition of the gut microbiome, in particular by altering the Sutterella to Barneseilla ratio, and alters the metabolic potential of intestinal bacteria. Age-related changes of the gut microbiome were associated with the physiological decline of musculoskeletal function, and with molecular markers of nutrient processing/availability, and inflammatory/immune status in aged versus adult rats. Altogether, our study highlights that aging leads to a complex interplay between the microbiome and host physiology, and provides candidate microbial species to target physical and metabolic decline during aging by modulating gut microbial ecology.",Aging,2017,Jay Siddharth; Anirikh Chakrabarti; Alice PannÃ©rec; Sonia Karaz; Delphine Morin-Rivron; Mojgan Masoodi; Jerome N Feige; Scott James Parkinson
28610994,Manganese-induced sex-specific gut microbiome perturbations in C57BL/6 mice.,"Overexposure to manganese (Mn) leads to toxic effects, such as promoting the development of Parkinson's-like neurological disorders. The gut microbiome is deeply involved in immune development, host metabolism, and xenobiotics biotransformation, and significantly influences central nervous system (CNS) via the gut-brain axis, i.e. the biochemical signaling between the gastrointestinal tract and the CNS. However, it remains unclear whether Mn can affect the gut microbiome and its metabolic functions, particularly those linked to neurotoxicity. In addition, sex-specific effects of Mn have been reported, with no mechanism being identified yet. Recently, we have shown that the gut microbiome is largely different between males and females, raising the possibility that differential gut microbiome responses may contribute to sex-selective toxicity of Mn. Here, we applied high-throughput sequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) metabolomics to explore how Mn<sup>2+</sup> exposure affects the gut microbiome and its metabolism in C57BL/6 mice. Mn<sup>2+</sup> exposure perturbed the gut bacterial compositions, functional genes and fecal metabolomes in a highly sex-specific manner. In particular, bacterial genes and/or key metabolites of neurotransmitter synthesis and pro-inflammatory mediators are significantly altered by Mn<sup>2+</sup> exposure, which can potentially affect chemical signaling of gut-brain interactions. Likewise, functional genes involved in iron homeostasis, flagellar motility, quorum sensing, and Mn transportation/oxidation are also widely changed by Mn<sup>2+</sup> exposure. Taken together, this study has demonstrated that Mn<sup>2+</sup> exposure perturbs the gut microbiome and its metabolic functions, which highlights the potential role of the gut microbiome in Mn<sup>2+</sup> toxicity, particularly its sex-specific toxic effects.",Toxicology and applied pharmacology,2017,Liang Chi; Bei Gao; Xiaoming Bian; Pengcheng Tu; Hongyu Ru; Kun Lu
28195358,Parkinson's disease and Parkinson's disease medications have distinct signatures of the gut microbiome.,"There is mounting evidence for a connection between the gut and Parkinson's disease (PD). Dysbiosis of gut microbiota could explain several features of PD.The objective of this study was to determine if PD involves dysbiosis of gut microbiome, disentangle effects of confounders, and identify candidate taxa and functional pathways to guide research.A total of 197 PD cases and 130 controls were studied. Microbial composition was determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing of DNA extracted from stool. Metadata were collected on 39 potential confounders including medications, diet, gastrointestinal symptoms, and demographics. Statistical analyses were conducted while controlling for potential confounders and correcting for multiple testing. We tested differences in the overall microbial composition, taxa abundance, and functional pathways.Independent microbial signatures were detected for PD (P = 4E-5), participants' region of residence within the United States (P = 3E-3), age (P = 0.03), sex (P = 1E-3), and dietary fruits/vegetables (P = 0.01). Among patients, independent signals were detected for catechol-O-methyltransferase-inhibitors (P = 4E-4), anticholinergics (P = 5E-3), and possibly carbidopa/levodopa (P = 0.05). We found significantly altered abundances of the Bifidobacteriaceae, Christensenellaceae, [Tissierellaceae], Lachnospiraceae, Lactobacillaceae, Pasteurellaceae, and Verrucomicrobiaceae families. Functional predictions revealed changes in numerous pathways, including the metabolism of plant-derived compounds and xenobiotics degradation.PD is accompanied by dysbiosis of gut microbiome. Results coalesce divergent findings of prior studies, reveal altered abundance of several taxa, nominate functional pathways, and demonstrate independent effects of PD medications on the microbiome. The findings provide new leads and testable hypotheses on the pathophysiology and treatment of PD.

26627987,Gut microbiome in health and disease: Linking the microbiome-gut-brain axis and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of systemic and neurodegenerative diseases.,"The gut microbiome comprises the collective genome of the trillions of microorganisms residing in our gastrointestinal ecosystem. The interaction between the host and its gut microbiome is a complex relationship whose manipulation could prove critical to preventing or treating not only various gut disorders, like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and ulcerative colitis (UC), but also central nervous system (CNS) disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The purpose of this review is to summarize what is known about the gut microbiome, how it is connected to the development of disease and to identify the bacterial and biochemical targets that should be the focus of future research. Understanding the mechanisms behind the activity and proliferation of the gut microbiome will provide us new insights that may pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies.",Pharmacology & therapeutics,2016,Shivani Ghaisas; Joshua Maher; Anumantha Kanthasamy
26092111,Peripheral aetiopathogenic drivers and mediators of Parkinson's disease and co-morbidities: role of gastrointestinal microbiota.,"We seek an aetiopathogenic model for the spectrum of Parkinson's disease (PD), functional bowel disease, depression and cognitive impairment. The adopted concept is that systemic immuno-inflammatory processes mediate neuro-inflammation. The model would be based on phenotype, exposome (including gastrointestinal microbiome), milieu (immuno-inflammatory and metabolome), human genetics and their interactions. It would enable a patient's position, to be understood in terms of drivers, perpetuators and mediators, and a future position, with and without intervention, predicted. Even the cardinal facets of PD may have different drivers: halting one may allow escape down subordinate pathways. Peptic ulceration is prodromal to PD. In our randomised placebo-controlled trial, hypokinesia improved over the year following biopsy-proven Helicobacter pylori eradication and rigidity worsened. This was independent of any (stable, long tÂ½) antiparkinsonian medication. There are pointers to an autoimmune process: for example, surveillance-confirmed hypokinesia effect was indication specific. During surveillance, successive antimicrobial courses, other than for Helicobacter, were associated with cumulative increase in rigidity. Exhibiting laxatives appeared to stem the overall temporal increase, despite antiparkinsonian medication, in rigidity. Thus, intestinal dysbiosis may be a major source of bystander neuronal damage. There are biological gradients of objective measures of PD facets on circulating inflammatory markers and leucocyte subset counts. Moreover, lactulose hydrogen breath test positivity for small-intestinal bacterial overgrowth (present in two thirds of PD patients) is associated with the same subsets: higher natural killer and total CD4+ counts and lower neutrophils. With greater aetiopathogenic understanding, relatively low cost and on-the-shelf medication could have a major impact. A new generation of animal models, based on the gut microbiome, is envisaged.",Journal of neurovirology,2016,Sylvia M Dobbs; R John Dobbs; Clive Weller; AndrÃ© Charlett; Aisha Augustin; David Taylor; Mohammad A A Ibrahim; Ingvar Bjarnason
25940667,"The dormant blood microbiome in chronic, inflammatory diseases.","Blood in healthy organisms is seen as a 'sterile' environment: it lacks proliferating microbes. Dormant or not-immediately-culturable forms are not absent, however, as intracellular dormancy is well established. We highlight here that a great many pathogens can survive in blood and inside erythrocytes. 'Non-culturability', reflected by discrepancies between plate counts and total counts, is commonplace in environmental microbiology. It is overcome by improved culturing methods, and we asked how common this would be in blood. A number of recent, sequence-based and ultramicroscopic studies have uncovered an authentic blood microbiome in a number of non-communicable diseases. The chief origin of these microbes is the gut microbiome (especially when it shifts composition to a pathogenic state, known as 'dysbiosis'). Another source is microbes translocated from the oral cavity. 'Dysbiosis' is also used to describe translocation of cells into blood or other tissues. To avoid ambiguity, we here use the term 'atopobiosis' for microbes that appear in places other than their normal location. Atopobiosis may contribute to the dynamics of a variety of inflammatory diseases. Overall, it seems that many more chronic, non-communicable, inflammatory diseases may have a microbial component than are presently considered, and may be treatable using bactericidal antibiotics or vaccines.",FEMS microbiology reviews,2015,Marnie Potgieter; Janette Bester; Douglas B Kell; Etheresia Pretorius
25847918,Leaky intestine and impaired microbiome in an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mouse model.,"Emerging evidence has demonstrated that intestinal homeostasis and the microbiome play essential roles in neurological diseases, such as Parkinson's disease. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by a progressive loss of motor neurons and muscle atrophy. Currently, there is no effective treatment. Most patients die within 3-5Â years due to respiratory paralysis. Although the death of motor neurons is a hallmark of ALS, other organs may also contribute to the disease progression. We examined the gut of an ALS mouse model, G93A, which expresses mutant superoxide dismutase (SOD1(G93A)), and discovered a damaged tight junction structure and increased permeability with a significant reduction in the expression levels of tight junction protein ZO-1 and the adherens junction protein E-cadherin. Furthermore, our data demonstrated increased numbers of abnormal Paneth cells in the intestine of G93A mice. Paneth cells are specialized intestinal epithelial cells that can sense microbes and secrete antimicrobial peptides, thus playing key roles in host innate immune responses and shaping the gut microbiome. A decreased level of the antimicrobial peptides defensin 5 alpha was indeed found in the ALS intestine. These changes were associated with a shifted profile of the intestinal microbiome, including reduced levels of Butyrivibrio Fibrisolvens, Escherichia coli, and Fermicus, in G93A mice. The relative abundance of bacteria was shifted in G93A mice compared to wild-type mice. Principal coordinate analysis indicated a difference in fecal microbial communities between ALS and wild-type mice. Taken together, our study suggests a potential novel role of the intestinal epithelium and microbiome in the progression of ALS.",Physiological reports,2015,Shaoping Wu; Jianxun Yi; Yong-Guo Zhang; Jingsong Zhou; Jun Sun
23981537,Metabolic features of the cell danger response.,"The cell danger response (CDR) is the evolutionarily conserved metabolic response that protects cells and hosts from harm. It is triggered by encounters with chemical, physical, or biological threats that exceed the cellular capacity for homeostasis. The resulting metabolic mismatch between available resources and functional capacity produces a cascade of changes in cellular electron flow, oxygen consumption, redox, membrane fluidity, lipid dynamics, bioenergetics, carbon and sulfur resource allocation, protein folding and aggregation, vitamin availability, metal homeostasis, indole, pterin, 1-carbon and polyamine metabolism, and polymer formation. The first wave of danger signals consists of the release of metabolic intermediates like ATP and ADP, Krebs cycle intermediates, oxygen, and reactive oxygen species (ROS), and is sustained by purinergic signaling. After the danger has been eliminated or neutralized, a choreographed sequence of anti-inflammatory and regenerative pathways is activated to reverse the CDR and to heal. When the CDR persists abnormally, whole body metabolism and the gut microbiome are disturbed, the collective performance of multiple organ systems is impaired, behavior is changed, and chronic disease results. Metabolic memory of past stress encounters is stored in the form of altered mitochondrial and cellular macromolecule content, resulting in an increase in functional reserve capacity through a process known as mitocellular hormesis. The systemic form of the CDR, and its magnified form, the purinergic life-threat response (PLTR), are under direct control by ancient pathways in the brain that are ultimately coordinated by centers in the brainstem. Chemosensory integration of whole body metabolism occurs in the brainstem and is a prerequisite for normal brain, motor, vestibular, sensory, social, and speech development. An understanding of the CDR permits us to reframe old concepts of pathogenesis for a broad array of chronic, developmental, autoimmune, and degenerative disorders. These disorders include autism spectrum disorders (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), asthma, atopy, gluten and many other food and chemical sensitivity syndromes, emphysema, Tourette's syndrome, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), traumatic brain injury (TBI), epilepsy, suicidal ideation, organ transplant biology, diabetes, kidney, liver, and heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer and Parkinson disease, and autoimmune disorders like lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis.",Mitochondrion,2014,Robert K Naviaux
35572407,Interplay of gut microbiota and oxidative stress: Perspective on neurodegeneration and neuroprotection.,"Recent research on the implications of gut microbiota on brain functions has helped to gather important information on the relationship between them. Pathogenesis of neurological disorders is found to be associated with dysregulation of gut-brain axis. Some gut bacteria metabolites are found to be directly associated with the increase in reactive oxygen species levels, one of the most important risk factors of neurodegeneration. Besides their morbid association, gut bacteria metabolites are also found to play a significant role in reducing the onset of these life-threatening brain disorders.Studies done in the recent past raises two most important link between gut microbiota and the brain: ""gut microbiota-oxidative stress-neurodegeneration"" and gut microbiota-antioxidant-neuroprotection. This review aims to gives a deep insight to our readers, of the collective studies done, focusing on the gut microbiota mediated oxidative stress involved in neurodegeneration along with a focus on those studies showing the involvement of gut microbiota and their metabolites in neuroprotection.This review is focused on three main key concepts. Firstly, the mounting evidences from clinical and preclinical arenas shows the influence of gut microbiota mediated oxidative stress resulting in dysfunctional neurological processes. Therefore, we describe the potential role of gut microbiota influencing the vulnerability of brain to oxidative stress, and a budding causative in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Secondly, contributing roles of gut microbiota has been observed in attenuating oxidative stress and inflammation via its own metabolites or by producing secondary metabolites and, also modulation in gut microbiota population with antioxidative and anti-inflammatory probiotics have shown promising neuro resilience. Thirdly, high throughput <i>in silico</i> tools and databases also gives a correlation of gut microbiome, their metabolites and brain health, thus providing fascinating perspective and promising new avenues for therapeutic options.",Journal of advanced research,2022,Shruti Shandilya; Sandeep Kumar; Niraj Kumar Jha; Kavindra Kumar Kesari; Janne Ruokolainen
35111696,Gut Microbiota: A Key Regulator in the Effects of Environmental Hazards on Modulates Insulin Resistance.,"Insulin resistance is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), type II diabetes (T2D), and Parkinson's disease (PD). Emerging evidence indicates that these disorders are typically characterized by alterations in the gut microbiota composition, diversity, and their metabolites. Currently, it is understood that environmental hazards including ionizing radiation, toxic heavy metals, pesticides, particle matter, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are capable of interacting with gut microbiota and have a non-beneficial health effect. Based on the current study, we propose the hypothesis of ""gut microenvironment baseline drift"". According to this ""baseline drift"" theory, gut microbiota is a temporarily combined cluster of species sharing the same environmental stresses for a short period, which would change quickly under the influence of different environmental factors. This indicates that the microbial species in the gut do not have a long-term relationship; any split, division, or recombination may occur in different environments. Nonetheless, the ""baseline drift"" theory considers the critical role of the response of the whole gut microbiome. Undoubtedly, this hypothesis implies that the gut microbiota response is not merely a ""cross junction"" switch; in contrast, the human health or disease is a result of a rich palette of gut-microbiota-driven multiple-pathway responses. In summary, environmental factors, including hazardous and normal factors, are critical to the biological impact of the gut microbiota responses and the dual effect of the gut microbiota on the regulation of biological functions. Novel appreciation of the role of gut microbiota and environmental hazards in the insulin resistance would shed new light on insulin resistance and also promote the development of new research direction and new overcoming strategies for patients.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2021,Ruixue Huang
35083314,The small bowel microbiome changes significantly with age and aspects of the ageing process.,"Gut microbiome changes have been associated with human ageing and implicated in age-related diseases including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. However, studies to date have used stool samples, which do not represent the entire gut. Although more challenging to access, the small intestine plays critical roles in host metabolism and immune function. In this paper (Leite <i>et al.</i> (2021), Cell Reports, doi: 10.1016/j.celrep.2021.109765), we demonstrate significant differences in the small intestinal microbiome in older subjects, using duodenal aspirates from 251 subjects aged 18-80 years. Differences included significantly decreased microbial diversity in older subjects, driven by increased relative abundance of phylum Proteobacteria, particularly family Enterobacteriaceae and coliform genera <i>Escherichia</i> and <i>Klebsiella.</i> Moreover, while this decreased diversity was associated with the 'ageing process' (comprising chronologic age, number of medications, and number of concomitant diseases), changes in certain taxa were found to be associated with number of medications alone (<i>Klebsiella</i>), number of diseases alone (<i>Clostridium, Bilophila</i>), or chronologic age alone (<i>Escherichia</i>, <i>Lactobacillus, Enterococcus</i>). Lastly, many taxa associated with increasing chronologic age were anaerobes. These changes may contribute to changes in human health that occur during the ageing process.","Microbial cell (Graz, Austria)",2022,Gabriela Leite; Mark Pimentel; Gillian M Barlow; Ruchi Mathur
35069178,The Gut-Brain Axis and Its Relation to Parkinson's Disease: A Review.,"Parkinson's disease is a chronic neurodegenerative disease characterized by the accumulation of misfolded alpha-synuclein protein (Lewy bodies) in dopaminergic neurons of the <i>substantia nigra</i> and other related circuitry, which contribute to the development of both motor (bradykinesia, tremors, stiffness, abnormal gait) and non-motor symptoms (gastrointestinal issues, urinogenital complications, olfaction dysfunction, cognitive impairment). Despite tremendous progress in the field, the exact pathways and mechanisms responsible for the initiation and progression of this disease remain unclear. However, recent research suggests a potential relationship between the commensal gut bacteria and the brain capable of influencing neurodevelopment, brain function and health. This bidirectional communication is often referred to as the microbiome-gut-brain axis. Accumulating evidence suggests that the onset of non-motor symptoms, such as gastrointestinal manifestations, often precede the onset of motor symptoms and disease diagnosis, lending support to the potential role that the microbiome-gut-brain axis might play in the underlying pathological mechanisms of Parkinson's disease. This review will provide an overview of and critically discuss the current knowledge of the relationship between the gut microbiota and Parkinson's disease. We will discuss the role of Î±-synuclein in non-motor disease pathology, proposed pathways constituting the connection between the gut microbiome and the brain, existing evidence related to pre- and probiotic interventions. Finally, we will highlight the potential opportunity for the development of novel preventative measures and therapeutic options that could target the microbiome-gut-brain axis in the context of Parkinson's disease.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2021,Emily M Klann; Upuli Dissanayake; Anjela Gurrala; Matthew Farrer; Aparna Wagle Shukla; Adolfo Ramirez-Zamora; Volker Mai; Vinata Vedam-Mai
34965376,Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease May Result from Reactivation of Embryologic Pathways Silenced at Birth.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), Lewy Body Dementia (LBD), and Parkinson's disease (PD) form a continuum that may explain multiple aspects of age-related neurodegeneration. Inflammaging, the long-term result of the chronic physiological stimulation of the innate immune system, is integral to this process. The gut microbiome plays an important role in inflammaging, as it can release inflammatory products and communicate with other organs and systems. Although AD and PD are molecularly and clinically distinct disorders, their causes appear to underlie LBD. All three conditions lie on a continuum related to AD, PD, or LBD in vulnerable persons. Inflammation in AD is linked to cytokines and growth factors. Moreover, cytokines and neurotrophins profoundly affect PD and LBD. Growth factors, neurotrophins and cytokines are also involved in embryo neural development. Cytokines influence gene expression, metabolism, cell stress, and apoptosis in the preimplantation embryo. The responsible genes are silenced around birth. But if activated by inflammaging and viruses in the brain decades later, they could destroy the same neural structures they created in utero. For this reason, the pathology and progression of AD, LBD, and PD would be unique. Embryonic reactivation could explain two well documented features of AD. 1) NSAIDs reduce AD risk but fail as a treatment. 2) NSAIDs reduce AD risk because they suppress inflammaging. But they are not a treatment because they cannot silence the embryonic genes that have become active and damage the brain.",Discovery medicine,2021,Steven Lehrer; Peter H Rheinstein

34888340,Neuroprotection by the Ketogenic Diet: Evidence and Controversies.,"The ketogenic diet (KD) is a high-fat low-carbohydrate diet that has been used for decades as a non-pharmacologic approach to treat metabolic disorders and refractory pediatric epilepsy. In recent years, enthusiasm for the KD has increased in the scientific community due to evidence that the diet reduces pathology and improves various outcome measures in animal models of neurodegenerative disorders, including multiple sclerosis, stroke, glaucoma, spinal cord injury, retinal degenerations, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Clinical trials also suggest that the KD improved quality of life in patients with multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, the major ketone bodies BHB and ACA have potential neuroprotective properties and are now known to have direct effects on specific inflammatory proteins, transcription factors, reactive oxygen species, mitochondria, epigenetic modifications and the composition of the gut microbiome. Neuroprotective benefits of the KD are likely due to a combination of these cellular processes and other potential mechanisms that are yet to be confirmed experimentally. This review provides a comprehensive summary of current evidence for the effectiveness of the KD in humans and preclinical models of various neurological disorders, describes molecular mechanisms that may contribute to its beneficial effects, and highlights key controversies and current gaps in knowledge.",Frontiers in nutrition,2021,Sarah M Gough; Alicia Casella; Kristen Jasmin Ortega; Abigail S Hackam
34884399,Differences in the Composition of Gut Microbiota between Patients with Parkinson's Disease and Healthy Controls: A Cohort Study.,"Gut microbiome and colonic inflammation can be associated with the predisposition and progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). The presented study aimed to compare gastrointestinal microbiota composition between patients diagnosed with PD and treated only with Levodopa to healthy controls.

Fecal samples were obtained from all participants. Next-Generation Sequencing was used to assess the microbiota composition. The endpoint was the difference in composition of the gut microbiota. In this study, we enrolled 27 hospitalized PD patients with well-controlled symptoms. The control group included 44 healthy subjects matched for age. Among PD patients, our results presented a higher abundance of <i>Bacteroides</i> phylum, class <i>Corynebacteria</i> among phylum <i>Actinobacteria</i>, class <i>Deltaproteobacteria</i> among phylum <i>Proteobacteria</i>, and genera such as <i>Butyricimonas, Robinsoniella</i>, and <i>Flavonifractor</i>. The species <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i>, <i>Eubacterium biforme</i>, and <i>Parabacteroides merdae</i> were identified as more common in the gut microbiota of PD patients.

34853754,Role of Gastrointestinal Dysbiosis and Fecal Transplantation in Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases with a high rate of morbidity. It is associated with dopaminergic neuron loss and is fairly common in the elderly population. Recently, there has been a growing interest in the role of the gut microbiome in the pathogenesis of PD and thus studies addressing the methods to modulate the microbiota are becoming increasingly popular. Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) is one of these methods and is effective in certain intestinal and extraintestinal conditions. This review aims to talk about gastrointestinal dysbiosis and how the reconstruction of this microbiome via FMT could potentially be used as a treatment modality in the future. We went through various studies and collected data relevant to our topic from the previous five years. The studies selected include reviews, observational studies, animal studies, case reports, and some grey literature. We concluded that although it has great potential as a therapeutic modality in the future, it is limited by several factors such as variability among the results of most clinical studies and the lack of large sample sizes. Therefore, there is a need for high-quality clinical trials with larger sample sizes to gather enough clinical evidence so that FMT can qualify as a widely recommended therapeutic measure.",Cureus,2021,Rahul Jena; Ruchi Jain; Suchitra Muralidharan; Vijaya Lakshmi Yanamala; Zainab Zubair; Ketan Kantamaneni; Krishi Jalla; Mahvish Renzu; Michael Alfonso
34841505,Assessment of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in Alzheimer's disease.,"There is great interest in crosstalk between the gastrointestinal and immune systems. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is a bowel disorder prevalent among patients with Parkinson's disease; SIBO treatment has been shown to modulate neurological inflammation, motor and cognitive outcomes there. However, to date, no link between Alzheimer's dementia and SIBO has been established. This pilot study sought to estimate the prevalence of SIBO in Alzheimer's dementia in the outpatient setting in Singapore General Hospital. It entailed performing a hydrogen breath test and objectively scoring gastrointestinal symptoms and their severity in 48 patients, comparing symptom scores and mean breath test values in those with mild to moderate Alzheimer's against age- and sex-matched controls that did not fulfill DSM-V criteria for probable Alzheimer's. Here, the prevalence of positive breath tests and symptoms of SIBO were no greater among Alzheimer's patients than in controls. This suggests that the gut microbiome changes and increased bowel inflammation seen in previous studies on Alzheimer's patients are likely effected through pathways other than SIBO, and are likely more complex than a mere increase in small bowel bacterial volume. Rather, future research could be directed along the lines of qualitative changes in small bowel microbiota, or pathologies in other parts of the gastrointestinal tract such as the colon or stomach, aspects which are not adequately captured by the hydrogen breath test.

34836918,Footprints of a microbial toxin from the gut microbiome to mesencephalic mitochondria.,"Idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterised by alpha-synuclein (aSyn) aggregation and death of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain. Recent evidence posits that PD may initiate in the gut by microbes or their toxins that promote chronic gut inflammation that will ultimately impact the brain. In this work, we sought to demonstrate that the effects of the microbial toxin Î²-<i>N</i>-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) in the gut may trigger some PD cases, which is especially worrying as this toxin is present in certain foods but not routinely monitored by public health authorities.To test the hypothesis, we treated wild-type mice, primary neuronal cultures, cell lines and isolated mitochondria with BMAA, and analysed its impact on gut microbiota composition, barrier permeability, inflammation and aSyn aggregation as well as in brain inflammation, dopaminergic neuronal loss and motor behaviour. To further examine the key role of mitochondria, we also determined the specific effects of BMAA on mitochondrial function and on inflammasome activation.BMAA induced extensive depletion of segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) that regulate gut immunity, thus triggering gut dysbiosis, immune cell migration, increased intestinal inflammation, loss of barrier integrity and caudo-rostral progression of aSyn. Additionally, BMAA induced <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> mitochondrial dysfunction with cardiolipin exposure and consequent activation of neuronal innate immunity. These events primed neuroinflammation, dopaminergic neuronal loss and motor deficits.Taken together, our results demonstrate that chronic exposure to dietary BMAA can trigger a chain of events that recapitulate the evolution of the PD pathology from the gut to the brain, which is consistent with 'gut-first' PD.",Gut,2023,A Raquel Esteves; MÃ¡rio F Munoz-Pinto; Daniela Nunes-Costa; Emanuel Candeias; Diana F Silva; JoÃ£o D MagalhÃ£es; A Raquel Pereira-Santos; I Luisa Ferreira; Susana Alarico; Igor Tiago; Nuno Empadinhas; Sandra Morais Cardoso
34829694,Probiotic Enhancement of Antioxidant Capacity and Alterations of Gut Microbiota Composition in 6-Hydroxydopamin-Induced Parkinson's Disease Rats.,"Oxidative stress plays a key role in the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD), which may be aggravated by concomitant PD-associated gut dysbiosis. Probiotics and prebiotics are therapeutically relevant to these conditions due to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and gut microbiome modulation properties. However, the mechanisms by which probiotic/prebiotic supplementation affects antioxidant capacity and the gut microbiome in PD remains poorly characterized. In this study, we assessed the effects of a <i>Lactobacillus salivarius</i> AP-32 probiotic, a prebiotic (dried AP-32 culture medium supernatant), and a probiotic/prebiotic cocktail in rats with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced PD. The neuroprotective effects and levels of oxidative stress were evaluated after eight weeks of daily supplementation. Fecal microbiota composition was analyzed by fecal 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The supplements were associated with direct increases in host antioxidant enzyme activities and short-chain fatty acid production, protected dopaminergic neurons, and improved motor functions. The supplements also altered the fecal microbiota composition, and some specifically enriched commensal taxa correlated positively with superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase activity, indicating supplementation also promotes antioxidant activity via an indirect pathway. Therefore, <i>L. salivarius</i> AP-32 supplementation enhanced the activity of host antioxidant enzymes via direct and indirect modes of action in rats with 6-OHDA-induced PD.","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2021,Shu-Ping Tsao; Bira Arumndari Nurrahma; Ravi Kumar; Chieh-Hsi Wu; Tu-Hsueh Yeh; Ching-Chi Chiu; Yen-Peng Lee; Yi-Chi Liao; Cheng-Hsieh Huang; Yao-Tsung Yeh; Hui-Yu Huang
34789332,New perspectives on cytoskeletal dysregulation and mitochondrial mislocalization in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by selective, early degeneration of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. Motor neurons have long axonal projections, which rely on the integrity of neuronal cytoskeleton and mitochondria to regulate energy requirements for maintaining axonal stability, anterograde and retrograde transport, and signaling between neurons. The formation of protein aggregates which contain cytoskeletal proteins, and mitochondrial dysfunctionÂ both have devastating effects on the function of neurons and are shared pathological features across several neurodegenerative conditions, including ALS, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly clear that cytoskeletal integrity and mitochondrial function are intricately linked. Therefore, dysregulations of the cytoskeletal network and mitochondrial homeostasis and localization, may be common pathways in the initial steps of neurodegeneration. Here we review and discuss known contributors, including variants in genetic loci and aberrant protein activities, which modify cytoskeletal integrity, axonal transport and mitochondrial localization in ALS and have overlapping features with other neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, we explore some emerging pathways that may contribute to this disruption in ALS.",Translational neurodegeneration,2021,Frances Theunissen; Phillip K West; Samuel Brennan; Bojan PetroviÄ; Kosar Hooshmand; P Anthony Akkari; Matt Keon; Boris Guennewig
34776854,Changes in the Gut Microbiome and Predicted Functional Metabolic Effects in an Australian Parkinson's Disease Cohort.,"<b>Background:</b> There has been increasing recognition of the importance of the gut microbiome in Parkinson's disease (PD), but the influence of geographic location has received little attention. The present study characterized the gut microbiota and associated changes in host metabolic pathways in an Australian cohort of people with PD (PwP). <b>Methods:</b> The study involved recruitment and assessment of 87 PwP from multiple Movement Disorders Clinics in Australia and 47 healthy controls. Illumina sequencing of the V3 and V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene was used to distinguish inter-cohort differences in gut microbiota; KEGG analysis was subsequently performed to predict functional changes in host metabolic pathways. <b>Results:</b> The current findings identified significant differences in relative abundance and diversity of microbial operational taxonomic units (OTUs), and specific bacterial taxa between PwP and control groups. Alpha diversity was significantly reduced in PwP when compared to controls. Differences were found in two phyla (Synergistetes and Proteobacteria; both increased in PwP), and five genera (C<i>olidextribacter, Intestinibacter, Kineothrix, Agathobaculum</i>, and <i>Roseburia</i>; all decreased in PwP). Within the PD cohort, there was no association identified between microbial composition and gender, constipation or use of gastrointestinal medication. Furthermore, KEGG analysis identified 15 upregulated and 11 downregulated metabolic pathways which were predicted to be significantly altered in PwP. <b>Conclusion:</b> This study provides the first comprehensive characterization of the gut microbiome and predicted functional metabolic effects in a southern hemisphere PD population, further exploring the possible mechanisms whereby the gut microbiota may exert their influence on this disease, and providing evidence for the incorporation of such data in future individualized therapeutic strategies.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2021,Jade E Kenna; Eng Guan Chua; Megan Bakeberg; Alfred Tay; Sarah McGregor; Anastazja Gorecki; Malcolm Horne; Barry Marshall; Frank L Mastaglia; Ryan S Anderton
34704023,Gut microbiome alpha-diversity is not a marker of Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis.,"The gut-brain axis may play a central role in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders. Dozens of case-control studies have been carried out to identify bacterial markers by the use of targeted metagenomics. Alterations of several taxonomic profiles have been confirmed across several populations, however, no consensus has been made regarding alpha-diversity. A recent publication has described and validated a novel method based on richness and evenness measures of the gut microbiome in order to reduce the complexity and multiplicity of alpha-diversity indices. We used these recently described richness and evenness composite measures to investigate the potential link between gut microbiome alpha-diversity and neurological disorders and to determine to what extent it could be used as a marker to diagnose neurological disorders from stool samples. We performed an exhaustive review of the literature to identify original published clinical studies including 16S rRNA gene sequencing on Parkinson's disease, multiple Sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. Richness and evenness factors loadings were quantified from sequencing files in addition with the Shannon diversity index. For each disease, we performed a meta-analysis comparing the indices between patients and healthy controls. Seven studies were meta-analysed for Parkinson's disease, corresponding to 1067 subjects (631 Parkinson's Disease/436 healthy controls). Five studies were meta-analysed for multiple sclerosis, corresponding to 303 subjects (164 Multiple Sclerosis/139 healthy controls). For Alzheimer's disease, the meta-analysis was not done as only two studies matched our criteria. Neither richness nor evenness was significantly altered in Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis patients in comparison to healthy controls (<i>P</i>-valueâ>â0.05). Shannon index was neither associated with neurological disorders (<i>P</i>-valueâ>â0.05). After adjusting for age and sex, none of the alpha-diversity measures were associated with Parkinson's Disease. This is the first report investigating systematically alpha-diversity and its potential link to neurological disorders. Our study has demonstrated that unlike in other gastro-intestinal, immune and metabolic disorders, loss of bacterial diversity is not associated with Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis.",Brain communications,2021,Jonathan Plassais; Guillaume Gbikpi-Benissan; Marine Figarol; Filip Scheperjans; Guy Gorochov; Pascal Derkinderen; Alessandra C L Cervino
34650532,Cross-Sectional Study on the Gut Microbiome of Parkinson's Disease Patients in Central China.,"Gastrointestinal dysfunction plays an important role in the occurrence and development of Parkinson's disease (PD). This study investigates the composition of the gut microbiome using shotgun metagenomic sequencing in PD patients in central China. Fecal samples from 39 PD patients (PD group) and the corresponding 39 healthy spouses of the patients (SP) were collected for shotgun metagenomics sequencing. Results showed a significantly altered microbial composition in the PD patients. <i>Bilophila wadsworthia</i> enrichment was found in the gut microbiome of PD patients, which has not been reported in previous studies. The random forest (RF) model, which identifies differences in microbiomes, reliably discriminated patients with PD from controls; the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.803. Further analysis of the microbiome and clinical symptoms showed that <i>Klebsiella</i> and <i>Parasutterella</i> were positively correlated with the duration and severity of PD, whereas hydrogen-generating <i>Prevotella</i> was negatively correlated with disease severity. The Cluster of Orthologous Groups of protein database, the KEGG Orthology database, and the carbohydrate-active enzymes of gene-category analysis showed that branched-chain amino acid-related proteins were significantly increased, and GH43 was significantly reduced in the PD group. Functional analysis of the metagenome confirmed differences in microbiome metabolism in the PD group related to short-chain fatty acid precursor metabolism.",Frontiers in microbiology,2021,Liangwei Mao; Yu Zhang; Jing Tian; Ming Sang; Guimin Zhang; Yuling Zhou; Puqing Wang
34576191,The Role of Gut Microbiota and Gut-Brain Interplay in Selected Diseases of the Central Nervous System.,"The gut microbiome has attracted increasing attention from researchers in recent years. The microbiota can have a specific and complex cross-talk with the host, particularly with the central nervous system (CNS), creating the so-called ""gut-brain axis"". Communication between the gut, intestinal microbiota, and the brain involves the secretion of various metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), structural components of bacteria, and signaling molecules. Moreover, an imbalance in the gut microbiota composition modulates the immune system and function of tissue barriers such as the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Therefore, the aim of this literature review is to describe how the gut-brain interplay may contribute to the development of various neurological disorders, combining the fields of gastroenterology and neuroscience. We present recent findings concerning the effect of the altered microbiota on neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, as well as multiple sclerosis. Moreover, the impact of the pathological shift in the microbiome on selected neuropsychological disorders, i.e., major depressive disorders (MDD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), is also discussed. Future research on the effect of balanced gut microbiota composition on the gut-brain axis would help to identify new potential opportunities for therapeutic interventions in the presented diseases.",International journal of molecular sciences,2021,Julia Doroszkiewicz; Magdalena Groblewska; Barbara Mroczko
34576000,"Nuclear and Mitochondrial Genome, Epigenome and Gut Microbiome: Emerging Molecular Biomarkers for Parkinson's Disease.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is currently the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, burdening about 10 million elderly individuals worldwide. The multifactorial nature of PD poses a difficult obstacle for understanding the mechanisms involved in its onset and progression. Currently, diagnosis depends on the appearance of clinical signs, some of which are shared among various neurologic disorders, hindering early diagnosis. There are no effective tools to prevent PD onset, detect the disease in early stages or accurately report the risk of disease progression. Hence, there is an increasing demand for biomarkers that may identify disease onset and progression, as treatment-based medicine may not be the best approach for PD. Over the last few decades, the search for molecular markers to predict susceptibility, aid in accurate diagnosis and evaluate the progress of PD have intensified, but strategies aimed to improve individualized patient care have not yet been established.Genomic variation, regulation by epigenomic mechanisms, as well as the influence of the host gut microbiome seem to have a crucial role in the onset and progress of PD, thus are considered potential biomarkers. As such, the human nuclear and mitochondrial genome, epigenome, and the host gut microbiome might be the key elements to the rise of personalized medicine for PD patients.",International journal of molecular sciences,2021,Gleyce Fonseca Cabral; Ana Paula Schaan; Giovanna C Cavalcante; Camille Sena-Dos-Santos; Tatiane Piedade de Souza; Natacha M Souza Port's; Jhully Azevedo Dos Santos Pinheiro; Ãndrea Ribeiro-Dos-Santos; Amanda F Vidal
34422879,Memorable Food: Fighting Age-Related Neurodegeneration by Precision Nutrition.,"Healthcare systems worldwide are seriously challenged by a rising prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), which mostly, but not exclusively, affect the ever-growing population of the elderly. The most known neurodegenerative diseases are Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, but some viral infections of the brain and traumatic brain injury may also cause NDD. Typical for NDD are the malfunctioning of neurons and their irreversible loss, which often progress irreversibly to dementia and ultimately to death. Numerous factors are involved in the pathogenesis of NDD: genetic variability, epigenetic changes, extent of oxidative/nitrosative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and DNA damage. The complex interplay of all the above-mentioned factors may be a fingerprint of neurodegeneration, with different diseases being affected to different extents by particular factors. There is a voluminous body of evidence showing the benefits of regular exercise to brain health and cognitive functions. Moreover, the importance of a healthy diet, balanced in macro- and micro-nutrients, in preventing neurodegeneration and slowing down a progression to full-blown disease is evident. Individuals affected by NDD almost inevitably have low-grade inflammation and anomalies in lipid metabolism. Metabolic and lipid profiles in NDD can be improved by the Mediterranean diet. Many studies have associated the Mediterranean diet with a decreased risk of dementia and AD, but a cause-and-effect relationship has not been deduced. Studies with caloric restriction showed neuroprotective effects in animal models, but the results in humans are inconsistent. The pathologies of NDD are complex and there is a great inter-individual (epi)genetic variance within any population. Furthermore, the gut microbiome, being deeply involved in nutrient uptake and lipid metabolism, also represents a pillar of the gut microbiome-brain axis and is linked with the pathogenesis of NDD. Numerous studies on the role of different micronutrients (omega-3 fatty acids, bioactive polyphenols from fruit and medicinal plants) in the prevention, prediction, and treatment of NDD have been conducted, but we are still far away from a personalized diet plan for individual NDD patients. For this to be realized, large-scale cohorts that would include the precise monitoring of food intake, mapping of genetic variants, epigenetic data, microbiome studies, and metabolome, lipidome, and transcriptome data are needed.",Frontiers in nutrition,2021,Maja MiloÅ¡eviÄ; Aleksandra ArsiÄ; Zorica CvetkoviÄ; Vesna VuÄiÄ
34422393,"A discussion of the gut microbiome's development, determinants, and dysbiosis in cancers of the esophagus and stomach.","The microbiome refers to a population of microbes that colonize the skin, nasopharynx, oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, and urogenital tract. The human microbiome consists of bacteria, archaea, fungi, viruses, and phages. Recent advances in genomic sequencing have catalyzed a deeper understanding of complex microbe-microbe and host-microbe interactions. Dysregulation of these interactions, or dysbiosis of the gastrointestinal tract, has been implicated in a growing list of pathologies including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, depression, Parkinson's disease, autism, and various gastrointestinal cancers. Gastric and esophageal cancer, for example, continue to remain as two of the most common causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, therefore there is an increased emphasis on investigating the role of dysbiosis on these cancers. In this review, we discuss the development and structure of the gut microbiome, its homeostatic and dysbiotic mechanisms, and the key microbes in esophageal and gastric carcinogenesis with a focus on bacterial biology. Further clarification of these pathways and discovery of diagnostic or therapeutic targets could have broad impacts on global subpopulations. It is important to understand the nature of the gastrointestinal tract microbiome and its potentional risk factors for dysbiosis in order to tailor its application to the individual patient and create an era of highly personalized, precision medicine.",Journal of gastrointestinal oncology,2021,Karan Grover; Stephanie Gregory; John F Gibbs; Nancy J Emenaker

We hypothesize that the microbiome is the missing link. Genetic studies have shown that overexpression of alpha-synuclein, a key pathological protein in Parkinson's disease (PD), can cause familial PD and variants at alpha-synuclein locus confer risk of idiopathic PD. Recently, dysbiosis of gut microbiome in PD was identified: altered abundances of three microbial clusters were found, one of which was composed of opportunistic pathogens. Using two large datasets, we found evidence that the overabundance of opportunistic pathogens in PD gut is influenced by the host genotype at the alpha-synuclein locus, and that the variants responsible modulate alpha-synuclein expression. Results put forth testable hypotheses on the role of gut microbiome in the pathogenesis of PD, the incomplete penetrance of PD susceptibility genes, and potential triggers of pathology in the gut.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2021,Zachary D Wallen; William J Stone; Stewart A Factor; Eric Molho; Cyrus P Zabetian; David G Standaert; Haydeh Payami

But in recent decades, compelling evidence has led the scientific community to place a greater emphasis on the role of gut microbes on the brain. Pathological observations and early gastrointestinal symptoms highlighted that gut dysbiosis likely precedes the onset of cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. The delicate balance in the number and functions of pathogenic microbes and alternative probiotic populations is critical in the modulation of systemic inflammation and neuronal health. However, there is limited success in restoring healthy microbial biodiversity in AD and PD patients with general probiotics interventions and fecal microbial therapies. Fortunately, the gut microflora is susceptible to long-term extrinsic influences such as lifestyle and dietary choices, providing opportunities for treatment through comparatively individual-specific control of human behavior. In this review, we examine the impact of restrictive diets on the gut microbiome populations associated with AD and PD. The overall evidence presented supports that gut dysbiosis is a plausible prelude to disease onset, and early dietary interventions are likely beneficial for the prevention and treatment of progressive neurodegenerative diseases.","Life (Basel, Switzerland)",2021,Li Yang Tan; Xin Yi Yeo; Han-Gyu Bae; Delia Pei Shan Lee; Roger C Ho; Jung Eun Kim; Dong-Gyu Jo; Sangyong Jung
34346706,Gut Microbiome and Serum Metabolome Alterations Associated with Isolated Dystonia.,"Dystonia is a complex neurological movement disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions. Increasing studies implicate the microbiome as a possible key susceptibility factor for neurological disorders, but the relationship between the gut microbiota and dystonia remains poorly explored. Here, the gut microbiota of 57 patients with isolated dystonia and 27 age- and environment-matched healthy controls was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Further, integrative analysis of the gut microbiome and serum metabolome measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was performed. No difference in Î±-diversity was found, while Î²-diversity was significantly different, with a more heterogeneous community structure among dystonia patients than among controls. The most significant changes in dystonia highlighted an increase in <i>Clostridiales</i>, including Blautia obeum, Dorea longicatena, and Eubacterium hallii, and a reduction in Bacteroides vulgatus and Bacteroides plebeius. The functional analysis revealed that genes related to tryptophan and purine biosynthesis were more abundant in gut microbiota from patients with dystonia, while genes linked to citrate cycle, vitamin B<sub>6</sub>, and glycan metabolism were less abundant. The evaluation of serum metabolites revealed altered levels of l-glutamic acid, taurine, and d-tyrosine, suggesting changes in neurotransmitter metabolism. The most modified metabolites strongly inversely correlated with the abundance of members belonging to the <i>Clostridiales</i>, revealing the effect of the gut microbiota on neurometabolic activity. This study is the first to reveal gut microbial dysbiosis in patients with isolated dystonia and identified potential links between gut microbiota and serum neurotransmitters, providing new insight into the pathogenesis of isolated dystonia. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Dystonia is the third most common movement disorder after essential tremor and Parkinson's disease. However, the cause for the majority of cases is not known. This is the first study so far that reveals significant alterations of gut microbiome and correlates the alteration of serum metabolites with gut dysbiosis in patients with isolated dystonia. We demonstrated a general overrepresentation of <i>Clostridiales</i> and underrepresentation of <i>Bacteroidetes</i> in patients with dystonia in comparison with healthy controls. The functional analysis found that genes related to the biosynthesis of tryptophan, which is the precursor of the neurotransmitter serotonin, were more active in isolated dystonia patients. Altered levels of several serum metabolites were found to be associated with microbial changes, such as d-tyrosine, taurine, and glutamate, indicating differences in neurotransmitter metabolism in isolated dystonia. Integrative analysis suggests that neurotransmitter system dysfunction may be a possible pathway by which the gut microbiome participates in the development of dystonia. The gut microbiome changes provide new insight into the pathogenesis of dystonia, suggesting new potential therapeutic directions.",mSphere,2021,Lingyan Ma; Jing Keng; Min Cheng; Hua Pan; Bo Feng; Yongfeng Hu; Tao Feng; Fan Yang

This review is aimed at highlighting the relationship between PD and the gastrointestinal tract, along with the supporting evidence for this. Firstly, we will focus on the gastrointestinal conditions and symptoms which commonly affects patients, including both upper and lower gastrointestinal issues. Secondly, the impact of nutrition and diet on neurological health and PD physiology, with particular emphasis on commonly consumed items including macronutrients and micronutrients. Finally, variability of the gut microbiome will also be discussed and its link with both the symptoms and signs of PD.

34171417,The neuromicrobiology of Parkinson's disease: A unifying theory.,"Recent evidence confirms that PD is indeed a multifactorial disease with different aetiologies and prodromal symptomatology that likely depend on the initial trigger. New players with important roles as triggers, facilitators and aggravators of the PD neurodegenerative process have re-emerged in the last few years, the microbes. Having evolved in association with humans for ages, microbes and their products are now seen as fundamental regulators of human physiology with disturbances in their balance being increasingly accepted to have a relevant impact on the progression of disease in general and on PD in particular. In this review, we comprehensively address early studies that have directly or indirectly linked bacteria or other infectious agents to the onset and progression of PD, from the earliest suspects to the most recent culprits, the gut microbiota. The quest for effective treatments to arrest PD progression must inevitably address the different interactions between microbiota and human cells, and naturally consider the gut-brain axis. The comprehensive characterization of such mechanisms will help design innovative bacteriotherapeutic approaches to selectively shape the gut microbiota profile ultimately to halt PD progression.

Important limitations of this work include small sample sizes and low-resolution taxonomic markers. Accordingly, we studied 162 gut microbiomes of mild and severe Graves' disease (GD) patients and healthy controls. Taxonomic and functional analyses based on metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) and MAG-annotated genes, together with predicted metabolic functions and metabolite profiles, revealed a well-defined network of MAGs, genes and clinical indexes separating healthy from GD subjects. A supervised classification model identified a combination of biomarkers including microbial species, MAGs, genes and SNPs, with predictive power superior to models from any single biomarker type (AUCâ=â0.98).

In addition to genetics, some environmental factors may exert vital parts in PD occurrence as well. At present, more and more studies are conducted to elucidate the association between gut microbial dysbiosis and the incidence of PD. Gut microbial dysbiosis has a certain effect on both the central nervous system (CNS) and the enteric nervous system (ENS), which indicates that there is a gut-microbiota-brain axis that induces CNS disorders. Some gut microbial strains are suggested to suppress or weaken the neuroinflammation- and gut-inflammation-immune responses, which suggests the protective and pathogenic effects of certain gut microbial species on PD progression. Therefore, gut microbiome may contain plenty of targets for preventing and managing PD. Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) may serve as a direct and useful treatment for PD in the future. Nonetheless, there is little available scientific research in this field.

34034646,Comparison study of differential abundance testing methods using two large Parkinson disease gut microbiome datasets derived from 16S amplicon sequencing.,"Testing for differential abundance of microbes in disease is a common practice in microbiome studies. Numerous differential abundance (DA) testing methods exist and range from traditional statistical tests to methods designed for microbiome data. Comparison studies of DA testing methods have been performed, but none performed on microbiome datasets collected for the study of real, complex disease. Due to this, DA testing was performed here using various DA methods in two large, uniformly collected gut microbiome datasets on Parkinson disease (PD), and their results compared.Overall, 78-92% of taxa tested were detected as differentially abundant by at least one method, while 5-22% were called differentially abundant by the majority of methods (depending on dataset and filtering of taxonomic data prior to testing). Concordances between method results ranged from 1 to 100%. Average concordance for datasets 1 and 2 were 24% and 28% respectively, and 27% for replicated DA signatures. Concordances increased when removing rarer taxa before testing, increasing average concordances by 2-32%. Certain methods consistently resulted in higher concordances (e.g. ANCOM-BC, LEfSe), while others consistently resulted in lower (e.g. edgeR, fitZIG). Hierarchical clustering revealed three groups of DA signatures that were (1) replicated by the majority of methods on average and included taxa previously associated with PD, (2) replicated by a subset of methods and included taxa largely enriched in PD, and (3) replicated by few to one method(s).Differential abundance tests yielded varied concordances, and amounts of detected DA signatures. Some methods were more concordant than others on both filtered and unfiltered data, therefore, if consistency with other study methodology is a key goal, one might choose among these methods. Even still, using one method on one dataset may find true associations, but may also detect false positives. To help lower false positives, one might analyze data with two or more DA methods to gauge concordance, and use a built-in replication dataset. This study will hopefully serve to complement previously reported DA method comparison studies by implementing and coalescing a large number of both previously and yet to be compared methods on two real gut microbiome datasets.",BMC bioinformatics,2021,Zachary D Wallen

Although SARS-CoV-2 infections are not more prevalent in Parkinson's disease patients, a higher mortality rate has been reported not only associated with older age and longer disease duration, but also through several mechanisms, such as interactions with the brain dopaminergic system and through systemic inflammatory responses. Indeed, a number of the neurological symptoms seen in COVID-19 patients, as well as the alterations in the gut microbiome, are also prevalent in patients with Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, biochemical pathways such as oxidative stress, inflammation, and protein aggregation have shared commonalities between Parkinson's disease and COVID-19 disease progression.

33968794,Review: The Role of Intestinal Dysbiosis in Parkinson's Disease.,"Several studies have highlighted the roles played by the gut microbiome in central nervous system diseases. Clinical symptoms and neuropathology have suggested that Parkinson's disease may originate in the gut, which is home to approximately 100 trillion microbes. Alterations in the gastrointestinal microbiota populations may promote the development and progression of Parkinson's disease. Here, we reviewed existing studies that have explored the role of intestinal dysbiosis in Parkinson's disease, focusing on the roles of microbiota, their metabolites, and components in inflammation, barrier failure, microglial activation, and Î±-synuclein pathology. We conclude that there are intestinal dysbiosis in Parkinson's disease. Intestinal dysbiosis is likely involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease through mechanisms that include barrier destruction, inflammation and oxidative stress, decreased dopamine production, and molecular mimicry. Additional studies remain necessary to explore and verify the mechanisms through which dysbiosis may cause or promote Parkinson's disease. Preclinical studies have shown that gastrointestinal microbial therapy may represent an effective and novel treatment for Parkinson's disease; however, more studies, especially clinical studies, are necessary to explore the curative effects of microbial therapy in Parkinson's disease.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2021,Yiying Huang; Jinchi Liao; Xu Liu; Yunxiao Zhong; Xiaodong Cai; Ling Long

Chronic constipation frequently manifests prior to motor symptoms and impairs quality of life. An osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM) sequence used physical exam assessment and manual treatment of neuromusculoskeletal dysfunctions pertinent to constipation in PD for this prospective ABA-design study, IRB-NYITBHS1065. The effects of 4 weekly treatments on the gut microbiome among men and women over 40 years old with chronic constipation and PD were investigated. Severity of PD was rated with the Movement Disorders Society-Unified PD rating scale (UPDRS) in six subjects with constipation. Also, the Bristol stool scale and questionnaires validated for constipation were administered for diagnosis, symptom severity, and quality of life during a 4-week control-period (A), 4-weekly OMM-treatments (B), and 2-weeks no-intervention (A). Biweekly stool samples were assessed for normalized microbiota abundance.The mean Bristol rating improved from type 2 (Â± 1) Pre-OMM to 3 (Â± 1; p = .167; d = 0.677) Post-OMM. Mean constipation severity significantly decreased (p = .010; d = 1.508) Post-OMM. Mean quality of life significantly improved (p = .041; d = 1.072) Post-OMM. The Pre-OMM mean number of families within the phylum Firmicutes decreased by 3 (p = .043; d = 1.177) Post-OMM.

33819374,"Trimethylamine modulates dauer formation, neurodegeneration, and lifespan through tyra-3/daf-11 signaling in Caenorhabditis elegans.","In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, signals derived from bacteria in the diet, the animal's major nutrient source, can modulate both behavior and healthspan. Here we describe a dual role for trimethylamine (TMA), a human gut flora metabolite, which acts as a nutrient signal and a neurotoxin. TMA and its associated metabolites are produced by the human gut microbiome and have been suggested to serve as risk biomarkers for diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. We demonstrate that the tyramine receptor TYRA-3, a conserved G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), is required to sense TMA and mediate its responses. TMA activates guanylyl cyclase DAF-11 signaling through TYRA-3 in amphid neurons (ASK) and ciliated neurons (BAG) to mediate food-sensing behavior. Bacterial mutants deficient in TMA production enhance dauer formation, extend lifespan, and are less preferred as a food source. Increased levels of TMA lead to neural damage in models of Parkinson's disease and shorten lifespan. Our results reveal conserved signaling pathways modulated by TMA in C. elegans that are likely to be relevant for its effects in mammalian systems.",Aging cell,2021,Amit Khanna; Durai Sellegounder; Jitendra Kumar; Manish Chamoli; Miguel Vargas; Shankar J Chinta; Anand Rane; Christopher Nelson; T Harshani Peiris; Rachel Brem; Julie Andersen; Gordon Lithgow; Pankaj Kapahi
33782648,Preventing and Treating Neurological Disorders with the Flavonol Fisetin.,"Neurological disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases, have a significant negative impact on both patients and society at large. Since the prevalence of most of these disorders increases with age, the consequences for our aging population are only going to grow. It is now acknowledged that neurological disorders are multi-factorial involving disruptions in multiple cellular systems. While each disorder has specific initiating mechanisms and pathologies, certain common pathways appear to be involved in most, if not all, neurological disorders. Thus, it is becoming increasingly important to identify compounds that can modulate the multiple pathways that contribute to disease development or progression. One of these compounds is the flavonol fisetin. Fisetin has now been shown in preclinical models to be effective at preventing the development and/or progression of multiple neurological disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, stroke (both ischemic and hemorrhagic) and traumatic brain injury as well as to reduce age-associated changes in the brain. These beneficial effects stem from its actions on multiple pathways associated with the different neurological disorders. These actions include its well characterized anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects as well as more recently described effects on the regulated cell death oxytosis/ferroptosis pathway, the gut microbiome and its senolytic activity. Therefore, the growing body of pre-clinical data, along with fisetin's ability to modulate a large number of pathways associated with brain dysfunction, strongly suggest that it would be worthwhile to pursue its therapeutic effects in humans.","Brain plasticity (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2021,Pamela Maher
33717189,Microbiome or Infections: Amyloid-Containing Biofilms as a Trigger for Complex Human Diseases.,"The human microbiota is the community of microorganisms that live upon or within their human host. The microbiota consists of various microorganisms including bacteria, fungi, viruses, and archaea; the gut microbiota is comprised mostly of bacteria. Many bacterial species within the gut microbiome grow as biofilms, which are multicellular communities embedded in an extracellular matrix. Studies have shown that the relative abundances of bacterial species, and therefore biofilms and bacterial byproducts, change during progression of a variety of human diseases including gastrointestinal, autoimmune, neurodegenerative, and cancer. Studies have shown the location and proximity of the biofilms within the gastrointestinal tract might impact disease outcome. Gram-negative enteric bacteria secrete the amyloid curli, which makes up as much as 85% of the extracellular matrix of enteric biofilms. Curli mediates cell-cell attachment and attachment to various surfaces including extracellular matrix components such as fibronectin and laminin. Structurally, curli is strikingly similar to pathological and immunomodulatory human amyloids such as amyloid-Î², which has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease, Î±-synuclein, which is involved in Parkinson's disease, and serum amyloid A, which is secreted during the acute phase of inflammation. The immune system recognizes both bacterial amyloid curli and human amyloids utilizing the same receptors, so curli also induces inflammation. Moreover, recent work indicates that curli can participate in the self-assembly process of pathological human amyloids. Curli is found within biofilms of commensal enteric bacteria as well as invasive pathogens; therefore, evidence suggests that curli contributes to complex human diseases. In this review, we summarize the recent findings on how bacterial biofilms containing curli participate in the pathological and immunological processes in gastrointestinal diseases, systemic autoimmune diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases.",Frontiers in immunology,2021,Amanda L Miller; Shingo Bessho; Kaitlyn Grando; Ãagla TÃ¼kel
33692356,Meta-analysis of the Parkinson's disease gut microbiome suggests alterations linked to intestinal inflammation.,"The gut microbiota is emerging as an important modulator of neurodegenerative diseases, and accumulating evidence has linked gut microbes to Parkinson's disease (PD) symptomatology and pathophysiology. PD is often preceded by gastrointestinal symptoms and alterations of the enteric nervous system accompany the disease. Several studies have analyzed the gut microbiome in PD, but a consensus on the features of the PD-specific microbiota is missing. Here, we conduct a meta-analysis re-analyzing the ten currently available 16S microbiome datasets to investigate whether common alterations in the gut microbiota of PD patients exist across cohorts. We found significant alterations in the PD-associated microbiome, which are robust to study-specific technical heterogeneities, although differences in microbiome structure between PD and controls are small. Enrichment of the genera Lactobacillus, Akkermansia, and Bifidobacterium and depletion of bacteria belonging to the Lachnospiraceae family and the Faecalibacterium genus, both important short-chain fatty acids producers, emerged as the most consistent PD gut microbiome alterations. This dysbiosis might result in a pro-inflammatory status which could be linked to the recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms affecting PD patients.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2021,Stefano Romano; George M Savva; Janis R Bedarf; Ian G Charles; Falk Hildebrand; Arjan Narbad
33669008,"The Role of Gut Bacterial Metabolites in Brain Development, Aging and Disease.","In the last decade, emerging evidence has reported correlations between the gut microbiome and human health and disease, including those affecting the brain. We performed a systematic assessment of the available literature focusing on gut bacterial metabolites and their associations with diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). The bacterial metabolites short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) as well as non-SCFAs like amino acid metabolites (AAMs) and bacterial amyloids are described in particular. We found significantly altered SCFA levels in patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), affective disorders, multiple sclerosis (MS) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Non-SCFAs yielded less significantly distinct changes in faecal levels of patients and healthy controls, with the majority of findings were derived from urinary and blood samples. Preclinical studies have implicated different bacterial metabolites with potentially beneficial as well as detrimental mechanisms in brain diseases. Examples include immunomodulation and changes in catecholamine production by histone deacetylase inhibition, anti-inflammatory effects through activity on the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and involvement in protein misfolding. Overall, our findings highlight the existence of altered bacterial metabolites in patients across various brain diseases, as well as potential neuroactive effects by which gut-derived SCFAs, p-cresol, indole derivatives and bacterial amyloids could impact disease development and progression. The findings summarized in this review could lead to further insights into the gut-brain-axis and thus into potential diagnostic, therapeutic or preventive strategies in brain diseases.",Nutrients,2021,Shirley Mei-Sin Tran; M Hasan Mohajeri
33657381,Systematic analysis of gut microbiome reveals the role of bacterial folate and homocysteine metabolism in Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common progressive neurological disorder compromising motor functions. However, nonmotor symptoms, such as gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction, precede those affecting movement. Evidence of an early involvement of the GI tract and enteric nervous system highlights the need for better understanding of the role of gut microbiota in GI complications in PD. Here, we investigate the gut microbiome of patients with PD using metagenomics and serum metabolomics. We integrate these data using metabolic modeling and construct an integrative correlation network giving insight into key microbial species linked with disease severity, GI dysfunction, and age of patients with PD. Functional analysis reveals an increased microbial capability to degrade mucin and host glycans in PD. Personalized community-level metabolic modeling reveals the microbial contribution to folate deficiency and hyperhomocysteinemia observed in patients with PD. The metabolic modeling approach could be applied to uncover gut microbial metabolic contributions to PD pathophysiology.",Cell reports,2021,Dorines Rosario; Gholamreza Bidkhori; Sunjae Lee; Janis Bedarf; Falk Hildebrand; Emmanuelle Le Chatelier; Mathias Uhlen; Stanislav Dusko Ehrlich; Gordon Proctor; Ullrich WÃ¼llner; Adil Mardinoglu; Saeed Shoaie
33517890,Gut microbiota-derived propionate mediates the neuroprotective effect of osteocalcin in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with no absolute cure. The evidence of the involvement of gut microbiota in PD pathogenesis suggests the need to identify certain molecule(s) derived from the gut microbiota, which has the potential to manage PD. Osteocalcin (OCN), an osteoblast-secreted protein, has been shown to modulate brain function. Thus, it is of interest to investigate whether OCN could exert protective effect on PD and, if yes, whether the underlying mechanism lies in the subsequent changes in gut microbiota.The intraperitoneal injection of OCN can effectively ameliorate the motor deficits and dopaminergic neuronal loss in a 6-hydroxydopamine-induced PD mouse model. The further antibiotics treatment and fecal microbiota transplantation experiments confirmed that the gut microbiota was required for OCN-induced protection in PD mice. OCN elevated Bacteroidetes and depleted Firmicutes phyla in the gut microbiota of PD mice with elevated potential of microbial propionate production and was confirmed by fecal propionate levels. Two months of orally administered propionate successfully rescued motor deficits and dopaminergic neuronal loss in PD mice. Furthermore, AR420626, the agonist of FFAR3, which is the receptor of propionate, mimicked the neuroprotective effects of propionate and the ablation of enteric neurons blocked the prevention of dopaminergic neuronal loss by propionate in PD mice.Together, our results demonstrate that OCN ameliorates motor deficits and dopaminergic neuronal loss in PD mice, modulating gut microbiome and increasing propionate level might be an underlying mechanism responsible for the neuroprotective effects of OCN on PD, and the FFAR3, expressed in enteric nervous system, might be the main action site of propionate.

Of particular interest is the gut/microbiome-liver-brain axis for parsing out how genetic and environmental factors contribute to NDs. We have developed a mesofluidic platform technology to study gut-liver-cerebral interactions in the context of Parkinson's disease (PD). It connects microphysiological systems (MPSs) of the primary human gut and liver with a human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cerebral MPS in a systemically circulated common culture medium containing CD4<sup>+</sup> regulatory T and T helper 17 cells. We demonstrate this approach using a patient-derived cerebral MPS carrying the PD-causing A53T mutation, gaining two important findings: (i) that systemic interaction enhances features of in vivo-like behavior of cerebral MPSs, and (ii) that microbiome-associated short-chain fatty acids increase expression of pathology-associated pathways in PD.",Science advances,2021,Martin Trapecar; Emile Wogram; Devon Svoboda; Catherine Communal; Attya Omer; Tenzin Lungjangwa; Pierre Sphabmixay; Jason Velazquez; Kirsten Schneider; Charles W Wright; Samuel Mildrum; Austin Hendricks; Stuart Levine; Julien Muffat; Meelim Jasmine Lee; Douglas A Lauffenburger; David Trumper; Rudolf Jaenisch; Linda G Griffith

33422110,The impact of dextran sodium sulphate and probiotic pre-treatment in a murine model of Parkinson's disease.,"Recent work has established that Parkinson's disease (PD) patients have an altered gut microbiome, along with signs of intestinal inflammation. This could help explain the high degree of gastric disturbances in PD patients, as well as potentially be linked to the migration of peripheral inflammatory factors into the brain. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine microbiome alteration prior to the induction of a PD murine model.We presently assessed whether pre-treatment with the probiotic, VSL #3, or the inflammatory inducer, dextran sodium sulphate (DSS), would influence the PD-like pathology provoked by a dual hit toxin model using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and paraquat exposure.While VSL #3 has been reported to have anti-inflammatory effects, DSS is often used as a model of colitis because of the gut inflammation and the breach of the intestinal barrier that it induces. We found that VSL#3 did not have any significant effects (beyond a blunting of LPS paraquat-induced weight loss). However, the DSS treatment caused marked changes in the gut microbiome and was also associated with augmented behavioral and inflammatory outcomes. In fact, DSS markedly increased taxa belonging to the Bacteroidaceae and Porphyromonadaceae families but reduced those from Rikencellaceae and S24-7, as well as provoking colonic pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, consistent with an inflamed gut. The DSS also increased the impact of LPS plus paraquat upon microglial morphology, along with circulating lipocalin-2 (neutrophil marker) and IL-6. Yet, neither DSS nor VSL#3 influenced the loss of substantia nigra dopamine neurons or the astrocytic and cytoskeleton remodeling protein changes that were provoked by the LPS followed by paraquat treatment.These data suggest that disruption of the intestinal integrity and the associated microbiome can interact with systemic inflammatory events to promote widespread brain-gut changes that could be relevant for PD and at the very least, suggestive of novel neuro-immune communication.",Journal of neuroinflammation,2021,Zach Dwyer; Melany Chaiquin; Jeffrey Landrigan; Kiara Ayoub; Pragya Shail; Julianna Rocha; Christie L Childers; Kenneth B Storey; Dana J Philpott; Hongyu Sun; Shawn Hayley
33416892,Effects of dietary restriction on neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases.,"Recent and accumulating work in experimental animal models and humans shows that diet has a much more pervasive and prominent role than previously thought in modulating neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative mechanisms leading to some of the most common chronic central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Chronic or intermittent food restriction has profound effects in shaping brain and peripheral metabolism, immunity, and gut microbiome biology. Interactions among calorie intake, meal frequency, diet quality, and the gut microbiome modulate specific metabolic and molecular pathways that regulate cellular, tissue, and organ homeostasis as well as inflammation during normal brain aging and CNS neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis, among others.

33406628,Gut Microbiota Dysbiosis Is Associated with Elevated Bile Acids in Parkinson's Disease.,"The gut microbiome can impact brain health and is altered in Parkinson's disease (PD). The vermiform appendix is a lymphoid tissue in the cecum implicated in the storage and regulation of the gut microbiota. We sought to determine whether the appendix microbiome is altered in PD and to analyze the biological consequences of the microbial alterations. We investigated the changes in the functional microbiota in the appendix of PD patients relative to controls (<i>n</i> = 12 PD, 16 C) by metatranscriptomic analysis. We found microbial dysbiosis affecting lipid metabolism, including an upregulation of bacteria responsible for secondary bile acid synthesis. We then quantitatively measure changes in bile acid abundance in PD relative to the controls in the appendix (<i>n</i> = 15 PD, 12 C) and ileum (<i>n</i> = 20 PD, 20 C). Bile acid analysis in the PD appendix reveals an increase in hydrophobic and secondary bile acids, deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA). Further proteomic and transcriptomic analysis in the appendix and ileum corroborated these findings, highlighting changes in the PD gut that are consistent with a disruption in bile acid control, including alterations in mediators of cholesterol homeostasis and lipid metabolism. Microbially derived toxic bile acids are heightened in PD, which suggests biliary abnormalities may play a role in PD pathogenesis.",Metabolites,2021,Peipei Li; Bryan A Killinger; Elizabeth Ensink; Ian Beddows; Ali Yilmaz; Noah Lubben; Jared Lamp; Meghan Schilthuis; Irving E Vega; Randy Woltjer; J Andrew Pospisilik; Patrik Brundin; Lena Brundin; Stewart F Graham; Viviane Labrie
33063712,The emerging role of probiotics in neurodegenerative diseases: new hope for Parkinson's disease?,"Neurodegenerative disease etiology is still unclear, but different contributing factors, such as lifestyle and genetic factors are involved. Altered components of the gut could play a key role in the gut-brain axis, which is a bidirectional system between the central nervous system and the enteric nervous system. Variations in the composition of the gut microbiota and its function between healthy people and patients have been reported for a variety of human disorders comprising metabolic, autoimmune, cancer, and, notably, neurodegenerative disorders. Diet can alter the microbiota composition, affecting the gut-brain axis function. Different nutraceutical interventions have been devoted to normalizing gut microbiome dysbiosis and to improving biological outcomes in neurological conditions, including the use of probiotics. Preclinical and clinical investigations discussed in this review strengthen the correlation between intestinal microbiota and brain and the concept that modifying the microbiome composition may improve brain neurochemistry, modulating different pathways. This review will discuss the potential use of probiotics for Parkinson's disease prevention or treatment or as adjuvant therapy, confirming that gut microbiota modulation influences different pro-survival pathways.

PD is a gradually devastating neurodegenerative disorder of the neurological function marked with Î±-synucleinopathy affecting numerous regions of the brain-gut axis, as well as the central, enteric, and autonomic nervous system. Its etiology is a widely disputed topic.This review emphasizes to find out the correlation among the microbial composition and the observable disturbances in the metabolites of the microbial species and its impact on the immune response, which may have a concrete implication on the occurrence, persistence and, pathophysiology of PD via the gut-brain axis.An in-depth research and the database was developed from the available peer-reviewed articles to date (March 2020) utilizing numerous search engines like PubMed, MEDLINE and, other internet sources.Progressively increasing shreds of evidence have proved the fact that dysbiosis in the gut microbiome plays a central role in many neurological disorders, such as PD. Indeed, a disordered microbiome-gut-brain axis in PD could be focused on gastrointestinal afflictions that manifest primarily several years prior to the diagnosis, authenticating a concept wherein the pathological pathway progresses from the intestine reaching the brain.The microbiota greatly affects the bidirectional interaction between the brain and the gut via synchronized neurological, immunological, and neuroendocrine mechanisms.

36672595,Toxin-like Peptides from the Bacterial Cultures Derived from Gut Microbiome Infected by SARS-CoV-2-New Data for a Possible Role in the Long COVID Pattern.,"It has been 3 years since the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, however it is as yet little known how to care for the acute COVID-19 and long COVID patients. COVID-19 clinical manifestations are of both pulmonary and extra-pulmonary types. Extra-pulmonary ones include extreme tiredness (fatigue), shortness of breath, muscle aches, hyposmia, dysgeusia, and other neurological manifestations. In other autoimmune diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD) or Alzheimer's Disease (AD), it is well known that role of acetylcholine is crucial in olfactory dysfunction. We have already observed the presence of toxin-like peptides in plasma, urine, and faecal samples from COVID-19 patients, which are very similar to molecules known to alter acetylcholine signaling. After observing the production of these peptides in bacterial cultures, we have performed additional proteomics analyses to better understand their behavior and reported the extended data from our latest in vitro experiment. It seems that the gut microbiome continues to produce toxin-like peptides also after the decrease of RNA SARS-CoV-2 viral load at molecular tests. These toxicological interactions between the gut/human microbiome bacteria and the virus suggest a new scenario in the study of the clinical symptoms in long COVID and also in acute COVID-19 patients. It is discussed that in the bacteriophage similar behavior, the presence of toxins produced by bacteria continuously after viral aggression can be blocked using an appropriate combination of certain drugs.",Biomedicines,2022,Carlo Brogna; Simone Cristoni; Barbara Brogna; Domenico Rocco Bisaccia; Giuliano Marino; Valentina Viduto; Luigi Montano; Marina Piscopo

36564391,Inflammatory microbes and genes as potential biomarkers of Parkinson's disease.,"As the second-largest neurodegenerative disease in the world, Parkinson's disease (PD) has brought a severe economic and medical burden to our society. Growing evidence in recent years suggests that the gut microbiome may influence PD, but the exact pathogenesis of PD remains unclear. In addition, the current diagnosis of PD could be inaccurate and expensive. In this study, the largest meta-analysis currently of the gut microbiome in PD was analyzed, including 2269 samples by 16S rRNA gene and 236 samples by shotgun metagenomics, aiming to reveal the connection between PD and gut microbiome and establish a model to predict PD. The results showed that the relative abundances of potential pro-inflammatory bacteria, genes and pathways were significantly increased in PD, while potential anti-inflammatory bacteria, genes and pathways were significantly decreased. These changes may lead to a decrease in potential anti-inflammatory substances (short-chain fatty acids) and an increase in potential pro-inflammatory substances (lipopolysaccharides, hydrogen sulfide and glutamate). Notably, the results of 16S rRNA gene and shotgun metagenomic analysis have consistently identified five decreased genera (Roseburia, Faecalibacterium, Blautia, Lachnospira, and Prevotella) and five increased genera (Streptococcus, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Akkermansia, and Desulfovibrio) in PD. Furthermore, random forest models performed well for PD prediction based on 11 genera (accuracy > 80%) or 6 genes (accuracy > 90%) related to inflammation. Finally, a possible mechanism was presented to explain the pathogenesis of inflammation leading to PD. Our results provided further insights into the prediction and treatment of PD based on inflammation.",NPJ biofilms and microbiomes,2022,Shiqing Nie; Jichen Wang; Ye Deng; Zheng Ye; Yuan Ge

We discuss the hypothesis of a brain microbiota, the BrainBiota: bacteria living in symbiosis with brain cells. Existence of various bacteria in the human brain is suggested by morphological evidence, presence of bacterial proteins, metabolites, transcripts and mucosal-associated invariant T cells. Based on our data, we discuss the hypothesis that these bacteria are an integral part of brain development and immune tolerance as well as directly linked to the gut microbiome.

36516898,Effects of molecular hydrogen intervention on the gut microbiome in methamphetamine abusers with mental disorder.,"Methamphetamine (METH) is a potent and highly addictive psychostimulant and one of the most widely used illicit drugs, the abuse of which has become a severe public health problem worldwide. A growing amount of evidence has indicated potential connections between gut microbiota and mental disorders induced by METH and associations with neural and metabolic pathways. The present study aimed to explore the relationship between fecal microbial alterations and neuropsychiatric diseases in METH addictions. Thus, mental disorders and gut microbial alterations were analyzed by self-rating depression (SDS) and anxiety (SAS) scales and 16Â S rRNA gene sequencing, respectively. Our results showed that increased SDS and SAS indices and decreased alpha diversity indicated more serious mental disorders and lower bacterial diversity in METH users than in the age-matched healthy control group. The gut microbial composition in female METH users was also significantly altered, with reductions in hydrogen-producing bacteria, including Bacteroides and Roseburia. Molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) is spontaneously produced by intestinal bacteria in the process of anaerobic metabolism, which is the main pathway for H<sub>2</sub> production in vivo. Numerous studies have shown that hydrogen intervention can significantly improve neuropsychiatric diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Our results showed that hydrogen intervention, including drinking and inhaling, significantly alleviated mental disorders induced by METH abuse, and the inhalation of hydrogen also altered gut microbiota profiles in the METH abusers. These results suggest that hydrogen intervention has potential therapeutic applicability in the treatment of mental disorders in METH abusers.",Brain research bulletin,2023,Yong Wang; Mengmeng Wang; Bing Xie; Di Wen; Wenbo Li; Meiqi Zhou; Xintao Wang; Yun Lu; Bin Cong; Zhiyu Ni; Chunling Ma

36442206,Parkinson's Disease and the Gut Microbiome in Rural California.,"Increasing evidence connects the gut microbiome to Parkinson's disease (PD) etiology, but little is known about microbial contributions to PD progression and its clinical features.We aim to explore the association between the gut microbiome with PD, and the microbial association with PD-specific clinical features.In a community-based case-control study of 96 PD patients and 74 controls, microbiome data were obtained from 16S rRNA gene sequencing of fecal samples, and analyzed for microbial diversity, taxa abundance, and predicted functional pathways that differed in PD patients and controls, and their association with PD-specific features (disease duration, motor subtypes, L-DOPA daily dose, and motor function).PD patients' gut microbiome showed lower species diversity (pâ=â0.04) and were compositionally different (pâ=â0.002) compared to controls but had a higher abundance of three phyla (Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobiota, Actinobacteria) and five genera (Akkermansia, Enterococcus, Hungatella, and two Ruminococcaceae) controlling for sex, race, age, and sequencing platform. Also, 35 Metacyc pathways were predicted to be differentially expressed in PD patients including biosynthesis, compound degradation/utilization/assimilation, generation of metabolites and energy, and glycan pathways. Additionally, the postural instability gait dysfunction subtype was associated with three phyla and the NAD biosynthesis pathway. PD duration was associated with the Synergistota phylum, six genera, and the aromatic compound degradation pathways. Two genera were associated with motor function.PD patients differed from controls in gut microbiome composition and its predicted metagenome. Clinical features were also associated with bacterial taxa and altered metabolic pathways of interest for PD progression.",Journal of Parkinson's disease,2022,Keren Zhang; Kimberly C Paul; Jonathan P Jacobs; Hsiang-Chin Lori Chou; Aline Duarte Folle; Irish Del Rosario; Yu Yu; Jeff M Bronstein; Adrienne M Keener; Beate Ritz
36430144,What Are the Key Gut Microbiota Involved in Neurological Diseases? A Systematic Review.,"There is a growing body of evidence highlighting there are significant changes in the gut microbiota composition and relative abundance in various neurological disorders. We performed a systematic review of the different microbiota altered in a wide range of neurological disorders (Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and stroke). Fifty-two studies were included representing 5496 patients. At the genus level, the most frequently involved microbiota are Akkermansia, Faecalibacterium, and Prevotella. The overlap between the pathologies was strongest for MS and PD, sharing eight genera (Akkermansia, Butyricicoccus, Bifidobacterium, Coprococcus, Dorea, Faecalibacterium, Parabacteroides, and Prevotella) and PD and stroke, sharing six genera (Enterococcus, Faecalibacterium, Lactobacillus, Parabacteroides, Prevotella, and Roseburia). The identification signatures overlapping for AD, PD, and MS raise the question of whether these reflect a common etiology or rather common consequence of these diseases. The interpretation is hampered by the low number and low power for AD, ALS, and stroke with ample opportunity for false positive and false negative findings.",International journal of molecular sciences,2022,Bruno BonnechÃ¨re; Najaf Amin; Cornelia van Duijn
36411639,Deciphering the gut microbiome in neurodegenerative diseases and metagenomic approaches for characterization of gut microbes.,"The central nervous system has essential role in the regulation of the physiological condition of the human body. Gut microbes cause several types of gastrointestinal diseases like ulcer stomach and intestine and irritable bowel syndrome. Microbes present in the human gut can affect brain function by the release of neuroactive metabolites such as neurotransmitters, hormones, and other compounds. Gut microbial-derived metabolites also have an important role in neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, etc. Vital communication between the gut microbes and the central nervous system is known as the microbiota-gut-brain axis. It provides a communication pathway between the gut and brain which is made up of the vagus nerve, immune system components, and neuroendocrine. Disturbance in gut microbiota composition can alter the central nervous system and enteric nervous system functions. Metagenomics has been employed for the identification, and characterization of gut microbes and microbial-derived metabolites. This review is focused on the gut microbes-brain relationship and the role of gut microbes in neurodegenerative diseases. This study is also focused on major metagenomic approaches and their role in gut microbes characterization.",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2022,Nidhi Singh; Veer Singh; Sachchida Nand Rai; Vishal Mishra; Emanuel Vamanu; Mohan P Singh
36406749,A review of the preclinical and clinical studies on the role of the gut microbiome in aging and neurodegenerative diseases and its modulation.,"As the world population ages, the burden of age-related health problems grows, creating a greater demand for new novel interventions for healthy aging. Advancing aging is related to a loss of beneficial mutualistic microbes in the gut microbiota caused by extrinsic and intrinsic factors such as diet, sedentary lifestyle, sleep deprivation, circadian rhythms, and oxidative stress, which emerge as essential elements in controlling and prolonging life expectancy of healthy aging. This condition is known as gut dysbiosis, and it affects normal brain function via the brain-gut microbiota (BGM) axis, which is a bidirectional link between the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and the central nervous system (CNS) that leads to the emergence of brain disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Here, we reviewed the role of the gut microbiome in aging and neurodegenerative diseases, as well as provided a comprehensive review of recent findings from preclinical and clinical studies to present an up-to-date overview of recent advances in developing strategies to modulate the intestinal microbiome by probiotic administration, dietary intervention, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and physical activity to address the aging process and prevent neurodegenerative diseases. The findings of this review will provide researchers in the fields of aging and the gut microbiome design innovative studies that leverage results from preclinical and clinical studies to better understand the nuances of aging, gut microbiome, and neurodegenerative diseases.",Frontiers in cellular neuroscience,2022,Haslin Madihah Hashim; Suzana Makpol
36400238,Bile acids and neurological disease.,"This review will focus on how bile acids are being used in clinical trials to treat neurological diseases due to their central involvement with the gut-liver-brain axis and their physiological and pathophysiological roles in both normal brain function and multiple neurological diseases. The synthesis of primary and secondary bile acids species and how the regulation of the bile acid pool may differ between the gut and brain is discussed. The expression of several bile acid receptors in brain and their currently known functions along with the tools available to manipulate them pharmacologically are examined, together with discussion of the interaction of bile acids with the gut microbiome and their lesser-known effects upon brain glucose and lipid metabolism. How dysregulation of the gut microbiome, aging and sex differences may lead to disruption of bile acid signalling and possible causal roles in a number of neurological disorders are also considered. Finally, we discuss how pharmacological treatments targeting bile acid receptors are currently being tested in an array of clinical trials for several different neurodegenerative diseases.",Pharmacology & therapeutics,2022,Michael J Hurley; Rachel Bates; Jane Macnaughtan; Anthony H V Schapira
36389228,The interplay between the gut-brain axis and the microbiome: A perspective on psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.,"What is the effect of our gut microbial flora on brain? Does the gut microbiome have any role in the causation of psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases? Does the effect of gut microbiota traverse the gut-brain axis? Questions like these have captured the interest and imagination of the scientific community for quite some time now. Research in the quest for answers to these questions, to unravel the potential role of the microbiota inhabiting the gut in controlling brain functions, has progressed manifold over the last two decades. Although the possibility of microbiome as a key susceptibility factor for neurological disorders viz. Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and autism spectrum disorder has bolstered by an increase in the clinical and preclinical evidence, the field is still in its infancy. Given the fact that the diversity of the gut microbiota is affected by various factors including the diet and exercise, the interpretation of such data becomes all the more difficult. Also, such studies have been mostly conducted on animal models, so there is a need for randomized controlled trials in human subjects, corroborated by longitudinal studies, to establish if modulating the gut microbiota can unravel novel therapeutic interventions. Exploring the genomic, metagenomic and metabolomic data from clinical subjects with psychiatric and neurological diseases can prove to be a helpful guide in individual treatment selection.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2022,Yasir Bashir; Asad U Khan
36376318,Metagenomics of Parkinson's disease implicates the gut microbiome in multiple disease mechanisms.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) may start in the gut and spread to the brain. To investigate the role of gut microbiome, we conducted a large-scale study, at high taxonomic resolution, using uniform standardized methods from start to end. We enrolled 490 PD and 234 control individuals, conducted deep shotgun sequencing of fecal DNA, followed by metagenome-wide association studies requiring significance by two methods (ANCOM-BC and MaAsLin2) to declare disease association, network analysis to identify polymicrobial clusters, and functional profiling. Here we show that over 30% of species, genes and pathways tested have altered abundances in PD, depicting a widespread dysbiosis. PD-associated species form polymicrobial clusters that grow or shrink together, and some compete. PD microbiome is disease permissive, evidenced by overabundance of pathogens and immunogenic components, dysregulated neuroactive signaling, preponderance of molecules that induce alpha-synuclein pathology, and over-production of toxicants; with the reduction in anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective factors limiting the capacity to recover. We validate, in human PD, findings that were observed in experimental models; reconcile and resolve human PD microbiome literature; and provide a broad foundation with a wealth of concrete testable hypotheses to discern the role of the gut microbiome in PD.",Nature communications,2022,Zachary D Wallen; Ayse Demirkan; Guy Twa; Gwendolyn Cohen; Marissa N Dean; David G Standaert; Timothy R Sampson; Haydeh Payami
36353491,Gut microbiome and human health: Exploring how the probiotic genus <i>Lactobacillus</i> modulate immune responses.,"The highest density of microbes resides in human gastrointestinal tract, known as ""Gut microbiome"". Of note, the members of the genus <i>Lactobacillus</i> that belong to phyla Firmicutes are the most important probiotic bacteria of the gut microbiome. These gut-residing <i>Lactobacillus</i> species not only communicate with each other but also with the gut epithelial lining to balance the gut barrier integrity, mucosal barrier defence and ameliorate the host immune responses. The human body suffers from several inflammatory diseases affecting the gut, lungs, heart, bone or neural tissues. Mounting evidence supports the significant role of <i>Lactobacillus</i> spp. and their components (such as metabolites, peptidoglycans, and/or surface proteins) in modulatingimmune responses, primarily through exchange of immunological signals between gastrointestinal tract and distant organs. This bidirectional crosstalk which is mediated by <i>Lactobacillus</i> spp. promotes anti-inflammatory response, thereby supporting the improvement of symptoms pertaining to asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), neuroinflammatory diseases (such as multiple sclerosis, alzheimer's disease, parkinson's disease), cardiovascular diseases, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and chronic infections in patients. The metabolic disorders, obesity and diabetes are characterized by a low-grade inflammation. Genus <i>Lactobacillus</i> alleviates metabolic disorders by regulating the oxidative stress response and inflammatory pathways. Osteoporosis is also associated with bone inflammation and resorption. The <i>Lactobacillus</i> spp. and their metabolites act as powerful immune cell controllers and exhibit a regulatory role in bone resorption and formation, supporting bone health. Thus, this review demonstrated the mechanisms and summarized the evidence of the benefit of <i>Lactobacillus</i> spp. in alleviating inflammatory diseases pertaining to different organs from animal and clinical trials. The present narrative review explores in detail the complex interactions between the gut-dwelling <i>Lactobacillus</i> spp. and the immune components in distant organs to promote host's health.",Frontiers in pharmacology,2022,Sonakshi Rastogi; Aditi Singh
36346385,A prebiotic diet modulates microglial states and motor deficits in Î±-synuclein overexpressing mice.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a movement disorder characterized by neuroinflammation, Î±-synuclein pathology, and neurodegeneration. Most cases of PD are non-hereditary, suggesting a strong role for environmental factors, and it has been speculated that disease may originate in peripheral tissues such as the gastrointestinal (GI) tract before affecting the brain. The gut microbiome is altered in PD and may impact motor and GI symptoms as indicated by animal studies, although mechanisms of gut-brain interactions remain incompletely defined. Intestinal bacteria ferment dietary fibers into short-chain fatty acids, with fecal levels of these molecules differing between PD and healthy controls and in mouse models. Among other effects, dietary microbial metabolites can modulate activation of microglia, brain-resident immune cells implicated in PD. We therefore investigated whether a fiber-rich diet influences microglial function in Î±-synuclein overexpressing (ASO) mice, a preclinical model with PD-like symptoms and pathology. Feeding a prebiotic high-fiber diet attenuates motor deficits and reduces Î±-synuclein aggregation in the substantia nigra of mice. Concomitantly, the gut microbiome of ASO mice adopts a profile correlated with health upon prebiotic treatment, which also reduces microglial activation. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of microglia from the substantia nigra and striatum uncovers increased pro-inflammatory signaling and reduced homeostatic responses in ASO mice compared to wild-type counterparts on standard diets. However, prebiotic feeding reverses pathogenic microglial states in ASO mice and promotes expansion of protective disease-associated macrophage (DAM) subsets of microglia. Notably, depletion of microglia using a CSF1R inhibitor eliminates the beneficial effects of prebiotics by restoring motor deficits to ASO mice despite feeding a prebiotic diet. These studies uncover a novel microglia-dependent interaction between diet and motor symptoms in mice, findings that may have implications for neuroinflammation and PD.",eLife,2022,Reem Abdel-Haq; Johannes C M Schlachetzki; Joseph C Boktor; Thaisa M Cantu-Jungles; Taren Thron; Mengying Zhang; John W Bostick; Tahmineh Khazaei; Sujatha Chilakala; Livia H Morais; Greg Humphrey; Ali Keshavarzian; Jonathan E Katz; Matthew Thomson; Rob Knight; Viviana Gradinaru; Bruce R Hamaker; Christopher K Glass; Sarkis K Mazmanian
36334762,Are neuromodulation interventions associated with changes in the gut microbiota? A systematic review.,"The microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) refers to the bidirectional communication between the brain and the gut microbiota and recent studies have linked the MGBA to health and disease. Research has so far investigated this axis mainly from microbiota to brain but less is known about the other direction. One approach to examine the MGBA from brain to microbiota is through understanding if and how neuromodulation might impact microbiota. Neuromodulation encompasses a wide range of stimulation techniques and is used to treat neurological, psychiatric and metabolic disorders, like Parkinson's Disease, depression and obesity. Here, we performed a systematic review to investigate whether neuromodulation is associated with subsequent changes in the gut microbiota. Searches in PsycINFO and MEDLINE were performed up to March 2022. Included studies needed to be clinical or preclinical studies comparing the effects of deep brain stimulation, electroconvulsive therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation or vagal nerve stimulation on the gut microbiota before and after treatment or between active and control groups. Seven studies were identified. Neuromodulation was associated with changes in relative bacterial abundances, but not with (changes in) Î±-diversity or Î²-diversity. Summarizing, currently reported findings suggest that neuromodulation interventions are associated with moderate changes in the gut microbiome. However, findings remain inconclusive due to the limited number and varying quality of included studies, as well as the large heterogeneity between studies. More research is required to more conclusively establish whether, and if so, via which mechanism(s) of action neuromodulation interventions might influence the gut microbiota.",Neuropharmacology,2023,Vera Korenblik; Marlies E Brouwer; Aniko Korosi; Damiaan Denys; Claudi L H Bockting; Stanley Brul; Anja Lok
36332796,Gut microbiome and Parkinson's disease: Perspective on pathogenesis and treatment.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a disease of âº-synuclein aggregation-mediated dopaminergic neuronal loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta, which leads to motor and non-motor symptoms. Through the last two decades of research, there has been growing consensus that inflammation-mediated oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cytokine-induced toxicity are mainly involved in neuronal damage and loss associated with PD. However, it remains unclear how these mechanisms relate to sporadic PD, a more common form of PD. Both enteric and central nervous systems have been implicated in the pathogenesis of sporadic PD, thus highlighting the crosstalk between the gut and brain.of Review: In this review, we summarize how alterations in the gut microbiome can affect PD pathogenesis. We highlight various mechanisms increasing/decreasing the risk of PD development. Based on the previous supporting evidence, we suggest how early interventions could protect against PD development and how controlling specific factors, including our diet, could modify our perspective on disease mechanisms and therapeutics. We explain the strong relationship between the gut microbiota and the brain in PD subjects, by delineating the multiple mechanisms involved inneuroinflammation and oxidative stress. We conclude that the neurodetrimental effects of western diet (WD) and the neuroprotective effects of Mediterranean diets should be further exploredin humans through clinical trials. Key Scientific Concepts of Review: Alterations in the gut microbiome and associated metabolites may contribute to pathogenesis in PD. In some studies, probiotics have been shown to exert anti-oxidative effects in PD via improved mitochondrial dynamics and homeostasis, thus reducing PD-related consequences. However, there is a significant unmet need for randomized clinical trials to investigate the effectiveness of microbial products, probiotic-based supplementation, and dietary intervention in reversing gut microbial dysbiosis in PD.",Journal of advanced research,2023,Safa Salim; Fatima Ahmad; Ayesha Banu; Farhan Mohammad
36284437,Gut bacterial profiles in Parkinson's disease: A systematic review.,"Recent advances have highlighted the relationships between gut dysbiosis and Parkinson's disease (PD). Microbiota transplantation from PD patients to mice can induce increased alpha-synuclein-mediated motor deficits. Human studies have identified differences in the gut microbiota of PD patients compared to healthy controls. We undertook a systematic review to evaluate the available evidence for the involvement of gut bacteria in the etiology of PD.The PubMed databank, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure databank, and Wanfang Data were searched from inception until June 2021 to identify human case-control studies that investigated relationships between PD and microbiota quantified from feces. We evaluated the resulting studies focusing on bacterial taxa that were different between PD patients and healthy controls.Twenty-six studies were found in which 53 microbial families and 98 genera exhibited differences between patients with PD and healthy controls. The genera identified by more than two studies as increased in PD were Bifidobacterium, Alistipes, Christensenella, Enterococcus, Oscillospira, Bilophila, Desulfovibrio, Escherichia/Shigella, and Akkermansia, while Prevotella, Blautia, Faecalibacterium, Fusicatenibacter, and Haemophilus had three or more reports of being lower in PD patients. More than one report demonstrated that Bacteroides, Odoribacter, Parabacteroides, Butyricicoccus, Butyrivibrio, Clostridium, Coprococcus, Lachnospira, Lactobacillus, Megasphaera, Phascolarctobacterium, Roseburia, Ruminococcus, Streptococcus, and Klebsiella were altered in both directions.Our review shows that the involvement of the gut microbiome in the etiology of PD may involve alterations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producing bacteria and an increase in putative gut pathobionts. SCFAs-producing bacteria may vary above or below an ""optimal range,"" causing imbalances. Considering that Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Akkermansia are beneficial for human health, increased Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus in the PD gut microbiome may be associated with PD medications, especially COMT inhibitors, while a high level of Akkermansia may be associated with aging.",CNS neuroscience & therapeutics,2023,Zhe Li; Hongfeng Liang; Yingyu Hu; Lin Lu; Chunye Zheng; Yuzhen Fan; Bin Wu; Tao Zou; Xiaodong Luo; Xinchun Zhang; Yan Zeng; Ziyan Liu; Zhicheng Zhou; Zhenyu Yue; Yi Ren; Zhuo Li; Qiaozhen Su; Pingyi Xu
36278360,Exploring the Connection Between the Gut Microbiome and Parkinson's Disease Symptom Progression and Pathology: Implications for Supplementary Treatment Options.,"The contribution of the microbiota to induce gastrointestinal inflammation is hypothesized to be a key component of alpha-synuclein (aSyn) aggregation within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract in the pathological progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). The function of the GI tract is governed by a system of neurons that form part of the enteric nervous system (ENS). The ENS hosts Â 100-500 million nerve cells within two thin layers lining the GI tract. The gut-brain axis (GBA) is the major communication pathway between the ENS and the central nervous system. It has become increasingly clear that the microbiota in the gut are key regulators of GBA function and help to maintain homeostasis in the immune and endocrine systems. The GBA may act as a possible etiological launching pad for the pathogenesis of age-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as PD, because of an imbalance in the gut microbiota. PD is a multi-faceted illness with multiple biological, immunological, and environmental factors contributing to its pathological progression. Interestingly, individuals with PD have an altered gut microbiota compared to healthy individuals. However, there is a lack of literature describing the relationship between microbiota composition in the gut and symptom progression in PD patients. This review article examines how the pathology and symptomology of PD may originate from dysregulated signaling in the ENS. We then discuss by targeting the imbalance within the gut microbiota such as prebiotics and probiotics, some of the prodromal symptoms might be alleviated, possibly curtailing the pathological spread of aSyn and ensuing debilitating motor symptoms.",Journal of Parkinson's disease,2022,Dennis G Chan; Katelyn Ventura; Ally Villeneuve; Paul Du Bois; Matthew R Holahan

The beneficial effects of DR are being increasingly acknowledged in aging and in a series of age-related neurodegenerative disorders, for example, Parkinson's disease (PD). To date, the pathogenesis of PD remains elusive and there is no cure for it in spite of intensive research over decades. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the efficacy of DR on PD, focusing on the underlying mechanisms involving general metabolism, neuroendocrinolgy, neuroinflammation, gut microbiome, and so on.

36216843,Fecal microbiome alterations in treatment-naive de novo Parkinson's disease.,"Gut microbiota alterations in Parkinson's disease (PD) have been found in several studies and are suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis of PD. However, previous results could not be adequately adjusted for a potential confounding effect of PD medication and disease duration, as almost all PD participants were already using dopaminergic medication and were included several years after diagnosis. Here, the gut microbiome composition of treatment-naive de novo PD subjects was assessed compared to healthy controls (HC) in two large independent case-control cohorts (nâ=â136 and 56 PD, nâ=â85 and 87 HC), using 16S-sequencing of fecal samples. Relevant variables such as technical batches, diet and constipation were assessed for their potential effects. Overall gut microbiome composition differed between PD and HC in both cohorts, suggesting gut microbiome alterations are already present in de novo PD subjects at the time of diagnosis, without the possible confounding effect of dopaminergic medication. Although no differentially abundant taxon could be replicated in both cohorts, multiple short chain fatty acids (SCFA) producing taxa were decreased in PD in both cohorts. In particular, several taxa belonging to the family Lachnospiraceae were decreased in abundance. Fewer taxonomic differences were found compared to previous studies, indicating smaller effect sizes in de novo PD.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2022,Jeffrey M Boertien; Kirsi MurtomÃ¤ki; Pedro A B Pereira; Sygrid van der Zee; Tuomas H Mertsalmi; Reeta Levo; Tanja Nojonen; Elina MÃ¤kinen; Elina Jaakkola; Pia Laine; Lars Paulin; Eero Pekkonen; Valtteri Kaasinen; Petri Auvinen; Filip Scheperjans; Teus van Laar; 
36072564,Age-dependent effects of gut microbiota metabolites on brain resident macrophages.,"In recent years, development of age-related diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, as well as other brain disorders, including anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia have been shown to be associated with changes in the gut microbiome. Several factors can induce an alteration in the bacterial composition of the host's gastrointestinal tract. Besides dietary changes and frequent use of antibiotics, the microbiome is also profoundly affected by aging. Levels of microbiota-derived metabolites are elevated in older individuals with age-associated diseases and cognitive defects compared to younger, healthy age groups. The identified metabolites with higher concentration in aged hosts, which include choline and trimethylamine, are known risk factors for age-related diseases. While the underlying mechanisms and pathways remain elusive for the most part, it has been shown, that these metabolites are able to trigger the innate immunity in the central nervous system by influencing development and activation status of brain-resident macrophages. The macrophages residing in the brain comprise parenchymal microglia and non-parenchymal macrophages located in the perivascular spaces, meninges, and the choroid plexus. In this review, we highlight the impact of age on the composition of the microbiome and microbiota-derived metabolites and their influence on age-associated diseases caused by dysfunctional brain-resident macrophages.",Frontiers in cellular neuroscience,2022,Dilara Hasavci; Thomas Blank
36009361,Pain and Opioid-Induced Gut Microbial Dysbiosis.,"Opioid-induced dysbiosis (OID) is a specific condition describing the consequences of opioid use on the bacterial composition of the gut. Opioids have been shown to affect the epithelial barrier in the gut and modulate inflammatory pathways, possibly mediating opioid tolerance or opioid-induced hyperalgesia; in combination, these allow the invasion and proliferation of non-native bacterial colonies. There is also evidence that the gut-brain axis is linked to the emotional and cognitive aspects of the brain with intestinal function, which can be a factor that affects mental health. For example, <i>Mycobacterium</i>, <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Clostridium difficile</i> are linked to Irritable Bowel Disease; <i>Lactobacillaceae</i> and <i>Enterococcacae</i> have associations with Parkinson's disease, and <i>Alistipes</i> has increased prevalence in depression. However, changes to the gut microbiome can be therapeutically influenced with treatments such as faecal microbiota transplantation, targeted antibiotic therapy and probiotics. There is also evidence of emerging therapies to combat OID. This review has collated evidence that shows that there are correlations between OID and depression, Parkinson's Disease, infection, and more. Specifically, in pain management, targeting OID deserves specific investigations.",Biomedicines,2022,Karen R Thomas; Jacob Watt; Chuen Mong J Wu; Adejoke Akinrinoye; Sairah Amjad; Lucy Colvin; Rachel Cowe; Sylvia H Duncan; Wendy R Russell; Patrice Forget
35994167,Parkinson's Disease: A Multisystem Disorder.,"The way sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD) is perceived has undergone drastic changes in recent decades. For a long time, PD was considered a brain disease characterized by motor disturbances; however, the identification of several risk factors and the hypothesis that PD has a gastrointestinal onset have shed additional light. Today, after recognition of prodromal non-motor symptoms and the pathological processes driving their evolution, there is a greater understanding of the involvement of other organ systems. For this reason, PD is increasingly seen as a multiorgan and multisystemic pathology that arises from the interaction of susceptible genetic factors with a challenging environment during aging-related decline.",Neuroscience bulletin,2023,Helena Nunes Costa; Ana Raquel Esteves; Nuno Empadinhas; Sandra Morais Cardoso
35965349,Systematic profiling of the chicken gut microbiome reveals dietary supplementation with antibiotics alters expression of multiple microbial pathways with minimal impact on community structure.,"The emergence of antimicrobial resistance is a major threat to global health and has placed pressure on the livestock industry to eliminate the use of antibiotic growth promotants (AGPs) as feed additives. To mitigate their removal, efficacious alternatives are required. AGPs are thought to operate through modulating the gut microbiome to limit opportunities for colonization by pathogens, increase nutrient utilization, and reduce inflammation. However, little is known concerning the underlying mechanisms. Previous studies investigating the effects of AGPs on the poultry gut microbiome have largely focused on 16S rDNA surveys based on a single gastrointestinal (GI) site, diet, and/or timepoint, resulting in an inconsistent view of their impact on community composition.In this study, we perform a systematic investigation of both the composition and function of the chicken gut microbiome, in response to AGPs. Birds were raised under two different diets and AGP treatments, and 16S rDNA surveys applied to six GI sites sampled at three key timepoints of the poultry life cycle. Functional investigations were performed through metatranscriptomics analyses and metabolomics.Our study reveals a more nuanced view of the impact of AGPs, dependent on age of bird, diet, and intestinal site sampled. Although AGPs have a limited impact on taxonomic abundances, they do appear to redefine influential taxa that may promote the exclusion of other taxa. Microbiome expression profiles further reveal a complex landscape in both the expression and taxonomic representation of multiple pathways including cell wall biogenesis, antimicrobial resistance, and several involved in energy, amino acid, and nucleotide metabolism. Many AGP-induced changes in metabolic enzyme expression likely serve to redirect metabolic flux with the potential to regulate bacterial growth or produce metabolites that impact the host.As alternative feed additives are developed to mimic the action of AGPs, our study highlights the need to ensure such alternatives result in functional changes that are consistent with site-, age-, and diet-associated taxa. The genes and pathways identified in this study are therefore expected to drive future studies, applying tools such as community-based metabolic modeling, focusing on the mechanistic impact of different dietary regimes on the microbiome. Consequently, the data generated in this study will be crucial for the development of next-generation feed additives targeting gut health and poultry production.

35914559,Oral ingestion of the environmental toxicant trichloroethylene in rats induces alterations in the gut microbiome: Relevance to idiopathic Parkinson's disease.,"Microbial alterations within the gut microbiome appear to be a common feature of individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD), providing further evidence for the role of the gut-brain axis in PD development. As a major site of contact with the environment, questions have emerged surrounding the cause and effect of alterations to the gut microbiome by environmental contaminants associated with PD risk, such as pesticides, metals, and organic solvents. Recent data from our lab shows that ingestion of the industrial byproduct and environmental pollutant trichloroethylene (TCE) induces key Parkinsonian pathology within aged rats, including the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, Î±-synuclein accumulation, neuroinflammation, and endolysosomal deficits. As TCE is the most common organic contaminant within drinking water, we postulated that ingestion of TCE associated with PD-related neurodegeneration may alter the gut microbiome to a similar extent as observed in persons with PD. To assess this, we collected fecal samples from adult rats treated with 200Â mg/kg TCE over 6Â weeks via oral gavage - the dose that produced nigrostriatal neurodegeneration - and analyzed the gut microbiome via whole genome shotgun sequencing. Our results showed changes in gut microorganisms reflective of the microbial signatures observed in individuals with idiopathic PD, such as decreased abundance of short-chain fatty acid producing Blautia and elevated lactic-acid producing Bifidobacteria, as well as genera who contain species previously reported as opportunistic pathogens such as Clostridium. From these experimental data, we postulate that TCE exposure within contaminated drinking water could induce alterations of the gut microbiome that contributes to chronic disease risk, including idiopathic PD.",Toxicology and applied pharmacology,2022,Neda M Ilieva; Zachary D Wallen; Briana R De Miranda
35855338,Effects of Ketogenic Diet on Neuroinflammation in Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"The ketogenic diet (KD) is a low-carbohydrate, high-fat and adequate-protein diet. As a diet mimicking fasting, it triggers the production of ketone bodies (KBs) and brings the body into a state of ketosis. Recent and accumulating studies on humans and animal models have shown that KD is beneficial to neurodegenerative diseases through modulating central and peripheral metabolism, mitochondrial function, inflammation, oxidative stress, autophagy, and the gut microbiome. Complicated interplay of metabolism, gut microbiome, and other mechanisms can regulate neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases by activating multiple molecular and cellular pathways. In this review, we detail the physiological basis of the KD, its functions in regulating neuroinflammation, and its protective role in normal brain aging and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington's disease (HD). We aimed to elucidate the underlying neuroinflammatory mechanisms of KD therapies in neurodegenerative diseases and provide novel insights into their application for neurodegenerative disease prevention and treatment.",Aging and disease,2022,Ziying Jiang; Xi Yin; Miao Wang; Tong Chen; Yuanyuan Wang; Zhongbao Gao; Zhenfu Wang
35798742,Oral and gut dysbiosis leads to functional alterations in Parkinson's disease.,"Although several studies have identified a distinct gut microbial composition in Parkinson's disease (PD), few studies have investigated the oral microbiome or functional alteration of the microbiome in PD. We aimed to investigate the connection between the oral and gut microbiome and the functional changes in the PD-specific gut microbiome using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. The taxonomic composition of the oral and gut microbiome was significantly different between PD patients and healthy controls (Pâ=â0.003 and 0.001, respectively). Oral Lactobacillus was more abundant in PD patients and was associated with opportunistic pathogens in the gut (FDR-adjusted Pâ<â0.038). Functional analysis revealed that microbial gene markers for glutamate and arginine biosynthesis were downregulated, while antimicrobial resistance gene markers were upregulated in PD patients than healthy controls (all Pâ<â0.001). We identified a connection between the oral and gut microbiota in PD, which might lead to functional alteration of the microbiome in PD.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2022,Sungyang Jo; Woorim Kang; Yun Su Hwang; Seung Hyun Lee; Kye Won Park; Mi Sun Kim; Hyunna Lee; Hyung Jeong Yoon; Yoo Kyoung Park; Mauricio Chalita; Je Hee Lee; Hojun Sung; Jae-Yun Lee; Jin-Woo Bae; Sun Ju Chung
35786740,Gut instincts in neuroimmunity from the eighteenth to twenty-first centuries.,"In the past two decades, work on the microbiota-gut-brain axis has led to a renewed appreciation for the interconnectedness between body systems in both clinical and scientific circles. In the USA alone, millions of adults are burdened with non-communicable chronic diseases whose putative etiologies were previously thought to be restricted to either the gut or brain, such as inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, and autism spectrum disorder. However, the recent explosion of research into the impacts of the gut microbiome on diverse aspects of human health has revealed the potentially critical importance of reciprocal interactions between the gut microbiota, the immune system, and the brain in diverse diseases and disorders. In this review, we revisit the history of gut-brain interactions in science and medicine, which dates back to at least the eighteenth century, and outline how concepts in this field have shifted and evolved across eras. Next, we highlight the modern resurgence of gut-brain axis research, focusing on neuro-immune-microbiota interactions and recent progress towards a mechanistic understanding of the diverse impacts of the microbiome on human health. Finally, we offer a forward-looking perspective on the future of microbiota-gut-brain research, which may eventually reveal new paths towards the treatment of diverse diseases influenced by the complex connections between the microbiota and the brain.",Seminars in immunopathology,2022,Mytien Nguyen; Noah W Palm
35743072,PARK7/DJ-1 as a Therapeutic Target in Gut-Brain Axis Diseases.,"It is increasingly known that Parkinson's (PD) and Alzheimer's (AD) diseases occur more frequently in patients with inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases including inflammatory bowel (IBD) or celiac disease, indicating a pathological link between them. Although epidemiological observations suggest the existence of the gut-brain axis (GBA) involving systemic inflammatory and neural pathways, little is known about the exact molecular mechanisms. Parkinson's disease 7 (PARK7/DJ-1) is a multifunctional protein whose protective role has been widely demonstrated in neurodegenerative diseases, including PD, AD, or ischemic stroke. Recent studies also revealed the importance of PARK7/DJ-1 in the maintenance of the gut microbiome and also in the regulation of intestinal inflammation. All these findings suggest that PARK7/DJ-1 may be a link and also a potential therapeutic target in gut and brain diseases. In this review, therefore, we discuss our current knowledge about PARK7/DJ-1 in the context of GBA diseases.",International journal of molecular sciences,2022,Domonkos Pap; Apor Veres-SzÃ©kely; BeÃ¡ta Szebeni; ÃdÃ¡m Vannay
35723531,Bacterial Butyrate in Parkinson's Disease Is Linked to Epigenetic Changes and Depressive Symptoms.,"The gut microbiome and its metabolites can impact brain health and are altered in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. It has been recently demonstrated that PD patients have reduced fecal levels of the potent epigenetic modulator butyrate and its bacterial producers.Here, we investigate whether the changes in the gut microbiome and associated metabolites are related to PD symptoms and epigenetic markers in leucocytes and neurons.Stool, whole blood samples, and clinical data were collected from 55 PD patients and 55 controls. We performed DNA methylation analysis on whole blood samples and analyzed the results in relation to fecal short-chain fatty acid concentrations and microbiota composition. In another cohort, prefrontal cortex neurons were isolated from control and PD brains. We identified genome-wide DNA methylation by targeted bisulfite sequencing.We show that lower fecal butyrate and reduced counts of genera Roseburia, Romboutsia, and Prevotella are related to depressive symptoms in PD patients. Genes containing butyrate-associated methylation sites include PD risk genes and significantly overlap with sites epigenetically altered in PD blood leucocytes, predominantly neutrophils, and in brain neurons, relative to controls. Moreover, butyrate-associated methylated-DNA regions in PD overlap with those altered in gastrointestinal (GI), autoimmune, and psychiatric diseases.Decreased levels of bacterially produced butyrate are related to epigenetic changes in leucocytes and neurons from PD patients and to the severity of their depressive symptoms. PD shares common butyrate-dependent epigenetic changes with certain GI and psychiatric disorders, which could be relevant for their epidemiological relation. Â© 2022 The Authors.

35722294,"Integrated Microbiome and Host Transcriptome Profiles Link Parkinson's Disease to <i>Blautia</i> Genus: Evidence From Feces, Blood, and Brain.","A link between the gut microbiome and Parkinson's disease (PD) has been intensively studied, and more than 100 differential genera were identified across the studies. However, the predominant genera contributing to PD remain poorly understood. Inspired by recent advances showing microbiota distribution in the blood and brain, we, here, comprehensively investigated currently available fecal microbiome data (1,914 samples) to identify significantly altered genera, which were further validated by comparison to the results from microbiome analysis of blood (85 samples) and brain (268 samples). Our data showed that the composition of fecal microbiota was different from that of blood and brain. We found that <i>Blautia</i> was the unique genus consistently depleted across feces, blood, and brain samples of PD patients (<i>P</i> < 0.05), despite using rigorous criteria to remove contaminants. Moreover, enrichment analyses revealed that host genes correlated with <i>Blautia</i> genus abundance were mainly involved in mitochondrial function and energy metabolism, and mapped to neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) and metabolic diseases. A random forest classifier constructed with fecal microbiota data demonstrated that <i>Blautia</i> genus was an important feature contributing to discriminating PD patients from controls [receiver operating characteristic (ROC)-area under curve (AUC) = 0.704, precision-recall curve (PRC)-AUC = 0.787]. Through the integration of microbiome and transcriptome, our study depicted microbial profiles in the feces, blood, and brain of PD patients, and identified <i>Blautia</i> genus as a potential genus linked to PD. Further studies are greatly encouraged to determine the role of <i>Blautia</i> genus in the pathogenesis of PD.",Frontiers in microbiology,2022,Xingzhi Guo; Peng Tang; Chen Hou; Li Chong; Xin Zhang; Peng Liu; Li Chen; Yue Liu; Lina Zhang; Rui Li
35708472,Neuroinflammation: A Distal Consequence of Periodontitis.,"Periodontitis, a chronic, inflammatory disease, induces systemic inflammation and contributes to the development of neurodegenerative diseases. The precise etiology of the most common neurodegenerative disorders, such as sporadic Alzheimer's, Parkinson's diseases and multiple sclerosis (AD, PD, and MS, respectively), remains to be revealed. Chronic neuroinflammation is a well-recognized component of these disorders, and evidence suggests that systemic inflammation is a possible stimulus for neuroinflammation development. Systemic inflammation can lead to deleterious consequences on the brain if the inflammation is sufficiently severe or if the brain shows vulnerabilities due to genetic predisposition, aging, or neurodegenerative diseases. It has been proposed that periodontal disease can initiate or contribute to the AD pathogenesis through multiple pathways, including key periodontal pathogens. Dysbiotic oral bacteria can release bacterial products into the bloodstream and eventually cross the brain-blood barrier; these bacteria can also cause alterations to gut microbiota that enhance inflammation and potentially affect brain function via the gut-brain axis. The trigeminal nerve has been suggested as another route for connecting oral bacterial products to the brain. PD and MS are often preceded by gastrointestinal symptoms or aberrant gut microbiome composition, and alterations in the enteric nervous system accompany the disease. Clinical evidence has suggested that patients with periodontitis are at a higher risk of developing PD and MS. This nexus among the brain, periodontal disease, and systemic inflammation heralds new ways in which microglial cells, the main innate immune cells, and astrocytes, the crucial regulators of innate and adaptive immune responses in the brain, contribute to brain pathology. Currently, the lack of understanding of the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration is hindering treatment development. However, we may prevent this pathogenesis by tackling one of its possible contributors (periodontitis) for systemic inflammation through simple preventive oral hygiene measures.",Journal of dental research,2022,X Li; M Kiprowska; T Kansara; P Kansara; P Li
35674870,Neurodegeneration and Neuroinflammation in Parkinson's Disease: a Self-Sustained Loop.,"Neuroinflammation plays a significant role in Parkinson's disease (PD) etiology along with mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired proteostasis. In this context, mechanisms related to immune response can act as modifiers at different steps of the neurodegenerative process and justify the growing interest in anti-inflammatory agents as potential disease-modifying treatments in PD. The discovery of inherited gene mutations in PD has allowed researchers to develop cellular and animal models to study the mechanisms of the underlying biology, but the original cause of neuroinflammation in PD is still debated to date.Cell autonomous alterations in neuronal cells, including mitochondrial damage and protein aggregation, could play a role, but recent findings also highlighted the importance of intercellular communication at both local and systemic level. This has given rise to debate about the role of non-neuronal cells in PD and reignited intense research into the gut-brain axis and other non-neuronal interactions in the development of the disease. Whatever the original trigger of neuroinflammation in PD, what appears quite clear is that the aberrant activation of glial cells and other components of the immune system creates a vicious circle in which neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation nourish each other. In this review, we will provide an up-to-date summary of the main cellular alterations underlying neuroinflammation in PD, including those induced by environmental factors (e.g. the gut microbiome) and those related to the genetic background of affected patients. Starting from the lesson provided by familial forms of PD, we will discuss pathophysiological mechanisms linked to inflammation that could also play a role in idiopathic forms. Finally, we will comment on the potential clinical translatability of immunobiomarkers identified in PD patient cohorts and provide an update on current therapeutic strategies aimed at overcoming or preventing inflammation in PD.",Current neurology and neuroscience reports,2022,G Arena; K Sharma; G Agyeah; R KrÃ¼ger; A GrÃ¼newald; J C Fitzgerald
35656540,The Gut Microbiome in Parkinson's Disease: A Longitudinal Study of the Impacts on Disease Progression and the Use of Device-Assisted Therapies.,"Altered gut microbiome (GM) composition has been established in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, few studies have longitudinally investigated the GM in PD, or the impact of device-assisted therapies.To investigate the temporal stability of GM profiles from PD patients on standard therapies and those initiating device-assisted therapies (DAT) and define multivariate models of disease and progression.We evaluated validated clinical questionnaires and stool samples from 74 PD patients and 74 household controls (HCs) at 0, 6, and 12 months. Faster or slower disease progression was defined from levodopa equivalence dose and motor severity measures. 19 PD patients initiating Deep Brain Stimulation or Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel were separately evaluated at 0, 6, and 12 months post-therapy initiation.Persistent underrepresentation of short-chain fatty-acid-producing bacteria, <i>Butyricicoccus, Fusicatenibacter, Lachnospiraceae ND3007 group</i>, and <i>Erysipelotrichaceae UCG-003</i>, were apparent in PD patients relative to controls. A sustained effect of DAT initiation on GM associations with PD was not observed. PD progression analysis indicated that the genus <i>Barnesiella</i> was underrepresented in faster progressing PD patients at <i>t</i> = 0 and <i>t</i> = 12 months. Two-stage predictive modeling, integrating microbiota abundances and nutritional profiles, improved predictive capacity (change in Area Under the Curve from 0.58 to 0.64) when assessed at Amplicon Sequence Variant taxonomic resolution.We present longitudinal GM studies in PD patients, showing persistently altered GM profiles suggestive of a reduced butyrogenic production potential. DATs exerted variable GM influences across the short and longer-term. We found that specific GM profiles combined with dietary factors improved prediction of disease progression in PD patients.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2022,Michal Lubomski; Xiangnan Xu; Andrew J Holmes; Samuel Muller; Jean Y H Yang; Ryan L Davis; Carolyn M Sue
35654142,Mechanistic insights into accelerated Î±-synuclein aggregation mediated by human microbiome-associated functional amyloids.,"The gut microbiome has been shown to have key implications in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). The Escherichia coli functional amyloid CsgA is known to accelerate Î±-synuclein aggregation inÂ vitro and induce PD symptoms in mice. However, the mechanism governing CsgA-mediated acceleration of Î±-synuclein aggregation is unclear. Here, we show that CsgA can form stable homodimeric species that correlate with faster Î±-synuclein amyloid aggregation. Furthermore, we identify and characterize new CsgA homologs encoded by bacteria present in the human microbiome. These CsgA homologs display diverse aggregation kinetics, and they differ in their ability to modulate Î±-synuclein aggregation. Remarkably, we demonstrate that slowing down CsgA aggregation leads to an increased acceleration of Î±-synuclein aggregation, suggesting that the intrinsic amyloidogenicity of gut bacterial CsgA homologs affects their ability to accelerate Î±-synuclein aggregation. Finally, we identify a complex between CsgA and Î±-synuclein that functions as a platform to accelerate Î±-synuclein aggregation. Taken together, our work reveals complex interplay between bacterial amyloids and Î±-synuclein that better informs our understanding of PD causation.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2022,Sujeet S Bhoite; Yilin Han; Brandon T Ruotolo; Matthew R Chapman
35645785,Nutritional Intake and Gut Microbiome Composition Predict Parkinson's Disease.,"Models to predict Parkinson's disease (PD) incorporating alterations of gut microbiome (GM) composition have been reported with varying success.To assess the utility of GM compositional changes combined with macronutrient intake to develop a predictive model of PD.We performed a cross-sectional analysis of the GM and nutritional intake in 103 PD patients and 81 household controls (HCs). GM composition was determined by 16S amplicon sequencing of the V3-V4 region of bacterial ribosomal DNA isolated from stool. To determine multivariate disease-discriminant associations, we developed two models using Random Forest and support-vector machine (SVM) methodologies.Using updated taxonomic reference, we identified significant compositional differences in the GM profiles of PD patients in association with a variety of clinical PD characteristics. Six genera were overrepresented and eight underrepresented in PD patients relative to HCs, with the largest difference being overrepresentation of <i>Lactobacillaceae</i> at family taxonomic level. Correlation analyses highlighted multiple associations between clinical characteristics and select taxa, whilst constipation severity, physical activity and pharmacological therapies associated with changes in beta diversity. The random forest model of PD, incorporating taxonomic data at the genus level and carbohydrate contribution to total energy demonstrated the best predictive capacity [Area under the ROC Curve (AUC) of 0.74].The notable differences in GM diversity and composition when combined with clinical measures and nutritional data enabled the development of a predictive model to identify PD. These findings support the combination of GM and nutritional data as a potentially useful biomarker of PD to improve diagnosis and guide clinical management.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2022,Michal Lubomski; Xiangnan Xu; Andrew J Holmes; Samuel Muller; Jean Y H Yang; Ryan L Davis; Carolyn M Sue
35610236,Probiotics synergized with conventional regimen in managing Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is mainly managed by pharmacological therapy (e.g., Benserazide and dopamine agonists). However, prolonged use of these drugs would gradually diminish their dopaminergic effect. Gut dysbiosis was observed in some patients with PD, suggesting close association between the gut microbiome and PD. Probiotics modulate the host's gut microbiota beneficially. A 3-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted to investigate the beneficial effect of probiotic co-administration in patients with PD. Eighty-two PD patients were recruited and randomly divided into probiotic [nâ=â48; Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Probio-M8 (Probio-M8), Benserazide, dopamine agonists] and placebo (nâ=â34; placebo, Benserazide, dopamine agonists) groups. Finally, 45 and 29 patients from Probio-M8 and placebo groups provided complete fecal and serum samples for further omics analysis, respectively. The results showed that Probio-M8 co-administration conferred added benefits by improving sleep quality, alleviating anxiety, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Metagenomic analysis showed that, after the intervention, there were significantly more species-level genome bins (SGBs) of Bifidobacterium animalis, Ruminococcaceae, and Lachnospira, while less Lactobacillus fermentum and Klebsiella oxytoca in Probio-M8 group (Pâ<â0.05). Interestingly, Lactobacillus fermentum correlated positively with the scores of UPDRS-III, HAMA, HAMD-17, and negatively with MMSE. Klebsiella oxytoca correlated negatively with feces hardness. Moreover, co-administering Probio-M8 increased SGBs involved in tryptophan degradation, gamma-aminobutyric acid, short-chain fatty acids, and secondary bile acid biosynthesis, as well as serum acetic acid and dopamine levels (Pâ<â0.05). Taken together, Probio-M8 synergized with the conventional regimen and strengthened the clinical efficacy in managing PD, accompanied by modifications of the host's gut microbiome, gut microbial metabolic potential, and serum metabolites.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2022,Hairong Sun; Feiyan Zhao; Yuanyuan Liu; Teng Ma; Hao Jin; Keyu Quan; Bing Leng; Junwu Zhao; Xiaoling Yuan; Zhenguang Li; Fang Li; Lai-Yu Kwok; Shukun Zhang; Zhihong Sun; Jinbiao Zhang; Heping Zhang
35583791,Exploring the multifactorial aspects of Gut Microbiome in Parkinson's Disease.,"Advanced research in health science has broadened our view in approaching and understanding the pathophysiology of diseases and has also revolutionised diagnosis and treatment. Ever since the establishment of Braak's hypothesis in the propagation of alpha-synuclein from the distant olfactory and enteric nervous system towards the brain in Parkinson's Disease (PD), studies have explored and revealed the involvement of altered gut microbiota in PD. This review recapitulates the gut microbiome associated with PD severity, duration, motor and non-motor symptoms, and antiparkinsonian treatment from recent literature. Gut microbial signatures in PD are potential predictors of the disease and are speculated to be used in early diagnosis and treatment. In brief, the review also emphasises on implications of the prebiotic, probiotic, faecal microbiota transplantation, and dietary interventions as alternative treatments in modulating the disease symptoms in PD.",Folia microbiologica,2022,Sujith Pavan; Arvind N Prabhu; Sankar Prasad Gorthi; Bhabatosh Das; Ankur Mutreja; Vignesh Shetty; Thandavarayan Ramamurthy; Mamatha Ballal
35571084,Using <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> to Model Therapeutic Interventions of Neurodegenerative Diseases Targeting Microbe-Host Interactions.,"Emerging evidence from both clinical studies and animal models indicates the importance of the interaction between the gut microbiome and the brain in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). Although how microbes modulate neurodegeneration is still mostly unclear, recent studies have started to probe into the mechanisms for the communication between microbes and hosts in NDs. In this review, we highlight the advantages of using <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> (C. elegans) to disentangle the microbe-host interaction that regulates neurodegeneration. We summarize the microbial pro- and anti-neurodegenerative factors identified using the <i>C. elegans</i> ND models and the effects of many are confirmed in mouse models. Specifically, we focused on the role of bacterial amyloid proteins, such as curli, in promoting proteotoxicity and neurodegeneration by cross-seeding the aggregation of endogenous ND-related proteins, such as Î±-synuclein. Targeting bacterial amyloid production may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy for treating NDs, and several compounds, such as epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), were shown to suppress neurodegeneration at least partly by inhibiting curli production. Because bacterial amyloid fibrils contribute to biofilm formation, inhibition of amyloid production often leads to the disruption of biofilms. Interestingly, from a list of 59 compounds that showed neuroprotective effects in <i>C. elegans</i> and mouse ND models, we found that about half of them are known to inhibit bacterial growth or biofilm formation, suggesting a strong correlation between the neuroprotective and antibiofilm activities. Whether these potential therapeutics indeed protect neurons from proteotoxicity by inhibiting the cross-seeding between bacterial and human amyloid proteins awaits further investigations. Finally, we propose to screen the long list of antibiofilm agents, both FDA-approved drugs and novel compounds, for their neuroprotective effects and develop new pharmaceuticals that target the gut microbiome for the treatment of NDs. To this end, the <i>C. elegans</i> ND models can serve as a platform for fast, high-throughput, and low-cost drug screens that target the microbe-host interaction in NDs.",Frontiers in pharmacology,2022,Chenyin Wang; Chaogu Zheng
35565918,The Therapeutic Role of Ketogenic Diet in Neurological Disorders.,"The ketogenic diet (KD) is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate and adequate-protein diet that has gained popularity in recent years in the context of neurological diseases (NDs). The complexity of the pathogenesis of these diseases means that effective forms of treatment are still lacking. Conventional therapy is often associated with increasing tolerance and/or drug resistance. Consequently, more effective therapeutic strategies are being sought to increase the effectiveness of available forms of therapy and improve the quality of life of patients. For the moment, it seems that KD can provide therapeutic benefits in patients with neurological problems by effectively controlling the balance between pro- and antioxidant processes and pro-excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, and modulating inflammation or changing the composition of the gut microbiome. In this review we evaluated the potential therapeutic efficacy of KD in epilepsy, depression, migraine, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. In our opinion, KD should be considered as an adjuvant therapeutic option for some neurological diseases.",Nutrients,2022,Diana Pietrzak; Kamila Kasperek; PaweÅ RÄkawek; Iwona PiÄtkowska-Chmiel
35513230,Evidence for immune system alterations in peripheral biological fluids in Parkinson's disease.,"Immune-related alterations in Parkinson's disease (PD) can be monitored by assessing peripheral biological fluids that show that specific inflammatory pathways contribute to a chronic pro-inflammatory status. This pro-inflammatory activity is hypothesized to be already present in the prodromal stages of PD. These pathways maintain and reinforce chronic neurodegeneration by stimulating cell activation and proliferation what triggers the pro-inflammatory status as well. The gut microbiome possibly contributes to inflammatory pathways and shows specific differences in fecal samples from PD compared to healthy controls. In PD, Bacteroides abundance correlates with inflammatory markers in blood and motor impairment. Increased pro-inflammatory and decreased anti-inflammatory bacterial colonization can lead to changes in the metabolic pathways of amino acids, inducing increased membrane permeability, described as a leaky gut, enabling advanced contact between immune cells and gut microbiome and potentially a spreading of neuroinflammation through the body via the blood. Increased cytokine blood levels in PD are correlated with disease severity, motor symptoms, and clinical phenotypes. Î±-synuclein is a central player in PD-associated inflammation, inducing specific T-cell activity and triggering microglial activation in the central nervous system (CNS). Misfolded Î±-synuclein propagation possibly results in the spreading of aggregated Î±-synuclein from neuron to neuron leading to a sustained neuroinflammation. This is supported by age-dependent defects of protein uptake in microglia and monocytes, so-called ""inflammaging"", including Î±-synuclein oligomers, as the key pathological protein in PD. Genetic risk markers and inherited forms of PD are also associated with inflammation, which is highly relevant for potential therapeutical targets. The documented associations of inflammatory markers and clinical phenotypes indicate a pro-inflammatory concept of specific PD pathophysiology here. An in-depth understanding of inflammatory mechanisms in PD from bottom (gut) to top (CNS) and vice versa is needed to design novel immunomodulatory approaches to delay or even stop PD. Future studies focusing on structured protocols in large patient cohorts with appropriate control groups and comparative analysis among studies will aid the discovery of novel candidate biomarkers.",Neurobiology of disease,2022,Michael Bartl; Mary Xylaki; Mathias BÃ¤hr; Sandrina Weber; Claudia Trenkwalder; Brit Mollenhauer
35477134,Effects of therapeutic levels of dietary antibiotics on the cecal microbiome composition of broiler chickens.,"Dietary antibiotics, including antibiotic growth promoters (AGPs), have been commonly used to improve health and growth of poultry. The present study investigated the effects of therapeutic doses of dietary antibiotics, including bacitracin methylene disalicylate (BMD), penicillin G potassium (PP) and an ionophore (salinomycin, SA), on the cecal microbiome of chickens. BMD and SA treatments were given as dietary supplements from d 1 to 35 of age. The SAPP (salinomycin+ penicillin G potassium) group was given SA as a dietary supplement from d 1 to 35 of age and PP was added to drinking water from d 19 to 24 of age to simulate common practices for control of necrotic enteritis in broilers. The cecal contents were collected from all treatment groups on d 10, 24, and 35 of age and DNA was extracted for metagenomic analysis of the cecal microbiome. The results revealed that dietary or water supplementation of therapeutic levels of antibiotics and ionophores to chickens significantly altered the cecal microbial homeostasis during different stages of the chicken life. The alpha diversity analysis showed that BMD, SA, and SAPP treatments decreased diversity and evenness of the cecal microbiome of treated chickens on d 10 of age. Species richness was also reduced on d 35 following treatment with BMD. Beta diversity analyses revealed that SAPP and BMD induced significant changes in the relative abundance of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria on d 10, while no significant differences were observed on d 24. On d 35, the non-treated control group had higher relative abundance of unclassified Gram-positive and -negative bacteria compared to SA, SAPP, and BMD treatment groups. Overall, despite their beneficial role in controlling necrotic enteritis outbreaks, the findings of this study highlight the potential negative effects of dietary supplementation of therapeutic levels of antibiotics on the gut microbiome and suggest that adjusting gut bacteria may be required to restore microbial richness and diversity of the gut microbiome following treatment with these antibiotics.",Poultry science,2022,Seyed Hossien Kairmi; Khaled Taha-Abdelaziz; Alexander Yitbarek; Mehdi Sargolzaei; Heidi Spahany; Jake Astill; Bahram Shojadoost; Mohammadali Alizadeh; Raveendra R Kulkarni; John Parkinson; Shayan Sharif
35443740,Role of diet and its effects on the gut microbiome in the pathophysiology of mental disorders.,"There is emerging evidence that diet has a major modulatory influence on brain-gut-microbiome (BGM) interactions with important implications for brain health, and for several brain disorders. The BGM system is made up of neuroendocrine, neural, and immune communication channels which establish a network of bidirectional interactions between the brain, the gut and its microbiome. Diet not only plays a crucial role in shaping the gut microbiome, but it can modulate structure and function of the brain through these communication channels. In this review, we summarize the evidence available from preclinical and clinical studies on the influence of dietary habits and interventions on a selected group of psychiatric and neurologic disorders including depression, cognitive decline, Parkinson's disease, autism spectrum disorder and epilepsy. We will particularly address the role of diet-induced microbiome changes which have been implicated in these effects, and some of which are shared between different brain disorders. While the majority of these findings have been demonstrated in preclinical and in cross-sectional, epidemiological studies, to date there is insufficient evidence from mechanistic human studies to make conclusions about causality between a specific diet and microbially mediated brain function. Many of the dietary benefits on microbiome and brain health have been attributed to anti-inflammatory effects mediated by the microbial metabolites of dietary fiber and polyphenols. The new attention given to dietary factors in brain disorders has the potential to improve treatment outcomes with currently available pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies.",Translational psychiatry,2022,J Horn; D E Mayer; S Chen; E A Mayer
35432226,To the Gut Microbiome and Beyond: The Brain-First or Body-First Hypothesis in Parkinson's Disease.,"There is continued debate regarding Parkinson's disease etiology and whether it originates in the brain or begins in the gut. Recently, evidence has been provided for both, with Parkinson's disease onset presenting as either a ""body-first"" or ""brain-first"" progression. Most research indicates those with Parkinson's disease have an altered gut microbiome compared to controls. However, some studies do not report gut microbiome differences, potentially due to the brain or body-first progression type. Based on the etiology of each proposed progression, individuals with the body-first progression may exhibit altered gut microbiomes, i.e., where short-chain fatty acid producing bacteria are reduced, while the brain-first progression may not. Future microbiome research should consider this hypothesis and investigate whether gut microbiome differences exist between each type of progression. This may further elucidate the impact of the gut microbiome in Parkinson's disease and show how it may not be homogenous across individuals with Parkinson's disease.",Frontiers in microbiology,2022,Nathan D Nuzum; Amy Loughman; Ewa A Szymlek-Gay; Wei-Peng Teo; Ashlee M Hendy; Helen Macpherson
35399136,"Intestinal Dopamine Receptor D2 is Required for Neuroprotection Against 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced Dopaminergic Neurodegeneration.","A wealth of evidence has suggested that gastrointestinal dysfunction is associated with the onset and progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the mechanisms underlying these links remain to be defined. Here, we investigated the impact of deregulation of intestinal dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) signaling in response to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Dopamine/dopamine signaling in the mouse colon decreased with ageing. Selective ablation of Drd2, but not Drd4, in the intestinal epithelium, caused a more severe loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra following MPTP challenge, and this was accompanied by a reduced abundance of succinate-producing Alleoprevotella in the gut microbiota. Administration of succinate markedly attenuated dopaminergic neuronal loss in MPTP-treated mice by elevating the mitochondrial membrane potential. This study suggests that intestinal epithelial DRD2 activity and succinate from the gut microbiome contribute to the maintenance of nigral DA neuron survival. These findings provide a potential strategy targeting neuroinflammation-related neurological disorders such as PD.",Neuroscience bulletin,2022,Hairong Peng; Shui Yu; Yukai Zhang; Yanqing Yin; Jiawei Zhou
35393656,The human microbiome in disease and pathology.,"This narrative review seeks to examine the relationships between bacterial microbiomes and infectious disease. This is achieved by detailing how different human host microbiomes develop and function, from the earliest infant acquisitions of maternal and environmental species through to the full development of microbiomes by adulthood. Communication between bacterial species or communities of species within and outside of the microbiome is a factor in both maintenance of homeostasis and management of threats from the external environment. Dysbiosis of this homeostasis is key to understanding the development of disease states. Several microbiomes and the microbiota within are used as prime examples of how changes in species composition, particularly at the phylum level, leads to such diverse conditions as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), type 2 diabetes, psoriasis, Parkinson's disease, reflux oesophagitis and others. The review examines spatial relationships between microbiomes to understand how dysbiosis in the gut microbiome in particular can influence diseases in distant host sites via routes such as the gut-lung, gut-skin and gut-brain axes. Microbiome interaction with host processes such as adaptive immunity is increasingly identified as critical to developing the capacity of the immune system to react to pathogens. Dysbiosis of essential bacteria involved in modification of host substrates such as bile acid components can result in development of Crohn's disease, small intestine bacterial overgrowth, hepatic cancer and obesity. Interactions between microbiomes in distantly located sites are being increasingly being identified, resulting in a 'whole of body' effect by the combined host microbiome.","APMIS : acta pathologica, microbiologica, et immunologica Scandinavica",2022,Jim Manos
35327401,<i>Drosophila</i> Model for Studying Gut Microbiota in Behaviors and Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Mounting evidence indicates that the gut microbiota is linked to several physiological processes and disease development in mammals; however, the underlying mechanisms remained unexplored mostly due to the complexity of the mammalian gut microbiome. The fruit fly, <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, is a valuable animal model for studying host-gut microbiota interactions in translational aspects. The availability of powerful genetic tools and resources in <i>Drosophila</i> allowed the scientists to unravel the mechanisms by which the gut microbes affect fitness, health, and behavior of their hosts. <i>Drosophila</i> models have been extensively used not only to study animal behaviors (i.e., courtship, aggression, sleep, and learning & memory), but also some human related neurodegenerative diseases (i.e., Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease) in the past.

35326429,Hydrogen Sulfide Produced by Gut Bacteria May Induce Parkinson's Disease.,"Several bacterial species can generate hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S). Study evidence favors the view that the microbiome of the colon harbors increased amounts of H<sub>2</sub>S producing bacteria in Parkinson's disease. Additionally, H<sub>2</sub>S can easily penetrate cell membranes and enter the cell interior. In the cells, excessive amounts of H<sub>2</sub>S can potentially release cytochrome c protein from the mitochondria, increase the iron content of the cytosolic iron pool, and increase the amount of reactive oxygen species. These events can lead to the formation of alpha-synuclein oligomers and fibrils in cells containing the alpha-synuclein protein. In addition, bacterially produced H<sub>2</sub>S can interfere with the body urate metabolism and affect the blood erythrocytes and lymphocytes. Gut bacteria responsible for increased H<sub>2</sub>S production, especially the mucus-associated species of the bacterial genera belonging to the Desulfovibrionaceae and Enterobacteriaceae families, are likely play a role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Special attention should be devoted to changes not only in the colonic but also in the duodenal microbiome composition with regard to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Influenza infections may increase the risk of Parkinson's disease by causing the overgrowth of H<sub>2</sub>S-producing bacteria both in the colon and duodenum.",Cells,2022,Kari Erik Murros
35317228,Analysis methods for the gut microbiome in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.,"For a long time, the central nervous system was believed to be the only regulator of cognitive functions. However, accumulating evidence suggests that the composition of the microbiome is strongly associated with brain functions and diseases. Indeed, the gut microbiome is involved in neuropsychiatric diseases (e.g., depression, autism spectrum disorder, and anxiety) and neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease). In this review, we provide an overview of the link between the gut microbiome and neuropsychiatric or neurodegenerative disorders. We also introduce analytical methods used to assess the connection between the gut microbiome and the brain. The limitations of the methods used at present are also discussed. The accurate translation of the microbiome information to brain disorder could promote better understanding of neuronal diseases and aid in finding alternative and novel therapies.",Computational and structural biotechnology journal,2022,Jae Gwang Song; Myeong-Sang Yu; Bomi Lee; Jingyu Lee; Su-Hee Hwang; Dokyun Na; Hyung Wook Kim
35307514,Gut dysbiosis and age-related neurological diseases in females.,"Historically, females have been underrepresented in biological research. With increased interest in the gut microbiome and the gut-brain axis, it is important for researchers to pursue studies that consider sex as a biological variable. The composition of the gut microbiome is influenced by environmental factors, disease, diet, and varies with age and by sex. Detrimental changes in the gut microbiome, referred to as dysbiosis, is believed to influence the development and progression of age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and stroke. Many are investigating the changes in microbial populations in order or to better understand the role of the gut immunity and the microbiome in neurodegenerative diseases, many of which the exact etiology remains elusive, and no cures exist.Â  Others are working to find diagnostic markers for earlier detection, or to therapeutically modulate microbial populations using probiotics. However, while all these diseases present in reproductively senescent females, most studies only use male animals for their experimental design. Reproductively senescent females have been shown to have differences in disease progression, inflammatory responses, and microbiota composition, therefore, for research to be translational to affected populations it is necessary for appropriate models to be used. This review discusses factors that influence the gut microbiome and the gut brain axis in females, and highlights studies that have investigated the role of dysbiosis in age-related neurodegenerative disorders that have included females in their study design.",Neurobiology of disease,2022,Janelle M Korf; Bhanu P Ganesh; Louise D McCullough
35281490,Mechanistic Insights Into Gut Microbiome Dysbiosis-Mediated Neuroimmune Dysregulation and Protein Misfolding and Clearance in the Pathogenesis of Chronic Neurodegenerative Disorders.,"The human gut microbiota is a complex, dynamic, and highly diverse community of microorganisms. Beginning as early as <i>in utero</i> fetal development and continuing through birth to late-stage adulthood, the crosstalk between the gut microbiome and brain is essential for modulating various metabolic, neurodevelopmental, and immune-related pathways. Conversely, microbial dysbiosis - defined as alterations in richness and relative abundances - of the gut is implicated in the pathogenesis of several chronic neurological and neurodegenerative disorders. Evidence from large-population cohort studies suggests that individuals with neurodegenerative conditions have an altered gut microbial composition as well as microbial and serum metabolomic profiles distinct from those in the healthy population. Dysbiosis is also linked to psychiatric and gastrointestinal complications - comorbidities often associated with the prodromal phase of Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Studies have identified potential mediators that link gut dysbiosis and neurological disorders. Recent findings have also elucidated the potential mechanisms of disease pathology in the enteric nervous system prior to the onset of neurodegeneration. This review highlights the functional pathways and mechanisms, particularly gut microbe-induced chronic inflammation, protein misfolding, propagation of disease-specific pathology, defective protein clearance, and autoimmune dysregulation, linking gut microbial dysbiosis and neurodegeneration. In addition, we also discuss how pathogenic transformation of microbial composition leads to increased endotoxin production and fewer beneficial metabolites, both of which could trigger immune cell activation and enteric neuronal dysfunction. These can further disrupt intestinal barrier permeability, aggravate the systemic pro-inflammatory state, impair blood-brain barrier permeability and recruit immune mediators leading to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Continued biomedical advances in understanding the microbiota-gut-brain axis will extend the frontier of neurodegenerative disorders and enable the utilization of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to mitigate the pathological burden of these diseases.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2022,Piyush Padhi; Carter Worth; Gary Zenitsky; Huajun Jin; Kumar Sambamurti; Vellareddy Anantharam; Arthi Kanthasamy; Anumantha G Kanthasamy
35207632,Gastrointestinal Dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease: Current and Potential Therapeutics.,"Abnormalities in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of Parkinson's disease (PD) sufferers were first reported over 200 years ago; however, the extent and role of GI dysfunction in PD disease progression is still unknown. GI dysfunctions, including dysphagia, gastroparesis, and constipation, are amongst the most prevalent non-motor symptoms in PD. These symptoms not only impact patient quality of life, but also complicate disease management. Conventional treatment pathways for GI dysfunctions (i.e., constipation), such as increasing fibre and fluid intake, and the use of over-the-counter laxatives, are generally ineffective in PD patients, and approved compounds such as guanylate cyclase C agonists and selective 5-hyroxytryptamine 4 receptor agonists have demonstrated limited efficacy. Thus, identification of potential targets for novel therapies to alleviate PD-induced GI dysfunctions are essential to improve clinical outcomes and quality of life in people with PD. Unlike the central nervous system (CNS), where PD pathology and the mechanisms involved in CNS damage are relatively well characterised, the effect of PD at the cellular and tissue level in the enteric nervous system (ENS) remains unclear, making it difficult to alleviate or reverse GI symptoms. However, the resurgence of interest in understanding how the GI tract is involved in various disease states, such as PD, has resulted in the identification of novel therapeutic avenues. This review focuses on common PD-related GI symptoms, and summarizes the current treatments available and their limitations. We propose that by targeting the intestinal barrier, ENS, and/or the gut microbiome, may prove successful in alleviating PD-related GI symptoms, and discuss emerging therapies and potential drugs that could be repurposed to target these areas.",Journal of personalized medicine,2022,Myat Noe Han; David I Finkelstein; Rachel M McQuade; Shanti Diwakarla
35203906,Parkinson's Disease in Light of the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"In this review we attempt to collate the existing scientific evidence regarding the possible role of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD), as well as to investigate the impact of PD/parkinsonism on the clinical course of the viral infection itself. Since etiology of PD is not completely understood, various studies suggest different potential links between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and PD. Suggested connections include, among others, similar prodromal symptoms, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system involvement, or gut microbiome dysbiosis participation. Despite the initial assumptions that, as a mainly elderly population suffering from rigidity of respiratory muscles, impairment of cough reflex, and dyspnea, PD patients would be more susceptible to viral infection, and would experience a more aggressive course of COVID-19, the published scientific reports contain mutually exclusive data that require further investigation and meta-analysis.",Brain sciences,2022,Anna Drelich-Zbroja; Mateusz Cheda; Maryla KuczyÅska; Izabela DÄbrowska; Ewa Kopyto; Izabela Halczuk
35189807,Rifaximin modulates TRH and TRH-like peptide expression throughout the brain and peripheral tissues of male rats.,"The TRH/TRH-R1 receptor signaling pathway within the neurons of the dorsal vagal complex is an important mediator of the brain-gut axis. Mental health and protection from a variety of neuropathologies, such as autism, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, major depression, migraine and epilepsy are influenced by the gut microbiome and is mediated by the vagus nerve. The antibiotic rifaximin (RF) does not cross the gut-blood barrier. It changes the composition of the gut microbiome resulting in therapeutic benefits for traveler's diarrhea, hepatic encephalopathy, and prostatitis. TRH and TRH-like peptides, with the structure pGlu-X-Pro-NH<sub>2</sub>, where ""X"" can be any amino acid residue, have reproduction-enhancing, caloric-restriction-like, anti-aging, pancreatic-Î² cell-, cardiovascular-, and neuroprotective effects. TRH and TRH-like peptides occur not only throughout the CNS but also in peripheral tissues. To elucidate the involvement of TRH-like peptides in brain-gut-reproductive system interactions 16 male Sprague-Dawley rats, 203âÂ±â6Â g, were divided into 4 groups (nâ=â4/group): the control (CON) group remained on ad libitum Purina rodent chow and water for 10Â days until decapitation, acute (AC) group receiving 150Â mg RF/kg powdered rodent chow for 24Â h providing 150Â mg RF/kg body weight for 200Â g rats, chronic (CHR) animals receiving RF for 10Â days; withdrawal (WD) rats receiving RF for 8Â days and then normal chow for 2Â days.Significant changes in the levels of TRH and TRH-like peptides occurred throughout the brain and peripheral tissues in response to RF. The number of significant changes in TRH and TRH-like peptide levels in brain resulting from RF treatment, in descending order were: medulla (16), piriform cortex (8), nucleus accumbens (7), frontal cortex (5), striatum (3), amygdala (3), entorhinal cortex (3), anterior (2), and posterior cingulate (2), hippocampus (1), hypothalamus (0) and cerebellum (0). The corresponding ranking for peripheral tissues were: prostate (6), adrenals (4), pancreas (3), liver (2), testis (1), heart (0).The sensitivity of TRH and TRH-like peptide expression to RF treatment, particularly in the medulla oblongata and prostate, is consistent with the participation of these peptides in the therapeutic effects of RF.",BMC neuroscience,2022,Albert Eugene Pekary; Albert Sattin
35163103,Gut-Brain Axis as a Pathological and Therapeutic Target for Neurodegenerative Disorders.,"Human lifestyle and dietary behaviors contribute to disease onset and progression. Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), considered multifactorial disorders, have been associated with changes in the gut microbiome. NDDs display pathologies that alter brain functions with a tendency to worsen over time. NDDs are a worldwide health problem; in the US alone, 12 million Americans will suffer from NDDs by 2030. While etiology may vary, the gut microbiome serves as a key element underlying NDD development and prognosis. In particular, an inflammation-associated microbiome plagues NDDs. Conversely, sequestration of this inflammatory microbiome by a correction in the dysbiotic state of the gut may render therapeutic effects on NDDs. To this end, treatment with short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria, the main metabolites responsible for maintaining gut homeostasis, ameliorates the inflammatory microbiome. This intimate pathological link between the gut and NDDs suggests that the gut-brain axis (GBA) acts as an underexplored area for developing therapies for NDDs. Traditionally, the classification of NDDs depends on their clinical presentation, mostly manifesting as extrapyramidal and pyramidal movement disorders, with neuropathological evaluation at autopsy as the gold standard for diagnosis. In this review, we highlight the evolving notion that GBA stands as an equally sensitive pathological marker of NDDs, particularly in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and chronic stroke. Additionally, GBA represents a potent therapeutic target for treating NDDs.",International journal of molecular sciences,2022,Alma Rosa Lezama Toledo; GermÃ¡n Rivera Monroy; Felipe Esparza Salazar; Jea-Young Lee; Shalini Jain; Hariom Yadav; Cesario Venturina Borlongan
35145822,Constipation and Cigarette Smoking Are Independent Influences for Parkinson's Disease.,"Background Tobacco smokers have reduced Parkinson's disease (PD) risk. Some patients withÂ PD experience constipation long before they develop mobility problems, and constipation is a frequent complaint of people who try to stop smoking. Recently, the gut microbiome has been implicated in PD. Methods In the present study, we analyzed the relationship between smoking and constipation in subjects withÂ PD and controls. We wished to determine whether the effects of smoking and constipation were independent or whether they might be interrelated. To evaluate the relationship, we used a cohort of subjects from the UK Biobank (UKB). Results In 501,174 subjects, the decreased risk of Parkinson's disease with increased smoking was significant (p < 0.001, two-tailed Fisher's exact test). The increased risk of constipation in subjects withÂ PD was significant (p = 0.001, two-tailed Fisher's exact test). Logistic regression was performed; sex, age, constipation, and smoking were theÂ independent variables, and PD present or absent was the dependent variable. The PD odds ratio (OR) for males was 1.790 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.629-1.966) times that for females, indicating that PD is more common in men. The risk of PD increased by 1.140 (95% CI: 1.131-1.149) with every year of age. Constipation increased the risk of PD by 4.043 (95% CI: 1.901-8.599). Smoking diminished PD risk by 0.772 (95% CI: 0.690-0.863). Drinking coffee was associated with a reduced risk of PD (OR: 0.815 (95% CI: 0.730-0.909). Drinking tea reduced PD risk by 0.979 (95% CI: 0.962-0.997) for each cup per day.Â The effects of sex, age, constipation, smoking, drinking coffee, andÂ drinking tea were independent and significant. Conclusion Our analysis suggests that the favorable effect of smoking on PD is independent of the detrimental effect of constipation. Smoking reduces PD risk because itÂ not only stimulates the bowel to empty and prevents constipationÂ but also alters the gut microbiome. Another factor, perhaps the tobacco component diterpenoids, may be responsible for the PD risk-reducing effect.",Cureus,2022,Steven Lehrer; Peter H Rheinstein
35057561,Are We What We Eat? Impact of Diet on the Gut-Brain Axis in Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease is characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms, such as defects in the gut function, which may occur before the motor symptoms. To date, there are therapies that can improve these symptoms, but there is no cure to avoid the development or exacerbation of this disorder. Dysbiosis of gut microbiota could have a crucial role in the gut-brain axis, which is a bidirectional communication between the central nervous system and the enteric nervous system. Diet can affect the microbiota composition, impacting gut-brain axis functionality. Gut microbiome restoration through probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics or other dietary means could have the potential to slow PD progression. In this review, we will discuss the influence of diet on the bidirectional communication between gut and brain, thus supporting the hypothesis that this disorder could begin in the gut. We also focus on how food-based therapies might then have an influence on PD and could ameliorate non-motor as well as motor symptoms.",Nutrients,2022,Margherita Alfonsetti; Vanessa Castelli; Michele d'Angelo

Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder with few management options, although the gut microbiome has been suggested as a potential avenue of treatment. We retrospectively analysed the microbiome from human stool samples from a previously published study, which had demonstrated the efficacy of photobiomodulation to treat Parkinson's patients' symptoms. Specifically, we have observed changes in the microbiome of Parkinson's patients after a 12-week treatment regimen with photobiomodulation to the abdomen, neck, head and nose. Noted were positive changes in the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (F:B) ratio, which is often interpreted as a proxy for gut health.",Journal of personalized medicine,2022,Brian Bicknell; Ann Liebert; Craig S McLachlan; Hosen Kiat
35032636,Impact of intestinal disorders on central and peripheral nervous system diseases.,"Brain injuries and neurological diseases have a significant impact on the gut microbiome and the gut barrier. Reciprocally, gut disorders, such as Inflammatory Bowel Syndromes (IBS), can affect the development and pathology of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases, although this aspect is less well studied and is the focus of this review. Inflammatory Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a chronic and debilitating functional gastrointestinal disorder afflicting an estimated 9-23% of the world's population. A hallmark of this disease is leaky gut, a pathology in which the integrity of the gut blood barrier is compromised, causing gut contents such as immune cells and microbiota to enter the bloodstream leading to low-grade systemic inflammation. The increased levels of inflammation associated cytokines in circulation has the potential to affect all organs, including the brain. Although the brain is protected by the blood brain barrier, inflammation associated cytokines can damage the junctions in this barrier and allow brain infiltration of peripheral immune cells. Central inflammation in the brain is associated with various neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and neuropsychiatric disorders, namely, depression, and anxiety. Neurodegenerative diseases are of particular concern due to the anticipated rise in the population of the elderly and consequently, the prevalence of these diseases. Additionally, depression and anxiety are the most common mental illnesses affecting roughly 18% of the American population. In this review, we will explore the mechanisms by which IBS can influence the risk and severity of neurological disease.",Neurobiology of disease,2022,Yumna El-Hakim; Shameena Bake; Kathiresh Kumar Mani; Farida Sohrabji
34985325,A Comprehensive Review on the Role of the Gut Microbiome in Human Neurological Disorders.,"The human body is full of an extensive number of commensal microbes, consisting of bacteria, viruses, and fungi, collectively termed the human microbiome. The initial acquisition of microbiota occurs from both the external and maternal environments, and the vast majority of them colonize the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). These microbial communities play a central role in the maturation and development of the immune system, the central nervous system, and the GIT system and are also responsible for essential metabolic pathways. Various factors, including host genetic predisposition, environmental factors, lifestyle, diet, antibiotic or nonantibiotic drug use, etc., affect the composition of the gut microbiota. Recent publications have highlighted that an imbalance in the gut microflora, known as dysbiosis, is associated with the onset and progression of neurological disorders. Moreover, characterization of the microbiome-host cross talk pathways provides insight into novel therapeutic strategies. Novel preclinical and clinical research on interventions related to the gut microbiome for treating neurological conditions, including autism spectrum disorders, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and stroke, hold significant promise. This review aims to present a comprehensive overview of the potential involvement of the human gut microbiome in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders, with a particular emphasis on the potential of microbe-based therapies and/or diagnostic microbial biomarkers. This review also discusses the potential health benefits of the administration of probiotics, prebiotics, postbiotics, and synbiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation in neurological disorders.",Clinical microbiology reviews,2022,Shokufeh Ghasemian Sorboni; Hanieh Shakeri Moghaddam; Reza Jafarzadeh-Esfehani; Saman Soleimanpour
34980288,Performance of distinct microbial based solutions in a Campylobacter infection challenge model in poultry.,"Antibiotic growth promoters (AGPs) are commonly used within poultry production to improve feed conversion, bird growth, and reduce morbidity and mortality from clinical and subclinical diseases. Due to the association between AGP usage and rising antimicrobial resistance, the industry has explored new strategies including the use of probiotics and other microbial-based interventions to promote the development of a healthy microbiome in birds and mitigate against infections associated with food safety and food security. While previous studies have largely focused on the ability of probiotics to protect against Clostridium perfringens and Salmonella enterica, much less is known concerning their impact on Campylobacter jejuni, a near commensal of the chicken gut microbiome that nevertheless is a major cause of food poisoning in humans.Here we compare the efficacy of four microbial interventions (two single strain probiotics, the bacterium-Pediococcus acidilactici, and the yeast-Saccharomyces cerevisiae boulardii; and two complex, competitive exclusion, consortia-Aviguard and CEL) to bacitracin, a commonly used AGP, to modulate chicken gut microbiota and subsequently impact C. jejuni infection in poultry. Cecal samples were harvested at 30- and 39-days post hatch to assess Campylobacter burden and examine their impact on the gut microbiota. While the different treatments did not significantly decrease C. jejuni burden relative to the untreated controls, both complex consortia resulted in significant decreases relative to treatment with bacitracin. Analysis of 16S rDNA profiles revealed a distinct microbial signature associated with each microbial intervention. For example, treatment with Aviguard and CEL increased the relative abundance of Bacteroidaceae and Rikenellaceae respectively. Furthermore, Aviguard promoted a less complex microbial community compared to other treatments.Depending upon the individual needs of the producer, our results illustrate the potential of each microbial interventions to serve flock-specific requirements.",Animal microbiome,2022,Maxine Ty; Khaled Taha-Abdelaziz; Vanessa Demey; Mathieu Castex; Shayan Sharif; John Parkinson
38488556,Unraveling the gut-brain axis: the impact of steroid hormones and nutrition on Parkinson's disease.,"This comprehensive review explores the intricate relationship between nutrition, the gut microbiome, steroid hormones, and Parkinson's disease within the context of the gut-brain axis. The gut-brain axis plays a pivotal role in neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease, encompassing diverse components such as the gut microbiota, immune system, metabolism, and neural pathways. The gut microbiome, profoundly influenced by dietary factors, emerges as a key player. Nutrition during the first 1000 days of life shapes the gut microbiota composition, influencing immune responses and impacting both child development and adult health. High-fat, high-sugar diets can disrupt this delicate balance, contributing to inflammation and immune dysfunction. Exploring nutritional strategies, the Mediterranean diet's anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties show promise in reducing Parkinson's disease risk. Microbiome-targeted dietary approaches and the ketogenic diet hold the potential in improving brain disorders. Beyond nutrition, emerging research uncovers potential interactions between steroid hormones, nutrition, and Parkinson's disease. Progesterone, with its anti-inflammatory properties and presence in the nervous system, offers a novel option for Parkinson's disease therapy. Its ability to enhance neuroprotection within the enteric nervous system presents exciting prospects. The review addresses the hypothesis that Î±-synuclein aggregates originate from the gut and may enter the brain via the vagus nerve. Gastrointestinal symptoms preceding motor symptoms support this hypothesis. Dysfunctional gut-brain signaling during gut dysbiosis contributes to inflammation and neurotransmitter imbalances, emphasizing the potential of microbiota-based interventions. In summary, this review uncovers the complex web of interactions between nutrition, the gut microbiome, steroid hormones, and Parkinson's disease within the gut-brain axis framework. Understanding these connections not only offers novel therapeutic insights but also illuminates the origins of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease.",Neural regeneration research,2024,Paula Maria Neufeld; Ralf A Nettersheim; Veronika Matschke; Matthias Vorgerd; Sarah Stahlke; Carsten Theiss
38357211,Gut microbiota and metabolite variations in a migraine mouse model.,"Migraine is a prevalent clinical disorder characterized by recurrent unilateral throbbing headache episodes accompanied by symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia. Despite its common occurrence, the diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment of migraine remain controversial. Extensive research has implicated the gut microbiota in various central nervous system disorders, including anxiety disorders, depression, and Parkinson's disease. Some studies have also suggested that migraine may stem from disruptions to neurohormones and metabolism. This study aimed to investigate the disparities in gut microbiota and metabolites between migraine mice model and normal mice to shed light on the underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutic approaches. Distinct differences in gut microbial composition were observed between the migraine mouse model and normal mouse, indicating a potential correlation between these variations and the pathogenesis of migraine. This study provides evidence of differences in gut microbiota composition and metabolites between a migraine mouse model and normal mice, which showed that Akkermansiaceae constituted the most abundant taxon in the sham injection mouse group, while Lachnospiraceae constituted the most prevalent group in the migraine mouse model group. The associations between the abundances of <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> and Lachnospiraceae bacteria and metabolites suggested their potential roles in the pathogenesis of migraine. The altered abundance of Lachnospiraceae observed in migraine-afflicted mice and its correlations with changes in metabolites suggest that it may affect the host's health. Thus, probiotic therapy emerges as a possible treatment for migraine. Moreover, significant disparities in gut metabolites were observed between the migraine mouse model and normal mice. These alterations encompass multiple metabolic pathways, suggesting that metabolic disturbances may also contribute to the development of migraines.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2023,Dan Wang; Xu Liu; Suming Shi; Tongli Ren; Wuqing Wang
38275646,"Trihexyphenidyl Alters Its Host's Metabolism, Neurobehavioral Patterns, and Gut Microbiome Feedback Loop-The Modulating Role of <i>Anacyclus pyrethrum</i>.","Trihexyphenidyl (THP)-a synthetic anticholinergic medication used to manage parkinsonism and extrapyramidal symptoms-has gained significant clinical recognition. However, there is a critical gap in understanding its withdrawal effects. This study investigates the intricate interplay between gut microbiota and oxidative stress during THP withdrawal. Furthermore, it explores the therapeutic potential of <i>Anacyclus pyrethrum</i> (AEAP) for alleviating the associated adverse effects. This comprehensive research combines behavioral tests, biochemical analysis, gut microbiome assessment utilizing matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), and oxidative stress measures. The results reveal that the chronic administration of THP leads to severe withdrawal syndrome, marked by heightened anxiety, depressive-like behaviors, increased cortisol levels, elevated oxidative stress, and gut dysbiosis. However, the administration of AEAP alongside THP shows a significant capacity to mitigate these deleterious effects. Co-treatment and post-treatment with AEAP increased bacterial density and diversity, promoting the proliferation of beneficial bacteria associated with improved gut health. Furthermore, AEAP administration reduced cortisol levels and exhibited potent antioxidant properties, effectively countering the THP-induced oxidative damage. This study highlights the withdrawal effects of THP and underscores the therapeutic potential of AEAP for managing these symptoms. The findings reveal its promising effects in alleviating behavioral and biochemical impairments, reducing oxidative stress, and restoring gut microbiota, which could significantly impact the clinical management of THP withdrawal and potentially extend to other substance withdrawal scenarios.","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,Abdelmounaim Baslam; Hajar Azraida; Rachida Aboufatima; Mohamed Ait-El-Mokhtar; Ilham Dilagui; Samia Boussaa; Abderrahman Chait; Marouane Baslam
38229613,Dysbiosis of the Beneficial Gut Bacteria in Patients with Parkinson's Disease from India.,"Recent advancement in understanding neurological disorders has revealed the involvement of dysbiosis of the gut microbiota in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). We sequenced microbial DNA using fecal samples collected from PD cases and healthy controls (HCs) to evaluate the role of gut microbiota.Full-length bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing of fecal samples was performed using amplified polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products on the GridION Nanopore sequencer. Sequenced data were analyzed using web-based tools BugSeq and MicrobiomeAnalyst.We found that certain bacterial families like Clostridia UCG 014, Cristensenellaceae, and Oscillospiraceae are higher in abundance, and Lachinospiracea, Coriobacteriaceae and genera associated with short-chain fatty acid production, <i>Faecalibacterium</i>, <i>Fusicatenibacter</i>, <i>Roseburia</i> and <i>Blautia</i>, are lower in abundance among PD cases when compared with the HC.

38203294,Molecular Mechanisms of Neuroprotection by Ketone Bodies and Ketogenic Diet in Cerebral Ischemia and Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Ketone bodies (KBs), such as acetoacetate and Î²-hydroxybutyrate, serve as crucial alternative energy sources during glucose deficiency. KBs, generated through ketogenesis in the liver, are metabolized into acetyl-CoA in extrahepatic tissues, entering the tricarboxylic acid cycle and electron transport chain for ATP production. Reduced glucose metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction correlate with increased neuronal death and brain damage during cerebral ischemia and neurodegeneration. Both KBs and the ketogenic diet (KD) demonstrate neuroprotective effects by orchestrating various cellular processes through metabolic and signaling functions. They enhance mitochondrial function, mitigate oxidative stress and apoptosis, and regulate epigenetic and post-translational modifications of histones and non-histone proteins. Additionally, KBs and KD contribute to reducing neuroinflammation and modulating autophagy, neurotransmission systems, and gut microbiome. This review aims to explore the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms underpinning the neuroprotective effects of KBs and KD against brain damage in cerebral ischemia and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.",International journal of molecular sciences,2023,Jiwon Jang; Su Rim Kim; Jo Eun Lee; Seoyeon Lee; Hyeong Jig Son; Wonchae Choe; Kyung-Sik Yoon; Sung Soo Kim; Eui-Ju Yeo; Insug Kang
38176929,Research Progress of Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis in Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by misfolding of Î±-synuclein. Clinical manifestations include slowly developing resting tremor, muscle rigidity, bradykinesia and abnormal gait. The pathological mechanisms underlying PD are complex and yet to be fully elucidated. Clinical studies suggest that the onset of gastrointestinal symptoms may precede motor symptoms in PD patients. The microbiota-gut-brain axis plays a bidirectional communication role between the enteric nervous system and the central nervous system. This bidirectional communication between the brain and gut is influenced by the neural, immune and endocrine systems related to the gut microbiome. A growing body of evidence indicates a strong link between dysregulation of the gut microbiota and PD. In this review, we present recent progress in understanding the relationship between the microbiota-gut-brain axis and PD.

38106100,Hypothesizing mechanistic links between microbes and disease using knowledge graphs.,"Knowledge graphs have found broad biomedical applications, providing useful representations of complex knowledge. Although plentiful evidence exists linking the gut microbiome to disease, mechanistic understanding of those relationships remains generally elusive. Here we demonstrate the potential of knowledge graphs to hypothesize plausible mechanistic accounts of host-microbe interactions in disease. To do so, we constructed a knowledge graph of linked microbes, genes and metabolites called MGMLink. Using a semantically constrained shortest path search through the graph and a novel path prioritization methodology based on cosine similarity, we show that this knowledge supports inference of mechanistic hypotheses that explain observed relationships between microbes and disease phenotypes. We discuss specific applications of this methodology in inflammatory bowel disease and Parkinson's disease. This approach enables mechanistic hypotheses surrounding the complex interactions between gut microbes and disease to be generated in a scalable and comprehensive manner.",bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,2023,Brook Santangelo; Michael Bada; Lawrence Hunter; Catherine Lozupone
38078745,Microbiota-mediated effects of Parkinson's disease medications on Parkinsonian non-motor symptoms in male transgenic mice.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by motor symptoms and a loss of dopaminergic neurons, as well as a variety of non-motor symptoms, including constipation, depression, and anxiety. Recently, evidence has also accumulated for a link between gut microbiota and PD. Most PD patients are on dopamine replacement therapy, primarily a combination of L-DOPA and carbidopa; however, the effect of these medications on the microbiota and non-motor symptoms in PD is still unclear. In this study, we explored the effects of chronic oral treatment with L-DOPA plus carbidopa (LDCD) on the gut microbiota and non-motor symptoms in males of a transgenic mouse model of PD (dbl-PAC-Tg(<i>SNCA</i><sup>A53T</sup>);<i>Snca</i>-/-). To further test whether the effects of these PD medications were mediated by the gut microbiota, oral antibiotic treatment (Abx; vancomycin and neomycin) was included both with and without concurrent LDCD treatment. Post-treatment, the gastrointestinal, motor, and behavioral phenotypes were profiled, and fecal, ileal, and jejunal samples were analyzed for gut microbiota composition by 16S sequencing. LDCD treatment was found to improve symptoms of constipation and depression in this model, concurrent with increases in <i>Turicibacter</i> abundance in the ileum. Abx treatment worsened the symptoms of constipation, possibly through decreased levels of short-chain fatty acids and disrupted gut barrier function. LDCD + Abx treatment showed an interaction effect on behavioral symptoms that was also associated with ileal <i>Turicibacter</i> levels. This study demonstrates that, in a mouse model, PD medications and antibiotics affect PD-related non-motor symptoms potentially <i>via</i> the gut microbiota.IMPORTANCEThe motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) are caused by a loss of dopamine-producing neurons and are commonly treated with dopamine replacement therapy (L-DOPA plus carbidopa). PD has also been associated with altered gut microbiota composition. However, the effects of these PD medications on PD-related non-motor symptoms and the gut microbiota have not been well characterized. This study uses a transgenic mouse model of PD to help resolve medication-induced microbiota alterations from those that are potentially disease relevant within a PD context, and explores how long-term treatment may interact with the gut microbiota to impact non-motor symptoms.",mSphere,2024,Nina Radisavljevic; Avril Metcalfe-Roach; Mihai Cirstea; M Mahebali Tabusi; Tahereh Bozorgmehr; Haggai Bar-Yoseph; B Brett Finlay
38075261,Gut-brain axis: gut dysbiosis and psychiatric disorders in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.,"Gut dysbiosis and psychiatric symptoms are common early manifestations of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). These diseases, characterised by progressive neuron loss and pathological protein accumulation, impose debilitating effects on patients. Recently, these pathological proteins have been linked with gut dysbiosis and psychiatric disorders. The gut-brain axis links the enteric and central nervous systems, acting as a bidirectional communication pathway to influence brain function and behavior. The relationship triad between gut dysbiosis, psychiatric disorders, and neurodegeneration has been investigated in pairs; however, evidence suggests that they are all interrelated and a deeper understanding is required to unravel the nuances of neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, this review aims to summarise the current literature on the roles of gut dysbiosis and psychiatric disorders in pathological protein-related neurodegenerative diseases. We discussed how changes in the gut environment can influence the development of psychiatric symptoms and the progression of neurodegeneration and how these features overlap in AD and PD. Moreover, research on the interplay between gut dysbiosis, psychiatric disorders, and neurodegeneration remains in its early phase. In this review, we highlighted potential therapeutic approaches aimed at mitigating gastrointestinal problems and psychiatric disorders to alter the rate of neurodegeneration. Further research to assess the molecular mechanisms underlying AD and PD pathogenesis remains crucial for developing more effective treatments and achieving earlier diagnoses. Moreover, exploring non-invasive, early preventive measures and interventions is a relatively unexplored but important avenue of research in neurodegenerative diseases.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2023,Charlotte R Denman; Sang Myun Park; Junghyun Jo

This axis has been suggested to play a role in several neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy, paving the way for microbiome-based intervention strategies for the mitigation and treatment of symptoms. Epilepsy is a multifaceted neurological condition affecting more than 50 million individuals worldwide, 30% of whom do not respond to conventional pharmacological therapies. Among the first-hand microbiota modulation strategies, nutritional interventions represent an easily applicable option in both clinical and home settings. In this narrative review, we summarize the mechanisms underlying the microbiota-gut-brain axis involvement in epilepsy, discuss the impact of antiepileptic drugs on the gut microbiome, and then the impact of a particular dietary pattern, the ketogenic diet, on the microbiota-gut-brain axis in epileptic patients. The investigation of the microbiota response to non-pharmacological therapies is an ever-expanding field with the potential to allow the design of increasingly accessible and successful intervention strategies.",Microbiome research reports,2023,Mariachiara Mengoli; Gabriele Conti; Marco Fabbrini; Marco Candela; Patrizia Brigidi; Silvia Turroni; Monica Barone
38024855,Protective effects of dioscin against Parkinson's disease via regulating bile acid metabolism through remodeling gut microbiome/GLP-1 signaling.,"It is necessary to explore potent therapeutic agents via regulating gut microbiota and metabolism to combat Parkinson's disease (PD). Dioscin, a bioactive steroidal saponin, shows various activities. However, its effects and mechanisms against PD are limited. In this study, dioscin dramatically alleviated neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, and restored the disorders of mice induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). 16Â S rDNA sequencing assay demonstrated that dioscin reversed MPTP-induced gut dysbiosis to decrease <i>Firmicutes</i>-to-<i>Bacteroidetes</i> ratio and the abundances of <i>Enterococcus</i>, <i>Streptococcus</i>, <i>Bacteroides</i> and <i>Lactobacillus genera</i>, which further inhibited bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity and blocked bile acid (BA) deconjugation. Fecal microbiome transplantation test showed that the <i>anti</i>-PD effect of dioscin was gut microbiota-dependent. In addition, non-targeted fecal metabolomics assays revealed many differential metabolites in adjusting steroid biosynthesis and primary bile acid biosynthesis. Moreover, targeted bile acid metabolomics assay indicated that dioscin increased the levels of ursodeoxycholic acid, tauroursodeoxycholic acid, taurodeoxycholic acid and Î²-muricholic acid in feces and serum. In addition, ursodeoxycholic acid administration markedly improved the protective effects of dioscin against PD in mice. Mechanistic test indicated that dioscin significantly up-regulated the levels of takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R), GLP-1, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and down-regulated NADPH oxidases 2 (NOX2) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-ÎºB) levels. Our data indicated that dioscin ameliorated PD phenotype by restoring gut dysbiosis and regulating bile acid-mediated oxidative stress and neuroinflammation via targeting GLP-1 signal in MPTP-induced PD mice, suggesting that the compound should be considered as a prebiotic agent to treat PD in the future.",Journal of pharmaceutical analysis,2023,Zhang Mao; Haochen Hui; Xuerong Zhao; Lina Xu; Yan Qi; Lianhong Yin; Liping Qu; Lan Han; Jinyong Peng
38014294,The Parkinson's drug entacapone disrupts gut microbiome homeostasis via iron sequestration.,"Increasing evidence shows that many human-targeted drugs alter the gut microbiome, leading to implications for host health. However, much less is known about the mechanisms by which drugs target the microbiome and how drugs affect microbial function. Here we combined quantitative microbiome profiling, long-read metagenomics, stable isotope probing and single-cell chemical imaging to investigate the impact of two widely prescribed nervous system-targeted drugs on the gut microbiome. <i>Ex vivo</i> supplementation of physiologically relevant concentrations of entacapone or loxapine succinate to faecal samples significantly impacted the abundance of up to one third of the microbial species present. Importantly, we demonstrate that the impact of these drugs on microbial metabolism is much more pronounced than their impact on abundances, with low concentrations of drugs reducing the activity, but not the abundance of key microbiome members like <i>Bacteroides, Ruminococcus</i> or <i>Clostridium</i> species. We further demonstrate that entacapone impacts the microbiome due to its ability to complex and deplete available iron, and that microbial growth can be rescued by replenishing levels of microbiota-accessible iron. Remarkably, entacapone-induced iron starvation selected for iron-scavenging organisms carrying antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes. Collectively, our study unveils the impact of two under-investigated drugs on whole microbiomes and identifies metal sequestration as a mechanism of drug-induced microbiome disturbance.",bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,2023,FÃ¡tima C Pereira; Xiaowei Ge; Jannie Munk Kristensen; Rasmus H Kirkegaard; Klara Maritsch; Yifan Zhu; Marie Decorte; Bela Hausmann; David Berry; Kenneth Wasmund; Arno Schintlmeister; Thomas Boettcher; Ji-Xin Cheng; Michael Wagner
38004795,A Catastrophic Biodiversity Loss in the Environment Is Being Replicated on the Skin Microbiome: Is This a Major Contributor to the Chronic Disease Epidemic?,"There has been a catastrophic loss of biodiversity in ecosystems across the world. A similar crisis has been observed in the human gut microbiome, which has been linked to ""all human diseases affecting westernized countries"". This is of great importance because chronic diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide and make up 90% of America's healthcare costs. Disease development is complex and multifactorial, but there is one part of the body's interlinked ecosystem that is often overlooked in discussions about whole-body health, and that is the skin microbiome. This is despite it being a crucial part of the immune, endocrine, and nervous systems and being continuously exposed to environmental stressors. Here we show that a parallel biodiversity loss of 30-84% has occurred on the skin of people in the developed world compared to our ancestors. Research has shown that dysbiosis of the skin microbiome has been linked to many common skin diseases and, more recently, that it could even play an active role in the development of a growing number of whole-body health problems, such as food allergies, asthma, cardiovascular diseases, and Parkinson's, traditionally thought unrelated to the skin. Damaged skin is now known to induce systemic inflammation, which is involved in many chronic diseases. We highlight that biodiversity loss is not only a common finding in dysbiotic ecosystems but also a type of dysbiosis. As a result, we make the case that biodiversity loss in the skin microbiome is a major contributor to the chronic disease epidemic. The link between biodiversity loss and dysbiosis forms the basis of this paper's focus on the subject. The key to understanding why biodiversity loss creates an unhealthy system could be highlighted by complex physics. We introduce entropy to help understand why biodiversity has been linked with ecosystem health and stability. Meanwhile, we also introduce ecosystems as being governed by ""non-linear physics"" principles-including chaos theory-which suggests that every individual part of any system is intrinsically linked and implies any disruption to a small part of the system (skin) could have a significant and unknown effect on overall system health (whole-body health). Recognizing the link between ecosystem health and human health allows us to understand how crucial it could be to maintain biodiversity across systems everywhere, from the macro-environment we inhabit right down to our body's microbiome. Further, in-depth research is needed so we can aid in the treatment of chronic diseases and potentially change how we think about our health. With millions of people currently suffering, research to help mitigate the crisis is of vital importance.",Microorganisms,2023,Christopher Wallen-Russell; Nancy Pearlman; Samuel Wallen-Russell; Dragos Cretoiu; Dana Claudia Thompson; Silviu Cristian Voinea
37927277,Pesticides and the Microbiome-Gut-Brain Axis: Convergent Pathways in the Pathogenesis of Parkinson's Disease.,"The increasing global burden of Parkinson's disease (PD), termed the PD pandemic, is exceeding expectations related purely to population aging and is likely driven in part by lifestyle changes and environmental factors. Pesticides are well recognized risk factors for PD, supported by both epidemiological and experimental evidence, with multiple detrimental effects beyond dopaminergic neuron damage alone. The microbiome-gut-brain axis has gained much attention in recent years and is considered to be a significant contributor and driver of PD pathogenesis. In this narrative review, we first focus on how both pesticides and the microbiome may influence PD initiation and progression independently, describing pesticide-related central and peripheral neurotoxicity and microbiome-related local and systemic effects due to dysbiosis and microbial metabolites. We then depict the bidirectional interplay between pesticides and the microbiome in the context of PD, synthesizing current knowledge about pesticide-induced dysbiosis, microbiome-mediated alterations in pesticide availability, metabolism and toxicity, and complex systemic pesticide-microbiome-host interactions related to inflammatory and metabolic pathways, insulin resistance and other mechanisms. An overview of the unknowns follows, and the role of pesticide-microbiome interactions in the proposed body-/brain-first phenotypes of PD, the complexity of environmental exposures and gene-environment interactions is discussed. The final part deals with possible further steps for translation, consisting of recommendations on future pesticide use and research as well as an outline of promising preventive/therapeutic approaches targeted on strengthening or restoring a healthy gut microbiome, closing with a summary of current gaps and future perspectives in the field.",Journal of Parkinson's disease,2023,Kristina Kulcsarova; Corinna Bang; Daniela Berg; Eva Schaeffer
37900921,"4-Ethylphenol-fluxes, metabolism and excretion of a gut microbiome derived neuromodulator implicated in autism.","Gut-microbiome-derived metabolites, such as 4-Ethylphenol [4EP], have been shown to modulate neurological health and function. Although the source of such metabolites is becoming better understood, knowledge gaps remain as to the mechanisms by which they enter host circulation, how they are transported in the body, how they are metabolised and excreted, and the way they exert their effects. High blood concentrations of host-modified 4EP, 4-ethylphenol sulfate [4EPS], are associated with an anxiety phenotype in autistic individuals. We have reviewed the existing literature and discuss mechanisms that are proposed to contribute influx from the gut microbiome, metabolism, and excretion of 4EP. We note that increased intestinal permeability is common in autistic individuals, potentially explaining increased flux of 4EP and/or 4EPS across the gut epithelium and the Blood Brain Barrier [BBB]. Similarly, kidney dysfunction, another complication observed in autistic individuals, impacts clearance of 4EP and its derivatives from circulation. Evidence indicates that accumulation of 4EPS in the brain of mice affects connectivity between subregions, particularly those linked to anxiety. However, we found no data on the presence or quantity of 4EP and/or 4EPS in human brains, irrespective of neurological status, likely due to challenges sampling this organ. We argue that the penetrative ability of 4EP is dependent on its form at the BBB and its physicochemical similarity to endogenous metabolites with dedicated active transport mechanisms across the BBB. We conclude that future research should focus on physical (e.g., ingestion of sorbents) or metabolic mechanisms (e.g., conversion to 4EP-glucuronide) that are capable of being used as interventions to reduce the flux of 4EP from the gut into the body, increase the efflux of 4EP and/or 4EPS from the brain, or increase excretion from the kidneys as a means of addressing the neurological impacts of 4EP.",Frontiers in molecular biosciences,2023,Francesca Day; Justin O'Sullivan; Chris Pook
37841274,"Melanin: a unifying theory of disease as exemplified by Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Lewy body dementia.","Melanin, a ubiquitous dark pigment, plays important roles in the immune system, including scavenging reactive oxygen species formed in response to ultraviolet radiation absorption, absorbing metals, thermal regulation, drug uptake, innate immune system functions, redox, and energy transduction. Many tissue types, including brain, heart, arteries, ovaries, and others, contain melanin. Almost all cells contain precursors to melanin. A growing number of diseases in which there is a loss of melanin and/or neuromelanin are increasingly thought to have infectious etiologies, for example, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Lewy Body Dementia (LBD), and vitiligo. AD, PD, LBD, and vitiligo have been linked with herpesvirus, which enters melanosomes and causes apoptosis, and with gut dysbiosis and inflammation. Herpesvirus is also linked with gut dysbiosis and inflammation. We theorize that under normal healthy states, melanin retains some of the energy it absorbs from electromagnetic radiation, which is then used to fuel cells, and energy from ATP is used to compliment that energy supply. We further theorize that loss of melanin reduces the energy supply of cells, which in the case of AD, PD, and LBD results in an inability to sustain immune system defenses and remove the plaques associated with the disease, which appear to be part of the immune system's attempt to eradicate the pathogens seen in these neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, in an attempt to explain why removing these plaques does not result in improvements in cognition and mood and why cognitions and moods in these individuals have ebbs and flows, we postulate that it is not the plaques that cause the cognitive symptoms but, rather, inflammation in the brain resulting from the immune system's response to pathogens. Our theory that energy retained in melanin fuels cells in an inverse relationship with ATP is supported by studies showing alterations in ATP production in relationship to melanin levels in melanomas, vitiligo, and healthy cells. Therefore, alteration of melanin levels may be at the core of many diseases. We propose regulating melanin levels may offer new avenues for treatment development.",Frontiers in immunology,2023,Stacie Z Berg; Jonathan Berg
37834373,Impact of Microbiome-Brain Communication on Neuroinflammation and Neurodegeneration.,"The gut microbiome plays a pivotal role in maintaining human health, with numerous studies demonstrating that alterations in microbial compositions can significantly affect the development and progression of various immune-mediated diseases affecting both the digestive tract and the central nervous system (CNS). This complex interplay between the microbiota, the gut, and the CNS is referred to as the gut-brain axis. The role of the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases has gained increasing attention in recent years, and evidence suggests that gut dysbiosis may contribute to disease development and progression. Clinical studies have shown alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota in multiple sclerosis patients, with a decrease in beneficial bacteria and an increase in pro-inflammatory bacteria. Furthermore, changes within the microbial community have been linked to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Microbiota-gut-brain communication can impact neurodegenerative diseases through various mechanisms, including the regulation of immune function, the production of microbial metabolites, as well as modulation of host-derived soluble factors. This review describes the current literature on the gut-brain axis and highlights novel communication systems that allow cross-talk between the gut microbiota and the host that might influence the pathogenesis of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.",International journal of molecular sciences,2023,Iris Stolzer; Eveline Scherer; Patrick SÃ¼Ã; Veit Rothhammer; Beate Winner; Markus F Neurath; Claudia GÃ¼nther
37777156,Metaorganismal choline metabolism shapes olfactory perception.,"Microbes living in the intestine can regulate key signaling processes in the central nervous system that directly impact brain health. This gut-brain signaling axis is partially mediated by microbe-host-dependent immune regulation, gut-innervating neuronal communication, and endocrine-like small molecule metabolites that originate from bacteria to ultimately cross the blood-brain barrier. Given the mounting evidence of gut-brain crosstalk, a new therapeutic approach of ""psychobiotics"" has emerged, whereby strategies designed to primarily modify the gut microbiome have been shown to improve mental health or slow neurodegenerative diseases. Diet is one of the most powerful determinants of gut microbiome community structure, and dietary habits are associated with brain health and disease. Recently, the metaorganismal (i.e., diet-microbe-host) trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) pathway has been linked to the development of several brain diseases including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and ischemic stroke. However, it is poorly understood how metaorganismal TMAO production influences brain function under normal physiological conditions. To address this, here we have reduced TMAO levels by inhibiting gut microbe-driven choline conversion to trimethylamine (TMA), and then performed comprehensive behavioral phenotyping in mice. Unexpectedly, we find that TMAO is particularly enriched in the murine olfactory bulb, and when TMAO production is blunted at the level of bacterial choline TMA lyase (CutC/D), olfactory perception is altered. Taken together, our studies demonstrate a previously underappreciated role for the TMAO pathway in olfactory-related behaviors.",The Journal of biological chemistry,2023,William J Massey; Kristen E Kay; Thomas C Jaramillo; Anthony J Horak; Shijie Cao; Lucas J Osborn; Rakhee Banerjee; Marko Mrdjen; Michael K Hamoudi; Daniel J Silver; Amy C Burrows; Amanda L Brown; Ofer Reizes; Justin D Lathia; Zeneng Wang; Stanley L Hazen; J Mark Brown
37771782,Oral [60]fullerene reduces neuroinflammation to alleviate Parkinson's disease via regulating gut microbiome.,"Neuroinflammation is considered to drive the pathogenic process of neuronal degeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, effective anti-neuroinflammation therapeutics for PD still remain dissatisfactory. Here we explore a robust therapeutic strategy for PD using anti-neuroinflammatory fullerenes. <b>Methods:</b> Oral fullerene was prepared by a ball-milling method. 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse model was used to investigate the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of it. The gut microenvironment was evaluated by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR), and western blot (WB). The neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration were evaluated by pathological analysis, Elisa kits, transmission electron microscopy, Q-PCR, WB and so on. Toxicity was assessed by weight, blood test and hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. <b>Results:</b> Oral fullerene therapeutic system that dissolved [60]fullerene into olive oil (abbreviated as OFO) was dexterously designed, which could reduce neuroinflammation via regulating the diversity of gut microbiome, increasing the contents of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and recovering the integrity of gut barrier. Accordingly, the reduction of neuroinflammation prevented dopaminergic neuronal degeneration. And thus, OFO significantly ameliorated motor deficits and fundamentally reversed dopamine (DA) loss in MPTP-induced PD mice. Of note, OFO exhibited low toxicity towards the living body. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our findings suggest that OFO is a safe-to-use, easy-to-apply, and prospective candidate for PD treatment in clinic, opening a therapeutic window for neuroinflammation-triggered neurodegeneration.",Theranostics,2023,Xue Li; Ruijun Deng; Jie Li; Hui Li; Zhe Xu; Lei Zhang; Linyin Feng; Chunying Shu; Mingming Zhen; Chunru Wang
37764277,Therapeutic Effects of Baicalin on Diseases Related to Gut-Brain Axis Dysfunctions.,"The gut-brain axis is an active area of research. Several representative diseases, including central nervous system disorders (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and depression), metabolic disorders (obesity-related diseases), and intestinal disorders (inflammatory bowel disease and dysbiosis), are associated with the dysfunctional gut-brain axis. Baicalin, a bioactive flavonoid extracted from <i>Scutellaria baicalensis</i>, is reported to exert various pharmacological effects. This narrative review summarizes the molecular mechanisms and potential targets of baicalin in disorders of the gut-brain axis. Baicalin protects the central nervous system through anti-neuroinflammatory and anti-neuronal apoptotic effects, suppresses obesity through anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, and alleviates intestinal disorders through regulatory effects on intestinal microorganisms and short-chain fatty acid production. The bioactivities of baicalin are mediated through the gut-brain axis. This review comprehensively summarizes the regulatory role of baicalin in gut-brain axis disorders, laying a foundation for future research, although further confirmatory basic research is required.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,Qichao Hu; Shuyu Hou; Baoyi Xiong; Yueqiang Wen; Jundong Wang; Jinhao Zeng; Xiao Ma; Fang Wang

Cognitive decline is a prominent feature of aging, with implications for different neurodegenerative disorders. The gut microbiome has gained attention for its potential impact on health and disease, including cognitive function. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the relationship between the gut microbiome and cognitive function in the context of aging. Following PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive search strategy was employed in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Studies exploring the role of the microbiome in cognition and neurodegenerative disorders, published between 2013 and 2023, were included. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed. Quantitative synthesis using statistical analyses was performed to examine microbial diversity and relative abundance in various cognitive conditions. Sixteen studies involving a total of 1303 participants were included in the analysis. The gut microbiota's relative abundance was different in individuals with cognitive impairments such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and dementia, compared to the healthy controls. The most prevalent phyla affected were Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria. Meta-analyses indicated substantial heterogeneity among studies focusing on Alzheimer's disease. The overall quality of evidence related to microbial analysis was moderate. The gut microbiome's role in cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disorders warrants investigation. Altered microbial abundance, particularly in specific phyla, is associated with cognitive impairments.

37690584,An updated overview on the relationship between human gut microbiome dysbiosis and psychiatric and psychological disorders.,"There is a lot of evidence establishing that nervous system development is related to the composition and functions of the gut microbiome. In addition, the central nervous system (CNS) controls the imbalance of the intestinal microbiota, constituting a bidirectional communication system. At present, various gut-brain crosstalk routes have been described, including immune, endocrine and neural circuits via the vagal pathway. Several empirical data have associated gut microbiota alterations (dysbiosis) with neuropsychiatric diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, autism and Parkinson's disease, and with other psychological disorders, like anxiety and depression. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) therapy has shown that the gut microbiota can transfer behavioral features to recipient animals, which provides strong evidence to establish a causal-effect relationship. Interventions, based on prebiotics, probiotics or synbiotics, have demonstrated an important influence of microbiota on neurological disorders by the synthesis of neuroactive compounds that interact with the nervous system and by the regulation of inflammatory and endocrine processes.

Many PD risk factors are known, but those affecting disease progression are not. Lifestyle and microbial dysbiosis are candidates in this context. Diet-driven gut dysbiosis and reduced barrier function may increase exposure of enteric neurons to toxins.

We analyze the gut microbiome, motor behavior, and gastrointestinal and brain pathologies. We find that diet and bacterial curli alter the microbiome and exacerbate motor performance, as well as intestinal and brain pathologies, but to different extents.

The gut microbiome communicates with the central nervous system via the gut-brain axis and affects behavioral and cognitive phenotypes. Dysbiosis (a dysfunctional microbiome) drives increased intestinal permeability and inflammation that can negatively affect the brain via the gut-brain axis. Healthier metabolic and lipid profiles and cognitive phenotypes are observed in individuals with more distinct microbiomes. In this review, we discuss the role of the gut microbiome and gut-brain axis in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease and related animal models, in cancer and cancer treatments, and in metabolic syndrome. We also discuss strategies to improve the gut microbiome and ultimately brain function. Because healthier cognitive phenotypes are observed in individuals with more distinct microbiomes, increased efforts are warranted to develop therapeutic strategies for those at increased risk of developing neurological disorders and patients diagnosed with those disorders.",Seminars in neurology,2023,Jacob Raber; Thomas J Sharpton

37571393,Underlying Mechanisms of Brain Aging and Neurodegenerative Diseases as Potential Targets for Preventive or Therapeutic Strategies Using Phytochemicals.,"During aging, several tissues and biological systems undergo a progressive decline in function, leading to age-associated diseases such as neurodegenerative, inflammatory, metabolic, and cardiovascular diseases and cancer. In this review, we focus on the molecular underpinning of senescence and neurodegeneration related to age-associated brain diseases, in particular, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, along with introducing nutrients or phytochemicals that modulate age-associated molecular dysfunctions, potentially offering preventive or therapeutic benefits. Based on current knowledge, the dysregulation of microglia genes and neuroinflammation, telomere attrition, neuronal stem cell degradation, vascular system dysfunction, reactive oxygen species, loss of chromosome X inactivation in females, and gut microbiome dysbiosis have been seen to play pivotal roles in neurodegeneration in an interactive manner. There are several phytochemicals (e.g., curcumin, EGCG, fucoidan, galangin, astin C, apigenin, resveratrol, phytic acid, acacetin, daucosterol, silibinin, sulforaphane, withaferin A, and betulinic acid) that modulate the dysfunction of one or several key genes (e.g., TREM2, C3, C3aR1, TNFA, NF-kb, TGFB1&2, SIRT1&6, HMGB1, and STING) affected in the aged brain. Although phytochemicals have shown promise in slowing down the progression of age-related brain diseases, more studies to identify their efficacy, alone or in combinations, in preclinical systems can help to design novel nutritional strategies for the management of neurodegenerative diseases in humans.",Nutrients,2023,Hamid Mostafavi Abdolmaleky; Jin-Rong Zhou
37481569,Study of the gut microbiome in Egyptian patients with Parkinson's Disease.,"Recently, an important relationship between Parkinson's disease and the gut microbiota, through the brain-gut axis interactions, has been established. Previous studies have declared that alterations in the gut microbiota have a great impact on the pathogenesis and clinical picture of Parkinson's disease (PD). The present study aimed to identify the gut microbiome that is likely related to Parkinson's disease as well as their possible relation to clinical phenotypes.Thirty patients with Parkinson's disease, who presented to the Parkinson's disease Neurology Clinic of Alexandria University Hospital were enrolled in our study. A cross-matching control group of 35 healthy subjects of similar age and sex were included. Stool specimens were taken from each. Quantitative SYBR Green Real-Time PCR was done for the identification and quantitation of selected bacterial phyla, genera and/or species.There was a significant increase in Bacteroides and a significant decrease of Firmicutes and Firmicutes / Bacteroidetes ratio and Bifidobacteria in PD patients. Although Prevotella was decreased among PD patients relative to the healthy control, the difference was not statistically significant. Comparing the PD clinical phenotypes with the control group, the Mixed phenotype had significantly higher Bacteroides, Tremors predominant had lower Firmicutes and Firmicutes / Bacteroidetes ratio, and both tremors and postural instability and gait disability (PIGD) phenotypes had lower Bifidobacteria. However, there was no statistically significant difference between these phenotypes. Furthermore, when comparing tremors and non-tremors predominant phenotypes; Lactobacilli showed a significant decrease in non-tremors predominant phenotypes.The current study showed evidence of changes in the gut microbiome of Parkinson's disease patients compared to the healthy controls. These observations may highlight the importance of the identification of microbiome and specific bacterial changes that can be targeted for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.",BMC microbiology,2023,Mohammad Mehanna; Suzan AbuRaya; Shwikar Mahmoud Ahmed; Ghada Ashmawy; Ahmed Ibrahim; Essameldin AbdelKhaliq
37449597,"Gut-microbiome-brain axis: the crosstalk between the vagus nerve, alpha-synuclein and the brain in Parkinson's disease.","This critical review of the literature shows that there is a close link between the microbiome, the gut, and the brain in Parkinson's disease. The vagus nerve, the main component of the parasympathetic nervous system, is involved in the regulation of immune response, digestion, heart rate, and control of mood. It can detect microbiota metabolites through its afferents, transferring this gut information to the central nervous system. Preclinical and clinical studies have shown the important role played by the gut microbiome and gut-related factors in disease development and progression, as well as treatment responses. These findings suggest that the gut microbiome may be a valuable target for new therapeutic strategies for Parkinson's disease. More studies are needed to better understand the underlying biology and how this axis can be modulated for the patient's benefit.",Neural regeneration research,2023,JÃºlio CÃ©sar Claudino Dos Santos; Leandro Freitas Oliveira; Felipe Micelli Noleto; Camilla Teixeira Pinheiro GusmÃ£o; Gerly Anne de Castro Brito; Glauce Socorro de Barros Viana
37403161,Overexpression of human alpha-Synuclein leads to dysregulated microbiome/metabolites with ageing in a rat model of Parkinson disease.,"Braak's hypothesis states that sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD) follows a specific progression of pathology from the peripheral to the central nervous system, and this progression can be monitored by detecting theÂ accumulation of alpha-Synuclein (Î±-Syn) protein. Consequently, there isÂ growing interest in understanding how the gut (commensal) microbiome can regulate Î±-Syn accumulation, as this could potentially lead to PD.We used 16S rRNA and shotgun sequencing to characterise microbial diversity. <sup>1</sup>H-NMR was employed to understand the metaboliteÂ production and intestinal inflammation estimated using ELISA and RNA-sequencing from feces and theÂ intestinal epithelial layer respectively. TheÂ Na<sup>+</sup> channel current and gut permeability were measured using anÂ Ussing chamber. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence imaging were applied to detect theÂ Î±-Syn protein. LC-MS/MS was used for characterization of proteins from metabolite treated neuronal cells. Finally, Metascape and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) bioinformatics tools were used for identification of dysregulated pathways.We studied a transgenic (TG) rat model overexpressing the human SNCA gene and found that a progressive gut microbial composition alteration characterized by the reduction of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio could be detected in the young TG rats. Interestingly, this ratio then increased with ageing. TheÂ dynamics of Lactobacillus and Alistipes were monitored and reduced Lactobacillus and increased Alistipes abundance was discerned in ageing TG rats. Additionally, the SNCA gene overexpression resulted in gut Î±-Syn protein expression and increased with advanced age. Further, older TG animals had increased intestinal inflammation, decreased Na<sup>+</sup> current and a robust alteration in metabolite production characterized by the increase of succinate levels in feces and serum. Manipulation of the gut bacteria by short-term antibiotic cocktailÂ treatment revealed a complete loss of short-chain fatty acids and aÂ reduction in succinate levels. Although antibioticÂ cocktail treatment did not change Î±-Syn expression in the enteric nervous system of the colon, however, reduced Î±-Syn expression was detected in the olfactory bulbs (forebrain) of the TG rats.Our data emphasize that the gut microbiome dysbiosis synchronous with ageing leads to a specific alteration of gut metabolites and can be modulated by antibiotics which may affect PD pathology.",Molecular neurodegeneration,2023,Yogesh Singh; Christoph Trautwein; Joan Romani; Madhuri S Salker; Peter H Neckel; Isabel Fraccaroli; Mahkameh Abeditashi; Nils Woerner; Jakob Admard; Achal Dhariwal; Morten K D Dueholm; Karl-Herbert SchÃ¤fer; Florian Lang; Daniel E Otzen; Hilal A Lashuel; Olaf Riess; Nicolas Casadei
37375679,"New Pieces for an Old Puzzle: Approaching Parkinson's Disease from Translatable Animal Models, Gut Microbiota Modulation, and Lipidomics.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is a severe neurodegenerative disease characterized by disabling motor alterations that are diagnosed at a relatively late stage in its development, and non-motor symptoms, including those affecting the gastrointestinal tract (mainly constipation), which start much earlier than the motor symptoms. Remarkably, current treatments only reduce motor symptoms, not without important drawbacks (relatively low efficiency and impactful side effects). Thus, new approaches are needed to halt PD progression and, possibly, to prevent its development, including new therapeutic strategies that target PD etiopathogeny and new biomarkers. Our aim was to review some of these new approaches. Although PD is complex and heterogeneous, compelling evidence suggests it might have a gastrointestinal origin, at least in a significant number of patients, and findings in recently developed animal models strongly support this hypothesis. Furthermore, the modulation of the gut microbiome, mainly through probiotics, is being tested to improve motor and non-motor symptoms and even to prevent PD. Finally, lipidomics has emerged as a useful tool to identify lipid biomarkers that may help analyze PD progression and treatment efficacy in a personalized manner, although, as of today, it has only scarcely been applied to monitor gut motility, dysbiosis, and probiotic effects in PD. Altogether, these new pieces should be helpful in solving the old puzzle of PD.",Nutrients,2023,Lorena Ortega Moreno; Ana Bagues; Vicente MartÃ­nez; Raquel Abalo
37375029,Therapeutic Prospect of New Probiotics in Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Increasing clinical and preclinical evidence implicates gut microbiome (GM) dysbiosis as a key susceptibility factor for neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). In recent years, neurodegenerative diseases have been viewed as being driven not solely by defects in the brain, and the role of GM in modulating central nervous system function via the gut-brain axis has attracted considerable interest. Encouraged by current GM research, the development of new probiotics may lead to tangible impacts on the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. This review summarizes current understandings of GM composition and characteristics associated with neurodegenerative diseases and research demonstrations of key molecules from the GM that affect neurodegeneration. Furthermore, applications of new probiotics, such as <i>Clostridium butyricum</i>, <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i>, <i>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</i>, and <i>Bacteroides fragilis</i>, for the remediation of neurodegenerative diseases are discussed.",Microorganisms,2023,Mingxia Bi; Chang Liu; Yulin Wang; Shuang-Jiang Liu
37374992,Gut Microbiome Transplants and Their Health Impacts across Species.,"The human gut, required for ingesting and processing food, extracting nutrients, and excreting waste, is made up of not just human tissue but also trillions of microbes that are responsible for many health-promoting functions. However, this gut microbiome is also associated with multiple diseases and negative health outcomes, many of which do not have a cure or treatment. One potential mechanism to alleviate these negative health effects caused by the microbiome is the use of microbiome transplants. Here, we briefly review the gut's functional relationships in laboratory model systems and humans, with a focus on the different diseases they directly affect. We then provide an overview of the history of microbiome transplants and their use in multiple diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, as well as <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> infections, and irritable bowel syndrome. We finally provide insights into areas of research in which microbiome transplant research is lacking, but that simultaneously may provide significant health improvements, including age-related neurodegenerative diseases.",Microorganisms,2023,Benjamin H Levine; Jessica M Hoffman
37368331,Gut Microbiota and Its Repercussion in Parkinson's Disease: A Systematic Review in Occidental Patients.,"(1) Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a relatively common and complex pathology, and some of its mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Change in host microbiota is related to the pathophysiology of numerous diseases. This systematic review aims to gather existing data on the occidental hemisphere, compare it, and search for any significant association between Parkinson's disease and gut microbiota dysbiosis. (2) Methods: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) and Meta-analyses Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) protocols were used for this systematic review. PubMed was used as the database search engine. Of the 166 studies found, only 10 were used, as they met our inclusion criteria: case-control studies, studies that assessed the correlation of PD and gut microbiome, studies that took place in occidental regions, and studies that were performed on humans and were written in English. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used as the assessment tool for overall risk of bias in this systematic review. (3) Results: The studies analyzed were divided into three geographic areas: Region 1: United States of America and Canada; Region 2: Germany, Ireland, and Finland; and Region 3: Italy; based on geographical similarities among these populations. The following statistically significant results were described in PD patients, compared with non-PD controls. In the first region, a significant increase in the following bacteria was seen: 1. Phylum: Actinobacteriota and its Genus: <i>Bifidobacterium</i>; 2. Phylum: Verrucomicrobiota and its Genus: <i>Akkermansia</i>; 3. Genus: <i>Enterococcus</i>, <i>Hungatella</i>, <i>Lactobacillus</i>, and <i>Oscillospira</i> of the Phylum: Firmicutes; 4. Family: <i>Ruminococcaceae</i> of Phylum: Firmicutes; 5. Phylum: Bacteroidetes and its Genus: <i>Bacteroides</i>; 6. Phylum: Proteobacteria. A significant decrease was described in the Family: <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> and its Genus: <i>Blautia</i>, <i>Coprococcus</i>, and <i>Roseburia</i>, which belong to the Phylum: Firmicutes. In the second region, a raised number of: 1. Phylum: Verrucomicrobiota, its Genus: <i>Akkermansia</i>, and its Species: <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i>; 2. Family: <i>Verrucomicrobiaceae</i> of the Phylum: Verrucomicrobiota; 3. Genus: <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Roseburia</i> of the Phylum: Firmicutes; 4. Family: <i>Lactobacillaceae</i> of the Phylum: Firmicutes; 5. Family: <i>Barnesiellaceae</i> of the Phylum: Bacteroidetes; 6. Genus: <i>Bifidobacterium</i> of the Phylum: Actinobacteriota; 7. Species: <i>Bilophila wadsworthia</i> of the Phylum: Thermodesulfobacteriota, was identified. Only one Genus: <i>Prevotella</i> of the Phylum: Bacteroidetes was decreased. In the third and last region, an augmented number of these bacteria were found: 1. Phylum: Verrucomicrobiota and its Genus: <i>Akkermansia</i>; 2. Family: <i>Bifidobacteriaceae</i> and <i>Coriobacteriaceae</i> of the Phylum: Actinobacteriota; 3. Phylum: Firmicutes and its Family: <i>Christensenellaceae</i> and <i>Lactobacillaceae</i>; 4. Family: <i>Enterococcaceae</i> and its Genus: <i>Enterococcus</i>, of the Phylum: Firmicutes; 5. Genus: <i>Lactococcus</i> and <i>Oscillospira</i>, of the Phylum: Firmicutes; 6. Phylum: Proteobacteria, its Family: <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i>, and the Genus: <i>Citrobacter</i>, <i>Klebsiella</i>, <i>Salmonella</i>, and <i>Shigella</i>; 7. Genus: <i>ParaBacteroides</i> of the Phylum: Bacteroidetes. In contrast, a significant decrease in 1. Phylum: Firmicutes, its Family: <i>Lachnospiraceae</i>, and its Genus: <i>Roseburia</i> and 2. Genus: <i>Ruminococcus</i> of the Phylum: Firmicutes, was described. (4) Conclusion: A significant gut dysbiosis, involving multiple bacterial taxa, was found in PD patients compared to healthy people in the occidental regions. However, more studies are needed to find the precise pathophysiologic involvement of other groups of pathogens, such as fungi and parasites, in the development and progression of PD.",Neurology international,2023,Ana Cristina Proano; Javier A Viteri; Eileen N Orozco; Marco Antonio Calle; Stefany Carolina Costa; Daniel V Reyes; Melissa German-Montenegro; David F Moncayo; Andrea C Tobar; Juan A Moncayo
37340511,Parkinson's disease: Are gut microbes involved?,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects more than 10 million individuals worldwide. It is characterized by motor and sensory deficits. Research studies have increasingly demonstrated a correlation between Parkinson's disease and alternations in the composition of the gut microbiota in affected patients. Also, the significant role of prebiotics and probiotics in gastrointestinal and neurological conditions is imperative to understand their relation to Parkinson's disease.To explore the scientific interaction of the gut-microbiota-brain axis and its association with Parkinson's disease, a comprehensive narrative review of the relevant literature was conducted. Articles were retrieved systematically from reputable sources, including PubMed, Science Direct, World Health Organization (WHO), and Advanced Google Scholar. Key search terms included are ""Parkinson's Disease"", ""Gut Microbiome"", ""Braak's Theory"", ""Neurological Disorders"", and ""Gut-brain axis"". Articles included in our review are published in English and they provide detailed information on the relationship between Parkinson's disease and gut microbiota RESULTS: This review highlights the impact of gut microbiota composition and associated factors on the progression of Parkinson's disease. Evidence-based studies highlighting the existing evidence of the relationship between Parkinson's disease and alteration in gut microbiota are discussed. Consequently, the potential mechanisms by which the gut microbiota may affect the composition of the gut microbiota were revealed, with a particular emphasis on the role of the gut-brain axis in this interplay.Understanding the complex interplay between gut microbiota and Parkinson's disease is a potential implication for the development of novel therapeutics against Parkinson's disease. Following the existing relationship demonstrated by different evidence-based studies on Parkinson's disease and gut microbiota, our review concludes by providing recommendations and suggestions for future research studies with a particular emphasis on the impact of the microbiota-brain axis on Parkinson's disease.",Brain and behavior,2023,Abass Olawale Omotosho; Yusuf Amuda Tajudeen; Habeebullah Jayeola Oladipo; Sodiq Inaolaji Yusuff; Muritala AbdulKadir; Abdulbasit Opeyemi Muili; Oluwaseyi Muyiwa Egbewande; Rashidat Onyinoyi Yusuf; Zaccheaus Oluwaseun Faniran; Abdullateef Opeyemi Afolabi; Mona Said El-Sherbini
37323145,Therapies for Parkinson's disease and the gut microbiome: evidence for bidirectional connection.,"The gut brain axis (GBA), a bidirectional communication pathway has often been linked to health and disease, and gut microbiota (GM), a key component of this pathway shown to be altered in Parkinson's disease (PD), are suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis of PD. There are few studies that report the impact of oral medication therapy on GM, however, there are even fewer studies that discuss the impact of other treatments such as device assisted therapies (DAT) including deep brain stimulation (DBS), levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel infusion (LCIG) and photobiomodulation (PBM) and how these might impact GM. Here, we review the literature and summarize findings of the potential contributions of GM to the heterogenous clinical response to pharmaceutical therapies among individuals with PD. We also discuss the potential interactions between the GM and DATs such as DBS and LCIG and present evidence for alterations in GM in response to DATs. Given the complexity and highly individual nature of the GM of patients with PD and the potential influence that other external factors such as diet, lifestyle, medications, stage of the disease and other comorbidities, further investigations into the response of GM to therapies are worthy of future study in prospective, controlled trials as well as medication naÃ¯ve individuals. Such detailed studies will help us further comprehend the relationship between GM in PD patients, and will help investigate the potential of targeting GM associated changes as a treatment avenue for PD.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2023,Grace Hey; Navya Nair; Emily Klann; Anjela Gurrala; Delaram Safarpour; Volker Mai; Adolfo Ramirez-Zamora; Vinata Vedam-Mai
37305758,The role of the microbiota-gut-brain axis and intestinal microbiome dysregulation in Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex progressive neurodegenerative disease associated with aging. Its main pathological feature is the degeneration and loss of dopaminergic neurons related to the misfolding and aggregation of Î±-synuclein. The pathogenesis of PD has not yet been fully elucidated, and its occurrence and development process are closely related to the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Dysregulation of intestinal microbiota may promote the damage of the intestinal epithelial barrier, intestinal inflammation, and the upward diffusion of phosphorylated Î±-synuclein from the enteric nervous system (ENS) to the brain in susceptible individuals and further lead to gastrointestinal dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration of the central nervous system (CNS) through the disordered microbiota-gut-brain axis. The present review aimed to summarize recent advancements in studies focusing on the role of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in the pathogenesis of PD, especially the mechanism of intestinal microbiome dysregulation, intestinal inflammation, and gastrointestinal dysfunction in PD. Maintaining or restoring homeostasis in the gut microenvironment by targeting the gut microbiome may provide future direction for the development of new biomarkers for early diagnosis of PD and therapeutic strategies to slow disease progression.",Frontiers in neurology,2023,Qing Li; Ling-Bing Meng; Li-Jun Chen; Xia Shi; Ling Tu; Qi Zhou; Jin-Long Yu; Xin Liao; Yuan Zeng; Qiao-Ying Yuan
37298527,Neurodegenerative and Neurodevelopmental Diseases and the Gut-Brain Axis: The Potential of Therapeutic Targeting of the Microbiome.,"The human gut microbiome contains the largest number of bacteria in the body and has the potential to greatly influence metabolism, not only locally but also systemically. There is an established link between a healthy, balanced, and diverse microbiome and overall health. When the gut microbiome becomes unbalanced (dysbiosis) through dietary changes, medication use, lifestyle choices, environmental factors, and ageing, this has a profound effect on our health and is linked to many diseases, including lifestyle diseases, metabolic diseases, inflammatory diseases, and neurological diseases. While this link in humans is largely an association of dysbiosis with disease, in animal models, a causative link can be demonstrated. The link between the gut and the brain is particularly important in maintaining brain health, with a strong association between dysbiosis in the gut and neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases. This link suggests not only that the gut microbiota composition can be used to make an early diagnosis of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases but also that modifying the gut microbiome to influence the microbiome-gut-brain axis might present a therapeutic target for diseases that have proved intractable, with the aim of altering the trajectory of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, autism spectrum disorder, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, among others. There is also a microbiome-gut-brain link to other potentially reversible neurological diseases, such as migraine, post-operative cognitive dysfunction, and long COVID, which might be considered models of therapy for neurodegenerative disease. The role of traditional methods in altering the microbiome, as well as newer, more novel treatments such as faecal microbiome transplants and photobiomodulation, are discussed.",International journal of molecular sciences,2023,Brian Bicknell; Ann Liebert; Thomas Borody; Geoffrey Herkes; Craig McLachlan; Hosen Kiat
37239020,The Impact of microRNAs on Mitochondrial Function and Immunity: Relevance to Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's Disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, is characterised by the severe loss of dopaminergic neurons in the Substantia Nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and by the presence of Lewy bodies. PD is diagnosed upon the onset of motor symptoms, such as bradykinesia, resting tremor, rigidity, and postural instability. It is currently accepted that motor symptoms are preceded by non-motor features, such as gastrointestinal dysfunction. In fact, it has been proposed that PD might start in the gut and spread to the central nervous system. Growing evidence reports that the gut microbiota, which has been found to be altered in PD patients, influences the function of the central and enteric nervous systems. Altered expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) in PD patients has also been reported, many of which regulate key pathological mechanisms involved in PD pathogenesis, such as mitochondrial dysfunction and immunity. It remains unknown how gut microbiota regulates brain function; however, miRNAs have been highlighted as important players. Remarkably, numerous studies have depicted the ability of miRNAs to modulate and be regulated by the host's gut microbiota. In this review, we summarize the experimental and clinical studies implicating mitochondrial dysfunction and immunity in PD. Moreover, we gather recent data on miRNA involvement in these two processes. Ultimately, we discuss the reciprocal crosstalk between gut microbiota and miRNAs. Studying the bidirectional interaction of gut microbiome-miRNA might elucidate the aetiology and pathogenesis of gut-first PD, which could lead to the application of miRNAs as potential biomarkers or therapeutical targets for PD.",Biomedicines,2023,Beatriz F S Guedes; Sandra Morais Cardoso; Ana Raquel Esteves
37237983,Escalating Bi-Directional Feedback Loops between Proinflammatory Microglia and Mitochondria in Ageing and Post-Diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive age-related neurodegenerative disease affecting up to 3% of the global population over 65 years of age. Currently, the underlying physiological aetiology of PD is unknown. However, the diagnosed disorder shares many common non-motor symptoms associated with ageing-related neurodegenerative disease progression, such as neuroinflammation, microglial activation, neuronal mitochondrial impairment, and chronic autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Clinical PD has been linked to many interrelated biological and molecular processes, such as escalating proinflammatory immune responses, mitochondrial impairment, lower adenosine triphosphate (ATP) availability, increasing release of neurotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS), impaired blood brain barrier integrity, chronic activation of microglia, and damage to dopaminergic neurons consistently associated with motor and cognitive decline. Prodromal PD has also been associated with orthostatic hypotension and many other age-related impairments, such as sleep disruption, impaired gut microbiome, and constipation. Thus, this review aimed to present evidence linking mitochondrial dysfunction, including elevated oxidative stress, ROS, and impaired cellular energy production, with the overactivation and escalation of a microglial-mediated proinflammatory immune response as naturally occurring and damaging interlinked bidirectional and self-perpetuating cycles that share common pathological processes in ageing and PD. We propose that both chronic inflammation, microglial activation, and neuronal mitochondrial impairment should be considered as concurrently influencing each other along a continuum rather than as separate and isolated linear metabolic events that affect specific aspects of neural processing and brain function.","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,Shane Michael Ravenhill; Andrew Howard Evans; Sheila Gillard Crewther
37228957,The microbiota-gut-brain axis and three common neurological disorders: a mini-review.,"Neurological disorders are an important cause of disability and death globally. Recently, a large body of research shows that the gut microbiome affects the brain and its conditions, through the gut-brain axis. The purpose of this mini-review is to provide a brief overview of the relationship between the microbiota-gut-brain axis in three neurological disorders: epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, and migraine. The authors chose these three disorders because of their burdensome and great effect on health care. We live on a microbial planet. Before humans, microorganisms existed for a hundred million years. Today, there are trillions of these microbes living in our bodies, it is called human microbiota. These organisms have a crucial role in our homeostasis and survival. Most of the human microbiota live in the gut. The number of gut microbiota is much more than the number of body cells. Gut microbiota has been regarded as a crucial regulator of the gut-brain axis. The discovery of the microbiota-gut-brain axis is described as a major advancement in neuroscience because it influences the pathophysiology of several neurological and psychiatric disorders. From this, more studies of the microbiota-gut-brain axis are needed in the future, to provide a better understanding of brain disorders and so that better treatment and prognosis.",Annals of medicine and surgery (2012),2023,Amjad Mhanna; Zuheir Alshehabi
37212075,IgA-Biome Profiles Correlate with Clinical Parkinson's Disease Subtypes.,"Parkinson's disease is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder with distinctive gut microbiome patterns suggesting that interventions targeting the gut microbiota may prevent, slow, or reverse disease progression and severity.Because secretory IgA (SIgA) plays a key role in shaping the gut microbiota, characterization of the IgA-Biome of individuals classified into either the akinetic rigid (AR) or tremor dominant (TD) Parkinson's disease clinical subtypes was used to further define taxa unique to these distinct clinical phenotypes.Flow cytometry was used to separate IgA-coated and -uncoated bacteria from stool samples obtained from AR and TD patients followed by amplification and sequencing of the V4 region of the 16âS rDNA gene on the MiSeq platform (Illumina).IgA-Biome analyses identified significant alpha and beta diversity differences between the Parkinson's disease phenotypes and the Firmicutes/Bacteroides ratio was significantly higher in those with TD compared to those with AR. In addition, discriminant taxa analyses identified a more pro-inflammatory bacterial profile in the IgA+ fraction of those with the AR clinical subclass compared to IgA-Biome analyses of those with the TD subclass and with the taxa identified in the unsorted control samples.IgA-Biome analyses underscores the importance of the host immune response in shaping the gut microbiome potentially affecting disease progression and presentation. In the present study, IgA-Biome analyses identified a unique proinflammatory microbial signature in the IgA+ fraction of those with AR that would have otherwise been undetected using conventional microbiome analysis approaches.",Journal of Parkinson's disease,2023,Eric L Brown; Heather T Essigmann; Kristi L Hoffman; Ashley S Alexander; Michael Newmark; Zhi-Dong Jiang; Jessika Suescun; Mya C Schiess; Craig L Hanis; Herbert L DuPont
37207228,How Toll-like receptors influence Parkinson's disease in the microbiome-gut-brain axis.,"Recently, a large number of experimenters have found that the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease may be related to the gut microbiome and proposed the microbiome-gut-brain axis. Studies have shown that Toll-like receptors, especially Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), are key mediators of gut homeostasis. In addition to their established role in innate immunity throughout the body, research is increasingly showing that the Toll-like receptor 2 and Toll-like receptor 4 signaling pathways shape the development and function of the gut and enteric nervous system. Notably, Toll-like receptor 2 and Toll-like receptor 4 are dysregulated in Parkinson's disease patients and may therefore be identified as the core of early gut dysfunction in Parkinson's disease. To better understand the contribution of Toll-like receptor 2 and Toll-like receptor 4 dysfunction in the gut to early Î±-synuclein aggregation, we discussed the structural function of Toll-like receptor 2 and Toll-like receptor 4 and signal transduction of Toll-like receptor 2 and Toll-like receptor 4 in Parkinson's disease by reviewing clinical, animal models, and <i>in vitro</i> studies. We also present a conceptual model of the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease, in which microbial dysbiosis alters the gut barrier as well as the Toll-like receptor 2 and Toll-like receptor 4 signaling pathways, ultimately leading to a positive feedback loop for chronic gut dysfunction, promoting Î±-synuclein aggregation in the gut and vagus nerve.",Frontiers in immunology,2023,Ziyi Zhang; Zhihui Liu; Ao Lv; Chenhui Fan
37157885,The Endotoxin Hypothesis of Parkinson's Disease.,"The endotoxin hypothesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is the idea that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) endotoxins contribute to the pathogenesis of this disorder. LPS endotoxins are found in, and released from, the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, for example in the gut. It is proposed that gut dysfunction in early PD leads to elevated LPS levels in the gut wall and blood, which promotes both Î±-synuclein aggregation in the enteric neurons and a peripheral inflammatory response. Communication to the brain via circulating LPS and cytokines in the blood and/or the gut-brain axis leads to neuroinflammation and spreading of Î±-synuclein pathology, exacerbating neurodegeneration in brainstem nuclei and loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, and manifesting in the clinical symptoms of PD. The evidence supporting this hypothesis includes: (1) gut dysfunction, permeability, and bacterial changes occur early in PD, (2) serum levels of LPS are increased in a proportion of PD patients, (3) LPS induces Î±-synuclein expression, aggregation, and neurotoxicity, (4) LPS causes activation of peripheral monocytes leading to inflammatory cytokine production, and (5) blood LPS causes brain inflammation and specific loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons, mediated by microglia. If the hypothesis is correct, then treatment options might include: (1) changing the gut microbiome, (2) reducing gut permeability, (3) reducing circulating LPS levels, or (4) blocking the response of immune cells and microglia to LPS. However, the hypothesis has a number of limitations and requires further testing, in particular whether reducing LPS levels can reduce PD incidence, progression, or severity. Â© 2023 The Authors.

37130861,"Gut microbiome dysbiosis across early Parkinson's disease, REM sleep behavior disorder and their first-degree relatives.","The microbiota-gut-brain axis has been suggested to play an important role in Parkinson's disease (PD). Here we performed a cross-sectional study to profile gut microbiota across early PD, REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), first-degree relatives of RBD (RBD-FDR), and healthy controls, which could reflect the gut-brain staging model of PD. We show gut microbiota compositions are significantly altered in early PD and RBD compared with control and RBD-FDR. Depletion of butyrate-producing bacteria and enrichment of pro-inflammatory Collinsella have already emerged in RBD and RBD-FDR after controlling potential confounders including antidepressants, osmotic laxatives, and bowel movement frequency. Random forest modelling identifies 12 microbial markers that are effective to distinguish RBD from control. These findings suggest that PD-like gut dysbiosis occurs at the prodromal stages of PD when RBD develops and starts to emerge in the younger RBD-FDR subjects. The study will have etiological and diagnostic implications.",Nature communications,2023,Bei Huang; Steven W H Chau; Yaping Liu; Joey W Y Chan; Jing Wang; Suk Ling Ma; Jihui Zhang; Paul K S Chan; Yun Kit Yeoh; Zigui Chen; Li Zhou; Sunny Hei Wong; Vincent C T Mok; Ka Fai To; Hei Ming Lai; Simon Ng; Claudia Trenkwalder; Francis K L Chan; Yun Kwok Wing
37110302,Gut Dysbiosis: A Target for Protective Interventions against Parkinson's Disease.,"Sub-chronic inflammation, caused by age-related dysbiosis, primes the brain to neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative diseases. Evidence revealed that Parkinson's disease (PD) might originate in the gut, demonstrating gastro-intestinal disturbances, as reported by PD patients long before developing motor symptoms. In this study, we conducted comparative analyses in relatively young and old mice maintained in conventional or gnotobiotic conditions. We aimed to confirm that the effects induced by age-related dysbiosis, rather than aging itself, sensitize to PD onset. This hypothesis was confirmed in germ-free (GF) mice, which proved resistant to the pharmacological induction of PD, regardless of their age. Contrary to conventional animals, old GF mice did not develop an inflammatory phenotype or an accumulation of iron in the brain, two catalysts sensitizing to disease onset. The resistance of GF mice to PD is reverted when colonized with stool collected from conventional old animals, but not if receiving bacterial content from young mice. Hence, changes in gut microbiota composition are a risk factor for PD development and can be targeted preventively by iron chelators, shown to protect the brain from pro-inflammatory intestinal priming that sensitizes to neuroinflammation and the development of severe PD.",Microorganisms,2023,Illyane S Lima; Ana C PÃªgo; Ana C Martins; Ana R Prada; JoÃ£o TomÃ¡s Barros; Gracelino Martins; Raffaella Gozzelino
37065853,Getting closer to modeling the gut-brain axis using induced pluripotent stem cells.,"The gut microbiome (GM), the gut barrier, and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) are key elements of the gut-brain axis (GBA). The advances in organ-on-a-chip and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSCs) technology might enable more physiological gut-brain-axis-on-a-chip models. The ability to mimic complex physiological functions of the GBA is needed in basic mechanistic research as well as disease research of psychiatric, neurodevelopmental, functional, and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. These brain disorders have been associated with GM dysbiosis, which may affect the brain <i>via</i> the GBA. Although animal models have paved the way for the breakthroughs and progression in the understanding of the GBA, the fundamental questions of exactly when, how, and why still remain unanswered. The research of the complex GBA have relied on equally complex animal models, but today's ethical knowledge and responsibilities demand interdisciplinary development of non-animal models to study such systems. In this review we briefly describe the gut barrier and BBB, provide an overview of current cell models, and discuss the use of iPSCs in these GBA elements. We highlight the perspectives of producing GBA chips using iPSCs and the challenges that remain in the field.",Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,2023,Vanessa Hall; Katja Maria Sahlgren Bendtsen
36986165,The Role of Diet as a Modulator of the Inflammatory Process in the Neurological Diseases.,"Neurological diseases are recognized as major causes of disability and mortality worldwide. Due to the dynamic progress of diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's Disease (PD), Schizophrenia, Depression, and Multiple Sclerosis (MD), scientists are mobilized to look for new and more effective methods of interventions. A growing body of evidence suggests that inflammatory processes and an imbalance in the composition and function of the gut microbiome, which play a critical role in the pathogenesis of various neurological diseases and dietary interventions, such as the Mediterranean diet the DASH diet, or the ketogenic diet can have beneficial effects on their course. The aim of this review was to take a closer look at the role of diet and its ingredients in modulating inflammation associated with the development and/or progression of central nervous system diseases. Presented data shows that consuming a diet abundant in fruits, vegetables, nuts, herbs, spices, and legumes that are sources of anti-inflammatory elements such as omega-3 fatty acids, polyphenols, vitamins, essential minerals, and probiotics while avoiding foods that promote inflammation, create a positive brain environment and is associated with a reduced risk of neurological diseases.

36984872,A Comprehensive NMR Analysis of Serum and Fecal Metabolites in Familial Dysautonomia Patients Reveals Significant Metabolic Perturbations.,"Central metabolism has a profound impact on the clinical phenotypes and penetrance of neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's (PD) diseases, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). In contrast to the multifactorial origin of these neurological diseases, neurodevelopmental impairment and neurodegeneration in Familial Dysautonomia (FD) results from a single point mutation in the <i>ELP1</i> gene. FD patients represent a well-defined population who can help us better understand the cellular networks underlying neurodegeneration, and how disease traits are affected by metabolic dysfunction, which in turn may contribute to dysregulation of the gut-brain axis of FD. Here, <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectroscopy was employed to characterize the serum and fecal metabolomes of FD patients, and to assess similarities and differences in the polar metabolite profiles between FD patients and healthy relative controls. Findings from this work revealed noteworthy metabolic alterations reflected in energy (ATP) production, mitochondrial function, amino acid and nucleotide catabolism, neurosignaling molecules, and gut-microbial metabolism. These results provide further evidence for a close interconnection between metabolism, neurodegeneration, and gut microbiome dysbiosis in FD, and create an opportunity to explore whether metabolic interventions targeting the gut-brain-metabolism axis of FD could be used to redress or slow down the progressive neurodegeneration observed in FD patients.",Metabolites,2023,Stephanann M Costello; Alexandra M Cheney; Annie Waldum; Brian Tripet; Maria Cotrina-Vidal; Horacio Kaufmann; Lucy Norcliffe-Kaufmann; Frances Lefcort; ValÃ©rie CopiÃ©
36984505,Controlling the Impact of <i>Helicobacter pylori</i>-Related Hyperhomocysteinemia on Neurodegeneration.,"<i>Helicobacter pylori</i> infection consists a high global burden affecting more than 50% of the world's population. It is implicated, beyond substantiated local gastric pathologies, i.e., peptic ulcers and gastric cancer, in the pathophysiology of several neurodegenerative disorders, mainly by inducing hyperhomocysteinemia-related brain cortical thinning (BCT). BCT has been advocated as a possible biomarker associated with neurodegenerative central nervous system disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and/or glaucoma, termed as ""ocular Alzheimer's disease"". According to the infection hypothesis in relation to neurodegeneration, <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> as non-commensal gut microbiome has been advocated as trigger and/or mediator of neurodegenerative diseases, such as the development of Alzheimer's disease. Among others, <i>Helicobacter pylori</i>-related inflammatory mediators, defensins, autophagy, vitamin D, dietary factors, role of probiotics, and some pathogenetic considerations including relevant involved genes are discussed within this opinion article. In conclusion, by controlling the impact of <i>Helicobacter pylori</i>-related hyperhomocysteinemia on neurodegenerative disorders might offer benefits, and additional research is warranted to clarify this crucial topic currently representing a major worldwide burden.","Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2023,Jannis Kountouras; Michael Doulberis; Apostolis Papaefthymiou; Stergios A Polyzos; Christos Zavos; Evangelos Kazakos; Stergios Arapoglou; Foteini Kyrailidi; Maria C Mouratidou; Marina Boziki; Elisabeth Vardaka
36978911,The Potential of Flavonoids and Flavonoid Metabolites in the Treatment of Neurodegenerative Pathology in Disorders of Cognitive Decline.,"Flavonoids are a biodiverse family of dietary compounds that have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and antibacterial cell protective profiles. They have received considerable attention as potential therapeutic agents in biomedicine and have been widely used in traditional complimentary medicine for generations. Such complimentary medical herbal formulations are extremely complex mixtures of many pharmacologically active compounds that provide a therapeutic outcome through a network pharmacological effects of considerable complexity. Methods are emerging to determine the active components used in complimentary medicine and their therapeutic targets and to decipher the complexities of how network pharmacology provides such therapeutic effects. The gut microbiome has important roles to play in the generation of bioactive flavonoid metabolites retaining or exceeding the antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties of the intact flavonoid and, in some cases, new antitumor and antineurodegenerative bioactivities. Certain food items have been identified with high prebiotic profiles suggesting that neutraceutical supplementation may be beneficially employed to preserve a healthy population of bacterial symbiont species and minimize the establishment of harmful pathogenic organisms. Gut health is an important consideration effecting the overall health and wellbeing of linked organ systems. Bioconversion of dietary flavonoid components in the gut generates therapeutic metabolites that can also be transported by the vagus nerve and systemic circulation to brain cell populations to exert a beneficial effect. This is particularly important in a number of neurological disorders (autism, bipolar disorder, AD, PD) characterized by effects on moods, resulting in depression and anxiety, impaired motor function, and long-term cognitive decline. Native flavonoids have many beneficial properties in the alleviation of inflammation in tissues, however, concerns have been raised that therapeutic levels of flavonoids may not be achieved, thus allowing them to display optimal therapeutic effects. Dietary manipulation and vagal stimulation have both yielded beneficial responses in the treatment of autism spectrum disorders, depression, and anxiety, establishing the vagal nerve as a route of communication in the gut-brain axis with established roles in disease intervention. While a number of native flavonoids are beneficial in the treatment of neurological disorders and are known to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, microbiome-generated flavonoid metabolites (e.g., protocatechuic acid, urolithins, Î³-valerolactones), which retain the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potency of the native flavonoid in addition to bioactive properties that promote mitochondrial health and cerebrovascular microcapillary function, should also be considered as potential biotherapeutic agents. Studies are warranted to experimentally examine the efficacy of flavonoid metabolites directly, as they emerge as novel therapeutic options.","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,James Melrose
36938477,Evaluating the effectiveness of probiotics in relieving constipation in Parkinson's disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of probiotics on the treatment of constipation in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) by analyzing data from published randomized clinical trials (RCTs). PD is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by clinical symptoms such as rigidity, bradykinesia, and resting tremor. Constipation is a common complaint reported by PD patients. Probiotics are often used to treat functional constipation. The potential mechanisms behind PD-related constipation include dysfunction of the enteric nervous system due to alpha-synuclein aggregation, dyssynergic contractions of the puborectalis muscle, and alterations of the gut microbiome.To conduct this study, we searched Scopus, PubMed, and Google Scholar for published articles on PD, probiotics, and constipation. We selected RCTs from 944 studies, and ultimately included 3 RCTs in our meta-analysis. The frequency of bowel movements per week was the only index that could be summarized among the records. We extracted and analyzed the results as means and standard deviations.We calculated a standardized mean difference (SMD) of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.65 to 1.19; I-squaredÂ =Â 57.0%; pÂ <Â 0.001) to determine the treatment effect in terms of frequency of bowel movements per week in the RCTs.Our results show that probiotic intake has beneficial effects on constipation in PD patients. Further research, including multicenter studies, is needed to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of probiotic supplements in neurodegenerative diseases.",Heliyon,2023,Nasibeh Ghalandari; Farhad Assarzadegan; Hossein Mahdavi; Elham Jamshidi; Hadi Esmaily
36843420,Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"A growing body of evidence has demonstrated an intricate association between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and neurodegenerative conditions, expanding beyond previous foci of comorbidities between IBD and mood disorders. These new discoveries stem from an improved understanding of the gut-microbiome-brain axis: specifically, the ability of the intestinal microbiota to modulate inflammation and regulate neuromodulatory compounds. Clinical retrospective studies incorporating large sample sizes and population-based cohorts have demonstrated and confirmed the relevance of IBD and chronic neurodegeneration in clinical medicine. In this review, we expound upon the current knowledge on the gut-microbiome-brain axis, highlighting several plausible mechanisms linking IBD with neurodegeneration. We also summarize the known associations between IBD with Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, vascular dementia and ischemic stroke, and multiple sclerosis in a clinical context. Finally, we discuss the implications of an improved understanding of the gut-microbiome-brain axis in preventing, diagnosing, and managing neurodegeneration among IBD and non-IBD patients.",Gut and liver,2023,Jin Sun Kim; Mu-Hong Chen; Hohui E Wang; Ching-Liang Lu; Yen-Po Wang; Bing Zhang
36816743,The Role of Gut Microbiota in Various Neurological and Psychiatric Disorders-An Evidence Mapping Based on Quantified Evidence.,"We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Epistemonikos to identify systematic reviews and meta-analysis (SRs). We searched for neurological diseases and psychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), anorexia nervosa (AN), bipolar disorder (BD), eating disorder (ED), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), major depressive disorder (MDD), multiple sclerosis (MS), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), Parkinson's disease (PD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), spinal cord injury (SCI), schizophrenia, and stroke. We used A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR-2) to evaluate the quality of included SRs. We also created an evidence map showing the role of gut microbiota in neurological diseases and the certainty of the evidence.In total, 42 studies were included in this evidence mapping. Most findings were obtained from observational studies. According to the AMSTAR-2 assessment, 21 SRs scored ""critically low"" in terms of methodological quality, 16 SR scored ""low,"" and 5 SR scored ""moderate."" A total of 15 diseases have been investigated for the potential association between gut microbiome alpha diversity and disease, with the Shannon index and Simpson index being the most widely studied. A total of 12 diseases were investigated for potential link between beta diversity and disease. At the phylum level, <i>Firmicutes</i>, <i>Bacteroidetes</i>, <i>Actinobacteria</i>, <i>Proteobacteria</i>, and <i>Verrucomicrobia</i> were more researched.

Some diseases have been found to have specific flora changes, and some diseases have been found to have common intestinal microbiological changes.We found varied levels of evidence for the associations between gut microbiota and neurological diseases; some gut microbiota increased the risk of neurological diseases, whereas others showed evidence of benefit that gut microbiota might be promising therapeutic targets for such diseases.",Mediators of inflammation,2023,Yaning Zang; Xigui Lai; Conghui Li; Dongfang Ding; Ying Wang; Yi Zhu
36769029,Health Benefits of Coffee Consumption for Cancer and Other Diseases and Mechanisms of Action.,"Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages worldwide, and epidemiology studies associate higher coffee consumption with decreased rates of mortality and decreased rates of neurological and metabolic diseases, including Parkinson's disease and type 2 diabetes. In addition, there is also evidence that higher coffee consumption is associated with lower rates of colon and rectal cancer, as well as breast, endometrial, and other cancers, although for some of these cancers, the results are conflicting. These studies reflect the chemopreventive effects of coffee; there is also evidence that coffee consumption may be therapeutic for some forms of breast and colon cancer, and this needs to be further investigated. The mechanisms associated with the chemopreventive or chemotherapeutic effects of over 1000 individual compounds in roasted coffee are complex and may vary with different diseases. Some of these mechanisms may be related to nuclear factor erythroid 2 (Nrf2)-regulated pathways that target oxidative stress or pathways that induce reactive oxygen species to kill diseased cells (primarily therapeutic). There is evidence for the involvement of receptors which include the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and orphan nuclear receptor 4A1 (NR4A1), as well as contributions from epigenetic pathways and the gut microbiome. Further elucidation of the mechanisms will facilitate the potential future clinical applications of coffee extracts for treating cancer and other inflammatory diseases.",International journal of molecular sciences,2023,Stephen Safe; Jainish Kothari; Amanuel Hailemariam; Srijana Upadhyay; Laurie A Davidson; Robert S Chapkin
36750613,Gut microbiota of Parkinson's disease in an appendectomy cohort: a preliminary study.,"In patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), Î±-synuclein pathology is thought to spread to the brain via the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve. The link between the gut microbiome and PD has been explored in various studies. The appendix might play an important role in immunity by maintaining the microbiota as a reservoir. In recent times, appendectomy has been linked to a lower risk of PD, possibly owing to the role of the appendix in altering the gut microbiome. We aimed to elucidate whether the gut microbiota affects PD development in the appendectomy cohort. We analyzed the fecal microbial composition in patients with PD and healthy controls with and without a history of appendectomy. The abundance of microbes from the family Enterobacteriaceae was higher in feces samples from patients with Parkinson's disease compared to that in samples collected from healthy controls. Furthermore, there was a significant phylogenetic difference between patients with PD and healthy controls who had undergone appendectomy. There was a significant phylogenetic difference between patients with PD and HCs who had undergone APP. These results suggest the correlation between gut microbiota and PD in patients who have undergone APP.",Scientific reports,2023,Keiichi Nakahara; Shunya Nakane; Kazuo Ishii; Tokunori Ikeda; Yukio Ando
36674517,The Role of Fecal Microbiota Transplantation in the Treatment of Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Review.,"Neurodegenerative diseases are highly prevalent but poorly understood, and with few treatment options despite decades of intense research, attention has recently shifted toward other mediators of neurological disease that may present future targets for therapeutic research. One such mediator is the gut microbiome, which communicates with the brain through the gut-brain axis and has been implicated in various neurological disorders. Alterations in the gut microbiome have been associated with numerous neurological and other diseases, and restoration of the dysbiotic gut has been shown to improve disease conditions. One method of restoring a dysbiotic gut is via fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), recolonizing the ""diseased"" gut with normal microbiome. Fecal microbiota transplantation is a treatment method traditionally used for <i>Clostridium difficile</i> infections, but it has recently been used in neurodegenerative disease research as a potential treatment method. This review aims to present a summary of neurodegenerative research that has used FMT, whether as a treatment or to investigate how the microbiome influences pathogenesis.",International journal of molecular sciences,2023,Julie-Anne T Matheson; R M Damian Holsinger

38694913,Current and further outlook on the protective potential of <i>Antrodia camphorata</i> against neurological disorders.,"Prevalent neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and stroke are increasingly becoming a global burden as society ages. It is well-known that degeneration and loss of neurons are the fundamental underlying processes, but there are still no effective therapies for these neurological diseases. In recent years, plenty of studies have focused on the pharmacology and feasibility of natural products as new strategies for the development of drugs that target neurological disorders. <i>Antrodia camphorata</i> has become one of the most promising candidates, and the crude extracts and some active metabolites of it have been reported to play various pharmacological activities to alleviate neurological symptoms at cellular and molecular levels. This review highlights the current evidence of <i>Antrodia camphorata</i> against neurological disorders, including safety evaluation, metabolism, blood-brain barrier penetration, neuroprotective activities, and the potential on regulating the gut-microbiome-brain axis.

This study aimed to evaluate the clinical effects and safety of a single faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in patients with early-stage PD.The GUT-PARFECT trial, a single-centre randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at Ghent University Hospital between December 01, 2020 and December 12, 2022. Participants (aged 50-65 years, Hoehn and Yahr stage 2) were randomly assigned to receive nasojejunal FMT with either healthy donor stool or their own stool. Computer-generated randomisation was done in a 1:1 ratio through permutated-block scheduling. Treatment allocation was concealed for participants and investigators. The primary outcome measure at 12 months was the change in the Movement Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) motor score obtained during off-medication evaluations. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed using a mixed model for repeated measures analysis. This completed trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03808389).Between December 2020 and December 2021, FMT procedures were conducted on 46 patients with PD: 22 in the healthy donor group and 24 in the placebo group. Clinical evaluations were performed at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months post-FMT. Full data analysis was possible for 21 participants in the healthy donor group and 22 in the placebo group. After 12 months, the MDS-UPDRS motor score significantly improved by a mean of 5.8 points (95% CIÂ -11.4 toÂ -0.2) in the healthy donor group and by 2.7 points (-8.3 to 2.9) in the placebo group (pÂ =Â 0.0235).

38664425,Effects of microbiome-based interventions on neurodegenerative diseases: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are characterized by neuronal damage and progressive loss of neuron function. Microbiome-based interventions, such as dietary interventions, biotics, and fecal microbiome transplant, have been proposed as a novel approach to managing symptoms and modulating disease progression. Emerging clinical trials have investigated the efficacy of interventions modulating the GM in alleviating or reversing disease progression, yet no comprehensive synthesis have been done. A systematic review of the literature was therefore conducted to investigate the efficacy of microbiome-modulating methods. The search yielded 4051 articles, with 15 clinical trials included. The overall risk of bias was moderate in most studies. Most microbiome-modulating interventions changed the GM composition. Despite inconsistent changes in GM composition, the meta-analysis showed that microbiome-modulating interventions improved disease burden (SMD,â-â0.57; 95% CIâ-â0.93 toâ-â0.21; I<sup>2</sup>â=â42%; Pâ=â0.002) with a qualitative trend of improvement in constipation.

38649365,Diet and the gut microbiome in patients with Parkinson's disease.,"It has been suggested that gut microbiota influence Parkinson's disease (PD) via the gut-brain axis. Here, we examine associations between diet and gut microbiome composition and its predicted functional pathways in patients with PD. We assessed gut microbiota in fecal samples from 85 PD patients in central California using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Diet quality was assessed by calculating the Healthy Eating Index 2015 (HEI-2015) based on the Diet History Questionnaire II. We examined associations of diet quality, fiber, and added sugar intake with microbial diversity, composition, taxon abundance, and predicted metagenomic profiles, adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and sequencing platform. Higher HEI scores and fiber intake were associated with an increase in putative anti-inflammatory butyrate-producing bacteria, such as the genera Butyricicoccus and Coprococcus 1. Conversely, higher added sugar intake was associated with an increase in putative pro-inflammatory bacteria, such as the genera Klebsiella. Predictive metagenomics suggested that bacterial genes involved in the biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharide decreased with higher HEI scores, whereas a simultaneous decrease in genes involved in taurine degradation indicates less neuroinflammation. We found that a healthy diet, fiber, and added sugar intake affect the gut microbiome composition and its predicted metagenomic function in PD patients. This suggests that a healthy diet may support gut microbiome that has a positive influence on PD risk and progression.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2024,Dayoon Kwon; Keren Zhang; Kimberly C Paul; Aline D Folle; Irish Del Rosario; Jonathan P Jacobs; Adrienne M Keener; Jeff M Bronstein; Beate Ritz
38648770,Role of the Gut Microbiome and Bacterial Amyloids in the Development of Synucleinopathies.,"Less than ten years ago, evidence began to accumulate about association between the changes in the composition of gut microbiota and development of human synucleinopathies, in particular sporadic form of Parkinson's disease. We collected data from more than one hundred and thirty experimental studies that reported similar results and summarized the frequencies of detection of different groups of bacteria in these studies. It is important to note that it is extremely rare that a unidirectional change in the population of one or another group of microorganisms (only an elevation or only a reduction) was detected in the patients with Parkinson's disease. However, we were able to identify several groups of bacteria that were overrepresented in the patients with Parkinson's disease in the analyzed studies. There are various hypotheses about the molecular mechanisms that explain such relationships. Usually, Î±-synuclein aggregation is associated with the development of inflammatory processes that occur in response to the changes in the microbiome. However, experimental evidence is accumulating on the influence of bacterial proteins, including amyloids (curli), as well as various metabolites, on the Î±-synuclein aggregation.

38627687,Ambient long-term exposure to organophosphorus pesticides and the human gut microbiome: an observational study.,"Organophosphorus pesticides (OP) have been associated with various human health conditions. Animal experiments and in-vitro models suggested that OP may also affect the gut microbiota. We examined associations between ambient chronic exposure to OP and gut microbial changes in humans.We recruited 190 participants from a community-based epidemiologic study of Parkinson's disease living in a region known for heavy agricultural pesticide use in California. Of these, 61% of participants had Parkinson's disease and their mean age was 72Â years. Microbiome and predicted metagenome data were generated by 16S rRNA gene sequencing of fecal samples. Ambient long-term OP exposures were assessed using pesticide application records combined with residential addresses in a geographic information system. We examined gut microbiome differences due to OP exposures, specifically differences in microbial diversity based on the Shannon index and Bray-Curtis dissimilarities, and differential taxa abundance and predicted Metacyc pathway expression relying on regression models and adjusting for potential confounders.OP exposure was not associated with alpha or beta diversity of the gut microbiome. However, the predicted metagenome was sparser and less evenly expressed among those highly exposed to OP (pâ=â0.04). Additionally, we found that the abundance of two bacterial families, 22 genera, and the predicted expression of 34 Metacyc pathways were associated with long-term OP exposure. These pathways included perturbed processes related to cellular respiration, increased biosynthesis and degradation of compounds related to bacterial wall structure, increased biosynthesis of RNA/DNA precursors, and decreased synthesis of Vitamin B1 and B6.In support of previous animal studies and in-vitro findings, our results suggest that ambient chronic OP pesticide exposure alters gut microbiome composition and its predicted metabolism in humans.",Environmental health : a global access science source,2024,Keren Zhang; Kimberly Paul; Jonathan P Jacobs; Myles G Cockburn; Jeff M Bronstein; Irish Del Rosario; Beate Ritz

38562309,Hospital-treated infections and subsequent Parkinson's disease risk: a register-based sibling comparison study.,"Serious infections may result in greater risk of Parkinson's disease. However, high-quality cohort studies focusing on a potential causal role of different types and sites of infection are lacking. Gastrointestinal infections are of a particular interest due to growing evidence implicating gut dysbiosis in Parkinson's disease aetiology. This population-based cohort study used the Swedish Total Population Register to identify individuals born during 1944-77 and resident in Sweden between 1990 and 2018 (<i>N</i> = 3 698 319). Hospital-treated infections at ages 21-30 and 31-40 years were identified from the National Patient Register. Participants were followed to identify Parkinson's disease diagnoses from age 41 years up to December 31, 2018, when the oldest individual reached 75 years. Cox regression with a sibling comparison design to tackle familial genetic and environmental confounding was used to derive hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for each infection site, type, or any infections at ages 21-30 and 31-40 years. During a median follow-up of 15.4 years, 8815 unique Parkinson's disease diagnoses were accrued, with a crude rate of 17.3 (95% confidence interval 17.0, 17.7) per 100 000 person-years. After controlling for shared familial factors, hospital-treated gastrointestinal and respiratory infections between 21 and 30 years of age were associated with a greater risk of Parkinson's disease [hazard ratios 1.35 (95% confidence interval: 1.05, 1.75) and 1.45 (95% confidence interval: 1.08, 1.95), respectively]; no association was found for any infections at age 31-40 [hazard ratio 1.05 (95% confidence interval: 0.93, 1.19)]. After adjustment, no statistically significant associations were observed for other sites including genitourinary and skin. These findings suggest that hospital-treated infections of the gastrointestinal tract and lungs, both of which may have an influence on the gut microbiome, by age 30 years may be risk factors for Parkinson's disease.",Brain communications,2024,Snieguole Vingeliene; Ayako Hiyoshi; Marleen A H Lentjes; Robert J Brummer; Katja Fall; Scott Montgomery
38540341,"Effects of Paraquat, Dextran Sulfate Sodium, and Irradiation on Behavioral and Cognitive Performance and the Gut Microbiome in A53T and A53T-L444P Mice.","Heterozygous carriers of the glucocerebrosidase 1 (GBA) L444P Gaucher mutation have an increased risk of developing Parkinson's disease (PD). The GBA mutations result in elevated alpha synuclein (aSyn) levels. Heterozygous mice carrying one allele with the L444P mutation knocked-into the mouse gene show increased aSyn levels and are more sensitive to motor deficits following exposure to the neurotoxin (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) MPTP than wild-type mice. Paraquat (PQ), a herbicide, increases PD risk in most studies. Its effects on the brain involve alterations in the gut microbiome. Exposure to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), a mouse model of colitis, can be used to determine whether gut microbiome alterations are sufficient to induce PD-relevant phenotypes. We rederived the A53T-L444P and A53T mouse lines to assess whether PQ, PQ in combination with radiation exposure (IR), and DSS have differential effects in A53T and A53T-L444P mice and whether these effects are associated with alterations in the gut microbiome. PQ and PQ + IR have differential effects in A53T and A53T-L444P mice. In contrast, effects of DSS are only seen in A53T-L444P mice. Exposure and genotype modulate the relationship between the gut microbiome and behavioral performance.

33362788,The Gut-Brain Axis: How Microbiota and Host Inflammasome Influence Brain Physiology and Pathology.,"The human microbiota has a fundamental role in host physiology and pathology. Gut microbial alteration, also known as dysbiosis, is a condition associated not only with gastrointestinal disorders but also with diseases affecting other distal organs. Recently it became evident that the intestinal bacteria can affect the central nervous system (CNS) physiology and inflammation. The nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract are communicating through a bidirectional network of signaling pathways called the gut-brain axis, which consists of multiple connections, including the vagus nerve, the immune system, and bacterial metabolites and products. During dysbiosis, these pathways are dysregulated and associated with altered permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and neuroinflammation. However, numerous mechanisms behind the impact of the gut microbiota in neuro-development and -pathogenesis remain poorly understood. There are several immune pathways involved in CNS homeostasis and inflammation. Among those, the inflammasome pathway has been linked to neuroinflammatory conditions such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, but also anxiety and depressive-like disorders. The inflammasome complex assembles upon cell activation due to exposure to microbes, danger signals, or stress and lead to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1Î² and interleukin-18) and to pyroptosis. Evidences suggest that there is a reciprocal influence of microbiota and inflammasome activation in the brain. However, how this influence is precisely working is yet to be discovered. Herein, we discuss the status of the knowledge and the open questions in the field focusing on the function of intestinal microbial metabolites or products on CNS cells during healthy and inflammatory conditions, such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and also neuropsychiatric disorders. In particular, we focus on the innate inflammasome pathway as immune mechanism that can be involved in several of these conditions, upon exposure to certain microbes.",Frontiers in immunology,2020,Andrina Rutsch; Johan B KantsjÃ¶; Francesca Ronchi
32934117,Gut Microbiota and Metabolome Alterations Associated with Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of intracellular aggregates of misfolded alpha-synuclein along the cerebral axis. Several studies report the association between intestinal dysbiosis and Parkinson's disease, although a cause-effect relationship remains to be established. Herein, the gut microbiota composition of 64 Italian patients with Parkinson's disease and 51 controls was determined using a next-generation sequencing approach. A real metagenomics shape based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was also investigated. The most significant changes within the Parkinson's disease group highlighted a reduction in bacterial taxa, which are linked to anti-inflammatory/neuroprotective effects, particularly in the <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> family and key members, such as <i>Butyrivibrio, Pseudobutyrivibrio, Coprococcus</i>, and <i>Blautia</i> The direct evaluation of fecal metabolites revealed changes in several classes of metabolites. Changes were seen in lipids (linoleic acid, oleic acid, succinic acid, and sebacic acid), vitamins (pantothenic acid and nicotinic acid), amino acids (isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, glutamic acid, and pyroglutamic acid) and other organic compounds (cadaverine, ethanolamine, and hydroxy propionic acid). Most modified metabolites strongly correlated with the abundance of members belonging to the <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> family, suggesting that these gut bacteria correlate with altered metabolism rates in Parkinson's disease.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> To our knowledge, this is one of the few studies thus far that correlates the composition of the gut microbiota with the direct analysis of fecal metabolites in patients with Parkinson's disease. Overall, our data highlight microbiota modifications correlated with numerous fecal metabolites. This suggests that Parkinson's disease is associated with gut dysregulation that involves a synergistic relationship between gut microbes and several bacterial metabolites favoring altered homeostasis. Interestingly, a reduction of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria influenced the shape of the metabolomics profile, affecting several metabolites with potential protective effects in the Parkinson group. On the other hand, the extensive impact that intestinal dysbiosis has at the level of numerous metabolic pathways could encourage the identification of specific biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of Parkinson's disease, also in light of the effect that specific drugs have on the composition of the intestinal microbiota.",mSystems,2020,Sarah Vascellari; Vanessa Palmas; Marta Melis; Silvia Pisanu; Roberto Cusano; Paolo Uva; Daniela Perra; Veronica Madau; Marianna Sarchioto; Valentina Oppo; Nicola Simola; Micaela Morelli; Maria Laura Santoru; Luigi Atzori; Maurizio Melis; Giovanni Cossu; Aldo Manzin
32357258,Microbiota Composition and Metabolism Are Associated With Gut Function in Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease is characterized by a high burden of gastrointestinal comorbidities, especially constipation and reduced colonic transit time, and by gut microbiota alterations. The diverse metabolites produced by the microbiota are broadly relevant to host health. How microbiota composition and metabolism relate to gastrointestinal function in Parkinson's disease is largely unknown. The objectives of the current study were to assesses associations between microbiota composition, stool consistency, constipation, and systemic microbial metabolites in Parkinson's disease to better understand how intestinal microbes contribute to gastrointestinal disturbances commonly observed in patients.Three hundred participants (197 Parkinson's patients and 103 controls) were recruited for this cross-sectional cohort study. Participants supplied fecal samples for microbiota sequencing (n = 300) and serum for untargeted metabolomics (n = 125). Data were collected on motor and nonmotor Parkinson's symptoms, medications, diet, and demographics.Significant microbiota taxonomic differences were observed in Parkinson's patients, even when controlling for gastrointestinal function. Parkinson's microbiota was characterized by reduced carbohydrate fermentation and butyrate synthesis capacity and increased proteolytic fermentation and production of deleterious amino acid metabolites, including p-cresol and phenylacetylglutamine. Taxonomic shifts and elevated proteolytic metabolites were strongly associated with stool consistency (a proxy for colonic transit time) and constipation among patients.Compositional and metabolic alterations in the Parkinson's microbiota are highly associated with gut function, suggesting plausible mechanistic links between altered bacterial metabolism and reduced gut health in this disease. The systemic detection of elevated deleterious proteolytic microbial metabolites in Parkinson's serum suggests a mechanism whereby microbiota dysbiosis contributes to disease etiology and pathophysiology.

32103766,"Gut, oral and nasal microbiota and Parkinson's disease.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease, and in an effort to identify novel therapeutic target for this disease in recent years, human microbiota has attracted much interest. This paper briefly summarizes the main findings concerning the differences of human microbiome across several important mucosal interfaces, including nose, mouth, and gut between PD patients and controls as obtained from a total of 13 studies published since 2015, which covered a total of 943 PD patients and 831 matched controls from 6 countries. Overall, these studies supported the differences of gut microbiota between PD patients and matched controls, while significantly altered bacterial taxa among studies were not identical. Due to relatively limited number of available studies and covered patients, the associations between oral and nasal microbiota and PD remain inconclusive. The therapeutic and diagnostic potentials of gut microbiota for PD are discussed. More well-designed clinical studies recruiting large-scale PD patients are encouraged in future.",Microbial cell factories,2020,Liang Shen
31628992,"Exercise, diet and stress as modulators of gut microbiota: Implications for neurodegenerative diseases.","The last decade has witnessed an exponentially growing interest in gut microbiota and the gut-brain axis in health and disease. Accumulating evidence from preclinical and clinical research indicate that gut microbiota, and their associated microbiomes, may influence pathogenic processes and thus the onset and progression of various diseases, including neurological and psychiatric disorders. In fact, gut dysbiosis (microbiota dysregulation) has been associated with a range of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's and motor neuron disease, as well as multiple sclerosis. The gut microbiota constitutes a dynamic microbial system constantly challenged by many biological variables, including environmental factors. Since the gut microbiota constitute a changeable and experience-dependent ecosystem, they provide potential therapeutic targets that can be modulated as new interventions for dysbiosis-related disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases. This article reviews the evidence for environmental modulation of gut microbiota and its relevance to brain disorders, exploring in particular the implications for neurodegenerative diseases. We will focus on three major environmental factors that are known to influence the onset and progression of those diseases, namely exercise, diet and stress. Further exploration of environmental modulation, acting via both peripheral (e.g. gut microbiota and associated metabolic dysfunction or 'metabolopathy') and central (e.g. direct effects on CNS neurons and glia) mechanisms, may lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches, such as enviromimetics, for a wide range of neurological and psychiatric disorders.",Neurobiology of disease,2020,Carolina Gubert; Geraldine Kong; Thibault Renoir; Anthony J Hannan
32290475,d-glutamate and Gut Microbiota in Alzheimer's Disease.,"An increasing number of studies have shown that the brain-gut-microbiota axis may significantly contribute to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Moreover, impaired memory and learning involve the dysfunction neurotransmission of glutamate, the agonist of the <i>N</i>-methyl-d-aspartate receptor and a major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain. This systematic review aimed to summarize the current cutting-edge research on the gut microbiota and glutamate alterations associated with dementia.PubMed, the Cochrane Collaboration Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials, and Cochrane Systematic Reviews were reviewed for all studies on glutamate and gut microbiota in dementia published up until Feb 2020.Several pilot studies have reported alterations of gut microbiota and metabolites in AD patients and other forms of dementia. Gut microbiota including <i>Bacteroides vulgatus</i> and <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> affect glutamate metabolism and decrease the glutamate metabolite 2-keto-glutaramic acid. Meanwhile, gut bacteria with glutamate racemase including <i>Corynebacterium glutamicum, Brevibacterium lactofermentum</i>, and <i>Brevibacterium avium</i> can convert l-glutamate to d-glutamate. N-methyl-d-aspartate glutamate receptor (NMDAR)-enhancing agents have been found to potentially improve cognition in AD or Parkinson's disease patients. These findings suggest that d-glutamate (d-form glutamate) metabolized by the gut bacteria may influence the glutamate NMDAR and cognitive function in dementia patients.Gut microbiota and glutamate are potential novel interventions to be developed for dementia. Exploring comprehensive cognitive functions in animal and human trials with glutamate-related NMDAR enhancers are warranted to examine d-glutamate signaling efficacy in gut microbiota in patients with AD and other neurodegenerative dementias.",International journal of molecular sciences,2020,Chun-Hung Chang; Chieh-Hsin Lin; Hsien-Yuan Lane

Diet is an environmental factor that influences the diversity and functionality of the gut microbiota, where dietary changes have a direct action on their homeostasis. The environment created in the gut by ultra-processed foods, a hallmark of the Western diet that are recognized as trigger factors for low-grade systemic inflammatory and oxidative changes, favor the development of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). From a systematic search, the present review analyzes the relationship and effect of the current feeding pattern, with the dysregulation of the microbiota and its influence on the development of cognitive decline. Because diagnosis of NDs is usually at late stages, this review highlights the importance of a search for stricter public health strategies regarding access to and development of ultra-processed foods.","Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)",2020,Edwin E MartÃ­nez Leo; Maira R Segura Campos

32827699,Acupuncture inhibits neuroinflammation and gut microbial dysbiosis in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease.,"Growing evidences show that gut microbiota is associated with the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) and the gut-brain axis can be promising target for the development of the therapeutic strategies for PD. Acupuncture has been used to improve brain functions and inflammation in neurological disorders such as PD, and to recover the gastrointestinal dysfunctions in various gastrointestinal disorders. Thus, we investigated whether acupuncture could improve Parkinsonism and gut microbial dysbiosis induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. First, we observed that acupuncture treatment at acupoints GB34 and ST36 could improve motor functions and comorbid anxiety in PD mice. Next, we found that acupuncture increased the levels of dopaminergic fibers and neurons in the striatum and the substantia nigra, respectively. Acupuncture also restored the overexpression of microglia and astrocyte as well as conversion of Bax and Bcl-2 expression in both the striatum and the substantia nigra, indicating that inflammatory responses and apoptosis were blocked by acupuncture. Additionally, via 16S rRNA sequence analysis, we observed that the relative abundance of 18 genera were changed in acupuncture-treated mice compared to the PD mice. Of them, Butyricimonas, Holdemania, Frisingicoccus, Gracilibacter, Phocea, and Aestuariispira showed significant correlations with anxiety as well as motor functions. Furthermore, the predicted functional analyses showed that acupuncture restored the physiology functions such as glutathione metabolism, methane metabolism, and PD pathway. In conclusion, we suggest that the effects of acupuncture on the enhanced motor function and the protection of the dopaminergic neurons may be associated with the regulation of the gut microbial dysbiosis and thus the inhibition of the neuroinflammation in the PD mice.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2020,Jae-Hwan Jang; Mi-Jung Yeom; Sora Ahn; Ju-Young Oh; Suhwan Ji; Tae-Hong Kim; Hi-Joon Park

The KD is being explored for Febrile Infection-Related Epilepsy Syndrome (FIRES) and epileptic encephalopathies. There is growing evidence that KD works by targeting dysregulated adaptive and innate immunity that occurs in drug-resistant epilepsy and in refractory status epilepticus. Beyond epilepsy, there are yet additional potential uses in neurological disorders because KD appears to have the broad anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. The KD exerts anti-inflammatory action against a variety of experimental models of neurological disorders including multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, pain, and spinal cord injury. Anti-inflammatory action of KD appears to be mediated by multiple mechanisms.

Microbiota-targeted interventions, including probiotic Clostridium butyricum (Cb), have been recently shown to have favorable effects in PD by regulating microbiota-gut-brain axis. However, the potential beneficial roles and its mechanisms of Cb on PD were still unknown. Male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to a PD model-induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and were treated intragastrically with Cb for 4Â weeks. The motor functions were assessed by a series of behavioral tests including pole test, beam walking teat, forced swimming test and open field test. The dopaminergic neuron loss, synaptic plasticity and microglia activation, as well as the levels of colonic glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), colonic G protein-coupled receptors GPR41/43 and cerebral GLP-1 receptors were assessed. Gut microbial composition was assessed by 16S rRNA sequencing analysis. Our results showed that oral administration of Cb could improve motor deficits, dopaminergic neuron loss, synaptic dysfunction and microglia activation in the MPTP-induced mice. Meanwhile, Cb treatment could reverse the dysbiosis of gut microbiota and the decreased levels of colonic GLP-1, colonic GPR41/43 and cerebral GLP-1 receptor in the MPTP-induced mice. These findings indicated that the neuroprotective mechanism of Cb on PD might be related to the improvement of abnormal gut microbiota-gut-brain axis.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2021,Jing Sun; Haijun Li; Yangjie Jin; Jiaheng Yu; Shiyin Mao; Kuan-Pin Su; Zongxin Ling; Jiaming Liu
32266160,Fecal Microbiota Transplantation in Neurological Disorders.,"<b>Background:</b> Several studies suggested an important role of the gut microbiota in the pathophysiology of neurological disorders, implying that alteration of the gut microbiota might serve as a treatment strategy. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is currently the most effective gut microbiota intervention and an accepted treatment for recurrent <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> infections. To evaluate indications of FMT for patients with neurological disorders, we summarized the available literature on FMT. In addition, we provide suggestions for future directions. <b>Methods:</b> In July 2019, five main databases were searched for studies and case descriptions on FMT in neurological disorders in humans or animal models. In addition, the ClinicalTrials.gov website was consulted for registered planned and ongoing trials. <b>Results:</b> Of 541 identified studies, 34 were included in the analysis. Clinical trials with FMT have been performed in patients with autism spectrum disorder and showed beneficial effects on neurological symptoms. For multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease, several animal studies suggested a positive effect of FMT, supported by some human case reports. For epilepsy, Tourette syndrome, and diabetic neuropathy some studies suggested a beneficial effect of FMT, but evidence was restricted to case reports and limited numbers of animal studies. For stroke, Alzheimer's disease and Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome only studies with animal models were identified. These studies suggested a potential beneficial effect of healthy donor FMT. In contrast, one study with an animal model for stroke showed increased mortality after FMT. For Guillain-BarrÃ© only one study was identified. Whether positive findings from animal studies can be confirmed in the treatment of human diseases awaits to be seen. Several trials with FMT as treatment for the above mentioned neurological disorders are planned or ongoing, as well as for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. <b>Conclusions:</b> Preliminary literature suggests that FMT may be a promising treatment option for several neurological disorders. However, available evidence is still scanty and some contrasting results were observed. A limited number of studies in humans have been performed or are ongoing, while for some disorders only animal experiments have been conducted.

Besides, the effect of family environment on gut microbiota dysbiosis remains unclear.We characterized the gut microbial compositions of 63 PD patients, 63 healthy spouses (HS) and 74 healthy people (HP) using 16S rRNA sequencing. Clinical phenotypes and microbial composition were analyzed comprehensively.There were markedly different microbial compositions among PD, HS and HP samples by alpha/beta diversity. We also found differential microbial compositions among Hoehn & Yahr stage/disease duration. Eight inflammation-associated microbial genera shared a continuously increase trend with increased Hoehn & Yahr stage and disease duration, indicating characteristic bacteria associated with deterioration in PD. Additionally, seven bacterial markers were identified for accurately differentiating PD patients from the controls (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.856).Our study shows altered gut microbiota in PD patients. Importantly, inflammation-associated microbial genera may play roles in PD progression. Differential microbial compositions in HS and HP samples demonstrate that the gut microbiota are also affected by family environment.

The effects of levodopa (LD) have been poorly assessed, and those of LD-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) have not been evaluated so far. The aim of this study was to identify the effect of LD and LCIG, in particular, on the GM and metabolome.Fecal DNA samples from 107 patients with a clinical diagnosis of PD were analyzed by next-generation sequencing of the V3 and V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene.

We also included a group of patients (nÂ =Â 23) without antiparkinsonian medicaments (NaÃ¯ve group). Fecal metabolic extracts were evaluated by gas chromatography mass spectrometry.The multivariate analysis showed a significantly higher abundance in the LCIG group of Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia, and Serratia compared to the LD group. Compared to the NaÃ¯ve group, the univariate analysis showed a reduction of Blautia and Lachnospirae in the LD group. Moreover, an increase of Proteobacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, and a reduction of Firmicutes, Lachnospiraceae, and Blautia was found in the LCIG group. No significant difference was found in the multivariate analysis of these comparisons. The LD group and LCIG group were associated with a metabolic profile linked to gut inflammation.Our results suggest that LD, and mostly LCIG, might significantly influence the microbiota composition and host/bacteria metabolism, acting as stressors in precipitating a specific inflammatory intestinal microenvironment, potentially related to the PD state and progression.",European journal of neurology,2021,Marta Melis; Sarah Vascellari; Maria Laura Santoru; Valentina Oppo; Margherita Fabbri; Marianna Sarchioto; Daniela Murgia; Maurizio Zibetti; Leonardo Lopiano; Alessandra Serra; Vanessa Palmas; Silvia Pisanu; Daniela Perra; Veronica Madau; Roberto Cusano; Paolo Uva; Alessandra Mereu; Paolo Contu; Micaela Morelli; Luigi Atzori; Maurizio Melis; Aldo Manzin; Giovanni Cossu
32032654,Gut microbiota differences between healthy older adults and individuals with Parkinson's disease: A systematic review.,"The 'Dual Hit' hypothesis, stating that Parkinson's disease (PD) begins via olfactory pathways and the gut, and the gastrointestinal symptoms PD individuals face, have largely driven the interest of the gut's involvement in PD. Studies have since observed gut microbiota differences between PD groups and controls, with these alterations potentially relating to PD pathophysiology. However, differences in the studies' methodologies precludes unanimity on the relationships of gut microbiota to PD. Thirteen observational case-control studies investigating gut microbiota in PD and controls were reviewed to assess how microbiota abundance and diversity relates to PD. Nine studies showed butyrate producing gut microbiota had lower abundances in PD compared to controls. Three studies reported Î±-diversity was higher, with one reporting it was lower, in PD compared to controls. Given most studies show abundance, not diversity, differences of butyrate producing bacteria between groups, we propose abundance differences are more associated with PD than microbiota diversity.

However, the therapeutic efficacy of fisetin in Parkinson's disease (PD) is unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that fisetin could markedly alleviate 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration in mice. To confirm the reported correlation between gut microbiota and PD, the bacterial DNA in the fresh feces of mice from each group was subjected to 16S rRNA (V3 and V4 regions) sequencing. The results revealed that fisetin changed the number, diversity, and distribution of gut microbiota in MPTP-induced mice model of PD. The alpha and beta diversity analyses showed that the fisetin intervented MPTP group gut microbiota exhibited a significantly higher abundance of Lachnospiraceae and a significantly lower abundance of uncultured_bacterium_g_Escherichia-Shigella and uncultured_bacterium_g_Bacillus than the MPTP group gut microbiota. These findings indicated that fisetin exerts a neuroprotective effect on neurodegeneration by altering the composition and diversity of gut microbiota. Thus, fisetin could be a potential novel therapeutic for PD.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2020,Tian-Jiao Chen; Ya Feng; Te Liu; Ting-Ting Wu; Ya-Jing Chen; Xuan Li; Qing Li; Yun-Cheng Wu

The bacterial flora of the human gut contributes direct and indirect signals to the CNS along the brain-gut axis. Alterations in gut flora, a state known as dysbiosis, has been tied to systemic inflammation, increased bacterial translocation, and increased absorbance of microbial by-products. An increase in recent literature has highlighted the role of the gut-brain axis in CNS pathology.

Suitable animal models are critical for our understanding of the mechanisms underlying disease and the associated prodromal disturbances. The neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated monkey model is commonly seen as a ""gold standard"" model that closely mimics the clinical motor symptoms and the nigrostriatal dopaminergic loss of PD, however MPTP toxicity extends to other nondopaminergic regions. Yet, there are limited reports monitoring the MPTP-induced progressive central and peripheral inflammation as well as other nonmotor symptoms such as gastrointestinal function and microbiota. We report 5 cases of progressive parkinsonism in non-human primates to gain a broader understanding of MPTP-induced central and peripheral inflammatory dysfunction to understand the potential role of inflammation in prodromal/pre-motor features of PD-like degeneration. We measured inflammatory proteins in plasma and CSF and performed [<sup>18</sup>F]FEPPA PET scans to evaluate translocator proteins (TSPO) or microglial activation. Monkeys were also evaluated for working memory and executive function using various behavior tasks and for gastrointestinal hyperpermeability and microbiota composition. Additionally, monkeys were treated with a novel TNF inhibitor XPro1595 (10Â mg/kg, nÂ =Â 3) or vehicle (nÂ =Â 2) every three days starting 11Â weeks after the initiation of MPTP to determine whether XPro1595 would alter inflammation and microglial behavior in a progressive model of PD. The case studies revealed that earlier and robust [<sup>18</sup>F]FEPPA PET signals resulted in earlier and more severe parkinsonism, which was seen in male cases compared to female cases. Potential other sex differences were observed in circulating inflammation, microbiota diversity and their metabolites. Additional studies with larger group sizes of both sexes would enable confirmation and extension of these findings. If these findings reflect potential differences in humans, these sex differences have significant implications for therapeutic development of inflammatory targets in the clinic.",Neurobiology of disease,2020,Valerie Joers; Gunasingh Masilamoni; Doty Kempf; Alison R Weiss; Travis M Rotterman; Benjamin Murray; Gul Yalcin-Cakmakli; Ronald J Voll; Mark M Goodman; Leonard Howell; Jocelyne Bachevalier; Stefan J Green; Ankur Naqib; Maliha Shaikh; Phillip A Engen; Ali Keshavarzian; Christopher J Barnum; Jonathon A Nye; Yoland Smith; MalÃº G Tansey
33194809,Gut Microbiota Approach-A New Strategy to Treat Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by neuronal loss and dysfunction of dopaminergic neurons located in the substantia nigra, which contain a variety of misfolded Î±-synuclein (Î±-syn). Medications that increase or substitute for dopamine can be used for the treatment of PD. Recently, numerous studies have shown gut microbiota plays a crucial role in regulating and maintaining multiple aspects of host physiology including host metabolism and neurodevelopment. In this review article, the role of gut microbiota in the etiological mechanism of PD will be reviewed. Furthermore, we discussed current pharmaceutical medicine-based methods to prevent and treat PD, followed by describing specific strains that affect the host brain function through the gut-brain axis. We explained in detail how gut microbiota directly produces neurotransmitters or regulate the host biosynthesis of neurotransmitters. The neurotransmitters secreted by the intestinal lumen bacteria may induce epithelial cells to release molecules that, in turn, can regulate neural signaling in the enteric nervous system and subsequently control brain function and behavior through the brain-gut axis. Finally, we proved that the microbial regulation of the host neuronal system.

32112917,The Link between Gut Dysbiosis and Neuroinflammation in Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. Despite its high frequency the etiology is still unclear; several lines of evidence show that an inflammatory process is implicated in the pathogenesis of this disorder; where activation of brain microglia plays a central role in the damage of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra. Such inflammation has been attributed to the toxic effect of aggregated Î±-synuclein; however, evidence also implicates an altered gut microbiota (dysbiosis) through the systemic release of endotoxins such as lipopolysaccharide and other metabolic products. This exposure may be enhanced by increased permeability of the intestinal (""leaky gut"") and the blood brain barrier; enhancing the entrance of microbiota-produced substances into the central nervous system. In this manuscript, we explore the evidence from clinical and basic science implicating microglia activation by gut dysbiosis and how this phenomenon may impact in the symptomatology and progression of PD.",Neuroscience,2020,JosÃ© Fidel Baizabal-Carvallo; Marlene Alonso-Juarez

Alterations in the microbiome metabolism affect the body homeostasis and they have been associated with the development of different human neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, autism spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder, depression, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, posttraumatic stress disorder and schizophrenia. The development of these complex diseases is influenced by various factors, including genetic predisposition and environmental triggers. Gut microbiota has recently emerged as an important actor in their physiopathology that has been shown to play a role in inflammation, oxidative stress, and gut permeability. Therefore, targeting the metabolites that are produced by or associated with the gut microbiota may help us understand how imbalance in the gut-brain axis affects human health.

Accumulating evidence suggests that perturbation of the gut microbiota contributes to the pathophysiology of mental illnesses including autism, depression and anxiety as well as neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.

Despite its prevalence, the pathophysiology of PD is not well understood. Recent studies highlight the role of gut microbiota in neurological disorders. In this review, we summarize the potential role of gut microbiota in the pathophysiology of PD. We first describe how gut microbiota can be influenced by factors predisposing individuals to PD, such as environmental toxins, aging, and host genetics. We then highlight the effect of gut microbiota on mechanisms implicated in the pathophysiology of PD, including disrupted microbiota gut brain axis (GBA), barrier dysfunction, and immune dysfunction. It is too early to connect the dots between gut microbiota and PD to establish causation, and experiments focused on investigating interrelationship between gut microbiota and associated metabolites on GBA, barrier dysfunction, and immune activation will be crucial to fill in the gaps.

32733812,Human Gut-Microbiota Interaction in Neurodegenerative Disorders and Current Engineered Tools for Its Modeling.,"The steady increase in life-expectancy of world population, coupled to many genetic and environmental factors (for instance, pre- and post-natal exposures to environmental neurotoxins), predispose to the onset of neurodegenerative diseases, whose prevalence is expected to increase dramatically in the next years. Recent studies have proposed links between the gut microbiota and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Human body is a complex structure where bacterial and human cells are almost equal in numbers, and most microbes are metabolically active in the gut, where they potentially influence other target organs, including the brain. The role of gut microbiota in the development and pathophysiology of the human brain is an area of growing interest for the scientific community. Several microbial-derived neurochemicals involved in the gut-microbiota-brain crosstalk seem implicated in the biological and physiological basis of neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration. Evidence supporting these connections has come from model systems, but there are still unsolved issues due to several limitations of available research tools. New technologies are recently born to help understanding the causative role of gut microbes in neurodegeneration. This review aims to make an overview of recent advances in the study of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in the field of neurodegenerative disorders by: (a) identifying specific microbial pathological signaling pathways; (b) characterizing new, advanced engineered tools to study the interactions between human cells and gut bacteria.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2020,Florencia Andrea Ceppa; Luca Izzo; Lorenzo Sardelli; Ilaria Raimondi; Marta Tunesi; Diego Albani; Carmen Giordano

Bioactive compounds from the microbial community harboring the human gut are involved in a finely tuned network of interconnections with the host, orchestrating a wide variety of physiological processes. These includes the bi-directional crosstalk between the central nervous system, the enteric nervous system, and the gastrointestinal tract (i.e., gut-brain axis). The increasing accumulation of evidence suggest a pivotal role of the composition and activity of the gut microbiota in neurodegeneration. In the present review we aim to provide an overview of the state-of-the-art of meta-omics sciences including metagenomics for the study of microbial genomes and taxa strains, metatranscriptomics for gene expression, metaproteomics and metabolomics to identify and/or quantify microbial proteins and metabolites, respectively. The potential and limitations of each discipline were highlighted, as well as the advantages of an integrated approach (multi-omics) to predict microbial functions and molecular mechanisms related to human diseases. Particular emphasis is given to the latest results obtained with these approaches in an attempt to elucidate the link between the gut microbiota and the most common neurodegenerative diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).",International journal of molecular sciences,2020,Bruno Tilocca; Luisa Pieroni; Alessio Soggiu; Domenico Britti; Luigi Bonizzi; Paola Roncada; Viviana Greco

In the current study, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) induced characteristic PD neurobehavior changes accompanied by increased Î±-synuclein, apoptotic protein Bim, and cleaved caspase-3 and decreased expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Meanwhile, the tryptophan (Trp) and tyrosine (Tyr) neurotransmitter metabolites involving kynurenine (KYN), serotonin (5-HT), and dopamine (DA) pathways were significantly changed in serum. Furthermore, the step-limited enzymes, which are responsible for the key metabolic pathways of these neurotransmitters, were obviously dysregulated. The 16S rRNA gene sequence results indicated that the abundance and diversity of the microbiota were obviously decreased in MPTP-treated mice, the presence of <i>Ruminococcus, Parabacteroides</i> and <i>Parasutterella</i> genera were obviously increased, while Coriobacteriaceae, <i>Flavonifractor</i>, Lachnospiraceae, Lactobacillaceae, and Rikenellaceae abundance was markedly decreased. The connectivity between the gut microbiota and neurotransmitter metabolism revealed that the gut microbiota dysbiosis was associated with disturbance of the DA, KYN, and 5-HT metabolic pathways. Therefore, our results provide evidence that gut-microbiota-brain axis disturbance may play an important role in PD development and targeting this axis might provide a promising therapeutic strategy for PD.",ACS chemical neuroscience,2020,Yuanhui Zhu; Fei Huan; Junfeng Wang; Xuexue Xie; Guoqin Yu; Xi Wang; Lei Jiang; Rong Gao; Hang Xiao; Haixia Ding; Jun Wang

The prevalence of PD increases with age and the number of individuals diagnosed with PD is expected to double from 6.9 million in 2015 to 14.2 million in 2040. To date, no drugs can stop the ongoing neurodegeneration caused by PD due to its unclear and complex pathogenic mechanisms. It has been wildly recognized that both gut microbiota and neuro-immunity are involved in the pathology of PD.

33390888,Caffeine and Parkinson's Disease: Multiple Benefits and Emerging Mechanisms.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by dopaminergic neurodegeneration, motor impairment and non-motor symptoms. Epidemiological and experimental investigations into potential risk factors have firmly established that dietary factor caffeine, the most-widely consumed psychoactive substance, may exerts not only neuroprotective but a motor and non-motor (cognitive) benefits in PD. These multi-benefits of caffeine in PD are supported by convergence of epidemiological and animal evidence. At least six large prospective epidemiological studies have firmly established a relationship between increased caffeine consumption and decreased risk of developing PD. In addition, animal studies have also demonstrated that caffeine confers neuroprotection against dopaminergic neurodegeneration using PD models of mitochondrial toxins (MPTP, 6-OHDA, and rotenone) and expression of Î±-synuclein (Î±-Syn). While caffeine has complex pharmacological profiles, studies with genetic knockout mice have clearly revealed that caffeine's action is largely mediated by the brain adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptor (A<sub>2A</sub>R) and confer neuroprotection by modulating neuroinflammation and excitotoxicity and mitochondrial function. Interestingly, recent studies have highlighted emerging new mechanisms including caffeine modulation of Î±-Syn degradation with enhanced autophagy and caffeine modulation of gut microbiota and gut-brain axis in PD models. Importantly, since the first clinical trial in 2003, United States FDA has finally approved clinical use of the A<sub>2A</sub>R antagonist istradefylline for the treatment of PD with OFF-time in Sept. 2019. To realize therapeutic potential of caffeine in PD, genetic study of caffeine and risk genes in human population may identify useful pharmacogenetic markers for predicting individual responses to caffeine in PD clinical trials and thus offer a unique opportunity for ""personalized medicine"" in PD.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2020,Xiangpeng Ren; Jiang-Fan Chen
32247371,The gut microbiome in Parkinson's disease: A culprit or a bystander?,"In recent years, large-scale metagenomics projects such as the Human Microbiome Project placed the gut microbiota under the spotlight of research on its role in health and in the pathogenesis several diseases, as it can be a target for novel therapeutical approaches. The emerging concept of a microbiota modulation of the gut-brain axis in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders has been explored in several studies in animal models, as well as in human subjects. Particularly, research on changes in the composition of gut microbiota as a potential trigger for alpha-synuclein (Î±-syn) pathology in Parkinson's disease (PD) has gained increasing interest. In the present review, we first provide the basis to the understanding of the role of gut microbiota in healthy subjects and the molecular basis of the gut-brain interaction, focusing on metabolic and neuroinflammatory factors that could trigger the alpha-synuclein conformational changes and aggregation. Then, we critically explored preclinical and clinical studies reporting on the changes in gut microbiota in PD, as compared to healthy subjects. Furthermore, we examined the relationship between the gut microbiota and PD clinical features, discussing data consistently reported across studies, as well as the potential sources of inconsistencies. As a further step toward understanding the effects of gut microbiota on PD, we discussed the relationship between dysbiosis and response to dopamine replacement therapy, focusing on Levodopa metabolism. We conclude that further studies are needed to determine whether the gut microbiota changes observed so far in PD patients is the cause or, instead, it is merely a consequence of lifestyle changes associated with the disease. Regardless, studies so far strongly suggest that changes in microbiota appears to be impactful in pathogenesis of neuroinflammation. Thus, dysbiotic microbiota in PD could influence the disease course and response to medication, especially Levodopa.

32157731,EGCG ameliorates neuronal and behavioral defects by remodeling gut microbiota and TotM expression in Drosophila models of Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. Eigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the major polyphenol in green tea, is known to exert a beneficial effect on PD patients. Although some mechanisms were suggested to underlie this intervention, it remains unknown if the EGCG-mediated protection was achieved by remodeling gut microbiota. In the present study, 0.1 mM or 0.5 mM EGCG was administered to the Drosophila melanogaster with PINK1 (PTEN induced putative kinase 1) mutations, a prototype PD model, and their behavioral performances, as well as neuronal/mitochondrial morphology (only for 0.5 mM EGCG treatment) were determined. According to the results, the mutant PINK1<sup>B9</sup> flies exhibited dopaminergic, survival, and behavioral deficits, which were rescued by EGCG supplementation. Meanwhile, EGCG resulted in profound changes in gut microbial compositions in PINK1<sup>B9</sup> flies, restoring the abundance of a set of bacteria. Notably, EGCG protection was blunted when gut microbiota was disrupted by antibiotics. We further isolated four bacterial strains from fly guts and the supplementation of individual Lactobacillus plantarum or Acetobacter pomorum strain exacerbated the neuronal and behavioral dysfunction of PD flies, which could not be rescued by EGCG. Transcriptomic analysis identified TotM as the central gene responding to EGCG or microbial manipulations. Genetic ablation of TotM blocked the recovery activity of EGCG, suggesting that EGCG-mediated protection warrants TotM. Apart from familial form, EGCG was also potent in improving sporadic PD symptoms induced by rotenone treatment, wherein gut microbiota shared regulatory roles. Together, our results suggest the relevance of the gut microbiota-TotM pathway in EGCG-mediated neuroprotection, providing insight into indirect mechanisms underlying nutritional intervention of Parkinson's disease.",FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,2020,Yi Xu; Mengmeng Xie; Jinsong Xue; Ling Xiang; Yali Li; Jie Xiao; Guiran Xiao; Hui-Li Wang
31843492,Alterations of the gut microbiota with antibiotics protects dopamine neuron loss and improve motor deficits in a pharmacological rodent model of Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating condition resulting in motor and non-motor symptoms affecting approximately 10 million people worldwide. Currently, there are no pharmacological treatments that can cure the condition or effectively halt its progression. The focus of PD research has been primarily on the neurobiological basis and consequences of dopamine (DA) neuron degeneration given that the loss of DA neurons projecting from the substantia nigra to the dorsal striatum results in the development of cardinal PD motor symptoms. Alternatively, gastrointestinal dysfunction is well recognized in PD patients, and often occurs prior to the development of motor symptoms. The gut microbiota, which contains thousands of bacterial species, play important roles in intestinal barrier integrity and function, metabolism, immunity and brain function. Pre-clinical and clinical studies suggest an important link between alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota and psychiatric and neurological conditions, including PD. Several reports have documented gut dysbiosis and alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota in PD patients. Therefore, the goal of this study was to explore the contribution of the gut microbiota to the behavioral and neurochemical alterations in a rodent toxin model of DA depletion that reproduces the motor symptoms associated with PD. We observed that chronic treatment of adult rats with non-absorbable antibiotics ameliorates the neurotoxicity of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in a unilateral lesion model. Specifically, immunohistochemistry against the dopaminergic neuron marker tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) showed an attenuation of the degree of 6-OHDA-induced dopaminergic neuron loss in antibiotic treated animals compared to control animals. In addition, we observed a reduction in the expression of pro-inflammatory markers in the striatum of antibiotic-treated animals. The degree of motor dysfunction after 6-OHDA was also attenuated in antibiotic-treated animals as measured by paw-rearing measurements in the cylinder test, forepaw stepping test, and ipsilateral rotations observed in the amphetamine-induced rotation test. These results implicate the gut microbiota as a potential contributor to pathology in the development of PD. Further studies are necessary to understand the specific mechanisms involved in transducing alterations in the gut microbiota to changes in dopaminergic neuron loss and motor dysfunction.",Experimental neurology,2020,Dimitri N Koutzoumis; Macarena Vergara; Jose Pino; Julia Buddendorff; Habibeh Khoshbouei; Ronald J Mandel; Gonzalo E Torres

32226375,Microbiota and Other Preventive Strategies and Non-genetic Risk Factors in Parkinson's Disease.,"The exact cause of Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease in modern societies, is still unknown. Many scientists point out that PD is caused by a complex interaction between different factors. Although the main risk factor is age, there are other influences, genetic and environmental, that individually or in combination may trigger neurodegenerative changes leading to PD. Nowadays, research remains focused on better understanding which environmental factors are related to the risk of developing PD and why. In line with the knowledge on evidence on exposures that prevent/delay PD onset or that impact on disease progression, the aims of this review were: (i) to comment on the non-genetic risk factors that mainly affect idiopathic PD; and (ii) to comment on seemingly reliable preventive interventions. We discuss both environmental factors that may affect the central nervous system (CNS) or the intestinal tract, and the likely mechanisms underlying noxious or protective actions. Knowledge on risk, protective factors, and mechanisms may help to envisage why nigral dopaminergic neurons are so vulnerable in PD and, eventually, to design new strategies for PD prevention and/or anti-PD therapy. This article reviews the variety of the known and suspected environmental factors, such as lifestyle, gut microbiota or pesticide exposition, and distinguishes between those that are harmful or beneficial for the PD acquisition or progression. In fact, the review covers one of the most novel players in the whole picture, and we address the role of microbiota on keeping a healthy CNS and/or on preventing the ""side-effects"" related to aging.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2020,Rafael Franco; Rafael Rivas-Santisteban; Irene Reyes-Resina; Gemma Navarro; Eva MartÃ­nez-Pinilla
32473843,Microbiota-gut-brain axis in health and disease: Is NLRP3 inflammasome at the crossroads of microbiota-gut-brain communications?,"Growing evidence highlights the relevance of microbiota-gut-brain axis in the maintenance of brain homeostasis as well as in the pathophysiology of major neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), multiple sclerosis (MS), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). In particular, changes in gut microbiota can promote enteric and peripheral neurogenic/inflammatory responses, which, in turn, could contribute to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in the central nervous system (CNS). Of note, the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain leucine rich repeat and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome acts as a key player in both coordinating the host physiology and shaping the peripheral and central immune/inflammatory responses in CNS diseases. In this context, there is pioneering evidence supporting the existence of a microbiota-gut-inflammasome-brain axis, in which enteric bacteria modulate, via NLRP3 signaling, inflammatory pathways that, in turn, contribute to influence brain homeostasis. The present review provides an overview of current knowledge on the role of microbiota-gut-inflammasome-brain axis in the major CNS diseases, including PD, AD, MS, ASD and MDD. In particular, though no direct and causal correlation among altered gut microbiota, NLRP3 activation and brain pathology has been demonstrated and in-depth studies are needed in this setting, our purpose was to pave the way to a novel and pioneering perspective on the pathophysiology of CNS disorders. Our intent was also to highlight and discuss whether alterations of microbiota-gut-inflammasome-brain axis support a holistic view of the pathophysiology of CNS diseases, even though each disorder displays a different clinical picture.",Progress in neurobiology,2020,Carolina Pellegrini; Luca Antonioli; Vincenzo Calderone; Rocchina Colucci; Matteo Fornai; Corrado Blandizzi
31854093,"The gut in Parkinson's disease: Bottom-up, top-down, or neither?","The gut-brain axis is a hot topic in Parkinson's disease. In an attempt to decipher its role in the disease pathogenesis, several animal models have been developed. Most of these models tried to reproduce Braak's hypothesis by showing that the pathological process could spread from the gut to the brain (bottom-up scenario). Interestingly, others groups showed that a top-down scenario could also occur and that 6-hydroxydopamine-induced nigrostriatal denervation was sufficient to induce significant changes in the gastrointestinal tract. Aside from this toxic approach, the article by O'Donovan and colleagues in this edition of Neurogastroenterology and Motility showed that bilateral nigral injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-alpha-synuclein in rats was accompanied by changes in the enteric nervous system and the gut microbiota, which occurred without any apparent brain-to-gut spread of human injected alpha-synuclein. Some changes observed in the gastrointestinal tract of animals injected with AAV-alpha-synuclein were in line with previous observations in Parkinson's disease patients, including increased expression of glial markers, swollen tyrosine hydroxylase-positive varicosities in the submucosal plexus, and decreases in Faecalibacterium and Lachnospiraceae. These findings suggest that, in addition to gut-brain pathways, the brain-to-gut communication may also be involved in Parkinson's disease pathophysiology. In this mini-review, we describe the strengths and limitations of the existing studies on the gut-brain axis in experimental models of parkinsonism and discuss an alternative hypothesis in which the central and enteric nervous system would evolve separately during disease progression.",Neurogastroenterology and motility,2020,LaurÃ¨ne Leclair-Visonneau; Michel Neunlist; Pascal Derkinderen; Thibaud Lebouvier
32941730,Gut Microbiota Dynamics in Parkinsonian Mice.,"Peripheral immunity is thought to be dysregulated in Parkinson's disease (PD) and may provide an avenue for novel immunotherapeutic interventions. Gut microbiota is a potential factor for modulating immunotherapy response. Considering the possibly complex role of the gut-brain axis in PD, we used a preclinical model to determine the effects of gut microbiota dynamics in mice receiving an immunotherapeutic intervention compared to controls. A total of 17 M83 heterozygous transgenic mice were used in this study. Mice in the treatment arm (<i>N</i> = 10) received adoptive cellular therapy (ACT) by injection, and control mice (<i>N</i> = 7) were injected with saline at 8 weeks of age. All mice received peripheral Î±-syn fibrils to hasten parkinsonian symptoms via an intramuscular injection 1 week later (9 weeks of age; baseline). Fecal pellets were collected from all mice at three time points postinjection (baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks). DNA from each stool sample was extracted, and 16S rDNA was amplified, sequenced, and analyzed using QIIME2 and RStudio. Differences in the relative abundance of bacterial taxa were observed over time between groups. No significant differences in alpha diversity were found between groups at any time point. UniFrac measures of phylogenetic distance between samples demonstrated distinct clustering between groups postbaseline (<i>p</i> = 0.002).

33153085,Do the Bugs in Your Gut Eat Your Memories? Relationship between Gut Microbiota and Alzheimer's Disease.,"The human microbiota is composed of trillions of microbial cells inhabiting the oral cavity, skin, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, airways, and reproductive organs. The gut microbiota is composed of dynamic communities of microorganisms that communicate bidirectionally with the brain via cytokines, neurotransmitters, hormones, and secondary metabolites, known as the gut microbiota-brain axis. The gut microbiota-brain axis is suspected to be involved in the development of neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease, and Autism Spectrum Disorder. AD is an irreversible, neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS), characterized by amyloid-Î² plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuroinflammation. Microglia and astrocytes, the resident immune cells of the CNS, play an integral role in AD development, as neuroinflammation is a driving factor of disease severity. The gut microbiota-brain axis is a novel target for Alzheimer's disease therapeutics to modulate critical neuroimmune and metabolic pathways. Potential therapeutics include probiotics, prebiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, and dietary intervention. This review summarizes our current understanding of the role of the gut microbiota-brain axis and neuroinflammation in the onset and development of Alzheimer's disease, limitations of current research, and potential for gut microbiota-brain axis targeted therapies.",Brain sciences,2020,Emily M Borsom; Keehoon Lee; Emily K Cope
33418492,Gut microbiota-derived metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide as a biomarker in early Parkinson's disease.,"This study aimed to investigate the potential of using changes in the plasma levels of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a gut microbiota-derived metabolite, as a biomarker in early Parkinson's disease (PD).Plasma TMAO levels were measured in 85 patients with drug-naÃ¯ve early stage PD and 20 healthy controls. A linear mixed model was used to assess longitudinal changes in levodopa-equivalent dose (LED) during follow-up (>2 y) in three tertile PD groups according to plasma TMAO levels. Additionally, a Cox regression analysis was performed to assess the effect of plasma TMAO levels on dementia conversion.Plasma TMAO levels of patients with PD were lower than those of healthy controls. A linear mixed model demonstrated that patients with PD and lower levels of TMAO (<4.75 Î¼mol/L; i.e., lowest tertile group) exhibited faster increases in LED over time. The Cox regression model did not reveal that plasma TMAO level was associated with the risk for dementia conversion (P = 0.488). However, when we divided patients with PD into two subgroups according to bet cutoff TMAO level to maximize the log-rank statistics, the PD group with a low plasma TMAO level (<6.92 Î¼mol/L) had a higher risk (with borderline statistical significance) for PD-dementia conversion than the group with a high TMAO level (hazard ratio: 7.565; 95% confidence interval, 1.004-57.019; P = 0.050).The results demonstrate that lower baseline plasma TMAO levels are associated with faster increases in LED and tend to increase the risk for PD-dementia conversion, suggesting the prognostic implications of TMAO in early stage PD.","Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)",2021,Seok Jong Chung; John Hoon Rim; Dajeong Ji; Sangwon Lee; Han Soo Yoo; Jin Ho Jung; KyoungWon Baik; Yonghoon Choi; Byoung Seok Ye; Young H Sohn; Mijin Yun; Sang-Guk Lee; Phil Hyu Lee

Foods, common drugs, and the polyphenolic compounds contained in wine modulate health both directly and through the gut microbiota. This observation and novel findings centered on nutrition, biochemistry, and metabolism, as well as the newer insights we gain into the microbiota-gut-brain axis, now lead us to propose a shunt to this classic triad, which involves the heart and cerebrovascular systems.

32161568,Gut Microbiota Altered in Mild Cognitive Impairment Compared With Normal Cognition in Sporadic Parkinson's Disease.,"<b>Background and Aim:</b> Gut bacteria play an important role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the alteration of fecal microbiota in PD with cognitive impairment remains unexplored. This study aimed to explore whether the gut microbiota of patients with PD having mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) were different from those with PD having normal cognition (PD-NC) and from healthy controls (HC). Also, the study probed the association between altered gut microbiota and cognitive ability in patients with PD. <b>Methods:</b> The fecal bacteria composition and short-chain fatty acids of 13 patients with PD-MCI, 14 patients with PD-NC, and 13 healthy spouses were analyzed using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. <b>Results:</b> Compared with HC, the fecal microbial diversities increased in patients with PD-MCI and PD-NC. After adjusting the influence of age, sex, body mass index, education, and constipation using the statistical method, the relative abundances of two families (Rikenellaceae and Ruminococcaceae) and four genera (<i>Alistipes, Barnesiella, Butyricimonas</i>, and <i>Odoribacter</i>) were found to be higher in the feces of the PD-MCI group compared with the other two groups. Moreover, the abundance of genus <i>Blautia</i> and <i>Ruminococcus</i> decreased obviously in the PD-MCI group compared with the PD-NC group. Further, the abundance of genera <i>Butyricimonas, Barnesiella, Alistipes, Odoribacter</i>, and <i>Ruminococcus</i> negatively correlated with cognition ability. <b>Conclusion:</b> Compared with HC and patients with PD-NC, the gut microbiota of patients with PD-MCI was significantly altered, particularly manifesting in enriched genera from Porphyromonadaceae family and decreased the abundance of genera <i>Blautia</i> and <i>Ruminococcus</i>.",Frontiers in neurology,2020,Tengzhu Ren; Yuyuan Gao; Yihui Qiu; Shuolin Jiang; Qingxi Zhang; Jiahui Zhang; Limin Wang; Yuhu Zhang; Lijuan Wang; Kun Nie
33262001,Molecular imaging of microbiota-gut-brain axis: searching for the right targeted probe for the right target and disease.,"The highly bidirectional dialogue between the gut and the brain is markedly stimulated and influenced by the microbiome through integrated neuroendocrine, neurological and immunological processes. Gut microbiota itself communicate with the host producing hormonal intermediates, metabolites, proteins, and toxins responsible for a variety of biochemical and functional inputs, thereby shaping host homeostasis. Indeed, a dysregulated microbiota-gut-brain axis might be the origin of many neuroimmune-mediated disorders, e.g. autism, multiple sclerosis, depression, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, which appear months or even years prior to a diagnosis, corroborating the theory that the pathological process is spread from the gut to the brain. A much deeper comprehension of how commensal microbe can be manipulated to interfere with disease progression is crucial for developing new strategies to diagnose and treat diseases. In recent years, the potential of positron-emission-tomography (PET) in the field of bacteria detection has gained attention. The uptake of several PET tracers has been evaluated to investigate infection pathophysiology, e.g. sterile or pathogen-mediated infection, monitoring of progression, or as a surrogate endpoint in clinical trials. In this minireview, we briefly describe the role of microbiome-gut-brain axis in health and disease and we discuss the imaging modalities and agents that could be applied to study the dynamic interactions between microbiome, gut and brain. These are key aspects in understanding the biochemical lexicon underpinning the microbiome-host crosstalk that would enable the development of diagnostics and therapeutics by targeting the human microbiota.",Nuclear medicine and biology,2021,Maria Cecilia Giron; Ulderico Mazzi
32325848,Can Gut Microbiota Be a Good Predictor for Parkinson's Disease? A Machine Learning Approach.,"The involvement of the gut microbiota in Parkinson's disease (PD), investigated in several studies, identified some common alterations of the microbial community, such as a decrease in <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> and an increase in <i>Verrucomicrobiaceae</i> families in PD patients. However, the results of other bacterial families are often contradictory. Machine learning is a promising tool for building predictive models for the classification of biological data, such as those produced in metagenomic studies. We tested three different machine learning algorithms (random forest, neural networks and support vector machines), analyzing 846 metagenomic samples (472 from PD patients and 374 from healthy controls), including our published data and those downloaded from public databases. Prediction performance was evaluated by the area under curve, accuracy, precision, recall and F-score metrics. The random forest algorithm provided the best results. Bacterial families were sorted according to their importance in the classification, and a subset of 22 families has been identified for the prediction of patient status. Although the results are promising, it is necessary to train the algorithm with a larger number of samples in order to increase the accuracy of the procedure.",Brain sciences,2020,Daniele Pietrucci; Adelaide Teofani; Valeria Unida; Rocco Cerroni; Silvia Biocca; Alessandro Stefani; Alessandro Desideri
33338469,Gut-Brain axis in Parkinson's disease etiology: The role of lipopolysaccharide.,"Recent studies highlight the initiation of Parkinson's disease (PD) in the gastrointestinal tract, decades before the manifestations in the central nervous system (CNS). This gut-brain axis of neurodegenerative diseases defines the critical role played by the unique microbial composition of the ""second brain"" formed by the enteric nervous system (ENS). Compromise in the enteric wall can result in the translocation of gut-microbiota along with their metabolites into the system that can affect the homeostatic machinery. The released metabolites can associate with protein substrates affecting several biological pathways. Among these, the bacterial endotoxin from Gram-negative bacteria, i.e., Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), has been implicated to play a definite role in progressive neurodegeneration. The molecular interaction of the lipid metabolites can have a direct neuro-modulatory effect on homeostatic protein components that can be transported to the CNS via the vagus nerve. Î±-synuclein (Î±-syn) is one such partner protein, the molecular interactions with which modulate its overall fibrillation propensity in the system. LPS interaction has been shown to affect the protein's aggregation kinetics in an alternative inflammatory pathway of PD pathogenesis. Several other lipid contents from the bacterial membranes could also be responsible for the initiation of Î±-syn amyloidogenesis. The present review will focus on the intermolecular interactions of Î±-syn with bacterial lipid components, particularly LPS, with a definite clinical manifestation in PD pathogenesis. However, deconvolution of the sequence of interaction events from the ENS to its propagation in the CNS is not easy or obvious. Nevertheless, the characterization of these lipid-mediated structures is a step towards realizing the novel targets in the pre-emptive diagnoses of PD. This comprehensive description should prompt the correlation of potential risk of amyloidogenesis upon detection of specific paradigm shifts in the microbial composition of the gut.",Chemistry and physics of lipids,2021,Dipita Bhattacharyya; Anirban Bhunia
32035595,Polyphenols in the management of brain disorders: Modulation of the microbiota-gut-brain axis.,"The modulation of the microbiota-gut-brain axis with a view to preventing and treating brain disorders became recently a hot topic for the scientific community. Dietary polyphenols are multifaceted compounds that have demonstrated to be highly advantageous to counteract inflammation, oxidative stress, and neurodegeneration, among other pathological conditions, being useful in the prevention and treatment of several chronic disorders. The potential of these compounds to prevent and treat brain disorders has not been only related to their capacity to reach the brain, depending on their chemical structure, and interact directly with brain cells, but also to their ability to modulate the communication between the brain and the gut, interfering with multiple branches of this axis. Preclinical studies have demonstrated the potential of these food bioactive compounds in brain diseases, namely, neurodevelopmental, such as Down's syndrome and Autism spectrum disorder, neurodegenerative, such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, and psychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety. Until now, dietary polyphenols have been recognized as promising nutraceuticals to combat brain disorders. However, the impact of these compounds on the gut-brain interconnection remains poorly elucidated. Also, clinical assays are crucial to further support the beneficial effects of these compounds as demonstrated in preclinical research.",Advances in food and nutrition research,2020,Diana Serra; Leonor M Almeida; Teresa C P Dinis
32819577,Dcf1 deletion presents alterations in gut microbiota of mice similar to Parkinson's disease.,"The gut-brain communication is increasingly being recognized as a profound effector on Parkinson's disease (PD). Gut microbiota changes have become the focus of attention. However, the mechanism leading to changes in the gut microbiota is not clear. In the present study, we found that knockout of Dcf1 (Dcf1<sup>-/-</sup>) caused changes in the gut microbiota in mice. Results indicated that the increased Proteobacteria (phylum-level) and decreased Prevotellaceae (family-level) in the microbiota composition of Dcf1<sup>-/-</sup> (KO) mice, which is consistent with the situation of PD patients. On species-level, Prevotellaceae_UCG-001 and Helicobacter_ganmani were significantly different between KO and WT mice, suggesting glycolipid metabolism disorders and inflammatory lesions in KO mice. In the behavior of Y-maze and Open field test, KO mice showed typical PD symptoms such as memory deficits, slowness of movement and anxiety. Further Nissl staining of brain tissue sections confirmed that the deletion of Dcf1 caused damage to amygdala neurons. These results provide a new mechanism for understanding gut microbiota changes, and provide a new basis for PD treatment from a new perspective of Gut-brain axis.",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2020,Weihao Li; Qinpin Zhao; Jiao Wang; Yajiang Wang; Tieqiao Wen
32557853,Meta-Analysis of Gut Dysbiosis in Parkinson's Disease.,"PD may begin with the intestinal accumulation of Î±-synuclein fibrils, which can be causally associated with gut dysbiosis. The variability of gut microbiota across countries prevented us from identifying shared gut dysbiosis in PD.To identify gut dysbiosis in PD across countries.We performed 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing analysis of gut microbiota in 223 patients with PD and 137 controls, and meta-analyzed gut dysbiosis by combining our dataset with four previously reported data sets from the United States, Finland, Russia, and Germany. We excluded uncommon taxa from our analyses. For pathway analysis, we developed the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes orthology set enrichment analysis method.After adjusting for confounding factors (body mass index, constipation, sex, age, and catechol-O-methyl transferase inhibitor), genera Akkermansia and Catabacter, as well as families Akkermansiaceae, were increased, whereas genera Roseburia, Faecalibacterium, and Lachnospiraceae ND3007 group were decreased in PD. Catechol-O-methyl transferase inhibitor intake markedly increased family Lactobacillaceae. Inspection of these bacteria in 12 datasets that were not included in the meta-analysis revealed that increased genus Akkermansia and decreased genera Roseburia and Faecalibacterium were frequently observed across countries. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes orthology set enrichment analysis revealed changes in short-chain fatty acid metabolisms in our dataset.We report that intestinal mucin layer-degrading Akkermansia is increased and that short-chain fatty acid-producing Roseburia and Faecalibacterium are decreased in PD across countries.

31917834,"Adolescence and Aging: Impact of Adolescence Inflammatory Stress and Microbiota Alterations on Brain Development, Aging, and Neurodegeneration.","Puberty/adolescence is a critical phase during neurodevelopment with numerous structural, neurochemical, and molecular changes occurring in response to genetic and environmental signals. A consequence of this major neuronal reorganizing and remodeling is a heightened level of vulnerability to stressors and immune challenges. The gut microbiota is a fundamental modulator of stress and immune responses and has been found to play a role in mental health conditions and neurodegenerative disorders. Environmental insults (stress, infection, neuroinflammation, and use of antibiotics) during adolescence can result in dysbiosis subsidizing the development of brain disorders later in life. Also, pubertal neuroinflammatory insults can alter neurodevelopment, impact brain functioning in an enduring manner, and contribute to neurological disorders related to brain aging, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and depression. Exposure to probiotics during puberty can mitigate inflammation, reverse dysbiosis, and decrease vulnerabilities to brain disorders later in life. The goal of this review is to reveal the consequences of pubertal exposure to stress and immune challenges on the gut microbiota, immune reactivity within the brain, and the risk or resilience to stress-induced mental illnesses and neurodegenerative disorders. We propose that the consumption of probiotics during adolescence contribute to the prevention of brain pathologies in adulthood.","The journals of gerontology.

While bacteria-derived products can induce aversive responses and influence pain perception, recent work suggests that ""abnormal"" microbiota is associated with neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease or autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Here we review how the gut microbiota modulates afferent sensory neurons function and pain, highlighting the role of the microbiota/gut/brain axis in the control of behaviors and neurological diseases. We outline the changes in gut microbiota, known as dysbiosis, and their influence on painful gastrointestinal disorders. Furthermore, both direct host/microbiota interaction that implicates activation of ""pain-sensing"" neurons by metabolites, or indirect communication via immune activation is discussed. Finally, treatment options targeting the gut microbiota, including pre- or probiotics, will be proposed. Further studies on microbiota/nervous system interaction should lead to the identification of novel microbial ligands and host receptor-targeted drugs, which could ultimately improve chronic pain management and well-being.","Journal of neural transmission (Vienna, Austria : 1996)",2020,Manon Defaye; Sandie Gervason; Christophe Altier; Jean-Yves Berthon; Denis Ardid; Edith Filaire; FrÃ©dÃ©ric Antonio Carvalho
32710966,Polymannuronic acid prevents dopaminergic neuronal loss via brain-gut-microbiota axis in Parkinson's disease model.,"The study aims to investigate the potentially neuroprotective effects and underlying mechanisms for brown seaweed polysaccharide of polymannuronic acid (PM) against Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis. PD model mice were pretreated with PM via oral gavage once per day for 4Â weeks and the preventative effects of PM against neuronal loss together with its modulation on brain-gut-microbiota axis were systematically explored. The results showed PM administration improved motor functions by preventing dopaminergic neuronal loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and enhanced contents of striatal homovanillic acid (HVA), serotonin (5-HT), 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) and Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in PD mice. PM significantly alleviated inflammation in gut, brain and systemic circulation as shown by reduced levels or expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines concurrently and inhibited mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling pathway in mice colon. Meanwhile, PM greatly improved integrity of intestinal barrier and blood brain barrier (BBB) as indicated by increased expressions of tight junction associated proteins in both mice colon and SNpc. Further studies indicated PM treatment resulted in changes of gut microbial compositions, together with great alterations of digestion and metabolism of dietary proteins and fats, which led to surge increase of fecal short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the colon of PD mice. In conclusion, pre-administration of PM could provide neuroprotective effects against PD pathogenesis by suppressing inflammation in gut, brain and systemic circulation, and by improving integrity of intestinal barrier and BBB. PM might modulate brain-gut-microbiota axis, at least in part, via gut microbiota derived SCFAs as mediators.",International journal of biological macromolecules,2020,Xiao-Li Dong; Xiong Wang; Fang Liu; Xin Liu; Zhong-Rui Du; Robert W Li; Chang-Hu Xue; Ka-Hing Wong; Wing-Tak Wong; Qing Zhao; Qing-Juan Tang
32844199,Gut metagenomics-derived genes as potential biomarkers of Parkinson's disease.,"Identification of the gut microbiome compositions associated with disease has become a research focus worldwide. Emerging evidence has revealed the presence of gut microbiota dysbiosis in Parkinson's disease. In this study, we aimed to identify the gut microbiome associated with Parkinson's disease and subsequently to screen and to validate potential diagnostic biomarkers of Parkinson's disease. This case-control study investigated gut microbial genes in faeces from 40 volunteer Chinese patients with Parkinson's disease and their healthy spouses using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Furthermore, the identified specific gut microbial gene markers were validated with real-time PCR in an independent Chinese cohort of 78 Parkinson's disease patients, 75 control subjects, 40 patients with multiple system atrophy and 25 patients with Alzheimer's disease. We developed the first gut microbial gene catalogue associated with Parkinson's disease. Twenty-five gene markers were identified that distinguished Parkinson's disease patients from healthy control subjects, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.896 (95% confidence interval: 83.1-96.1%). A highly accurate Parkinson's disease index, which was not influenced by disease severity or Parkinson's disease medications, was created. Testing these gene markers using quantitative PCR distinguished Parkinson's disease patients from healthy controls not only in the 40 couples (AUC = 0.922, 95% confidence interval: 86.4-98.0%), but also in an independent group of 78 patients with Parkinson's disease and 75 healthy control subjects (AUC = 0.905, 95% confidence interval: 86.0-95.1%). This classifier also performed a differential diagnosis power in discriminating these 78 patients with Parkinson's disease from a cohort of 40 patients with multiple system atrophy and 25 patients with Alzheimer's disease based on the panel of 25 biomarkers.

32317956,Microbial BMAA and the Pathway for Parkinson's Disease Neurodegeneration.,"The neurotoxin Î²-<i>N</i>-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) is a natural non-proteinogenic diamino acid produced by several species of both prokaryotic (cyanobacteria) and eukaryotic (diatoms and dinoflagellates) microorganisms. BMAA has been shown to biomagnify through the food chain in some ecosystems, accumulating for example in seafood such as shellfish and fish, common dietary sources of BMAA whose ingestion may have possible neuronal consequences. In addition to its excitotoxic potential, BMAA has been implicated in protein misfolding and aggregation, inhibition of specific enzymes and neuroinflammation, all hallmark features of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the exact molecular mechanisms of neurotoxicity remain to be elucidated in detail. Although BMAA is commonly detected in its free form, complex BMAA-containing molecules have also been identified such as the paenilamicins, produced by an insect gut bacterial pathogen. On the other hand, production of BMAA or BMAA-containing molecules by members of the human gut microbiota, for example by non-photosynthetic cyanobacteria, the Melainabacteria, remains only hypothetical. In any case, should BMAA reach the gut it may interact with cells of the mucosal immune system and neurons of the enteric nervous system (ENS) and possibly target the mitochondria. Here, we review the available evidence and hint on possible mechanisms by which chronic exposure to dietary sources of this microbial neurotoxin may drive protein misfolding and mitochondrial dysfunction with concomitant activation of innate immune responses, chronic low-grade gut inflammation, and ultimately the neurodegenerative features observed across the gut-brain axis in Parkinson's disease (PD).",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2020,Daniela Nunes-Costa; JoÃ£o Duarte MagalhÃ£es; Maria G-Fernandes; Sandra Morais Cardoso; Nuno Empadinhas

Studies on changes to intestinal microbiota in Parkinson's patients were retrieved and systematically reviewed. Quality filtering, clustering and species annotation were performed on 16s sequencing raw data from retrieved studies to achieve comparability across studies. Alpha-diversity indices and a random effect model were used to analyse significantly altered microbiota. A total of nine studies were included in this retrospective analysis, four of which contained raw data. Alpha diversity was significantly different between control and Parkinson's disease patients in two of the four studies. Using the raw data from four individual studies, we observed differences in the phlya Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria. Additionally, differences were observed between control and Parkinson's disease patients at the level of family (Prevotellacaea and Lactobacillaceae) and genus (Bifidobacterium and Clostridium).

32768944,The gut microbiota attenuate neuroinflammation in manganese exposure by inhibiting cerebral NLRP3 inflammasome.,"Manganese (Mn) exposure has been reported to cause neurodegenerative disorders. Î²-Amyloid (AÎ²) induced Tau pathology in an NLRP3-dependent manner is at the heart of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in the bidirectional gut-brain axis that integrates the gut and central nervous system (CNS) activities. In this study, we found that Mn exposure increases AÎ²<sub>1-40</sub> and Tau production in brain, and causes hippocampal degeneration and necrosis. Meanwhile, Mn exposure can stimulate neurotoxicity by increasing inflammation either in peripheral blood and CNS. Importantly, we found that transplantation of gut microbiota from normal rats into Mn exposure rats reduced AÎ² and Tau expression, and the cerebral expression of NLRP3 was downregulated, and the expression of neuroinflammatory factors was also downregulated. Therefore, improving the composition of gut microbiota in Mn exposure rats can attenuate neuroinflammation, which is considered as a novel therapeutic strategy for Mn exposure by remodelling the gut microbiota.",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2020,Hui Wang; Feng Yang; Ruihua Xin; Dongan Cui; Jiongjie He; Shidong Zhang; Yan Sun
33293403,Short-Chain Fatty Acid-Producing Gut Microbiota Is Decreased in Parkinson's Disease but Not in Rapid-Eye-Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder.,"Gut dysbiosis has been repeatedly reported in Parkinson's disease (PD) but only once in idiopathic rapid-eye-movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) from Germany. Abnormal aggregation of Î±-synuclein fibrils causing PD possibly starts from the intestine, although this is still currently under debate. iRBD patients frequently develop PD. Early-stage gut dysbiosis that is causally associated with PD is thus expected to be observed in iRBD. We analyzed gut microbiota in 26 iRBD patients and 137 controls by 16S rRNA sequencing (16S rRNA-seq). Our iRBD data set was meta-analyzed with the German iRBD data set and was compared with gut microbiota in 223 PD patients. Unsupervised clustering of gut microbiota by LIGER, a topic model-based tool for single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis, revealed four enterotypes in controls, iRBD, and PD. Short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria were conserved in an enterotype observed in controls and iRBD, whereas they were less conserved in enterotypes observed in PD. Genus <i>Akkermansia</i> and family <i>Akkermansiaceae</i> were consistently increased in both iRBD in two countries and PD in five countries. Short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria were not significantly decreased in iRBD in two countries. In contrast, we previously reported that recognized or putative SCFA-producing genera <i>Faecalibacterium</i>, <i>Roseburia</i>, and <i>Lachnospiraceae ND3007 group</i> were consistently decreased in PD in five countries. In Î±-synucleinopathy, increase of mucin-layer-degrading genus <i>Akkermansia</i> is observed at the stage of iRBD, whereas decrease of SCFA-producing genera becomes obvious with development of PD.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Twenty studies on gut microbiota in PD have been reported, whereas only one study has been reported on iRBD from Germany. iRBD has the highest likelihood ratio to develop PD. Our meta-analysis of iRBD in Japan and Germany revealed increased mucin-layer-degrading genus <i>Akkermansia</i> in iRBD. Genus <i>Akkermansia</i> may increase the intestinal permeability, as we previously observed in PD patients, and may make the intestinal neural plexus exposed to oxidative stress, which can lead to abnormal aggregation of prion-like Î±-synuclein fibrils in the intestine. In contrast to PD, SCFA-producing bacteria were not decreased in iRBD. As SCFA induces regulatory T (Treg) cells, a decrease of SCFA-producing bacteria may be a prerequisite for the development of PD.

Antibiotic exposure can have long-term effects on the composition of human intestinal microbiota, but a potential connection between antibiotic exposure and risk of PD has not been studied previously.To evaluate the impact of antibiotic exposure on the risk of PD in a nationwide, register-based, case-control study.We identified all patients who were diagnosed with PD in Finland during the years 1998 to 2014. Information was obtained on individual purchases of orally administered antibiotics during the years 1993 to 2014. We assessed the association between prior antibiotic exposure and PD using conditional logistic regression.The study population consisted of 13,976 PD cases and 40,697 controls. The strongest connection with PD risk was found for oral exposure to macrolides and lincosamides (adjusted odds ratio up to 1.416; 95% confidence interval, 1.053-1.904). After correction for multiple comparisons, exposure to antianaerobics and tetracyclines 10 to 15âyears before the index date, sulfonamides and trimethoprim 1 to 5âyears before the index date, and antifungal medications 1 to 5âyears before the index date were positively associated with PD risk. In post hoc analyses, further positive associations were found for broad-spectrum antibiotics.Exposure to certain types of oral antibiotics seems to be associated with an elevated risk of PD with a delay that is consistent with the proposed duration of a prodromal period. The pattern of associations supports the hypothesis that effects on gut microbiota could link antibiotics to PD, but further studies are needed to confirm this.

33106549,Increased intestinal permeability and gut dysbiosis in the R6/2 mouse model of Huntington's disease.,"Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive, multifaceted neurodegenerative disease associated with weight loss and gut problems. Under healthy conditions, tight junction (TJ)Â proteins maintain the intestinal barrier integrity preventing bacterial translocation from the intestinal lumen to the systemic circulation. Reduction of TJs expression in Parkinson's disease patients has been linked with increased intestinal permeability-leaky gut syndrome. The intestine contains microbiota, most dominant phyla being Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes; in pathogenic or disease conditions the balance between these bacteria might be disrupted. The present study investigated whether there is evidence for an increased intestinal permeability and dysbiosis in the R6/2 mouse model of HD. Our data demonstrate that decreased body weight and body length in R6/2 mice is accompanied by a significant decrease in colon length and increased gut permeability compared to wild type littermates, without any significant changes in the protein levels of the tight junction proteins (occludin, zonula occludens). Moreover, we found an altered gut microbiota in R6/2 mice with increased relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and decreased of Firmicutes. Our results indicate an increased intestinal permeability and dysbiosis in R6/2 mice and further studies investigating the clinical relevance of these findings are warranted.",Scientific reports,2020,Tiberiu Loredan Stan; Rana Soylu-Kucharz; Stephen Burleigh; Olena Prykhodko; Ling Cao; Naomi Franke; Marie SjÃ¶gren; Caroline Haikal; Frida HÃ¥llenius; Maria BjÃ¶rkqvist
31654753,Emerging concepts of mitochondrial dysfunction in Parkinson's disease progression: Pathogenic and therapeutic implications.,"Mitochondria are very dynamic organelle which plays a multifactorial role for a broad range of physiological processes inside the cell to maintain neural circuit integrity. They are required for the generation of cellular energy, regulation of calcium homeostasis and controlling programmed cell death. Defective mitochondrial homeostasis is frequently reported in a broad range of neurological disorders. Many lines of evidence suggest that it plays an essential role in aging and neurodegeneration. Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder and its aetiology is still largely unexplored. Overwhelming evidences indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in PD pathogenesis. Various genes involved in maintaining the mitochondrial homeostasis are also associated with the PD pathophysiology. Alterations in mitochondrial functions such as generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), impaired mitophagy, altered mitochondrial dynamics, impaired mitochondrial biogenesis and Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering may precede the development of PD pathology. In addition, recent studies have also shown the involvement of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases including PD. In this context, mitochondria-targeted therapies that can ameliorate the mitochondrial abnormalities may have great promise in the prevention and treatment of PD. This review aims to discuss the mitochondrial dysfunction associated with PD pathogenesis, influence of microbiome on mitochondrial regulation and various mitochondrial targeted therapies that can improve the mitochondrial function and deplete the severity of the disease.",Mitochondrion,2020,Linchi Rani; Amal Chandra Mondal
32389857,Targeting the microbiota in pharmacology of psychiatric disorders.,"There is increasing interest in the role of the gut microbiota in health and disease. In particular, gut microbiota influences the Central Nervous System (CNS) development and homeostasis through neural pathways or routes involving the immune and circulatory systems. The CNS, in turn, shapes the intestinal flora through endocrine or stress-mediated responses. These overall bidirectional interactions, known as gut microbiota-brain axis, profoundly affect some brain functions, such as neurogenesis and the production of neurotransmitters, up to influence behavioral aspects of healthy subjects. Consequently, a dysfunction within this axis, as observed in case of dysbiosis, can have an impact on the behavior of a given individual (e.g. anxiety and depression) or on the development of pathologies affecting the CNS, such as autism spectrum disorders and neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease). It should be considered that the whole microbiota has a significant role not only on aspects concerning human physiology, such as harvesting of nutrients and energy from the ingested food or production of a wide range of bioactive compounds, but also has positive effects on the gastrointestinal barrier function and actively contributes to the pharmacokinetics of several compounds including neuropsychiatric drugs. Indeed, the microbiota is able to affect drug absorption and metabolism up to have an impact on drug activity and/or toxicity. On the other hand, drugs are able to shape the human gut microbiota itself, where these changes may contribute to their pharmacologic profile. Therefore, the emerging picture on the complex drug-microbiota bidirectional interplay will have considerable implications in the future not only in terms of clinical practice but also, upstream, on drug development.",Pharmacological research,2020,Alessia Pascale; Nicoletta Marchesi; Stefano Govoni; Annalisa Barbieri

Emerging evidence is supporting the use of various strategies that modulate gut microbiota to exert neurological and psychological changes. This includes the utilisation of probiotics as a natural and dietary intervention for brain health. Here, we showed the potential AD-reversal effects of <i>Lactobacillus</i> probiotics through feeding to our <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> AD model. The administration of <i>Lactobacillus</i> strains was able to rescue the rough eye phenotype (REP) seen in AD-induced <i>Drosophila</i>, with a more prominent effect observed upon the administration of <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> DR7 (DR7). Furthermore, we analysed the gut microbiota of the AD-induced <i>Drosophila</i> and found elevated levels of <i>Wolbachia</i>. The administration of DR7 restored the gut microbiota diversity of AD-induced <i>Drosophila</i> with a significant reduction in <i>Wolbachia</i>'s relative abundance, accompanied by an increase of <i>Stenotrophomonas</i> and <i>Acetobacter</i>. Through functional predictive analyses, <i>Wolbachia</i> was predicted to be positively correlated with neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's, Huntington's and Alzheimer's diseases, while <i>Stenotrophomonas</i> was negatively correlated with these neurodegenerative disorders. Altogether, our data exhibited DR7's ability to ameliorate the AD effects in our AD-induced <i>Drosophila</i>. Thus, we propose that <i>Wolbachia</i> be used as a potential biomarker for AD.",Beneficial microbes,2020,F H P Tan; G Liu; S-Y A Lau; M H Jaafar; Y-H Park; G Azzam; Y Li; M-T Liong
31576631,Nigral overexpression of Î±-synuclein in a rat Parkinson's disease model indicates alterations in the enteric nervous system and the gut microbiome.,"A hallmark feature of Parkinson's disease (PD) is the build-up of Î±-synuclein protein aggregates throughout the brain; however Î±-synuclein is also expressed in enteric neurons. Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and pathology are frequently reported in PD, including constipation, increased intestinal permeability, glial pathology, and alterations to gut microbiota composition. Î±-synuclein can propagate through neuronal systems but the site of origin of Î±-synuclein pathology, whether it be the gut or the brain, is still unknown. Physical exercise is associated with alleviating symptoms of PD and with altering the composition of the gut microbiota.This study investigated the effects of bilateral nigral injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-Î±-synuclein on enteric neurons, glia and neurochemistry, the gut microbiome, and bile acid metabolism in rats, some of whom were exposed to voluntary exercise.Nigral overexpression of Î±-synuclein resulted in significant neuronal loss in the ileal submucosal plexus with no change in enteric glia. In contrast, the myenteric plexus showed a significant increase in glial expression, while neuronal numbers were maintained. Concomitant alterations were observed in the gut microbiome and related bile acid metabolism. Voluntary running protected against neuronal loss, increased enteric glial expression, and modified gut microbiome composition in the brain-injected AAV-Î±-synuclein PD model.These results show that developing nigral Î±-synuclein pathology in this PD model exerts significant alterations on the enteric nervous system (ENS) and gut microbiome that are receptive to modification by exercise. This highlights brain to gut communication as an important mechanism in PD pathology.",Neurogastroenterology and motility,2020,Sarah M O'Donovan; Erin K Crowley; Jillian R-M Brown; Orla O'Sullivan; Olivia F O'Leary; Suzanne Timmons; Yvonne M Nolan; David J Clarke; Niall P Hyland; Susan A Joyce; Aideen M Sullivan; Cora O'Neill
32105745,Mercury sulfide-containing Hua-Feng-Dan and 70W (Rannasangpei) protect against LPS plus MPTP-induced neurotoxicity and disturbance of gut microbiota in mice.,"Mercury sulfides (HgS) are frequently included in Ayurveda, Tibetan and Chinese medicines to assist the presumed therapeutic effects, but the ethnopharmacology remains elusive. The present study examined the protective effects of Î±-HgS-containing Hua-Feng-Dan and Î²-HgS-containing 70 Wei-Zhen-Zhu-Wan (70W, Rannasangpei) against Parkinson's disease mice induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plus 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP).A single injection of LPS (5Â mg/kg ip) was given to adult male C57BL/6 mice, and 150 days later, the low dose of MPTP (15Â mg/kg, ip, for 4 days) was given to produce the ""two-hit"" Parkinson's disease model. Together with MPTP treatment, mice were fed with clinically-relevant doses of Hua-Feng-Dan (0.6Â g/kg) and 70W (0.2Â g/kg) for 35 days. Rotarod test was performed to examine muscle coordination capability. At the end of the experiment, brain was transcardially perfused with paraformaldehyde, the substantia nigra was sectioned for microglia (Iba1 staining) and dopaminergic neuron (THir staining) determination. Colon bacterial DNA was extracted and subjected to qPCR analysis with 16S rRNA probes.The low-grade, chronic neuroinflammation produced by LPS aggravated MPTP neurotoxicity, as evidenced by decreased motor activity, intensified microglia activation and loss of dopaminergic neurons. Both Hua-Feng-Dan and 70W increased rotarod activity and ameliorated the pathological lesions in the brain. In gut microbiomes examined, LPS plus MPTP increased Verrucomicrobiaceae, Methanobacteriaceae, Pronicromonosporaceae, and Clostridaceae species were attenuated by Hua-Feng-Dan and 70W.Î±-HgS-containing Hua-Feng-Dan and Î²-HgS-containing 70W at clinical doses protected against chronic LPS plus MPTP-induced toxicity to the brain and gut, suggesting HgS-containing traditional medicines could target gut microbiota as a mechanism of their therapeutic effects.",Journal of ethnopharmacology,2020,An-Ling Hu; Sheng Song; Yi Li; Shang-Fu Xu; Feng Zhang; Cen Li; Jie Liu
32871960,Fecal microbiota transplantation therapy for Parkinson's disease: A preliminary study.,"Imbalances in the gut microbiota mediate the progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is currently being explored as a potential therapy for PD. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of FMT on PD. Fifteen PD patients were included, 10 of them received FMT via colonoscopy (colonic FMT group) and 5 received FMT via nasal-jejunal tube (nasointestinal FMT group). The score of PSQI, HAMD, HAMA, PDQ-39, NMSQ and UPDRS-III significantly decreased after FMT treatment (all Pâ<â.05). Colonic FMT group showed significant improvement and longer maintenance of efficacy compared with nasointestinal FMT (Pâ=â.002). Two patients achieved self-satisfying outcomes that last for more than 24 months. However, nasointestinal FMT group had no significant therapeutic effect, although UPDRS-III score slightly reduced. There were no patients were satisfied with nasointestinal FMT for more than 3 months. Among 15 PD patients, there were 5 cases had adverse events (AEs), including diarrhea (2 cases), abdominal pain (2 cases) and flatulence (1 case). These AEs were mild and self-limiting. We conclude that FMT can relieve the motor and non-motor symptoms with acceptable safety in PD. Compared with nasointestinal FMT, colonic FMT seems better and preferable.",Medicine,2020,Liu-Jun Xue; Xiao-Zhong Yang; Qiang Tong; Peng Shen; Shi-Jie Ma; Shang-Nong Wu; Jin-Long Zheng; Hong-Gang Wang
33070123,A review on preventive role of ketogenic diet (KD) in CNS disorders from the gut microbiota perspective.,"The gut microbiota plays an important role in neurological diseases via the gut-brain axis. Many factors such as diet, antibiotic therapy, stress, metabolism, age, geography and genetics are known to play a critical role in regulating the colonization pattern of the microbiota. Recent studies have shown the role of the low carbohydrate, adequate protein, and high fat ""ketogenic diet"" in remodeling the composition of the gut microbiome and thereby facilitating protective effects in various central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Gut microbes are found to be involved in the pathogenesis of various CNS disorders like epilepsy, Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and stress, anxiety and depression. InÂ vivo studies have shown an intricate link between gut microbes and KD and specific microbes/probiotics proved useful in inÂ vivo CNS disease models. In the present review, we discuss the gut-brain bidirectional axis and the underlying mechanism of KD-based therapy targeting gut microbiome in inÂ vivo animal models and clinical studies in neurological diseases. Also, we tried to infer how KD by altering the microbiota composition contributes towards the protective role in various CNS disorders. This review helps to uncover the mechanisms that are utilized by the KD and gut microbiota to modulate gut-brain axis functions and may provide novel opportunities to target therapies to the gut to treat neurologic disorders.",Reviews in the neurosciences,2021,Kajal Rawat; Neha Singh; Puja Kumari; Lekha Saha
33291597,Adiponectin Role in Neurodegenerative Diseases: Focus on Nutrition Review.,"Adiponectin is an adipokine produced by adipose tissue. It has numerous beneficial effects. In particular, it improves metabolic effects and glucose homeostasis, lipid profile, and is involved in the regulation of cytokine profile and immune cell production, having anti-inflammatory and immune-regulatory effects. Adiponectin's role is already known in immune diseases and also in neurodegenerative diseases. Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, are a set of diseases of the central nervous system, characterized by a chronic and selective process of neuron cell death, which occurs mainly in relation to oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Lifestyle is able to influence the development of these diseases. In particular, unhealthy nutrition on gut microbiota, influences its composition and predisposition to develop many diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases, given the importance of the ""gut-brain"" axis. There is a strong interplay between Adiponectin, gut microbiota, and brain-gut axis. For these reasons, a healthy diet composed of healthy nutrients such as probiotics, prebiotics, polyphenols, can prevent many metabolic and inflammatory diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases and obesity. The special Adiponectin role should be taken into account also, in order to be able to use this component as a therapeutic molecule.",International journal of molecular sciences,2020,Rita Polito; Irene Di Meo; Michelangela Barbieri; Aurora Daniele; Giuseppe Paolisso; Maria Rosaria Rizzo
31606537,Protective role of cinnabar and realgar in Hua-Feng-Dan against LPS plus rotenone-induced neurotoxicity and disturbance of gut microbiota in rats.,"Hua-Feng-Dan (HFD) is a traditional Chinese medicine used for neurological disorders. HFD contains cinnabar (HgS) and realgar (As<sub>4</sub>S<sub>4</sub>). The ethnopharmacological basis of cinnabar and realgar in HFD is not known.To address the role of cinnabar and realgar in HFD-produced neuroprotection against neurodegenerative diseases and disturbance of gut microbiota.Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plus rotenone (ROT)-elicited rat dopaminergic (DA) neuronal damage loss was performed as a Parkinson's disease animal model. Rats were given a single injection of LPS. Four months later, rats were challenged with the threshold dose of ROT. The clinical dose of HFD was administered via feed, starting from ROT administration for 46 days. Behavioral dysfunction was detected by rotarod and Y-maze tests. DA neuron loss and microglial activation were assessed via immunohistochemical staining and western bolt analysis. The colon content was collected to extract bacterial DNA followed by real-time PCR analysis with 16S rRNA primers.LPS plus ROT induced neurotoxicity, as evidenced by DA neuron loss in substantia nigra, impaired behavioral functions and increased microglial activation. HFD-original (containing 10% cinnabar and 10% realgar) rescued loss of DA neurons, improved behavioral dysfunction and attenuated microglial activation. Compared with HFD-original, HFD-reduced (3% cinnabar and 3% realgar) was also effective, but to be a less extent, while HFD-removed (without cinnabar and realgar) was ineffective. In analysis of gut microbiome, the increased Verrucomicrobiaceae and Lactobacteriaceae, and the decreased Enterobacteeriaceae by LPS plus ROT were ameliorated by HFD-original, and to be the less extent by HFD-reduced.Cinnabar and realgar are active ingredients in HFD to exert beneficial effects in a neurodegenerative model and gut microbiota.",Journal of ethnopharmacology,2020,Ce Chen; Bin-Bin Zhang; An-Ling Hu; Huan Li; Jie Liu; Feng Zhang
31790727,"Twice subacute MPTP administrations induced time-dependent dopaminergic neurodegeneration and inflammation in midbrain and ileum, as well as gut microbiota disorders in PD mice.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common progressive neurodegenerative disease. PD produces a pathological state in the intestine and disordered gut microbiota (GM), which may be important for the pathogenesis and progression of PD, but it is not clear. To explore the conditions and characteristics of intestinal pathology and GM disorders when PD-related injuries occur, we used twice 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) subacute administration with an interval of 3 weeks (each was an intraperitoneal injection of 25â¯mg/kg MPTP for 5 consecutive days). We observed the changes in intestinal and brain immune status, intestinal barrier function and GM in different injury states one day, one week, and three weeks after the first stimulus and one day and one week after the second stimulus. Our study found that two subacute administrations of MPTP induced dopaminergic (DAergic) neuron injury and inflammation in the midbrain and ileum, impaired intestinal barrier function and GM disorders closely related to administration. These changes recovered after the first administration, but after repeated administration, some indicators showed more dramatic changes than during the first administration. Our results suggest that the intestinal tract is sensitive to PD-related injury, and the GM is susceptible to disturbances caused by intestinal function, which may be concerned in local immune disorders of the intestine.",Neurotoxicology,2020,Wenjun Xie; Jieying Gao; Rong Jiang; Xinrong Liu; Feng Lai; Yong Tang; Hong Xiao; Yan Jia; Qunhua Bai
32946938,Genetic variants of TAS2R38 bitter taste receptor associate with distinct gut microbiota traits in Parkinson's disease: A pilot study.,"The non-tasting form of the bitter taste receptor, TAS2R38, has been shown as a genetic risk factor associated with the development of Parkinson's disease (PD). Specific taste receptors that are expressed in the lower gastrointestinal tract may respond to alteration in gut microbiota composition, detecting bacterial molecules, and regulate immune responses. Given the importance of brain-gut-microbiota axis and gene-environment interactions in PD, we investigate the associations between the genetic variants of TAS2R38 and gut microbiota composition in 39 PD patients. The results confirm that the majority of PD patients have reduced sensitivity to 6-n-propylthiouracil (PROP) and are carriers of at least one non-functional TAS2R38 AVI haplotype. Moreover, we found this correlation to be associated with a reduction in bacteria alpha-diversity with a predominant reduction of Clostridium genus. We hypothesised that the high frequency of the non-taster form of TAS2R38 associated with a diminuition of Clostridium bacteria in PD might determine a reduction in the activation of protective signalling-molecules useful in preserving gut homeostasis. This pilot study, by identifying a decrease in specific bacteria associated with a reduced sensitivity to PROP, adds essential information that opens new avenues of research into the association of PD microbiota composition and sensory modification.",International journal of biological macromolecules,2020,Sarah Vascellari; Melania Melis; Giovanni Cossu; Marta Melis; Alessandra Serra; Vanessa Palmas; Daniela Perra; Valentina Oppo; Michele Fiorini; Roberto Cusano; Micaela Morelli; Aldo Manzin; Iole Tomassini Barbarossa

These conditions get changed quite often, and often involve changes introduced into the gut microbiota which, as studies are revealing, directly modulate the CNS via a crosstalk. This cross-talk between the gut microbiota and CNS, i.e., the gut-brain axis (GBA), plays a major role in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS) and Huntington's disease (HD).We aim to discuss how gut microbiota, through GBA, regulate neurodegenerative disorders such as PD, AD, ALS, MS and HD.In this review, we have discussed the present understanding of the role played by the gut microbiota in neurodegenerative disorders and emphasized the probable therapeutic approaches being explored to treat them.In the first part, we introduce the GBA and its relevance, followed by the changes occurring in the GBA during neurodegenerative disorders and then further discuss its role in the pathogenesis of these diseases.

The underlying physiopathology is still unclear. Several lines of evidence suggest a role for oxidative stress and NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) in the neuropathological pathways that lead to ND. Furthermore, recent studies hypothesized a role for gut microbiota in the neuroinflammation; in particular, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) derived from Gram-negative bacteria in the gut is believed to play a role in causing ND by increase of oxidative stress and inflammation.

Systems Biology offers a holistic integrative approach to study the interplay between the different biologic systems as part of a whole, and may elucidate the host-microbiome interactions in NDDs. We reviewed direct and indirect pathways through which the microbiota can modulate the bidirectional communication of the gut-brain axis, and explored the evidence of microbial dysbiosis in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. As the gut microbiota being strongly affected by diet, the potential approaches to targeting the human microbiota through diet for the stimulation of neuroprotective microbial-metabolites secretion were described. We explored the potential of Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) to infer microbe-microbe and host-microbe interactions and to identify the microbiome contribution to disease development or prevention. Finally, a systemic approach based on GEMs and 'omics integration, that would allow the design of sustainable personalized anti-inflammatory diets in NDDs prevention, through the modulation of gut microbiota was described.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2020,Dorines Rosario; Jan Boren; Mathias Uhlen; Gordon Proctor; Dag Aarsland; Adil Mardinoglu; Saeed Shoaie
32088434,Gut microbiota dysbiosis might be responsible to different toxicity caused by Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate exposure in murine rodents.,"Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is widely used as a plasticizer, which can enter the body through a variety of ways and exerted multiple harmful effects, including liver toxicity, reproductive toxicity and even glucose metabolism disorder. Many studies have suggested that changes of gut microbiota are closely related to the occurrence of various diseases, but the effects of DEHP exposure on gut microbiota are still unclear. It was found in this study that the damage to different tissues by DEHP on two strains each from two different species of male rodents before puberty was dose and time of exposure dependent, and also depending on the strain and species of rodent. Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats showed highest sensitivity to DEHP exposure, with most severe organ damage, highest Th1 inflammatory response and most significant body weight gain. Correspondingly, the gut microbiota of SD rats showed most significant changes after DEHP exposure. Only SD rats, but not Wistar rats, BALB/c and C57BL/6J mice showed an increase in Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and Proteobacteria abundance in the fecal samples, which are known to associate with obesity and diabetes. This is consistent with the increasing body weight gain which was only found in SD rats. In addition, the decrease in the level of butyrate, increase in the abundance of potential pathogens and microbial genes linked to colorectal cancer, Parkinson's disease, and type 2 diabetes in the SD rats were associated with issue and functional damages and Th1 inflammatory response caused by DEHP exposure. We postulate that the differential effects of DEHP on gut microbiota may be an important cause of the differences in the toxicity on different strains and species of rodents to DEHP.","Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2020,Gang Wang; Qian Chen; Peijun Tian; Linlin Wang; Xiu Li; Yuan-Kun Lee; Jianxin Zhao; Hao Zhang; Wei Chen
32643435,Progression and survival of patients with motor neuron disease relative to their fecal microbiota.,"Gut microbiota studies have been well-investigated for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, however, fewer studies have comprehensively examined the gut microbiome in Motor Neuron Disease (MND), with none examining its impact on disease prognosis. Here, we investigate MND prognosis and the fecal microbiota, using 16S rRNA case-control data from 100 individuals with extensive medical histories and metabolic measurements. We contrast the composition and diversity of fecal microbiome signatures from 49 MND and 51 healthy controls by combining current gold-standard 16S microbiome pipelines. Using stringent quality control thresholds, we conducted qualitative assessment approaches including; direct comparison of taxa, PICRUSt2 predicted metagenomics, Shannon and Chao1-index and Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio. We show that the fecal microbiome of patients with MND is not significantly different from that of healthy controls that were matched by age, sex, and BMI, however there are distinct differences in Beta-diversity in some patients with MND. Weight, BMI, and metabolic and clinical features of disease in patients with MND were not related to the composition of their fecal microbiome, however, we observe a greater risk for earlier death in patients with MND with increased richness and diversity of the microbiome, and in those with greater Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio. This was independent of anthropometric, metabolic, or clinical features of disease, and warrants support for further gut microbiota studies in MND. Given the disease heterogeneity in MND, and complexity of the gut microbiota, large studies are necessary to determine the detailed role of the gut microbiota and MND prognosis.",Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis & frontotemporal degeneration,2020,Shyuan T Ngo; Restuadi Restuadi; Allan F McCrae; Ruben P Van Eijk; Fleur Garton; Robert D Henderson; Naomi R Wray; Pamela A McCombe; Frederik J Steyn
33154567,Using multi-organ culture systems to study Parkinson's disease.,"In recent years, it has been revealed that Parkinson's disease pathology may begin to manifest in the gastrointestinal track at a much earlier time point than in the brain. This paradigm shift has been suggested following evidence in humans that has been reproduced in animal models. Since rodent models cannot recapitulate many of the human disease features, human induced pluripotent stem cells derived from Parkinson's patients have been used to generate brain organoids, greatly contributing to our understanding of the disease pathophysiology. To understand the multifaced aspects of Parkinson's disease, it may be desirable to expand the complexity of these models, to include different brain regions, vasculature, immune cells as well as additional diverse organ-specific organoids such as gut and intestine. Furthermore, the contribution of gut microbiota to disease progression cannot be underestimated. Recent biotechnological advances propose that such combinations may be feasible. Here we discuss how this need can be met and propose that additional brain diseases can benefit from this approach.",Molecular psychiatry,2021,Orly Reiner; Tamar Sapir; Arpan Parichha

These studies have fuelled interest in the microbiome as a potential new target for treating disease Here, we reviewed the key metabolic diseases, obesity, type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis and the role of the microbiome in their pathogenesis. In particular, we will discuss disease associated microbial dysbiosis; the shift in the microbiome caused by medical interventions and the altered metabolite levels between diseases and interventions. The microbial dysbiosis seen was compared between diseases including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, liver cirrhosis and neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. This review highlights the commonalities and differences in dysbiosis of the gut between diseases, along with metabolite levels in metabolic disease vs. the levels reported after an intervention. We identify the need for further analysis using systems biology approaches and discuss the potential need for treatments to consider their impact on the microbiome.",Microorganisms,2020,Ceri Proffitt; Gholamreza Bidkhori; David Moyes; Saeed Shoaie
32252363,Revisiting the Role of Neurotrophic Factors in Inflammation.,"The neurotrophic factors are well known for their implication in the growth and the survival of the central, sensory, enteric and parasympathetic nervous systems. Due to these properties, neurturin (NRTN) and Glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), which belong to the GDNF family ligands (GFLs), have been assessed in clinical trials as a treatment for neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease. In addition, studies in favor of a functional role for GFLs outside the nervous system are accumulating. Thus, GFLs are present in several peripheral tissues, including digestive, respiratory, hematopoietic and urogenital systems, heart, blood, muscles and skin. More precisely, recent data have highlighted that different types of immune and epithelial cells (macrophages, T cells, such as, for example, mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, innate lymphoid cells (ILC) 3, dendritic cells, mast cells, monocytes, bronchial epithelial cells, keratinocytes) have the capacity to release GFLs and express their receptors, leading to the participation in the repair of epithelial barrier damage after inflammation. Some of these mechanisms pass on to ILCs to produce cytokines (such as IL-22) that can impact gut microbiota. In addition, there are indications that NRTN could be used in the treatment of inflammatory airway diseases and it prevents the development of hyperglycemia in the diabetic rat model. On the other hand, it is suspected that the dysregulation of GFLs produces oncogenic effects. This review proposes the discussion of the biological understanding and the potential new opportunities of the GFLs, in the perspective of developing new treatments within a broad range of human diseases.",Cells,2020,Lucas Morel; Olivia Domingues; Jacques Zimmer; Tatiana Michel
32247376,Mechanisms of alpha-synuclein toxicity: An update and outlook.,"Alpha-synuclein (aSyn) was identified as the main component of inclusions that define synucleinopathies more than 20 years ago. Since then, aSyn has been extensively studied in an attempt to unravel its roles in both physiology and pathology. Today, studying the mechanisms of aSyn toxicity remains in the limelight, leading to the identification of novel pathways involved in pathogenesis. In this chapter, we address the molecular mechanisms involved in synucleinopathies, from aSyn misfolding and aggregation to the various cellular effects and pathologies associated. In particular, we review our current understanding of the mechanisms involved in the spreading of aSyn between different cells, from the periphery to the brain, and back. Finally, we also review recent studies on the contribution of inflammation and the gut microbiota to pathology in synucleinopathies. Despite significant advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved, we still lack an integrated understanding of the pathways leading to neurodegeneration in PD and other synucleinopathies, compromising our ability to develop novel therapeutic strategies.",Progress in brain research,2020,InÃªs Caldeira BrÃ¡s; Mary Xylaki; Tiago Fleming Outeiro

Although its clinical diagnosis is based on motor symptoms such as resting tremor, postural instability, slow gait, and muscle stiffness, this disorder is also characterized by the presence of early emotional impairment, including features such as depression, anxiety, fatigue, and apathy. Depression is the main emotional manifestation associated with PD and the mechanisms involved in its pathophysiology have been extensively investigated however, it is not yet completely elucidated. In addition to monoaminergic imbalance, immunological and gut microbiota changes have been associated with depression in PD.

Moreover, some PD patients suffer from unintentional weight loss (WL) which may precede the motor manifestations of the disease. <b>Materials & methods:</b> Gut microbiota profiling by 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed in PD patients with an unintended WL, in steady weight patients (non-WL [NWL]) and in matched normal subjects. KEGG functional predictions were carried out. <b>Results:</b> Microbiota profiles revealed a dissimilarity between WL and NWL. Moreover, WL pathways were characterized by fatty acid biosynthesis, while NWL by inflammation pathways. <b>Conclusion:</b> The gut microbiota could participate in weight alteration observed in PD by the presence of bacteria involved in weight gain and inflammation, or conversely by bacteria implicated in energy expenditure.",Future microbiology,2020,Federica Del Chierico; Paola Grassini; Andrea Quagliariello; Margherita Torti; Alessandra Russo; Sofia Reddel; Fabrizio Stocchi
33064969,Characterization of the intestinal microbiota during <i>Citrobacter rodentium</i> infection in a mouse model of infection-triggered Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that has been shown to be influenced by the intestinal milieu. The gut microbiota is altered in PD patients, and murine studies have begun suggesting a causative role for the gut microbiota in progression of PD. We have previously shown that repeated infection with the intestinal murine pathogen <i>Citrobacter rodentium</i> resulted in the development of PD-like pathology in <i>Pink1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice compared to wild-type littermates. This addendum aims to expand this work by characterizing the gut microbiota during <i>C. rodentium</i> infection in our <i>Pink1</i><sup>-/-</sup> PD model. We observed little disturbance to the fecal microbiota diversity both between infection timepoints and between <i>Pink1</i><sup>-/-</sup> and wild-type control littermates. However, the level of short-chain fatty acids appeared to be altered over the course of infection with butyric acid significantly increasing in <i>Pink1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice and isobutyric acid increasing in wild-type mice.",Gut microbes,2020,Tyler Cannon; Anshul Sinha; Louis-Eric Trudeau; Corinne F Maurice; Samantha Gruenheid
33213462,Oral P. gingivalis impairs gut permeability and mediates immune responses associated with neurodegeneration in LRRK2 R1441G mice.,"The R1441G mutation in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene results in late-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). Peripheral inflammation and gut microbiota are closely associated with the pathogenesis of PD. Chronic periodontitis is a common type of peripheral inflammation, which is associated with PD. Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), the most common bacterium causing chronic periodontitis, can cause alteration of gut microbiota. It is not known whether Pg-induced dysbiosis plays a role in the pathophysiology of PD.In this study, live Pg were orally administrated to animals, three times a week for 1 month. Pg-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to stimulate mononuclear cells in vitro. The effects of oral Pg administration on the gut and brain were evaluated through behaviors, morphology, and cytokine expression.Dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra were reduced, and activated microglial cells were increased in R1441G mice given oral Pg. In addition, an increase in mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-Î±) and interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²) as well as protein level of Î±-synuclein together with a decrease in zonula occludens-1 (Zo-1) was detected in the colon in Pg-treated R1441G mice. Furthermore, serum interleukin-17A (IL-17A) and brain IL-17 receptor A (IL-17RA) were increased in Pg-treated R1441G mice.These findings suggest that oral Pg-induced inflammation may play an important role in the pathophysiology of LRRK2-associated PD.",Journal of neuroinflammation,2020,Yu-Kun Feng; Qiong-Li Wu; Yan-Wen Peng; Feng-Yin Liang; Hua-Jing You; Yi-Wei Feng; Ge Li; Xue-Jiao Li; Shu-Hua Liu; Yong-Chao Li; Yu Zhang; Zhong Pei
32894625,Helicobacter pylori Eradication in Parkinson's Disease: A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial.,"Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection has been associated with worse motor function in Parkinson's disease (PD).We aimed to evaluate the effects of HP eradication on PD symptoms.In this parallel-group, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled, single-center trial, patients with PD with positive HP urea breath test and serology were block randomized (1:1) to receive standard eradication triple therapy or identically appearing placebo capsules for 1âweek. Prespecified motor (International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society Unified PD Rating Scale [MDS-UPDRS], timed tests, and home-based wearable sensor measurements), nonmotor (Leeds Dyspepsia Questionnaire and Montreal Cognitive Assessment), and quality-of-life (Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39) outcome measures were assessed at weeks 6, 12, 24, and 52. The primary outcome was the baseline-to-week 12 change in ON medication MDS-UPDRS motor scores. Lactulose-hydrogen breath testing for concomitant small intestinal bacterial overgrowth was performed at baseline and repeated at week 24, together with the urea breath test.A total of 310 patients were screened for eligibility and 80 were randomly assigned, of whom 67 were included in the full-analysis set (32 treatment group patients, 35 placebo patients). HP eradication did not improve MDS-UPDRS motor scores at week 12 (mean difference 2.6 points in favor of placebo, 95% confidence interval: -0.4 to 5.6, P = 0.089). There was no significant improvement in any motor, nonmotor, or quality-of-life outcome at weeks 12 and 52. Both the full-analysis and per-protocol analyses (based on eradication status) supported these conclusions. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth status did not influence treatment results.HP eradication does not improve clinical outcomes in PD, suggesting that there is no justification for routine HP screening or eradication with the goal of improving PD symptoms.

33166735,Dysbiosis is one of the risk factor for stroke and cognitive impairment and potential target for treatment.,"More than 50 million people have various forms of cognitive impairment basically caused by neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and cerebrovascular diseases as well as stroke. Often these conditions coexist and exacerbate one another. The damaged area in post-stroke dementia may lead to neurodegenerative lesions. Gut microbiome functions like an endocrine organ by generating bioactive metabolites that can directly or indirectly impact human physiology. An alteration in the composition and function of intestinal flora, i.e. gut dysbiosis, is implicated in neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases. Additionally, gut dysbiosis may accelerate the progression of cognitive impairment. Dysbiosis may result from obesity; metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disease, and sleep disorders, Lack of physical activity is associated with dysbiosis as well. These may coexist in various patterns in older people, enhancing the risk, incidence, and progression of cerebrovascular lesions, neurodegenerative disorders, and cognitive impairment, creating a vicious circle. Recently, it has been reported that several metabolites produced by gut microbiota (e.g., trimethylamine/trimethylamine N-oxide, short-chain fatty acids, secondary bile acids) may be linked to neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases. New treatment modalities, including prebiotic and probiotics, may normalize the gut microbiota composition, change the brain-gut barrier, and decrease the risk of the pathology development. Fecal microbiota transplantation, sometimes in combination with other methods, is used for remodeling and replenishing the symbiotic gut microbiome. This promising field of research is associated with basic findings of bidirectional communication between body organs and gut microbiota that creates new possibilities of pharmacological treatments of many clinical conditions. The authors present the role of gut microbiota in physiology, and the novel therapeutic targets in modulation of intestinal microbiota Personalized therapies based on their personal genome make up could offer benefits by modulating microbiota cross-talk with brain and cardiovascular system. A healthy lifestyle, including pre and probiotic nutrition is generally recommended. Prevention may also be enhanced by correcting gut dysbiosis resulting a reduced risk of post-stroke cognitive impairment including dementia.",Pharmacological research,2021,Magdalena Koszewicz; Joanna Jaroch; Anna Brzecka; Maria Ejma; Slawomir Budrewicz; Liudmila M Mikhaleva; Cristian Muresanu; Pamela Schield; Siva G Somasundaram; Cecil E Kirkland; Marco Avila-Rodriguez; Gjumrakch Aliev
33071933,Changes in Gastrointestinal Microbiome Composition in PD: A Pivotal Role of Covariates.,"Altered gut microbiota may trigger or accelerate alpha-synuclein aggregation in the enteric nervous system in Parkinson's disease (PD). While several previous studies observed gut microbiota alterations in PD, findings like diversity indices, and altered bacterial taxa itself show a considerable heterogeneity across studies. We recruited 179 participants, of whom 101 fulfilled stringent inclusion criteria. Subsequently, the composition of the gut microbiota in 71 PD patients and 30 healthy controls was analyzed, sequencing V3-V4 regions of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene in fecal samples. Our goal was (1) to evaluate whether gut microbiota are altered in a southern German PD cohort, (2) to delineate the influence of disease duration, stage, and motor impairment, and (3) to investigate the influence of PD associated covariates like constipation and coffee consumption. Aiming to control for a large variety of covariates, strict inclusion criteria were applied. Finally, propensity score matching was performed to correct for, and to delineate the effect of remaining covariates (non-motor symptom (NMS) burden, constipation, and coffee consumption) on microbiota composition. Prior to matching altered abundances of distinct bacterial classes, orders, families, and genera were observed. Both, disease duration, and stage influenced microbiome composition. Interestingly, levodopa equivalent dose influenced the correlation of taxa with disease duration, while motor impairment did not. Applying different statistical tests, and after propensity score matching to control for NMS burden, constipation and coffee consumption, <i>Faecalibacterium</i> and <i>Ruminococcus</i> were most consistently reduced in PD compared to controls. Taken together, similar to previous studies, alterations of several taxa were observed in PD. Yet, further controlling for PD associated covariates such as constipation and coffee consumption revealed a pivotal role of these covariates. Our data highlight the impact of these PD associated covariates on microbiota composition in PD. This suggests that altered microbiota may mediate the protective effect of i.e., coffee consumption and the negative effect of constipation in PD.",Frontiers in neurology,2020,Alexandra Cosma-Grigorov; Holger Meixner; Anne Mrochen; Stefan Wirtz; JÃ¼rgen Winkler; Franz Marxreiter
32154946,Plasma Short-Chain Fatty Acids in Patients With Parkinson's Disease.,"Short-chain fatty acids are exclusively produced by gut microbiota and are reduced in feces of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The objective of this study was to conduct a case-control study on peripheral concentration of short-chain fatty acids based on evidence of pathologic changes in the blood-brain barrier in PD and the possible role of short-chain fatty acids in blood-brain barrier permeability.The plasma short-chain fatty acid concentration was measured in 38 PD and 33 normal controls using gas chromatography. The clinical characteristics of patients with PD and controls were evaluated, and dietary information was obtained using a food frequency questionnaire. Short-chain fatty acid concentrations were further compared after adjusting for age, sex, and significant food frequency questionnaire items.The concentrations of acetate, propionate, and butyrate did not differ between patients with PD and controls in unadjusted comparison. Dietary intakes of fibers, carbohydrates, lipids (total and fatty acids), and proteins did not differ between groups. After correction of covariates, acetic acid concentration was higher in patients with PD than in controls (116.47âÂ±â16.83 vs 108.20âÂ±â18.37 Î¼mol/L; P = 0.010). In correlation analyses, acetic acid concentration was positively correlated (R = 0.374, P = 0.021) with age, propionic acid concentration was negatively correlated with UPDRS part III score (R = -0.376, P = 0.020) and use of entacapone (R = -0.325, P = 0.047), and butyric acid concentration was correlated with monoamine oxidase inhibitor use (R = 0.382, P = 0.018) and anticholinergic use (R = -0.385, P = 0.024).Plasma short-chain fatty acids were paradoxically increased in PD and were associated with disease severity and antiparkinsonian medications. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the relationships of gut dysbiosis and inflammation with plasma short-chain fatty acids.

32039674,Development of a Novel Oral Delivery Vehicle for Probiotics.,"There is a significant interest in effective oral drug delivery of therapeutic substances. For probiotics, there is a particular need for a delivery platform that protects the bacteria from destruction by the acidic stomach while enabling targeted delivery to the intestine where microbiota naturally reside. The use of probiotics and how they impact the gut microbiota is a growing field and holds promise for the treatment of a variety of gastrointestinal diseases, including irritable bowel disease Crohn's disease and C. diff and other diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's diseases.The aim of this research was to use our newly developed chemically-modified alginate hydrogel with the characteristic feature of stability in acidic environments but disintegration under neutral-basic pH conditions to design a novel system for effective targeted delivery of ingested probiotics.We have used the approach of encapsulation of bacterial cells in the hydrogel of the modified alginate with in vitro studies in both simulated stomach acid and intestinal fluid conditions to demonstrate the potential application of this novel platform in oral delivery of probiotics. Our data provide a proof-of-concept that enables further studies in vivo with this delivery platform.We have demonstrated in the present study that our chemically modified alginate hydrogel is resistant to acidic conditions and protects bacterial cells encapsulated in it, but it is sensitive to neutral-basic pH conditions under which it disintegrates and releases its viable bacteria cell payload.

We previously reported that the novel psychobiotic strain, Lactobacillus plantarum PS128 (PS128), ameliorated abnormal behaviors and modulated neurotransmissions in dopaminergic pathways in rodent models. Here, we report that orally administering PS128 for 4Â weeks significantly alleviated the motor deficits, elevation in corticosterone, nigrostriatal dopaminergic neuronal death, and striatal dopamine reduction in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrathydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse models. PS128 ingestion suppressed glial cell hyperactivation and increased norepinephrine and neurotrophic factors in the striatum of the PD-model mice. PS128 administration also attenuated MPTP-induced oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in the nigrostriatal pathway. Fecal analysis showed that PS128 modulated the gut microbiota. L. plantarum abundance was significantly increased along with methionine biosynthesis-related microbial modules. PS128 also suppressed the increased family Enterobacteriaceae and lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan biosynthesis-related microbial modules caused by MPTP. In conclude, PS128 ingestion alleviated MPTP-induced motor deficits and neurotoxicity.PS128 supplementation inhibited neurodegenerative processes in PD-model mice and may help prevent PD.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2020,Jian-Fu Liao; Yun-Fang Cheng; Shu-Ting You; Wen-Chun Kuo; Chi-Wei Huang; Jen-Jie Chiou; Chih-Chieh Hsu; Hsiu-Mei Hsieh-Li; Sabrina Wang; Ying-Chieh Tsai
31836471,Sodium butyrate causes Î±-synuclein degradation by an Atg5-dependent and PI3K/Akt/mTOR-related autophagy pathway.,"Aggregation of Î±-Synuclein is central to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, these Î±-Synuclein inclusions are not only present in brain, but also in gut. Enteroendocrine cells (EECs), which are directly exposed to the gut lumen, can express Î±-Synuclein and directly connect to Î±-Synuclein-containing nerves. Dysbiosis of gut microbiota and microbial metabolite short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) has been implicated as a driver for PD. Butyrate is an SCFA produced by the gut microbiota. Our aim was to demonstrate how Î±-Synuclein expression in EECs responds to butyrate stimulation. Interestingly, we found that sodium butyrate (NaB) increases Î±-Synuclein mRNA expression, enhances Atg5-mediated autophagy (increased LC3B-II and decreased SQSTM1 (also known as p62) expression) in murine neuroendocrine STC-1Â cells. Further, Î±-Synuclein mRNA was decreased by the inhibition of autophagy by using inhibitor bafilomycin A1 or by silencing Atg5 with siRNA. Moreover, the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway was significantly inhibited and cell apoptosis was activated by NaB. Conditioned media from NaB-stimulated STC-1Â cells induced inflammation in SH-SY5Y cells. Collectively, NaB causes Î±-Synuclein degradation by an Atg5-dependent and PI3K/Akt/mTOR-related autophagy pathway.",Experimental cell research,2020,Chen-Meng Qiao; Meng-Fei Sun; Xue-Bing Jia; Yun Shi; Bo-Ping Zhang; Zhi-Lan Zhou; Li-Ping Zhao; Chun Cui; Yan-Qin Shen
34500451,Parkinson's Disease and Gut Microbiota.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is caused by abnormal aggregation of Î±-synuclein fibrils, called the Lewy bodies, in the central nervous system. Accumulating knowledge points to the notion that Î±-synuclein fibrils start from the dorsal vagal nucleus and ascend to the locus ceruleus and the substantia nigra (SN). Even in healthy elderly subjects without motor or cognitive impairment, Î±-synuclein fibrils are frequently observed in the brain and sometimes in the intestinal neural plexus. Enteroendocrine cells have a direct synapse to the vagal afferents, and the vagal nucleus has synaptic pathways to the SN and the striatum. Intestinal bacteria are likely to be involved in the formation of intestinal Î±-synuclein fibrils.A nonparametric meta-analysis of intestinal microbiota in PD in 5 countries, as well as scrutinization of the other reports from the other countries, indicates that mucin-degrading Akkermansia is increased in PD and that short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria are decreased in PD. Both dysbiosis should increase the intestinal permeability, which subsequently facilitates exposure of the intestinal neural plexus to toxins like lipopolysaccharide and pesticide, which should lead to abnormal aggregation of Î±-synuclein fibrils. Decreased SCFA also downregulates regulatory T cells and fails to suppress neuronal inflammation. Key Messages: Therapeutic intervention may be able to be established against these mechanisms. Additional biochemical, cellular, and animal studies are required to further dissect the direct association between intestinal microbiota and PD.",Annals of nutrition & metabolism,2021,Masaaki Hirayama; Kinji Ohno

34784980,Fecal microbiota transplantation protects rotenone-induced Parkinson's disease mice via suppressing inflammation mediated by the lipopolysaccharide-TLR4 signaling pathway through the microbiota-gut-brain axis.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, displaying not only well-known motor deficits but also gastrointestinal dysfunctions. Consistently, it has been increasingly evident that gut microbiota affects the communication between the gut and the brain in PD pathogenesis, known as the microbiota-gut-brain axis. As an approach to re-establishing a normal microbiota community, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has exerted beneficial effects on PD in recent studies. Here, in this study, we established a chronic rotenone-induced PD mouse model to evaluate the protective effects of FMT treatment on PD and to explore the underlying mechanisms, which also proves the involvement of gut microbiota dysbiosis in PD pathogenesis via the microbiota-gut-brain axis.We demonstrated that gut microbiota dysbiosis induced by rotenone administration caused gastrointestinal function impairment and poor behavioral performances in the PD mice. Moreover, 16S RNA sequencing identified the increase of bacterial genera Akkermansia and Desulfovibrio in fecal samples of rotenone-induced mice. By contrast, FMT treatment remarkably restored the gut microbial community, thus ameliorating the gastrointestinal dysfunctions and the motor deficits of the PD mice. Further experiments revealed that FMT administration alleviated intestinal inflammation and barrier destruction, thus reducing the levels of systemic inflammation. Subsequently, FMT treatment attenuated blood-brain barrier (BBB) impairment and suppressed neuroinflammation in the substantia nigra (SN), which further decreased the damage of dopaminergic neurons. Additional mechanistic investigation discovered that FMT treatment reduced lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels in the colon, the serum, and the SN, thereafter suppressing the TLR4/MyD88/NF-ÎºB signaling pathway and its downstream pro-inflammatory products both in the SN and the colon.Our current study demonstrates that FMT treatment can correct the gut microbiota dysbiosis and ameliorate the rotenone-induced PD mouse model, in which suppression of the inflammation mediated by the LPS-TLR4 signaling pathway both in the gut and the brain possibly plays a significant role. Further, we prove that rotenone-induced microbiota dysbiosis is involved in the genesis of PD via the microbiota-gut-brain axis.

Searches were conducted in the electronic databases PubMed and PsycINFO. 17 articles were included in this review, the majority were published after 2019. The results showed that gut dysbiosis predicts the development of these pathologies and influences their pathogenesis. In addition, it was found that different psychobiotics, mainly dietary fibers and probiotics of the Lactobacillus family, improved different cognitive functions such as cognitive performance and induce a reduced cortisol response.

32667590,The role of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in neuropsychiatric disorders.,"The microbiota-gut-brain axis is a bidirectional signaling mechanism between the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system. The complexity of the intestinal ecosystem is extraordinary; it comprises more than 100 trillion microbial cells that inhabit the small and large intestine, and this interaction between microbiota and intestinal epithelium can cause physiological changes in the brain and influence mood and behavior. Currently, there has been an emphasis on how such interactions affect mental health. Evidence indicates that intestinal microbiota are involved in neurological and psychiatric disorders. This review covers evidence for the influence of gut microbiota on the brain and behavior in Alzheimer disease, dementia, anxiety, autism spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia. The primary focus is on the pathways involved in intestinal metabolites of microbial origin, including short-chain fatty acids, tryptophan metabolites, and bacterial components that can activate the host's immune system. We also list clinical evidence regarding prebiotics, probiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation as adjuvant therapies for neuropsychiatric disorders.","Revista brasileira de psiquiatria (Sao Paulo, Brazil : 1999)",2021,Jaqueline S Generoso; Vijayasree V Giridharan; Juneyoung Lee; Danielle Macedo; Tatiana Barichello

Environmental toxins and gut dysbiosis may trigger oxidative stress and mucosal inflammation, and initiate Î±-synuclein accumulation in the enteric nervous system, early in PD. Chronic gut inflammation can lead to a leaky gut and systemic inflammation, neuro inflammation, and neuro degeneration via gut-vagus-brain signaling or through blood-brain barrier permeability. Concepts regarding the gut-brain signaling in PD pathogenesis are changing rapidly and more investigation is required. The gut microbiota interacts with the human body by modulating the enteric and central nervous systems, and immune activity. Understanding the immune responses between gut microbiota and human body might help in elucidating the PD pathogenesis. As changes in gut microbiota composition might be associated with different clinical phenotypes of PD, gut microbiota-modulating interventions, such as probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), have the potential to restore the gut dysbiosis, reduce inflammation, and possibly modulate the clinical PD phenotype.",Journal of neurology,2022,Vinod Metta; Valentina Leta; Kandadai Rukmini Mrudula; L K Prashanth; Vinay Goyal; Rupam Borgohain; Guy Chung-Faye; K Ray Chaudhuri
33905953,Potential roles of gut microbiota and microbial metabolites in Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complicated neurodegenerative disease attributed to multifactorial changes. However, its pathological mechanism remains undetermined. Accumulating evidence has revealed the emerging functions of gut microbiota and microbial metabolites, which can affect both the enteric nervous system and the central nervous system via the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Accordingly, intestinal dysbiosis might be closely associated with PD. This review explores alterations to gut microbiota, correlations with clinical manifestations of PD, and briefly probes the underlying mechanisms. Next, the highly controversial roles of microbial metabolites including short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), H<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>S are discussed. Finally, the pros and cons of the current treatments for PD, including those targeting microbiota, are assessed. Advancements in research techniques, further studies on levels of specific strains and longitudinal prospective clinical trials are urgently needed for the identification of early diagnostic markers and the development of novel therapeutic approaches for PD.",Ageing research reviews,2021,Shen-Yuan Zheng; Hai-Xia Li; Rui-Chen Xu; Wen-Teng Miao; Ming-Yuan Dai; Song-Tao Ding; Han-Deng Liu
33557896,"Relationships of gut microbiota, short-chain fatty acids, inflammation, and the gut barrier in Parkinson's disease.","Previous studies have reported that gut microbiota, permeability, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and inflammation are altered in Parkinson's disease (PD), but how these factors are linked and how they contribute to disease processes and symptoms remains uncertain. This study sought to compare and identify associations among these factors in PD patients and controls to elucidate their interrelations and links to clinical manifestations of PD.Stool and plasma samples and clinical data were collected from 55 PD patients and 56 controls. Levels of stool SCFAs and stool and plasma inflammatory and permeability markers were compared between patients and controls and related to one another and to the gut microbiota.Calprotectin was increased and SCFAs decreased in stool in PD in a sex-dependent manner. Inflammatory markers in plasma and stool were neither intercorrelated nor strongly associated with SCFA levels. Age at PD onset was positively correlated with SCFAs and negatively correlated with CXCL8 and IL-1Î² in stool. Fecal zonulin correlated positively with fecal NGAL and negatively with PD motor and non-motor symptoms. Microbiota diversity and composition were linked to levels of SCFAs, inflammatory factors, and zonulin in stool. Certain relationships differed between patients and controls and by sex.Intestinal inflammatory responses and reductions in fecal SCFAs occur in PD, are related to the microbiota and to disease onset, and are not reflected in plasma inflammatory profiles. Some of these relationships are distinct in PD and are sex-dependent. This study revealed potential alterations in microbiota-host interactions and links between earlier PD onset and intestinal inflammatory responses and reduced SCFA levels, highlighting candidate molecules and pathways which may contribute to PD pathogenesis and clinical presentation and which warrant further investigation.",Molecular neurodegeneration,2021,Velma T E Aho; Madelyn C Houser; Pedro A B Pereira; Jianjun Chang; Knut Rudi; Lars Paulin; Vicki Hertzberg; Petri Auvinen; MalÃº G Tansey; Filip Scheperjans
34707612,Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis and Epilepsy: A Review on Mechanisms and Potential Therapeutics.,"The gut-brain axis refers to the bidirectional communication between the gut and brain, and regulates intestinal homeostasis and the central nervous system <i>via</i> neural networks and neuroendocrine, immune, and inflammatory pathways. The development of sequencing technology has evidenced the key regulatory role of the gut microbiota in several neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Epilepsy is a complex disease with multiple risk factors that affect more than 50 million people worldwide; nearly 30% of patients with epilepsy cannot be controlled with drugs. Interestingly, patients with inflammatory bowel disease are more susceptible to epilepsy, and a ketogenic diet is an effective treatment for patients with intractable epilepsy. Based on these clinical facts, the role of the microbiome and the gut-brain axis in epilepsy cannot be ignored. In this review, we discuss the relationship between the gut microbiota and epilepsy, summarize the possible pathogenic mechanisms of epilepsy from the perspective of the microbiota gut-brain axis, and discuss novel therapies targeting the gut microbiota. A better understanding of the role of the microbiota in the gut-brain axis, especially the intestinal one, would help investigate the mechanism, diagnosis, prognosis evaluation, and treatment of intractable epilepsy.",Frontiers in immunology,2021,Manqiu Ding; Yue Lang; Hang Shu; Jie Shao; Li Cui
33856024,The role of gut dysbiosis in Parkinson's disease: mechanistic insights and therapeutic options.,"Parkinson's disease is a common neurodegenerative disorder in which gastrointestinal symptoms may appear prior to motor symptoms. The gut microbiota of patients with Parkinson's disease shows unique changes, which may be used as early biomarkers of disease. Alterations in the gut microbiota composition may be related to the cause or effect of motor or non-motor symptoms, but the specific pathogenic mechanisms are unclear. The gut microbiota and its metabolites have been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease by regulating neuroinflammation, barrier function and neurotransmitter activity. There is bidirectional communication between the enteric nervous system and the CNS, and the microbiota-gut-brain axis may provide a pathway for the transmission of Î±-synuclein. We highlight recent discoveries about alterations to the gut microbiota in Parkinson's disease and focus on current mechanistic insights into the microbiota-gut-brain axis in disease pathophysiology. Moreover, we discuss the interactions between the production and transmission of Î±-synuclein and gut inflammation and neuroinflammation. In addition, we draw attention to diet modification, the use of probiotics and prebiotics and faecal microbiota transplantation as potential therapeutic approaches that may lead to a new treatment paradigm for Parkinson's disease.",Brain : a journal of neurology,2021,Qing Wang; Yuqi Luo; K Ray Chaudhuri; Richard Reynolds; Eng-King Tan; Sven Pettersson
33623004,Oral berberine improves brain dopa/dopamine levels to ameliorate Parkinson's disease by regulating gut microbiota.,"The phenylalanine-tyrosine-dopa-dopamine pathway provides dopamine to the brain. In this process, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is the rate-limiting enzyme that hydroxylates tyrosine and generates levodopa (L-dopa) with tetrahydrobiopterin (BH<sub>4</sub>) as a coenzyme. Here, we show that oral berberine (BBR) might supply H<sup>â¢</sup> through dihydroberberine (reduced BBR produced by bacterial nitroreductase) and promote the production of BH<sub>4</sub> from dihydrobiopterin; the increased BH<sub>4</sub> enhances TH activity, which accelerates the production of L-dopa by the gut bacteria. Oral BBR acts in a way similar to vitamins. The L-dopa produced by the intestinal bacteria enters the brain through the circulation and is transformed to dopamine. To verify the gut-brain dialog activated by BBR's effect, Enterococcus faecalis or Enterococcus faecium was transplanted into Parkinson's disease (PD) mice. The bacteria significantly increased brain dopamine and ameliorated PD manifestation in mice; additionally, combination of BBR with bacteria showed better therapeutic effect than that with bacteria alone. Moreover, 2,4,6-trimethyl-pyranylium tetrafluoroborate (TMP-TFB)-derivatized matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) imaging of dopamine identified elevated striatal dopamine levels in mouse brains with oral Enterococcus, and BBR strengthened the imaging intensity of brain dopamine. These results demonstrated that BBR was an agonist of TH in Enterococcus and could lead to the production of L-dopa in the gut. Furthermore, a study of 28 patients with hyperlipidemia confirmed that oral BBR increased blood/fecal L-dopa by the intestinal bacteria. Hence, BBR might improve the brain function by upregulating the biosynthesis of L-dopa in the gut microbiota through a vitamin-like effect.",Signal transduction and targeted therapy,2021,Yan Wang; Qian Tong; Shu-Rong Ma; Zhen-Xiong Zhao; Li-Bin Pan; Lin Cong; Pei Han; Ran Peng; Hang Yu; Yuan Lin; Tian-Le Gao; Jia-Wen Shou; Xiao-Yang Li; Xian-Feng Zhang; Zheng-Wei Zhang; Jie Fu; Bao-Ying Wen; Jin-Bo Yu; Xuetao Cao; Jian-Dong Jiang
34695538,"Oral, Nasal, and Gut Microbiota in Parkinson's Disease.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most frequently diagnosed neurodegenerative disease. The purpose of this study was to investigate the link between microbiota composition in important mucosal interfaces (oral, nasal, and intestinal) and PD. Sequencing was undertaken of the V4-V5 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene of the microbiome from the oral cavity, nasal cavity, and gut of 91 PD patients and 91 healthy controls. Significant differences were found in microbiota composition in the oral cavity and gut, but not the nasal cavity, between PD patients and healthy controls after adjusting for age, gender, and body mass index (BMI). More genera in the oral cavity were significantly positively correlated with clinical characteristics, such as the HAMA and HAMD rating scales. The taxa c_Clostridia, o_Clostridiales, and f_Ruminococcaceae in the gut microbiota were associated with weight and MMSE score. Furthermore, as a result of dysbiosis, there was an enrichment of ion channel-, oxidative phosphorylation-, and carbohydrate metabolism-related pathways in the oral cavity and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis- and propanoate metabolism-related pathways in the intestine. Changes in these pathways can influence metabolism and inflammation, thereby contributing to PD pathogenesis. In addition, several subnetworks containing differentially abundant microbiota in the oral cavity and gut samples from PD patients may regulate microbial composition and function in PD. Overall, our results indicate that oral and gut dysbiosis may affect PD progression and provide a basis for understanding the pathogenesis of PD and identifying potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of this disease.",Neuroscience,2022,Zhuo Li; Gang Lu; Enli Luo; Bin Wu; Zhe Li; Jianwen Guo; Zhangyong Xia; Chunye Zheng; Qiaozhen Su; Yan Zeng; Wai Yee Chan; Xianwei Su; Xinmin Qiu; Xirun Zheng; Qiaodi Cai; Yanjuan Xu; Yingjun Chen; Yuzhen Fan; Weiwei Chen; Zecheng Yu; Xinjie Chen; Chunying Zheng; Mingbang Wang; Wai Sang Poon; Xiaodong Luo
34492236,Probiotics: Potential novel therapeutics for microbiota-gut-brain axis dysfunction across gender and lifespan.,"Probiotics are live microorganisms, which when administered in adequate amounts, present a health benefit for the host. While the beneficial effects of probiotics on gastrointestinal function are generally well recognized, new animal research and clinical studies have found that alterations in gut microbial communities can have a broad range of effects throughout the body. Non-intestinal sites impacted include the immune, endocrine, cardiovascular and the central nervous system (CNS). In particular, there has been a growing interest and appreciation about the role that gut microbiota may play in affecting CNS-related function through the 'microbiota-gut-brain axis'. Emerging evidence suggests potential therapeutic benefits of probiotics in several CNS conditions, such as anxiety, depression, autism spectrum disorders and Parkinson's disease. There may also be some gender-specific variances in terms of probiotic mediated effects, with the gut microbiota shaping and being concurrently molded by the hormonal environment governing differences between the sexes. Probiotics may influence the ability of the gut microbiome to affect a variety of biological processes in the host, including neurotransmitter activity, vagal neurotransmission, generation of neuroactive metabolites and inflammatory response mediators. Some of these may engage in cross talk with host sex hormones, such as estrogens, which could be of relevance in relation to their effects on stress response and cognitive health. This raises the possibility of gender-specific variation with regards to the biological action of probiotics, including that on the endocrine and central nervous systems. In this review we aim to describe the current understanding in relation to the role and use of probiotics in microbiota-gut-brain axis-related dysfunction. Furthermore, we will address the conceptualization and classification of probiotics in the context of gender and lifespan as well as how restoring gut microbiota composition by clinical or dietary intervention can help in supporting health outcomes other than those related to the gastrointestinal tract. We also evaluate how these new learnings may impact industrial effort in probiotic research and the discovery and development of novel and more personalized, condition-specific, beneficial probiotic therapeutic agents.",Pharmacology & therapeutics,2022,Shikha Snigdha; Kevin Ha; Paul Tsai; Timothy G Dinan; Jeremy D Bartos; Mohammed Shahid
33649989,The Gut-Brain Axis: Two Ways Signaling in Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic, progressive and second most prevalent neurological disorder affecting the motor system. Cardinal motor impairment and Î±-synucleinopathy are the characteristic features of PD. Recently, it has been identified that the gut-brain axis is substantially regulated by the gut microbiome (GM) through an immunological, neuroendocrine, and neural mechanism. However, disturbance in the gut-microbiome-brain axis in PD might proceed to gastrointestinal manifestations intermittently leading to the motor system and the PD pathogenesis itself. The gut microbial toxins may induce the production of Î±-synuclein (Î±-syn) aggregates in the enteric nervous system (ENS), which may proliferate and propagate in a prion-like-manner through the vagus nerve to the central nervous system (CNS); supporting the hypothesis that, GM might play a pivotal role in PD pathogenesis. Overstimulated innate immune system due to intestinal bacterial overgrowth or gut dysbiosis and the enhanced intestinal permeability may persuade systemic inflammation, while the activation of enteric glial cells and enteric neurons may contribute to Î±-synucleinopathy. Gut microbiota can bear a significant impact on neurological outcomes such as learning, memory and cognition. In this review paper, we summarize how the alterations in gut microbiota and ENS inflammation are associated with PD pathogenesis. The evidence supporting the causative role played by gut-associated dysbiosis and microbial byproducts, in the onset of PD is also discussed. We have highlighted the landmark discoveries in the field of PD particularly focusing on the gut-brain axis.

33417973,Unravelling the role of gut microbiota in Parkinson's disease progression: Pathogenic and therapeutic implications.,"In recent years, researchers have shown interest in bi-directional interaction between the brain and gut, called ""gut-brain axis"". Emerging pieces of evidence indicate that disturbances in this axis is found to be associated with the Parkinson's disease (PD). Several clinical investigations revealed the crucial role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of PD. It has been suggested that aggregation of misfolded protein Î±-syn, the neuropathological hallmark of PD, might begin in gut and propagates to the CNS via vagus nerve and olfactory bulb. Emerging evidences also suggest that initiation and progression of PD may be due to inflammation originating from gut. It has been shown that microbial gut dysbiosis causes the production of various pathogenic microbial metabolites which elevates pro-inflammatory environment in the gut that promotes neuroinflammation in the CNS. These observations raise the intriguing question - how gut microbial dysbiosis could contribute to PD progression. In this context, various microbiota-targeted therapies are under consideration that can re-establish the intestinal homeostasis which may have greater promise in the prevention and treatment of PD. This review focuses on the role of the gut microbiota in the initiation, progression of PD and current therapeutic intervention to deplete the severity of the disease.",Neuroscience research,2021,Linchi Rani; Amal Chandra Mondal
34530073,Alterations of gut microbiota and metabolome with Parkinson's disease.,"Gut microbiota and amino acids that are one of their metabolites play important roles in the mechanism of pathology of Parkinson's disease (PD). It has been reported that the level of amino acids in vivo participate in neurodegeneration by regulating adaptive immune response, while the current researches on alteration of amino acids in gut microbiota are still insufficient. We hypothesized that alterations in gut microbiota might be accompanied by altered concentrations of amino acids, leading to the occurrence of PD. In this study, we collected stool samples from PD and healthy controls to analyse fecal microbiome and targeted metabolome by 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene sequencing and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). At the genus level, there was a greater abundance of Alistipes, Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group, Bifidobacterium, Parabacteroides, while Faecalibacterium was decreased in fecal samples from PD patients. Moreover, fecal branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) and aromatic amino acids concentrations were significantly reduced in PD patients compared to controls. Our study not only finds the abundance of certain gut microbiota in PD,but also reveals that it is related to BCAAs and aromatic amino acids. These findings are beneficial to identifying new therapeutic targets for PD by regulating diet and/or gut microbiota.",Microbial pathogenesis,2021,Zhenzhen Yan; Fan Yang; Jingwei Cao; Wencai Ding; Shi Yan; Wanying Shi; Shirong Wen; Lifen Yao
33643026,"The Association Between the Gut Microbiota and Parkinson's Disease, a Meta-Analysis.","Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) were often observed with gastrointestinal symptoms, which preceded the onset of motor symptoms. Neuropathology of PD has also been found in the enteric nervous system (ENS). Many studies have reported significant PD-related alterations of gut microbiota. This meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the differences of gut microbiota between patients with PD and healthy controls (HCs) across different geographical regions. We conducted a systematic online search for case-control studies detecting gut microbiota in patients with PD and HCs. Mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to access alterations in the abundance of certain microbiota families in PD. Fifteen case-control studies were included in this meta-analysis study. Our results showed significant lower abundance levels of <i>Prevotellaceae</i> (MD = -0.37, 95% CI = -0.62 to -0.11), <i>Faecalibacterium</i> (MD = -0.41, 95% CI: -0.57 to -0.24), and <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> (MD = -0.34, 95% CI = -0.59 to -0.09) in patients with PD compared to HCs. Significant higher abundance level of <i>Bifidobacteriaceae</i> (MD = 0.38, 95%; CI = 0.12 to 0.63), <i>Ruminococcaceae</i> (MD = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.07 to 1.10), <i>Verrucomicrobiaceae</i> (MD = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.21 to 0.69), and <i>Christensenellaceae</i> (MD = 0.20, 95% CI = 0.07 to 0.34) was also found in patients with PD. Thus, shared alterations of certain gut microbiota were detected in patients with PD across different geographical regions. These PD-related gut microbiota dysbiosis might lead to the impairment of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) producing process, lipid metabolism, immunoregulatory function, and intestinal permeability, which contribute to the pathogenesis of PD.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2021,Ting Shen; Yumei Yue; Tingting He; Cong Huang; Boyi Qu; Wen Lv; Hsin-Yi Lai
34536490,"Gut dysbiosis, defective autophagy and altered immune responses in neurodegenerative diseases: Tales of a vicious cycle.","The human microbiota comprises trillions of symbiotic microorganisms and is involved in regulating gastrointestinal (GI), immune, nervous system and metabolic homeostasis. Recent observations suggest a bidirectional communication between the gut microbiota and the brain via immune, circulatory and neural pathways, termed the Gut-Brain Axis (GBA). Alterations in gut microbiota composition, such as seen with an increased number of pathobionts and a decreased number of symbionts, termed gut dysbiosis or microbial intestinal dysbiosis, plays a prominent role in the pathogenesis of central nervous system (CNS)-related disorders. Clinical reports confirm that GI symptoms often precede neurological symptoms several years before the development of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). Pathologically, gut dysbiosis disrupts the integrity of the intestinal barrier leading to ingress of pathobionts and toxic metabolites into the systemic circulation causing GBA dysregulation. Subsequently, chronic neuroinflammation via dysregulated immune activation triggers the accumulation of neurotoxic misfolded proteins in and around CNS cells resulting in neuronal death. Emerging evidence links gut dysbiosis to the aggravation and/or spread of proteinopathies from the peripheral nervous system to the CNS and defective autophagy-mediated proteinopathies. This review summarizes the current understanding of the role of gut microbiota in NDDs, and highlights a vicious cycle of gut dysbiosis, immune-mediated chronic neuroinflammation, impaired autophagy and proteinopathies, which contributes to the development of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. We also discuss novel therapeutic strategies targeting the modulation of gut dysbiosis through prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics or dietary interventions, and faecal microbial transplantation (FMT) in the management of NDDs.",Pharmacology & therapeutics,2022,Saravana Babu Chidambaram; Musthafa Mohamed Essa; A G Rathipriya; Muhammed Bishir; Bipul Ray; Arehally M Mahalakshmi; A H Tousif; Meena K Sakharkar; Rajpal Singh Kashyap; Robert P Friedland; Tanya M Monaghan
34112355,Zinc.,"Since the discovery of manifest Zn deficiency in 1961, the increasing number of studies demonstrated the association between altered Zn status and multiple diseases. In this chapter, we provide a review of the most recent advances on the role of Zn in health and disease (2010-20), with a special focus on the role of Zn in neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders, diabetes and obesity, male and female reproduction, as well as COVID-19. In parallel with the revealed tight association between ASD risk and severity and Zn status, the particular mechanisms linking Zn<sup>2+</sup> and ASD pathogenesis like modulation of synaptic plasticity through ProSAP/Shank scaffold, neurotransmitter metabolism, and gut microbiota, have been elucidated. The increasing body of data indicate the potential involvement of Zn<sup>2+</sup> metabolism in neurodegeneration. Systemic Zn levels in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease were found to be reduced, whereas its sequestration in brain may result in modulation of amyloid Î² and Î±-synuclein processing with subsequent toxic effects. Zn<sup>2+</sup> was shown to possess adipotropic effects through the role of zinc transporters, zinc finger proteins, and Zn-Î±2-glycoprotein in adipose tissue physiology, underlying its particular role in pathogenesis of obesity and diabetes mellitus type 2.

34589401,Novel compound FLZ alleviates rotenone-induced PD mouse model by suppressing TLR4/MyD88/NF-<i>Îº</i>B pathway through microbiota-gut-brain axis.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, but none of the current treatments for PD can halt the progress of the disease due to the limited understanding of the pathogenesis. In PD development, the communication between the brain and the gastrointestinal system influenced by gut microbiota is known as microbiota-gut-brain axis. However, the explicit mechanisms of microbiota dysbiosis in PD development have not been well elucidated yet. FLZ, a novel squamosamide derivative, has been proved to be effective in many PD models and is undergoing the phase I clinical trial to treat PD in China. Moreover, our previous pharmacokinetic study revealed that gut microbiota could regulate the absorption of FLZ <i>inÂ vivo</i>. The aims of our study were to assess the protective effects of FLZ treatment on PD and to further explore the underlying microbiota-related mechanisms of PD by using FLZ as a tool. In the current study, chronic oral administration of rotenone was utilized to induce a mouse model to mimic the pathological process of PD. Here we revealed that FLZ treatment alleviated gastrointestinal dysfunctions, motor symptoms, and dopaminergic neuron death in rotenone-challenged mice. 16S rRNA sequencing found that PD-related microbiota alterations induced by rotenone were reversed by FLZ treatment. Remarkably, FLZ administration attenuated intestinal inflammation and gut barrier destruction, which subsequently inhibited systemic inflammation. Eventually, FLZ treatment restored blood-brain barrier structure and suppressed neuroinflammation by inhibiting the activation of astrocytes and microglia in the substantia nigra (SN). Further mechanistic research demonstrated that FLZ treatment suppressed the TLR4/MyD88/NF-<i>Îº</i>B pathway both in the SN and colon. Collectively, FLZ treatment ameliorates microbiota dysbiosis to protect the PD model <i>via</i> inhibiting TLR4 pathway, which contributes to one of the underlying mechanisms beneath its neuroprotective effects. Our research also supports the importance of microbiota-gut-brain axis in PD pathogenesis, suggesting its potential role as a novel therapeutic target for PD treatment.",Acta pharmaceutica Sinica.

34669122,"An Alternative Explanation for Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease Initiation from Specific Antibiotics, Gut Microbiota Dysbiosis and Neurotoxins.","The late onset neuropathologies, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, have become increasingly prevalent. Their causation has been linked to genetics, gut microbiota dysbiosis (gut dysbiosis), autoimmune diseases, pathogens and exposures to neurotoxins. An alternative explanatory hypothesis is provided for their pathogenesis. Virtually everyone has pervasive daily exposures to neurotoxins, through inhalation, skin contact, direct blood transmission and through the gastrointestinal tract by ingestion. As a result, every individual has substantial and fluctuating neurotoxin blood levels. Two major barriers to neurotoxin entry into the central nervous system are the blood-brain barrier and the intestinal wall, in the absence of gut dysbiosis. Inflammation from gut dysbiosis, induced by antibiotic usage, can increase the intestinal wall permeability for neurotoxins to reach the bloodstream, and also increase the blood-brain barrier permeability to neurotoxins. Gut dysbiosis, including gut dysbiosis caused by antibiotic treatments, is an especially high risk for neurotoxin entry into the brain to cause late onset neuropathologies. Gut dysbiosis has far-reaching immune system and central nervous system effects, and even a transient gut dysbiosis can act in combination with neurotoxins, such as aluminum, mercury, lead, arsenic, cadmium, selenium, manganese, organophosphate pesticides and organochlorines, to reach neurotoxin blood levels that can initiate a late onset neuropathology, depending on an individual's age and genetic vulnerability.",Neurochemical research,2022,Kevin Roe
34475403,Gut microbiota and metabolites of Î±-synuclein transgenic monkey models with early stage of Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease. However, it is unclear whether microbiota and metabolites have demonstrated changes at early PD due to the difficulties in diagnosis and identification of early PD in clinical practice. In a previous study, we generated A53T transgenic monkeys with early Parkinson's symptoms, including anxiety and cognitive impairment. Here we analyzed the gut microbiota by metagenomic sequencing and metabolites by targeted gas chromatography. The gut microbiota analysis showed that the A53T monkeys have higher degree of diversity in gut microbiota with significantly elevated Sybergistetes, Akkermansia, and Eggerthella lenta compared with control monkeys. Prevotella significantly decreased in A53T transgenic monkeys. Glyceric acid, L-Aspartic acid, and p-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid were significantly elevated, whereas Myristic acid and 3-Methylindole were significantly decreased in A53T monkeys. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (KO0131) and the oxidative phosphorylation reaction (KO2147) were significantly increased in metabolic pathways of A53T monkeys. Our study suggested that the transgenic A53T and Î±-syn aggregation may affect the intestine microbiota and metabolites of rhesus monkeys, and the identified five compositional different metabolites that are mainly associated with mitochondrial dysfunction may be related to the pathogenesis of PD.",NPJ biofilms and microbiomes,2021,Yaping Yan; Shuchao Ren; Yanchao Duan; Chenyu Lu; Yuyu Niu; Zhengbo Wang; Briauna Inglis; Weizhi Ji; Yun Zheng; Wei Si
31684843,Effect of nutrition on neurodegenerative diseases. A systematic review.,"Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the progressive functional loss of neurons in the brain, causing cognitive impairment and motoneuron disability. Although multifactorial interactions are evident, nutrition plays an essential role in the pathogenesis and evolution of these diseases. A systematic literature search was performed, and the prevalence of studies evaluated the effect of the Mediterranean diet (MeDiet), nutritional support, EPA and DHA, and vitamins on memory and cognition impairment. The data showed that malnutrition and low body mass index (BMI) is correlated with the higher development of dementia and mortality. MeDiet, nutritional support, and calorie-controlled diets play a protective effect against cognitive decline, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson disease (PD) while malnutrition and insulin resistance represent significant risk factors. Malnutrition activates also the gut-microbiota-brain axis dysfunction that exacerbate neurogenerative process. Omega-3 and -6, and the vitamins supplementation seem to be less effective in protecting neuron degeneration. Insulin activity is a prevalent factor contributing to brain health while malnutrition correlated with the higher development of dementia and mortality.",Nutritional neuroscience,2021,Vittorio Emanuele Bianchi; Pomares Fredy Herrera; Rizzi Laura
34243604,Role of microbiota-derived short-chain fatty acids in nervous system disorders.,"During the past decade, accumulating evidence from the research highlights the suggested effects of bacterial communities of the human gut microbiota and their metabolites on health and disease. In this regard, microbiota-derived metabolites and their receptors, beyond the immune system, maintain metabolism homeostasis, which is essential to maintain the host's health by balancing the utilization and intake of nutrients. It has been shown that gut bacterial dysbiosis can cause pathology and altered bacterial metabolites' formation, resulting in dysregulation of the immune system and metabolism. The short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as butyrate, acetate, and succinate, are produced due to the fermentation process of bacteria in the gut. It has been noted remodeling in the gut microbiota metabolites associated with the pathophysiology of several neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, stress, anxiety, depression, autism, vascular dementia, schizophrenia, stroke, and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders, among others.

A mechanism review was performed to investigate whether the neurodegenerative cascade begins in the gut; mediated by gut dysbiosis and retrograde transport of Î±-synuclein. This review provides a summary of microbiome composition associated with PD, and evaluates pathophysiological mechanisms from animal and in vitro models of PD.A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed; 82 of 299 papers met the inclusion criteria.All twenty-two human case-control studies demonstrated an altered gut microbiota in PD compared to healthy controls, with results suggesting a proinflammatory phenotype present in PD. A germ-free animal study has demonstrated that gut microbiota are required for microglia activation, Î±-synuclein pathology and motor deficits. Accumulation of phosphorylated Î±-synuclein has been observed in the enteric nervous system prior to the onset of motor symptoms in animal models of PD, and there is data to support retrograde transport of Î±-synuclein from the gut to the brain. Different animal models of PD have demonstrated neuroinflammation, microglial activation and loss of dopaminergic neurons in the brain.Evidence from this review supports the hypothesis that pathology spreads from the gut to the brain.

34948234,Human Gut Microbiota in Health and Selected Cancers.,"The majority of the epithelial surfaces of our body, and the digestive tract, respiratory and urogenital systems, are colonized by a vast number of bacteria, archaea, fungi, protozoans, and viruses. These <i>microbiota</i>, particularly those of the intestines, play an important, beneficial role in digestion, metabolism, and the synthesis of vitamins. Their metabolites stimulate cytokine production by the human host, which are used against potential pathogens. The composition of the microbiota is influenced by several internal and external factors, including diet, age, disease, and lifestyle. Such changes, called dysbiosis, may be involved in the development of various conditions, such as metabolic diseases, including metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, Hashimoto's thyroidis and Graves' disease; they can also play a role in nervous system disturbances, such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and depression. An association has also been found between gut microbiota dysbiosis and cancer. Our health is closely associated with the state of our microbiota, and their homeostasis. The aim of this review is to describe the associations between human gut microbiota and cancer, and examine the potential role of gut microbiota in anticancer therapy.",International journal of molecular sciences,2021,Aleksandra SÄdzikowska; Leszek Szablewski
33499229,Clinical Phenotypes of Parkinson's Disease Associate with Distinct Gut Microbiota and Metabolome Enterotypes.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a clinically heterogenic disorder characterized by distinct clinical entities. Most studies on motor deficits dichotomize PD into tremor dominant (TD) or non-tremor dominant (non-TD) with akinetic-rigid features (AR). Different pathophysiological mechanisms may affect the onset of motor manifestations. Recent studies have suggested that gut microbes may be involved in PD pathogenesis. The aim of this study was to investigate the gut microbiota and metabolome composition in PD patients in relation to TD and non-TD phenotypes. In order to address this issue, gut microbiota and the metabolome structure of PD patients were determined from faecal samples using 16S next generation sequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry approaches. The results showed a reduction in the relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae, <i>Blautia</i>, <i>Coprococcus</i>, <i>Lachnospira</i>, and an increase in Enterobacteriaceae, <i>Escherichia</i> and <i>Serratia</i> linked to non-TD subtypes. Moreover, the levels of important molecules (i.e., nicotinic acid, cadaverine, glucuronic acid) were altered in relation to the severity of phenotype. We hypothesize that the microbiota/metabolome enterotypes associated to non-TD subtypes may favor the development of gut inflammatory environment and gastrointestinal dysfunctions and therefore a more severe Î±-synucleinopathy. This study adds important information to PD pathogenesis and emphasizes the potential pathophysiological link between gut microbiota/metabolites and PD motor subtypes.",Biomolecules,2021,Sarah Vascellari; Marta Melis; Vanessa Palmas; Silvia Pisanu; Alessandra Serra; Daniela Perra; Maria Laura Santoru; Valentina Oppo; Roberto Cusano; Paolo Uva; Luigi Atzori; Micaela Morelli; Giovanni Cossu; Aldo Manzin
34835406,Gut Microbiota Regulation and Their Implication in the Development of Neurodegenerative Disease.,"In recent years, human gut microbiota have become one of the most promising areas of microorganism research; meanwhile, the inter-relation between the gut microbiota and various human diseases is a primary focus. As is demonstrated by the accumulating evidence, the gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system interact through the gut-brain axis, which includes neuronal, immune-mediated and metabolite-mediated pathways. Additionally, recent progress from both preclinical and clinical studies indicated that gut microbiota play a pivotal role in gut-brain interactions, whereas the imbalance of the gut microbiota composition may be associated with the pathogenesis of neurological diseases (particularly neurodegenerative diseases), the underlying mechanism of which is insufficiently studied. This review aims to highlight the relationship between gut microbiota and neurodegenerative diseases, and to contribute to our understanding of the function of gut microbiota in neurodegeneration, as well as their relevant mechanisms. Furthermore, we also discuss the current application and future prospects of microbiota-associated therapy, including probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), potentially shedding new light on the research of neurodegeneration.",Microorganisms,2021,Peilin Sun; Lei Su; Hua Zhu; Xue Li; Yaxi Guo; Xiaopeng Du; Ling Zhang; Chuan Qin
34954497,Altered gut microbiota in Parkinson's disease patients with motor complications.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with gut dysbiosis. However, whether gut dysbiosis can cause motor complications is unclear.Subjects were enrolled from four independent movement disorder centers in Japan. We performed 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequence analysis of gut microbiota. Relative abundance of gut microbiota and relationships between them and clinical characteristics were statistically analyzed. Analysis of co-variance (ANCOVA) was used to assess altered gut microbiota associated with wearing-off or dyskinesia.We enrolled 223 patients with PD. Wearing-off was noted in 47.5% of patients and dyskinesia in 21.9%. We detected 98 genera of bacteria. Some changes in the gut microbiota were observed in patients with PD and motor complications. After Bonferroni correction, patients with wearing-off showed decreased relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae Blautia (pÂ <Â 0.0001) and increased relative abundance of Lactobacillaceae Lactobacillus (pÂ <Â 0.0001), but patients with dyskinesia no longer showed significant changes in the gut microbiota. Adjustment with two models of confounding factors followed by ANCOVA revealed that age (pÂ <Â 0.0001), disease duration (pÂ =Â 0.01), and wearing-off (pÂ =Â 0.0004) were independent risks for the decreased relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae Blautia, and wearing-off (pÂ =Â 0.009) was the only independent risk factor for the increased relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae Lactobacillus.Relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae Blautia and Lactobacillaceae Lactobacillus was significantly decreased and increased, respectively, in the gut microbiota of PD patients with motor complications. This indicates that an altered gut microbiota is associated with the development of motor complications in patients with advanced PD.",Parkinsonism & related disorders,2022,Kai Takahashi; Hiroshi Nishiwaki; Mikako Ito; Kazuhiro Iwaoka; Kenta Takahashi; Yoshio Suzuki; Keita Taguchi; Kanako Yamahara; Yoshio Tsuboi; Kenichi Kashihara; Masaaki Hirayama; Kinji Ohno; Tetsuya Maeda
35052575,Parkinson's Disease and the Metal-Microbiome-Gut-Brain Axis: A Systems Toxicology Approach.,"Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease, leading to motor and non-motor complications. Autonomic alterations, including gastrointestinal symptoms, precede motor defects and act as early warning signs. Chronic exposure to dietary, environmental heavy metals impacts the gastrointestinal system and host-associated microbiome, eventually affecting the central nervous system. The correlation between dysbiosis and PD suggests a functional and bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain. The bioaccumulation of metals promotes stress mechanisms by increasing reactive oxygen species, likely altering the bidirectional gut-brain link. To better understand the differing molecular mechanisms underlying PD, integrative modeling approaches are necessary to connect multifactorial perturbations in this heterogeneous disorder. By exploring the effects of gut microbiota modulation on dietary heavy metal exposure in relation to PD onset, the modification of the host-associated microbiome to mitigate neurological stress may be a future treatment option against neurodegeneration through bioremediation. The progressive movement towards a systems toxicology framework for precision medicine can uncover molecular mechanisms underlying PD onset such as metal regulation and microbial community interactions by developing predictive models to better understand PD etiology to identify options for novel treatments and beyond. Several methodologies recently addressed the complexity of this interaction from different perspectives; however, to date, a comprehensive review of these approaches is still lacking. Therefore, our main aim through this manuscript is to fill this gap in the scientific literature by reviewing recently published papers to address the surrounding questions regarding the underlying molecular mechanisms between metals, microbiota, and the gut-brain-axis, as well as the regulation of this system to prevent neurodegeneration.","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2021,Lady Johanna Forero-RodrÃ­guez; Jonathan Josephs-Spaulding; Stefano Flor; AndrÃ©s PinzÃ³n; Christoph Kaleta
34938619,Is the Gut Microbiota a Neglected Aspect of Gut and Brain Disorders?,"The gut microbiota is a quickly developing bacterial ecosystem with biodiversity.Â It is an adaptive immunity that varies with food intake, environmental conditions, and human habits, among other factors.Â Various external stimuli, such as drugs, can influence the gut microbial environment and lead to gut dysbiosis. Recently, gut dysbiosis has been identified as an important factor that leads to several diseases either by the released metabolites or by the gut neuronal connection. In brain disorders, gut dysbiosis is involved in neuropsychiatric manifestations, including autism spectrum disorder, anxiety, and depression by interfering with neurotransmitter homeostasis, and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease by releasing abnormal metabolites from the gut. Gut dysbiosis has been documented in gut disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease or irritable bowel syndrome. Immune cells in the gut are modulated by external factors such as stress, diet, and drugs to produce inflammatory cytokines, including interleukins (IL-4, IL-6, IL-17, IL-23, etc.). Inflammatory cytokines lead to a cascade of events, which lead to various ailments in the bowel. Beneficial bacteria in the form of probiotics ameliorate the condition and have healthful effects in disease conditions. This warrants further research to identify newer therapeutic strategies for diseases that cannot be cured or are difficult to treat.",Cureus,2021,Yuvaraj Balan; Archana Gaur; Varatharajan Sakthivadivel; Bhushan Kamble; Raja Sundaramurthy
33860738,The gut-brain axis and Parkinson disease: clinical and pathogenetic relevance.,"Gastrointestinal disorders are one of the most significant non-motor problems affecting people with Parkinson disease (PD). Pathogenetically, the gastrointestinal tract has been proposed to be the initial site of pathological changes in PD. Intestinal inflammation and alterations in the gut microbiota may contribute to initiation and progression of pathology in PD. However, the mechanisms underlying this ""gut-brain"" axis in PD remain unclear. PD patients can display a large variety of gastrointestinal symptoms, leading to reduced quality of life and psychological distress. Gastrointestinal disorders can also limit patients' response to medications, and consequently negatively impact on neurological outcomes. Despite an increasing research focus, gastrointestinal disorders in PD remain poorly understood and their clinical management often suboptimal. This review summarises our understanding of the relevance of the ""gut-brain"" axis to the pathogenesis of PD, discusses the impact of gastrointestinal disorders in patients with PD, and provides clinicians with practical guidance to their management.",Annals of medicine,2021,Elisa Menozzi; Jane Macnaughtan; Anthony H V Schapira
33459114,Role of gut microbiota in regulating gastrointestinal dysfunction and motor symptoms in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized primarily by motor and non-motor gastrointestinal (GI) deficits. GI symptoms' including compromised intestinal barrier function often accompanies altered gut microbiota composition and motor deficits in PD. Therefore, in this study, we set to investigate the role of gut microbiota and epithelial barrier dysfunction on motor symptom generation using a rotenone-induced mouse model of PD. We found that while six weeks of 10 mg/kg of chronic rotenone administration by oral gavage resulted in loss of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) neurons in both germ-free (GF) and conventionally raised (CR) mice, the decrease in motor strength and coordination was observed only in CR mice. Chronic rotenone treatment did not disrupt intestinal permeability in GF mice but resulted in a significant change in gut microbiota composition and an increase in intestinal permeability in CR mice. These results highlight the potential role of gut microbiota in regulating barrier dysfunction and motor deficits in PD.",Gut microbes,2021,Yogesh Bhattarai; Jie Si; Meng Pu; Owen A Ross; Pamela J McLean; Lisa Till; William Moor; Madhusudan Grover; Karunya K Kandimalla; Kara G Margolis; Gianrico Farrugia; Purna C Kashyap
35779869,Role of the gut microbiota in the development of various neurological diseases.,"In recent years, the scientific evidence supporting a relationship between the microbiota and various diseases has increased significantly; this trend has also been observed for neurological diseases. This has given rise to the concept of the gut-brain axis and the idea of a relationship between the gut microbiota and several neurological diseases whose aetiopathogenesis is yet to be clearly defined.We review the role of the gut microbiota in the gut-brain axis and analyse those neurological diseases in which alterations in the gut microbiota have been described as a result of human studies: specifically, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, and multiple sclerosis.The body of evidence linking the gut microbiota to various neurological diseases has grown considerably. Several interesting studies show a relationship between the gut microbiota and Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer disease, neuromyelitis optica, and multiple sclerosis, whereas other controversial studies implicate it in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Many of these studies place considerable emphasis on modulation of inflammation, particularly by bacteria capable of producing short-chain fatty acids. Despite these encouraging results, many questions remain, and there is a need to demonstrate causality, determine the role of fungi or viruses, and research possible treatment through diet, probiotics, or faecal microbiota transplantation.",Neurologia,2022,F Castillo-Ãlvarez; M E Marzo-Sola
34274348,Interactions between the microbiota and enteric nervous system during gut-brain disorders.,"For the last 20 years, researchers have focused their intention on the impact of gut microbiota in healthy and pathological conditions. This year (2021), more than 25,000 articles can be retrieved from PubMed with the keywords ""gut microbiota and physiology"", showing the constant progress and impact of gut microbes in scientific life. As a result, numerous therapeutic perspectives have been proposed to modulate the gut microbiota composition and/or bioactive factors released from microbes to restore our body functions. Currently, the gut is considered a primary site for the development of pathologies that modify brain functions such as neurodegenerative (Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, etc.) and metabolic (type 2 diabetes, obesity, etc.) disorders. Deciphering the mode of interaction between microbiota and the brain is a real original option to prevent (and maybe treat in the future) the establishment of gut-brain pathologies. The objective of this review is to describe recent scientific elements that explore the communication between gut microbiota and the brain by focusing our interest on the enteric nervous system (ENS) as an intermediate partner. The ENS, which is known as the ""second brain"", could be under the direct or indirect influence of the gut microbiota and its released factors (short-chain fatty acids, neurotransmitters, gaseous factors, etc.). Thus, in addition to their actions on tissue (adipose tissue, liver, brain, etc.), microbes can have an impact on local ENS activity. This potential modification of ENS function has global repercussions in the whole body via the gut-brain axis and represents a new therapeutic strategy.

33573273,Bile Acids and Microbiota: Multifaceted and Versatile Regulators of the Liver-Gut Axis.,"After their synthesis from cholesterol in hepatic tissues, bile acids (BAs) are secreted into the intestinal lumen. Most BAs are subsequently re-absorbed in the terminal ileum and are transported back for recycling to the liver. Some of them, however, reach the colon and change their physicochemical properties upon modification by gut bacteria, and vice versa, BAs also shape the composition and function of the intestinal microbiota. This mutual interplay of both BAs and gut microbiota regulates many physiological processes, including the lipid, carbohydrate and energy metabolism of the host. Emerging evidence also implies an important role of this enterohepatic BA circuit in shaping mucosal colonization resistance as well as local and distant immune responses, tissue physiology and carcinogenesis. Subsequently, disrupted interactions of gut bacteria and BAs are associated with many disorders as diverse as <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> or <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium infection, inflammatory bowel disease, type 1 diabetes, asthma, metabolic syndrome, obesity, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and epilepsy. As we cannot address all of these interesting underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms here, we summarize the current knowledge about the physiologic and pathogenic interplay of local site microbiota and the enterohepatic BA metabolism using a few selected examples of liver and gut diseases.",International journal of molecular sciences,2021,Niklas GrÃ¼ner; Jochen Mattner

34370175,Gut brain axis: an insight into microbiota role in Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common progressive neurodegenerative diseases. It is characterized neuropathologically by the presence of alpha-synuclein containing Lewy Bodies in the substantia nigra of the brain with loss of dopaminergic neurons in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra. The presence of alpha-synuclein aggregates in the substantia nigra and the enteric nervous system (ENS) drew attention to the possibility of a correlation between the gut microbiota and Parkinson's disease. The gut-brain axis is a two-way communication system, which explains how through the vagus nerve, the gut microbiota can affect the central nervous system (CNS), including brain functions related to the ENS, as well as how CNS can alter various gut secretions and immune responses. As a result, this dysbiosis or alteration in gut microbiota can be an early sign of PD with reported changes in short chain fatty acids, bile acids, and lipids. This gave rise to the use of probiotics and faecal microbiota transplantation as alternative approaches to improve the symptoms of patients with PD. The aim of this review is to discuss investigations that have been done to explore the gastrointestinal involvement in Parkinson's disease, the effect of dysbiosis, and potential therapeutic strategies for PD.",Metabolic brain disease,2021,Sara Ayman Moustafa; Shrouk Mohamed; Abdelhameed Dawood; Jihan Azar; Ekramy Elmorsy; Noura A M Rizk; Mohamed Salama

Abundance of bacteria producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and fecal SCFA concentrations are reduced in PD. SCFAs exert various beneficial functions in humans. In the interventional, monocentric, open-label clinical trial ""Effects of Resistant Starch on Bowel Habits, Short Chain Fatty Acids and Gut Microbiota in Parkinson'sDisease"" (RESISTA-PD; ID: NCT02784145), we aimed at altering fecal SCFAs by an 8-week prebiotic intervention with resistant starch (RS). We enrolled 87 subjects in three study-arms: 32 PD patients received RS (PDÂ +Â RS), 30 control subjects received RS, and 25 PD patients received solely dietary instructions. We performed paired-end 100 bp length metagenomic sequencing of fecal samples using the BGISEQ platform at an average of 9.9Â GB. RS was well-tolerated. In the PDÂ +Â RS group, fecal butyrate concentrations increased significantly, and fecal calprotectin concentrations dropped significantly after 8Â weeks of RS intervention. Clinically, we observed a reduction in non-motor symptom load in the PDÂ +Â RS group. The reference-based analysis of metagenomes highlighted stable alpha-diversity and beta-diversity across the three groups, including bacteria producing SCFAs. Reference-free analysis suggested punctual, yet pronounced differences in the metagenomic signature in the PDÂ +Â RS group. RESISTA-PD highlights that a prebiotic treatment with RS is safe and well-tolerated in PD. The stable alpha-diversity and beta-diversity alongside altered fecal butyrate and calprotectin concentrations call for long-term studies, also investigating whether RS is able to modify the clinical course of PD.","Genomics, proteomics & bioinformatics",2022,Anouck Becker; Georges Pierre Schmartz; Laura GrÃ¶ger; Nadja Grammes; Valentina Galata; Hannah Philippeit; Jacqueline Weiland; Nicole Ludwig; Eckart Meese; Sascha Tierling; JÃ¶rn Walter; Andreas Schwiertz; JÃ¶rg Spiegel; Gudrun Wagenpfeil; Klaus FaÃbender; Andreas Keller; Marcus M Unger
34358037,Modulation of Neuroinflammation by the Gut Microbiota in Prion and Prion-Like Diseases.,"The process of neuroinflammation contributes to the pathogenic mechanism of many neurodegenerative diseases. The deleterious attributes of neuroinflammation involve aberrant and uncontrolled activation of glia, which can result in damage to proximal brain parenchyma. Failure to distinguish self from non-self, as well as leukocyte reaction to aggregation and accumulation of proteins in the CNS, are the primary mechanisms by which neuroinflammation is initiated. While processes local to the CNS may instigate neurodegenerative disease, the existence or dysregulation of systemic homeostasis can also serve to improve or worsen CNS pathologies, respectively. One fundamental component of systemic homeostasis is the gut microbiota, which communicates with the CNS via microbial metabolite production, the peripheral nervous system, and regulation of tryptophan metabolism. Over the past 10-15 years, research focused on the microbiota-gut-brain axis has culminated in the discovery that dysbiosis, or an imbalance between commensal and pathogenic gut bacteria, can promote CNS pathologies. Conversely, a properly regulated and well-balanced microbiome supports CNS homeostasis and reduces the incidence and extent of pathogenic neuroinflammation. This review will discuss the role of the gut microbiota in exacerbating or alleviating neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases, and potential microbiota-based therapeutic approaches to reduce pathology in diseased states.","Pathogens (Basel, Switzerland)",2021,Josephine Trichka; Wen-Quan Zou

Clinical data indicate the substantial role of B-vitamins in various psychiatric disorders, including major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, autism, and dementia, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. As enzymatic cofactors, B-vitamins are involved in many physiological processes such as the metabolism of glucose, fatty acids and amino acids, metabolism of tryptophan in the kynurenine pathway, homocysteine metabolism, synthesis and metabolism of various neurotransmitters and neurohormones including serotonin, dopamine, adrenaline, acetylcholine, GABA, glutamate, D-serine, glycine, histamine and melatonin. Those vitamins are highly involved in brain energetic metabolism and respiration at the cellular level. They have a broad range of anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antioxidant and neuroprotective properties. Furthermore, some of those vitamins are involved in the regulation of permeability of the intestinal and blood-brain barriers. Despite the fact that a substantial amount of the above vitamins is acquired from various dietary sources, deficiencies are not uncommon, and it is estimated that micronutrient deficiencies affect about two billion people worldwide. The majority of gut-resident microbes and the broad range of bacteria available in fermented food, express genetic machinery enabling the synthesis and metabolism of B-vitamins and, consequently, intestinal microbiota and fermented food rich in probiotic bacteria are essential sources of B-vitamins for humans. All in all, there is growing evidence that intestinal bacteria-derived vitamins play a significant role in physiology and that dysregulation of the ""microbiota-vitamins frontier"" is related to various disorders. In this review, we will discuss the role of vitamins in mental health and explore the perspectives and potential of how gut microbiota-derived vitamins could contribute to mental health and psychiatric treatment.",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,2021,Leszek Rudzki; Trevor W Stone; Michael Maes; BÅaÅ¼ej Misiak; Jerzy Samochowiec; Agata Szulc
34682763,The Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis as a Key to Neuropsychiatric Disorders: A Mini Review.,"The central nervous system (CNS) is closely related to the gastrointestinal tract, mainly through regulating its function and homeostasis.

34737076,Environmental neurotoxicants and inflammasome activation in Parkinson's disease - A focus on the gut-brain axis.,"Inflammasomes are multi-protein complexes expressed in immune cells that function as intracellular sensors of environmental, metabolic and cellular stress. Inflammasome activation in the brain, has been shown to drive neuropathology and disease progression by multiple mechanisms, making it one of the most attractive therapeutic targets for disease modification in Parkinson's Disease (PD). Extensive inflammasome activation is evident in the brains of people with PD at the sites of dopaminergic degeneration and synuclein aggregation. While substantial progress has been made on validating inflammasome activation as a therapeutic target for PD, the mechanisms by which inflammasome activation is triggered and sustained over the disease course remain poorly understood. A growing body of evidence point to environmental and occupational chemical exposures as possible triggers of inflammasome activation in PD. The involvement of the gastrointestinal system and gut microbiota in PD pathophysiology is beginning to be elucidated, especially the profound link between gut dysbiosis and immune activation. While large cohort studies confirmed specific changes in the gut microbiota in PD patients compared to age-matched healthy controls, recent research suggest that synuclein pathology could be initiated in the gastrointestinal tract. In this review, we present a summarized perspective on current understanding on inflammasome activation and the gut-brain-axis link during PD pathophysiology. We discuss multiple environmental toxicants that are implicated as the etiological agents in causing idiopathic PD and their mechanistic underpinnings during neuroinflammatory events.

34512244,What Is Our Understanding of the Influence of Gut Microbiota on the Pathophysiology of Parkinson's Disease?,"Microbiota have increasingly become implicated in predisposition to human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Traditionally, a central nervous system (CNS)-centric approach to understanding PD has predominated; however, an association of the gut with PD has existed since Parkinson himself reported the disease. The gut-brain axis refers to the bidirectional communication between the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and the brain. Gut microbiota dysbiosis, reported in PD patients, may extend this to a microbiota-gut-brain axis. To date, mainly the bacteriome has been investigated. The change in abundance of bacterial products which accompanies dysbiosis is hypothesised to influence PD pathophysiology <i>via</i> multiple mechanisms which broadly centre on inflammation, a cause of alpha-synuclein (a-syn) misfolding. Two main routes are hypothesised by which gut microbiota can influence PD pathophysiology, the neural and humoral routes. The neural route involves a-syn misfolding peripherally in the enteric nerves which can then be transported to the brain <i>via</i> the vagus nerve. The humoral route involves transportation of bacterial products and proinflammatory cytokines from the gut <i>via</i> the circulation which can cause central a-syn misfolding by inducing neuroinflammation. This article will assess whether the current literature supports gut bacteria influencing PD pathophysiology <i>via</i> both routes.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2021,Amaryllis E Hill; Richard Wade-Martins; Philip W J Burnet
34094829,"Gut microbiota mediates the absorption of FLZ, a new drug for Parkinson's disease treatment.","The gut microbiota plays an important role in regulating the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of many drugs. FLZ, a novel squamosamide derivative, has been shown to have neuroprotective effects on experimental Parkinson's disease (PD) models. FLZ is under phase â  clinical trial now, while the underlying mechanisms contributing to the absorption of FLZ are still not fully elucidated. Due to the main metabolite of FLZ was abundant in feces but rare in urine and bile of mice, we focused on the gut microbiota to address how FLZ was metabolized and absorbed. <i>InÂ vitro</i> studies revealed that FLZ could be exclusively metabolized to its major metabolite M1 by the lanosterol 14 alpha-demethylase (CYP51) in the gut microbiota, but was almost not metabolized by any other metabolism-related organs, such as liver, kidney, and small intestine. M1 was quickly absorbed into the blood and then remethylated to FLZ by catechol <i>O</i>-methyltransferase (COMT). Notably, dysbacteriosis reduced the therapeutic efficacy of FLZ on the PD mouse model by inhibiting its absorption. The results show that the gut microbiota mediate the absorption of FLZ through a FLZ-M1-FLZ circulation. Our research elucidates the vital role of the gut microbiota in the absorption of FLZ and provides a theoretical basis for clinical pharmacokinetic studies and clinical application of FLZ in the treatment of PD.",Acta pharmaceutica Sinica.

34977556,Influence of probiotic bacteria on gut microbiota composition and gut wall function in an <i>in-vitro</i> model in patients with Parkinson's disease.,"We report here the potential role of a 4-strain probiotic suspension for use with patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Stool samples from a group of three patients with diagnosed PD were used to create microbiotas in an <i>in-vitro</i> gut model. The effects of dosing with an oral probiotic suspension (Symprove) on bacterial composition and metabolic activity in the microbiotas was evaluated over 48Â h and compared with healthy controls. Additionally, the effect of probiotic dosing on epithelial tight-junction integrity, production of inflammatory markers and wound healing were evaluated in cell culture models. In general, the relative proportions of the main bacterial phyla in the microbiotas of PD patients differed from those of healthy subjects, with levels of <i>Firmicutes</i> raised and levels of <i>Bacteroidetes</i> reduced. Dosing with probiotic resulted in a change in bacterial composition in the microbiotas over a 48Â h period. Several other indicators of gut health changed upon dosing with the probiotic; production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and lactate was stimulated, levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-10) increased and levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (MCP-1 and IL-8) decreased. Tight junction integrity was seen to improve with probiotic dosing and wound healing was seen to occur faster than a control.

33804226,New Avenues for Parkinson's Disease Therapeutics: Disease-Modifying Strategies Based on the Gut Microbiota.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder that currently affects 1% of the population over the age of 60 years, and for which no disease-modifying treatments exist. Neurodegeneration and neuropathology in different brain areas are manifested as both motor and non-motor symptoms in patients. Recent interest in the gut-brain axis has led to increasing research into the gut microbiota changes in PD patients and their impact on disease pathophysiology. As evidence is piling up on the effects of gut microbiota in disease development and progression, another front of action has opened up in relation to the potential usage of microbiota-based therapeutic strategies in treating gastrointestinal alterations and possibly also motor symptoms in PD. This review provides status on the different strategies that are in the front line (i.e., antibiotics; probiotics; prebiotics; synbiotics; dietary interventions; fecal microbiota transplantation, live biotherapeutic products), and discusses the opportunities and challenges the field of microbiome research in PD is facing.",Biomolecules,2021,Marina Lorente-PicÃ³n; Ariadna Laguna
33857347,Bacterial Extracellular Vesicles and the Gut-Microbiota Brain Axis: Emerging Roles in Communication and Potential as Therapeutics.,"Bacterial extracellular vesicles (BEVs) have emerged as candidate signaling vectors for long-distance interkingdom communication within the gut-microbiota brain axis. Most bacteria release these nanosized vesicles, capable of signaling to the brain via their abundant protein and small RNA cargo, possibly directly via crossing the blood-brain barrier. BEVs have been shown to regulate brain gene expression and induce pathology at most stages of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, and thus they may play a causal role in diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and depression/anxiety. On the other hand, BEVs have intrinsic therapeutic properties that may be relevant to probiotic therapy and can also be engineered to function as drug delivery vehicles and vaccines. Thus, BEVs may be both a cause of and solution to neuropathological conditions. In this review, current knowledge of the physiological roles of BEVs as well as state of the art pertaining to the development of therapeutic BEVs in the context of the microbiome-gut-brain axis are summarized.",Advanced biology,2021,Nicholas H Pirolli; William E Bentley; Steven M Jay
33746867,Effect of Levodopa Initiation on the Gut Microbiota in Parkinson's Disease.,"<b>Background:</b> The impact of Levodopa on the gut microbiota of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients has not been sufficiently addressed. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted a longitudinal study to examine the impact of Levodopa initiation on the gut microbiota composition of 19 PD patients who had not previously been exposed to Levodopa. Patients provided two stool samples prior to and two samples 90 days after starting Levodopa. Motor impairment (MDS-UPDRS Part III), diet, and other patient characteristics were assessed. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was used to characterize the microbiota. We examined, cross-sectionally and longitudinally, the associations between Levodopa use and alpha and beta diversity and performed feature-wise, multivariate modeling to identify taxa associated longitudinally with Levodopa use and with improvement in motor function after Levodopa administration. <b>Results:</b> We did not observe significant differences in alpha or beta diversity before vs. after initiation of Levodopa. In longitudinal feature-wise analyses, at the genus level, no taxa were significantly associated with Levodopa use after false discovery rate (FDR) correction (<i>q</i> < 0.05). We observed a marginally lower relative abundance of bacteria belonging to <i>Clostridium</i> group IV in PD patients who experienced a medium or large improvement in motor impairment in response to Levodopa compared to those with a small response [Î² = -0.64 (SE: 0.18), p-trend: 0.00015 p-FDR: 0.019]. <b>Conclusions:</b> In this study, Levodopa was not associated with changes in microbiota composition in this longitudinal analysis. The association between abundance of <i>Clostridium</i> group IV and short-term motor symptom response to Levodopa is preliminary and should be investigated in larger, longer-term studies, that include a control group.",Frontiers in neurology,2021,Natalia Palacios; Anas Hannoun; Julie Flahive; Doyle Ward; Kelsey Goostrey; Anindita Deb; Kara M Smith
34934429,Gut microbiota relieves inflammation in the substantia nigra of chronic Parkinson's disease by protecting the function of dopamine neurons.,"The composition of the intestinal flora of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) can change. However, whether reshaping the gut microbial composition can treat PD remains to be seen. The present study evaluated the effect of intestinal flora in the treatment of PD in a C57BL/6 mouse PD model induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Chronic, low-dose, MPTP-treated mice exhibited upregulated gene expression levels of TNF-Î± and IL-1Î² in the substantia nigra (SN) of the mice, and induced intestinal microbial disorders. This indicated that the chronic low-dose MPTP model could be used to evaluate the progress of early intestinal pathology and intestinal flora imbalance in PD. After transplantation of faecal bacteria to MPTP-induced PD mice, the level of inflammation in the SN of the mice was reduced, and motor dysfunction was alleviated. Notably, faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) upregulated the abundance of <i>Blautia</i> but downregulated <i>Anaerostipes</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, <i>ASF356</i> and <i>Ruminococcus</i> in the gut of PD mice. In addition, FMT reduced the activation of microglia and astrocytes in the SN and reduced the expression levels of GSK3Î², IL-1Î², inducible nitric oxide synthase and phosphorylated PTEN in the SN. Overall, the present study demonstrated that gut microbial dysfunction is associated with the pathogenesis of PD, and that FMT can protect PD mice by inhibiting neuroinflammation.",Experimental and therapeutic medicine,2022,Tian Zhang; Tan Wang; Xinxu Chen; Zhenqiang Zhao; Zhibin Chen
33763767,Unravelling the potential of gut microbiota in sustaining brain health and their current prospective towards development of neurotherapeutics.,"Increasing incidences of neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are being reported, but an insight into their pathology remains elusive. Findings have suggested that gut microbiota play a major role in regulating brain functions through the gut-brain axis. A unique bidirectional communication between gut microbiota and maintenance of brain health could play a pivotal role in regulating incidences of neurodegenerative diseases. Contrarily, the present life style with changing food habits and disturbed circadian rhythm may contribute to gut homeostatic imbalance and dysbiosis leading to progression of several neurological disorders. Therefore, dysbiosis, as a primary factor behind intestinal disorders, may also augment inflammation, intestinal and blood-brain barrier permeability through microbiota-gut-brain axis. This review primarily focuses on the gut-brain axis functions, specific gut microbial population, metabolites produced by gut microbiota, their role in regulating various metabolic processes and role of gut microbiota towards development of neurodegenerative diseases. However, several studies have reported a decrease in abundance of a specific gut microbial population and a corresponding increase in other microbial family, with few findings revealing some contradictions. Reports also showed that colonization of gut microbiota isolated from patients suffering from neurodegenerative disease leads to the development of enhance pathological outcomes in animal models. Hence, a systematic understanding of the dominant role of specific gut microbiome towards development of different neurodegenerative diseases could possibly provide novel insight into the use of probiotics and microbial transplantation as a substitute approach for treating/preventing such health maladies.",Archives of microbiology,2021,Ankita Banerjee; Lilesh Kumar Pradhan; Pradyumna Kumar Sahoo; Kautilya Kumar Jena; Nishant Ranjan Chauhan; Santosh Chauhan; Saroj Kumar Das
33337387,Does Gut Microbiota Influence the Course of Parkinson's Disease? A 3-Year Prospective Exploratory Study in de novo Patients.,"Although abnormalities in gut microbiota are hypothesized to influence the pathogenesis and clinical phenotype of Parkinson's disease (PD), prospective studies on de novo patients are lacking.To preliminarily investigate whether gut microbiota in early untreated PD may predict motor and non-motor features progression over a 3-year period.16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicons were sequenced on fecal samples of 39 de novo PD patients. Multiple confounders were taken into account, including dietary habits. Motor and non-motor symptoms were assessed using validated scales at baseline and followed-up yearly for 3 years. At last follow-up, a detailed neuropsychological assessment was additionally performed. A general linear model for repeated measurements- adjusted by dopaminergic therapy at follow-up- was used to investigate the relationship between bacterial taxa abundance at baseline (stratified by the median of distribution at baseline) and outcome variables.Twenty-five patients were included (11 refused, 2 lost at follow-up, 1 died). Lower abundance of Roseburia (Firmicutes phylum) at baseline was associated with worse evolution of motor, non-motor and cognitive functions at 3-year follow-up. Similarly, lower abundance of Ruminococcaceae and Actinobacteria at baseline was associated with faster worsening of global cognitive functions. At follow-up, frontal lobe functions were the features most robustly associated with baseline microbial abnormalities.In the present exploratory study on de novo PD, we found an association between abnormal distribution of specific bacterial taxa and the progression of motor and non-motor features over a 3-year period. This proof-of-principle study supports the design of a larger observational study aiming to determine whether these differences survive multiple-comparison correction and define microbiota-specific subgroups suitable for therapeutic targeting.",Journal of Parkinson's disease,2021,Roberto Cilia; Marco Piatti; Emanuele Cereda; Carlotta Bolliri; Serena Caronni; Valentina Ferri; Erica Cassani; Salvatore Bonvegna; Carlo Ferrarese; Anna L Zecchinelli; Michela Barichella; Gianni Pezzoli
34219519,The Role of The Gut Microbiome in Parkinson's Disease.,"The gut microbiota is known to play a role in various disease states through inflammatory, immune and endocrinologic response. Parkinson's Disease is of particular interest as gastrointestinal involvement is one of the earlier features seen in this disease. This paper examines the relationship between gut microbiota and Parkinson's Disease, which has a growing body of literature. Inflammation caused by gut dysbiosis is thought to increase a-synuclein aggregation and worsen motor and neurologic symptoms of Parkinson's disease. We discuss potential treatment and supplementation to modify the microbiota. Some of these treatments require further research before recommendations can be made, such as cord blood transplant, antibiotic use, immunomodulation and fecal microbiota transplant. Other interventions, such as increasing dietary fiber, polyphenol and fermented food intake, can be made with few risks and may have some benefit for symptom relief and speed of disease progression.",Journal of geriatric psychiatry and neurology,2021,Amy Gallop; James Weagley; Saif-Ur-Rahman Paracha; George Grossberg
34032644,Gut Microbiota as a Mediator of Host Neuro-Immune Interactions: Implications in Neuroinflammatory Disorders.,"The dynamic population of microbes that reside in the gastrointestinal tract plays a pivotal role in orchestrating several aspects of host physiology and health, including but not limited to nutrient extraction and metabolism, as well as the regulation of intestinal epithelial barrier integrity. Gut microbes interact with the host in a bi-directional manner as the microbiota can support the development and education of the innate and adaptive immune systems, thereby conferring protection against pathogens and harmful stimuli while training the host to maintain a homeostatic tolerance towards commensal symbiotics. Recent advances in the field have highlighted the importance of the host-microbiota relationship in neurodevelopment and behaviour, with relevant implications for the onset and progression of brain disorders of inflammatory origin. Microbial modulation of brain function is achieved throughout complex neuro-immune-endocrine pathways of the microbiome-gut-brain axis. Changes in the composition of the gut microbiota or perturbation in microbial-derived metabolites and neuroactive compounds are sensed by the afferent branches of the sympathetic and vagal innervation and transmitted to the central nervous system, which in turn produces behavioural responses. Here, we focus on how the crosstalk between the gut microbiota and the immune system modulates the development and function of the peripheral and central nervous systems. Specific attention is afforded to the involvement of host-microbe neuroimmune interactions in the pathogenesis of neuro-psychiatric and neuroinflammatory disorders such as autism spectrum disorders, anxiety, and depression, as well as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.",Modern trends in psychiatry,2021,Valentina Caputi; Jelena Popov; Maria Cecilia Giron; Siobhain O Apos Mahony
33510784,Fecal Microbiota Transplantation: A New Therapeutic Attempt from the Gut to the Brain.,"Gut dysbacteriosis is closely related to various intestinal and extraintestinal diseases. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a biological therapy that entails transferring the gut microbiota from healthy individuals to patients in order to reconstruct the intestinal microflora in the latter. It has been proved to be an effective treatment for recurrent <i>Clostridium difficile</i> infection. Studies show that the gut microbiota plays an important role in the pathophysiology of neurological and psychiatric disorders through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Therefore, reconstruction of the healthy gut microbiota is a promising new strategy for treating cerebral diseases. We have reviewed the latest research on the role of gut microbiota in different nervous system diseases as well as FMT in the context of its application in neurological, psychiatric, and other nervous system-related diseases (Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder, hepatic encephalopathy, neuropathic pain, etc.).",Gastroenterology research and practice,2021,Hao-Ming Xu; Hong-Li Huang; You-Lian Zhou; Hai-Lan Zhao; Jing Xu; Di-Wen Shou; Yan-Di Liu; Yong-Jian Zhou; Yu-Qiang Nie

Over the last few years, a revolutionary theory has correlated Parkinson's disease and other neurological disorders with a shared mechanism, which determines Î±-synuclein aggregates and progresses in the host in a prion-like manner. In this review, the main characteristics shared between Î±-synuclein and prion protein are compared and the cofactors that influence the remodeling of native protein structures and pathogenetic mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration are discussed.",International journal of molecular sciences,2021,Sarah Vascellari; Aldo Manzin
33400024,Is Gut Dysbiosis an Epicenter of Parkinson's Disease?,"Once recognized as one of the most esoteric diseases of the central nervous system, Parkinson's disease (PD) is now deemed to be a chronic illness contributed by the central, autonomic and enteric nervous systems. Most likely, an accumulation of Î±-synuclein in the central and enteric nervous systems is the key that supports this viewpoint. Constipation, one of the non-motor hallmarks in roughly two-third of PD patients, is regulated by the composition of gut bacteria, which is assumed to set off the enteric Î±-synuclein accrual. Vagus nerve is suggested to direct the signal for Î±-synuclein over-expression and accumulation to the brain. While trillions of microorganisms reside in the intestinal tract, only one third of the proportion inhabits evenly in all individuals. Existence of an impaired gut-microbe-brain axis consonant with dysbiosis could be an epicenter of this inexplicable disorder. Any alteration in the structure and function of the gastrointestinal tract owing to exposure of endogenous or exogenous chemicals or toxicants could lead to dysbiosis. However, inconsistency in the symptoms even after exposure to same chemical or toxicant in PD patients emphatically creates a conundrum. While the level of a few specific neurotransmitters and metabolites is influenced by microbes, implication of dysbiosis is still debatable. Nevertheless, the scientific literature is overflowing with the remarkable observations supporting the role of dysbiosis in PD. Lack of specificity to differentially diagnose PD with non-PD or PD-plus syndrome, to identify highly precise drug targets and to develop therapeutic stratagems to encounter the disease on the basis of this approach, causes us to be open-minded about the dysbiosis theory. The article reviews the facts supporting gut dysbiosis as the foremost trigger for PD onset along with disagreements.",Neurochemical research,2021,Charul Rajput; Alika Sarkar; Nidhi Sachan; Neeraj Rawat; Mahendra Pratap Singh
34381040,Genetic and environmental factors in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases and promising therapeutic intervention via fecal microbiota transplantation.,"Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by neuronal impairment and loss of function, and with the major shared histopathological hallmarks of misfolding and aggregation of specific proteins inside or outside cells. Some genetic and environmental factors contribute to the promotion of the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Currently, there are no effective treatments for neurodegenerative diseases. It has been revealed that bidirectional communication exists between the brain and the gut. The gut microbiota is a changeable and experience-dependent ecosystem and can be modified by genetic and environmental factors. The gut microbiota provides potential therapeutic targets that can be regulated as new interventions for neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we discuss genetic and environmental risk factors for neurodegenerative diseases, summarize the communication among the components of the microbiota-gut-brain axis, and discuss the treatment strategy of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). FMT is a promising treatment for neurodegenerative diseases, and restoration of the gut microbiota to a premorbid state is a novel goal for prevention and treatment strategies.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2021,Hui Wang; Feng Yang; Shidong Zhang; Ruihua Xin; Yan Sun
33549028,A narrative review of relationship between gut microbiota and neuropsychiatric disorders: mechanisms and clinical application of probiotics and prebiotics.,"The gut microbiota is a kind of fixed-value bacteria in the human intestine, characterized by a large quantity, a wide variety and interdependence with each other and with the host. The gut microbiota is considered to be an important link in maintaining health and pathogenic mechanism of many diseases. The gut microbiota affects the central nervous system under the action of the microbe-gut-brain axis through nerve, immune, endocrine and metabolic pathways. The gut microbiota not only regulates the gastrointestinal tract but plays a vital role in the development and function of the brain. More and more studies believe that normal gut microbiota is essential for the development of the central nervous system and emotional regulation. The imbalance of the gut microbiota can affect some neuropsychiatric diseases. Probiotics and prebiotics are active microorganisms beneficial to the human body and can regulate the microecological balance of the human intestinal tract. Current research shows that probiotics and prebiotics have a good preventive effect on Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, depression, autism spectrum disorders and other neurological and mental diseases. Based on this, we review the relevant research on the pathogenesis of probiotics and prebiotics and neuropsychiatric diseases, in an attempt to providing new ideas for exploring the treatment and prevention of neuropsychiatric diseases.",Annals of palliative medicine,2021,Huan Yang; Yuqing Liu; Rui Cai; Ying Li; Bing Gu

33470765,The gut microbiota metabolite propionate ameliorates intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction-mediated Parkinson's disease via the AKT signaling pathway.,"Parkinson's disease is a common neurodegenerative disease. Here, we investigated the protective effect and potential mechanisms of propionate on the intestinal epithelial barrier in mice with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced Parkinson's disease.Gas chromatography was used to determine short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) concentrations in the fecal samples of Parkinson's disease patients and healthy controls. The stepping test was used to analyze forelimb akinesia, whisker test was used to analyze sensorimotor injury, cylinder test was used to analyze sensorimotor function, and Western blotting was used to analyze protein expression.The concentrations of SCFAs, including acetate, butyrate and propionate, were significantly downregulated in the fecal samples of Parkinson's disease patients, and among the SCFAs, propionate decreased the most. Propionate administration improved the stepping test score, whisker test score and cylinder test score of MPTP-induced Parkinson's disease mice. Additionally, propionate administration increased the protein expression of zonula occludens-1 and occludin. Moreover, the effects of propionate on motor behavior and the intestinal epithelial barrier were dependent on the proteirrserinc-threonine kinases (AKT) signaling pathway. More importantly, treatment with SC79, a specific AKT agonist, abolished the effects of propionate on the intestinal epithelial barrier and motor behavior.Our results demonstrated that propionate, which was decreased in the fecal samples of Parkinson's disease patients, exerted beneficial effects on intestinal epithelial barrier function and improved motor behavior in MPTP-induced Parkinson's disease mice through the AKT signaling pathway.",Neuroreport,2021,Tingting Huang; Hongjuan Shi; Yuanfeng Xu; Lili Ji
34495955,Gut microbiota alterations in response to sleep length among African-origin adults.,"Sleep disorders are increasingly being characterized in modern society as contributing to a host of serious medical problems, including obesity and metabolic syndrome. Changes to the microbial community in the human gut have been reportedly associated with many of these cardiometabolic outcomes. In this study, we investigated the impact of sleep length on the gut microbiota in a large cohort of 655 participants of African descent, aged 25-45, from Ghana, South Africa (SA), Jamaica, and the United States (US). The sleep duration was self-reported via a questionnaire. Participants were classified into 3 sleep groups: short (<7hrs), normal (7-<9hrs), and long (â¥9hrs). Forty-seven percent of US participants were classified as short sleepers and 88% of SA participants as long sleepers. Gut microbial composition analysis (16S rRNA gene sequencing) revealed that bacterial alpha diversity negatively correlated with sleep length (p<0.05). Furthermore, sleep length significantly contributed to the inter-individual beta diversity dissimilarity in gut microbial composition (p<0.01). Participants with both short and long-sleep durations exhibited significantly higher abundances of several taxonomic features, compared to normal sleep duration participants. The predicted relative proportion of two genes involved in the butyrate synthesis via lysine pathway were enriched in short sleep duration participants. Finally, co-occurrence relationships revealed by network analysis showed unique interactions among the short, normal and long duration sleepers. These results suggest that sleep length in humans may alter gut microbiota by driving population shifts of the whole microbiota and also specific changes in Exact Sequence Variants abundance, which may have implications for chronic inflammation associated diseases. The current findings suggest a possible relationship between disrupted sleep patterns and the composition of the gut microbiota. Prospective investigations in larger and more prolonged sleep researches and causally experimental studies are needed to confirm these findings, investigate the underlying mechanism and determine whether improving microbial homeostasis may buffer against sleep-related health decline in humans.",PloS one,2021,Na Fei; Candice Choo-Kang; Sirimon Reutrakul; Stephanie J Crowley; Dale Rae; Kweku Bedu-Addo; Jacob Plange-Rhule; Terrence E Forrester; Estelle V Lambert; Pascal Bovet; Walter Riesen; Wolfgang Korte; Amy Luke; Brian T Layden; Jack A Gilbert; Lara R Dugas
34974121,Gut microbiota modulation by prednisolone in a rat kindling model of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizure.,"The gut microbiota is a complex community composed by several microorganisms that interact in the maintenance of homeostasis and contribute to physiological processes, including brain function. The relationship of the taxonomic composition of the gut microbiota with neurological diseases such as autism, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, anxiety, and depression is widely recognized. The immune system is an important intermediary between the gut microbiota and the central nervous system, being one of the communication routes of the gut-brain axis. Although the complexity of the relationship between inflammation and epilepsy has not yet been elucidated, inflammatory processes are similar in many ways to the consequences of dysbiosis and contribute to disease progression. This study aimed to analyze the taxonomic composition of the gut microbiota of rats treated with prednisolone in a kindling model of epilepsy. Male Wistar rats (90 days, nÂ =Â 24) divided into four experimental groups: sodium chloride solution 0.9Â g%, diazepam 2Â mg/kg, prednisolone 1Â mg/kg, and prednisolone 5Â mg/kg administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) for 14 days. The kindling model was induced by pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) 25Â mg/kg i.p. on alternate days. The taxonomic profile was established by applying metagenomic DNA sequencing. There was no change in alpha diversity, and the composition of the gut microbiota between prednisolone and diazepam was similar. The significant increase in Verrucomicrobia, Saccharibacteria, and Actinobacteria may be related to the protective activity against seizures and inflammatory processes that cause some cases of epilepsy. Further studies are needed to investigate the functional influence that these species have on epilepsy and the inflammatory processes that trigger it.",Microbial pathogenesis,2022,Amanda Muliterno Domingues LourenÃ§o de Lima; Gabriel de Lima Rosa; Edson Fernando MÃ¼ller Guzzo; Rafael Bremm Padilha; Rodrigo Costa da Silva; Alexandre Kleber Silveira; Daiana de Lima Morales; Milena Conci de Araujo; JosÃ© Claudio Fonseca Moreira; Afonso LuÃ­s Barth; Adriana Simon Coitinho; Sueli Teresinha Van Der Sand
34560239,Regulation of neurotoxicity in the striatum and colon of MPTP-induced Parkinson's disease mice by gut microbiome.,"Increasing evidence suggests the role of gut-microbiota-brain axis in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). The objective of this study was to examine whether repeated administration of MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) can influence the neurotoxicity in the striatum and colon, and the composition of gut microbiota and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in feces of adult mice. MPTP caused the reduction of dopamine transporter (DAT) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the striatum, and increases in phosphorylated Î±-synuclein (p-Î±-Syn) in the striatum and colon. There was a negative correlation between the expression of TH in the striatum and the expression of p-Î±-Syn in the colon, suggesting a role of gut-brain communication. MPTP caused abnormalities in the Î±- and Î²-diversity of gut microbiota in the mice. Furthermore, the relative abundance of the genus Faecalicatena in the MPTP-treated group was significantly lower than that of control group. Interestingly, there was a positive correlation between the genus Faecalicatena and the expression of TH in the striatum. Moreover, MPTP did not alter the levels of SCFAs in feces samples. However, there was a positive correlation between the relative abundance of the genus Faecalicatena and propionic acid. The data suggest that MPTP-induced increases in colonic p-Î±-Syn expression might be associated with dopaminergic neurotoxicity in the striatum via gut-microbiota-brain axis.",Brain research bulletin,2021,Jiajing Shan; Youge Qu; Siming Wang; Yan Wei; Lijia Chang; Li Ma; Kenji Hashimoto

33404072,Role of pattern recognition receptors and the microbiota in neurological disorders.,"In recent years, the gut microbiota has been increasingly implicated in the development of many extraintestinal disorders, including neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Despite this growing connection, our understanding of the precise mechanisms behind these effects is currently lacking. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are important innate immune proteins expressed on the surface and within the cytoplasm of a multitude of cells, both immune and otherwise, including epithelial, endothelial and neuronal. PRRs comprise four major subfamilies: the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain leucine rich repeats-containing receptors (NLRs), the retinoic acid inducible gene 1-like receptors and the C-type lectin receptors. Recognition of commensal bacteria by PRRs is critical for maintaining host-microbe interactions and homeostasis, including behaviour. The expression of PRRs on multiple cell types makes them a highly interesting and novel target for regulation of host-microbe signalling, which may lead to gut-brain signalling. Emerging evidence indicates that two of the four known families of PRRs (the NLRs and the TLRs) are involved in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders via the gut-brain axis. Taken together, increasing evidence supports a role for these PRRs in the development of neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis, via the microbiota-gut-brain axis.",The Journal of physiology,2021,Ciara E Keogh; Kavi M Rude; MÃ©lanie G Gareau
33985520,Evaluation of fecal microbiota transplantation in Parkinson's disease patients with constipation.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder and 70-80% of PD patients suffer from gastrointestinal dysfunction such as constipation. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for treating PD related to gastrointestinal dysfunction. We conducted a prospective, single- study. Eleven patients with PD received FMT. Fecal samples were collected before and after FMT and subjected to 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) gene sequencing. Hoehn-Yahr (H-Y) grade, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score, and the Non-Motion Symptom Questionnaire (NMSS) were used to assess improvements in motor and non-motor symptoms. PAC-QOL score and Wexner constipation score were used to assess the patient's constipation symptoms. All patients were tested by the small intestine breath hydrogen test, performed before and after FMT. Community richness (chao) and microbial structure in before-FMT PD patients were significantly different from the after-FMT. We observed an increased abundance of Blautia and Prevotella in PD patients after FMT, while the abundance of Bacteroidetes decreased dramatically. After FMT, the H-Y grade, UPDRS, and NMSS of PD patients decreased significantly. Through the lactulose H2 breath test, the intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) in PD patients returned to normal. The PAC-QOL score and Wexner constipation score in after-FMT patients decreased significantly. Our study profiles specific characteristics and microbial dysbiosis in the gut of PD patients.

34053222,Development of an Efficient and Sensitive Chemical Derivatization-Based LC-MS/MS Method for Quantifying Gut Microbiota-Derived Metabolites in Human Plasma and Its Application in Studying Cardiovascular Disease.,"Recently, the gut microbiota has been found to be associated with many diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, depression, Parkinson's disease, cancer, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Among various gut microbiota-derived metabolites (GMs), short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), bile acids (BAs), and tryptophan (TRP) metabolites are the most frequently discussed metabolites. LC-MS/MS shows advantages in quantifying the levels of metabolites with good sensitivity and selectivity; however, the poor ionization efficiency and polar characteristics of SCFAs make their analysis challenging, especially when analyzing plasma samples with low SCFA concentrations. Moreover, without characteristic fragment ions for unconjugated BAs and different detection ion modes for TRP metabolites and BAs, GM analysis is complex and time-consuming. To overcome these problems, we developed a derivatization method combined with LC-MS/MS to enhance the sensitivity and LC retention of GMs. Through derivatization with 3-nitrophenylhydrazine (3-NPH), 7 SCFAs, 9 bile acids, and 6 tryptophan metabolites can be simultaneously analyzed via separation within 14 min on a reversed-phase C18 column. For accurate quantification, <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-3NPH-labeled standards were used as one-to-one internal standards. This derivatization approach was optimized and then validated. We further applied this method to investigate the targeted GM profile in patients with CVD. The results showed a significant reduction in plasma butyrate levels in CVD patients compared with healthy controls, suggesting its potentially protective role in CVD. In summary, this work provides a sensitive and effective LC-MS/MS method for simultaneously quantifying gut microbiota-related metabolites in human plasma, which could benefit various future gut microbiota-related studies.",Journal of proteome research,2021,Hsin-Yu Liao; Chin-Yi Wang; Ching-Hua Lee; Hsien-Li Kao; Wei-Kai Wu; Ching-Hua Kuo
34276644,Altered Actinobacteria and Firmicutes Phylum Associated Epitopes in Patients With Parkinson's Disease.,"Recent evidence suggests that inflammation was participated in the pathogenesis of PD, thus, to understand the potential mechanism of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), we performed a metagenomic analysis of fecal samples from PD patient and controls. Using a two-stage metagenome-wide association strategy, fecal DNA samples from 69 PD patients and 244 controls in three groups (comprising 66 spouses, 97 age-matched, and 81 normal samples, respectively) were analyzed, and differences between candidate gut microbiota and microbiota-associated epitopes (MEs) were compared. In the study, 27 candidate bacterial biomarkers and twenty-eight candidate epitope peptides were significantly different between the PD patients and control groups. Further, enriched 4 and 13 MEs in PD were positively associated with abnormal inflammatory indicators [neutrophil percentage (NEUT.1), monocyte count/percentage (MONO/MONO.1), white blood cell count (WBC)] and five candidate bacterial biomarkers (c_Actinobacteria, f_Bifidobacteriaceae, <i>g_Bifidobacterium</i>, o_Bifidobacteriales, p_Actinobacteria) from Actinobacteria phylum, and they were also positively associated with histidine degradation and proline biosynthesis pathways, respectively. Additionally, enriched 2 MEs and 1 ME in PD were positively associated with above inflammatory indicators and two bacteria (f_Lactobacillaceae, <i>g_Lactobacillus</i>) from Firmicutes phylum, and they were also positively associated with pyruvate fermentation to propanoate I and negatively associated with isopropanol biosynthesis, respectively. Of these MEs, two MEs from GROEL2, RPSC were derived from <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, triggered the T cell immune response, as previously reported. Additionally, other candidate epitope peptides derived from <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> and <i>Mycobacterium leprae</i> may also have potential immune effects in PD. In all, the altered MEs in PD may relate to abnormalities in immunity and glutamate and propionate metabolism, which furthers our understanding of the pathogenesis of PD.",Frontiers in immunology,2021,Zhuo Li; Gang Lu; Zhe Li; Bin Wu; Enli Luo; Xinmin Qiu; Jianwen Guo; Zhangyong Xia; Chunye Zheng; Qiaozhen Su; Yan Zeng; Wai Yee Chan; Xianwei Su; Qiaodi Cai; Yanjuan Xu; Yingjun Chen; Mingbang Wang; Wai Sang Poon; Xiaodong Luo
33912026,Colonic Dopaminergic Neurons Changed Reversely With Those in the Midbrain via Gut Microbiota-Mediated Autophagy in a Chronic Parkinson's Disease Mice Model.,"The role of gut-brain axis in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) have become a research hotspot, appropriate animal model to study gut-brain axis in PD is yet to be confirmed. Our study employed a classical PD mice model achieved by chronic MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) injection to study concurrent changes of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain and the colon of mice. Our results showed such a PD model exhibited apparent locomotor deficits but not gastrointestinal dysfunction. Tyrosine hydroxylase expressions and dopamine content reduced greatly in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) or striatum, but increased in the colon of PD mice. Mechanism investigation indicated autophagy activity and apoptosis were stimulated in the SNpc, but inhibited in the colon of PD mice. Interplay of gut microbiota (GM) and autophagy in response to chronic MPTP injection led to GM dysbiosis and defective autophagy in mice colon. Meanwhile, fecal short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), acetate and propionate in particular, declined greatly in PD mice, which could be attributed to the decreased bacteria abundance of phylum <i>Bacteroidetes</i>, but increased abundance of phylum <i>Firmicutes</i>. GM dysbiosis derived fecal SCFAs might be one of the mediators of downregulated autophagy in the colon of PD mice. In conclusion, colonic dopaminergic neurons changed in the opposition direction with those in the midbrain via GM dysbiosis-mediated autophagy inhibition followed by suppressed apoptosis in response to chronic MPTP injection. Such a chronic PD mice model might not be an ideal model to study role of gut-brain axis in PD progression.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2021,Xin Liu; Zhong-Rui Du; Xiong Wang; Kar-Him Luk; Cheuk-Hin Chan; Xu Cao; Qing Zhao; Fang Zhao; Wing-Tak Wong; Ka-Hing Wong; Xiao-Li Dong
33557583,Electroacupuncture may alleviate behavioral defects via modulation of gut microbiota in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease involving non-motor symptoms, of which gastrointestinal disorders are the most common. In light of recent results, intestinal dysfunction may be involved in the pathogenesis of PD. Electroacupuncture (EA) has shown potential effects, although the underlying mechanism remains mostly unknown. We speculated that EA could relieve the behavioral defects of PD, and that this effect would be associated with modulation of the gut microbiota.Mice were randomly divided into three groups: control, PDâ+âMA (manual acupuncture), and PDâ+âEA. MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) was used to establish the mouse model of PD. Rotarod performance tests, open field tests, and pole tests were carried out to assess motor deficiencies. Immunohistochemistry was conducted to examine the survival of dopaminergic neurons. 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing was applied to investigate the alterations of the gut microbiome. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to characterize the messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines.We found that EA was able to alleviate the behavioral defects in the rotarod performance test and pole test, and partially rescue the significant loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) chemically induced by MPTP in mice. Moreover, the PDâ+âMA mice showed a tendency toward decreased intestinal microbial alpha diversity, while EA significantly reversed it. The abundance of Erysipelotrichaceae was significantly increased in PDâ+âMA mice, and the alteration was also reversed by EA. In addition, the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î± were substantially increased in the SN of PDâ+âMA mice, an effect that was reversed by EA.These results suggest that EA may alleviate behavioral defects via modulation of gut microbiota and suppression of inflammation in the SN of mice with PD, which provides new insights into the pathogenesis of PD and its treatment.",Acupuncture in medicine : journal of the British Medical Acupuncture Society,2021,Qiu-Qin Han; Yi Fu; Jia-Mei Le; Adam Pilot; Si Cheng; Pei-Qing Chen; Hailong Wu; Guo-Qing Wan; Xue-Feng Gu
34569965,Drosophila as a Model for Microbiota Studies of Neurodegeneration.,"Accumulating evidence show that the gut microbiota is deeply involved not only in host nutrient metabolism but also in immune function, endocrine regulation, and chronic disease. In neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the gut-brain axis, the bidirectional interaction between the brain and the gut, provides new route of pathological spread and potential therapeutic targets. Although studies of gut microbiota have been conducted mainly in mice, mammalian gut microbiota is highly diverse, complex, and sensitive to environmental changes. Drosophila melanogaster, a fruit fly, has many advantages as a laboratory animal: short life cycle, numerous and genetically homogenous offspring, less ethical concerns, availability of many genetic models, and low maintenance costs. Drosophila has a simpler gut microbiota than mammals and can be made to remain sterile or to have standardized gut microbiota by simple established methods. Research on the microbiota of Drosophila has revealed new molecules that regulate the brain-gut axis, and it has been shown that dysbiosis of the fly microbiota worsens lifespan, motor function, and neurodegeneration in AD and PD models. The results shown in fly studies represents a fundamental part of the immune and proteomic process involving gut-microbiota interactions that are highly conserved. Even though the fly's gut microbiota are not simple mimics of humans, flies are a valuable system to learn the molecular mechanisms of how the gut microbiota affect host health and behavior.",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2021,Fukiko Kitani-Morii; Robert P Friedland; Hideki Yoshida; Toshiki Mizuno
33889128,Impact of Subthalamic Deep Brain Stimulation on Hyposmia in Patients With Parkinson's Disease Is Influenced by Constipation and Dysbiosis of Microbiota.,"<b>Background:</b> Non-motor symptoms in PD usually arise at very early stage and vary during the whole disease progression. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is considered as a highly efficient treatment option for PD's motor function. However, the effect of DBS on NMS, especially hyposmia, has not been fully understood and the deep connection between different NMS such as hyposmia and constipation is still unknown. <b>Objective:</b> The objective of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic effect of DBS on hyposmia in PD patients with or without constipation and find potential factors which might influence the efficacy. <b>Methods:</b> A retrospective analysis of 65 PD patients accepted STN-DBS operation in Qilu Hospital during 2019-2020 were conducted to evaluate the exact therapeutic effect of DBS on hyposmia in PD. Sub-group analyses about the relationship between hyposmia and constipation were carried out. Analysis of flora in nasal mucosa was also conducted to evaluate the abundance and variety in different PD groups. <b>Results:</b> Our study showed that DBS had clearly improved olfactory function in Parkinson patients (<i>P</i> = 0.012) and subgroup analysis found that PD patients with constipation have lower olfactory function scores (25.27 Â± 3.44 vs. 33.90 Â± 6.633, <i>p</i> = 0.014) and worse improvement after DBS operation (ÎTDI 12.11 Â± 3.2 vs. 8.78 Â± 2.91, <i>p</i> = 0.0072). Analysis of flora indicated the obvious discrepancy on olfactory function scores and degree of improvement might be related to the abundance and dysbiosis of microbiota. <b>Conclusion:</b> In summary, this article presents a study on PD with hyposmia and constipation after DBS operation, explored the relationship between different NMS and offer a potential explanation on why PD patients with constipation usually have worse olfactory function for the less abundance and variety of microbiota.",Frontiers in neurology,2021,Chao Li; Ying Hou; Xu Wang; Yue-Xuan Li; Feng Li; Chao Zhang; Wei-Guo Li
34128115,The impact of device-assisted therapies on the gut microbiome in Parkinson's disease.,"Microbiome feedbacks are proposed to influence Parkinson's disease (PD) pathophysiology. A number of studies have evaluated the impact of oral medication on the gut microbiome (GM) in PD. However, the influence of PD device-assisted therapies (DATs) on the GM remains to be investigated.To profile acute gut microbial community alterations in response to PD DAT initiation.Clinical data and stool samples were collected from 21 PD patients initiating either deep brain stimulation (DBS) or levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) and ten spousal healthy control (HC) subjects. 16S amplicon sequencing of stool DNA enabled comparison of temporal GM stability between groups and with clinical measures, including disease alterations relative to therapy initiation.We assessed GM response to therapy in the PD group by comparing pre-therapy (-Â 2 and 0Â weeks) with post-therapy initiation timepoints (+â2 andâ+â4Â weeks) and HCs at baseline (0Â weeks). Altered GM compositions were noted between the PD and HC groups at various taxonomic levels, including specific differences for DBS (overrepresentation of Clostridium_XlVa, Bilophila, Parabacteroides, Pseudoflavonifractor and underrepresentation of Dorea) and LCIG therapy (overrepresentation of Pseudoflavonifractor, Escherichia/Shigella, and underrepresentation of Gemmiger). Beta diversity changes were also found over the 4Â week post-treatment initiation period.We report on initial short-term GM changes in response to the initiation of PD DATs. Prior to the introduction of the DAT, a PD-associated GM was observed. Following initiation of DAT, several DAT-specific changes in GM composition were identified, suggesting DATs can influence the GM in PD.",Journal of neurology,2022,Michal Lubomski; Xiangnan Xu; Andrew J Holmes; Jean Y H Yang; Carolyn M Sue; Ryan L Davis
33719004,Intragastric Administration of Casein Leads to Nigrostriatal Disease Progressed Accompanied with Persistent Nigrostriatal-Intestinal Inflammation Activited and Intestinal Microbiota-Metabolic Disorders Induced in MPTP Mouse Model of Parkinson's Disease.,"Gut microbial dysbiosis and alteration of gut microbiota composition in Parkinson's disease (PD) have been increasingly reported, no recognized therapies are available to halt or slow progression of PD and more evidence is still needed to illustrate its causative impact on gut microbiota and PD and mechanisms for targeted mitigation. Epidemiological evidence supported an association between milk intake and a higher incidence of Parkinson's disease (PD), questions have been raised about prospective associations between dietary factors and the incidence of PD. Here, we investigated the significance of casein in the development of PD. The mice were given casein (6.75Â g/kg i.g.) for 21Â days after MPTP (25Â mg/kg i.p.âÃâ5Â days) treatment, the motor function, dopaminergic neurons, inflammation, gut microbiota and fecal metabolites were observed. The experimental results revealed that the mice with casein gavage after MPTP treatment showed a persisted dyskinesia, the content of dopamine in striatum and the expression of TH in midbrain and ileum were decreased, the expression of Iba-1, CD4, IL-22 in midbrain and ileum increased continuously with persisted intestinal histopathology and intestinal barrier injury. Decreased intestinal bile secretion in addition with abnormal digestion and metabolism of carbohydrate, lipids and proteins were found, whereas these pathological status for the MPTP mice without casein intake had recovered after 24Â days, no significant differences were observed with regard to only treated with casein. Our study demonstrates that intestinal pathologic injury, intestinal dysbacteriosis and metabolism changes promoted by casein in MPTP mice ultimately exacerbated the lesions to dopaminergic neurons.",Neurochemical research,2021,Xinrong Liu; Shuya Liu; Yong Tang; Zhengjia Pu; Hong Xiao; Jieying Gao; Qi Yin; Yan Jia; Qunhua Bai

34785689,Cholecystectomy and subsequent risk of Parkinson's disease: a nationwide retrospective cohort study.,"Growing evidence has suggested that the gut-brain axis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), and that this role is mediated by the interactions between bile acids (BAs) and intestinal microbiota. Given that cholecystectomy can lead to alterations in BAs and gut microbiota, we investigated whether cholecystectomy is linked to a higher risk of PD. We constructed a cohort of patients with an operation code of cholecystectomy from 2010 to 2015 (nâ=â161,838) and age- and sex-matched control subjects without cholecystectomy (nâ=â286,135) using the National Health Insurance Service database. Incident PD was traced over a maximum observation period of 7 years. We identified 1404 incident PD cases during 1,631,265 person-years of follow-up. The cholecystectomy group showed an elevated risk of PD compared to the control group, even after adjusting for potential confounding factors (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.27). When the data were split by sex, the risk elevation was significant in men (adjusted HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.06-1.41), but not in women (adjusted HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.88-1.22). Our results provide evidence that cholecystectomy is associated with an increased risk of developing PD. This association differed between men and women, suggesting sex-specific effects of cholecystectomy on the risk of PD.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2021,Ryul Kim; Jee-Young Lee; Sanghyun Park; Kyungdo Han; Cheol Min Shin
34430117,Fecal Microbiota Transplantation: A Microbiome Modulation Technique for Alzheimer's Disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and the fifth leading cause of death among the elderly. AD involves parts of the brain that can lead to progressive memory loss and impaired language skills and cognitive thinking, affecting one's ability to carry out daily activities. Aging, bad dietary habits, family history, as well as altered gut microbiota composition may play a role in the pathogenesis of AD. Although the association between the imbalance of gut microbiota and AD is still difficult to determine, it has been suggested that dysbiosis can lead to the increased secretion of lipopolysaccharides and amyloid, which may impair the permeability of the intestine and the blood-brain barrier. Moreover, it can progress the process of neuroinflammation, amyloid-beta formation, and ultimately neuronal death. Microbiota-targeted interventions such as personalized diet, probiotics, or fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) might represent a potential therapeutic option for AD. This review article discusses the procedure of FMT and its possible side effects on the recipient's body. In addition, we review the role of FMT in the context of its application in various nervous system-related disorders (AD, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis).",Cureus,2021,Varsha Nandwana; Shibajee Debbarma
34566874,Intestinal Decontamination Therapy for Dyskinesia and Motor Fluctuations in Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease is neurodegenerative disorder with an initial robust response to levodopa. As the disease progresses, patients frequently develop dyskinesia and motor fluctuations, which are sometimes resistant to pharmacological therapy. In recent years, abnormalities in gut microbiota have been identified in these patients with a possible role in motor manifestations. Dysbiosis may reduce levodopa absorption leading to delayed ""On"" or ""no-On"" states. Among 84 consecutive patients with PD, we selected 14 with levodopa-induced dyskinesia and motor fluctuations with a Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) part IV â¥ 8 points following a trial of pharmacological adjustment 2-3 months prior to study enrollment or adjustments in deep brain stimulation therapy. Patients received treatment with sodium phosphate enema followed by oral rifaximin and polyethylene glycol for 7 and 10 days, respectively. Evaluations between 14 to 21 days after starting treatment showed improvement in MDS-UPDRS-IV (<i>P</i> = 0.001), including duration (<i>P</i> = 0.001) and severity of dyskinesia (<i>P</i> = 0.003); duration of medication ""Off""-state (<i>P</i> = 0.004); functional impact of motor fluctuations (<i>P</i> = 0.047) and complexity of motor fluctuations (<i>P</i> = 0.031); no statistical improvement was observed in ""Off"" dystonia (<i>P</i> = 0.109) and total motor scores (<i>P</i> = 0.430). Marked to moderate improvement in dyskinesia was observed in 57% of cases with blinded evaluation of videos. About 80% of patients perceived moderate to robust improvement at follow-up. A therapeutic strategy aimed at decontamination of intestines showed benefit in motor fluctuations and dyskinesia.

35002935,Mediterranean Diet Adherence in People With Parkinson's Disease Reduces Constipation Symptoms and Changes Fecal Microbiota After a 5-Week Single-Arm Pilot Study.,"<b>Introduction:</b> Non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) such as gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction are common, yet little is known about how modifying dietary intake impacts PD symptoms. The aim of this study in individuals with PD was to determine whether a Mediterranean diet intervention is feasible and affects GI function, intestinal permeability and fecal microbial communities. <b>Methods:</b> A single-arm, 5-week Mediterranean diet intervention study was conducted in eight people with PD. Daily and weekly questionnaires were administered to determine changes in GI symptoms. Urine and stool samples were collected at baseline and after 5 weeks to assess intestinal permeability and fecal microbial communities. Additionally, live-in partners of the participants with PD were matched as controls (<i>n</i> = 8) for baseline urine and stool samples. <b>Results:</b> Participants with PD increased intake of Mediterranean diet based on adherence scores from baseline to week 5 (4.4 Â± 0.6 vs. 11.9 Â± 0.7; <i>P</i> < 0.01 with >10 representing good adherence), which was linked with weight loss (77.4 kg vs. 74.9 kg, <i>P</i> = 0.01). Constipation syndrome scores decreased after 5 weeks (2.3 Â± 0.5 vs. 1.5 Â± 0.3; <i>P</i> = 0.04). <i>Bilophila</i>, was higher at baseline in PD (0.6 Â± 0.1% vs. 0.2 Â± 0.1% <i>P</i> = 0.02) and slightly decreased after the diet intervention (0.5 Â± 0.1%; <i>P</i> = 0.01). Interestingly, the proportion of <i>Roseburia</i> was significantly lower in PD compared to controls (0.6 Â± 0.2% vs. 1.6 Â± 0.3%; <i>P</i> = 0.02) and increased at week 5 (0.9 Â± 0.2%; <i>P</i> < 0.01). No differences were observed for markers of intestinal permeability between the control and PD groups or post-intervention. <b>Conclusions:</b> Short-term Mediterranean diet adherence is feasible in participants with PD; correlated with weight loss, improved constipation, and modified gut microbiota. <b>Clinical Trial Registration:</b> ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT03851861.",Frontiers in neurology,2021,Carley Rusch; Matthew Beke; Lily Tucciarone; Carmelo Nieves; Maria Ukhanova; Massimiliano S Tagliamonte; Volker Mai; Joon Hyuk Suh; Yu Wang; Shannon Chiu; Bhavana Patel; Adolfo Ramirez-Zamora; Bobbi Langkamp-Henken
34032647,Production of Psychoactive Metabolites by Gut Bacteria.,"The gut microbiome plays a vital role in numerous aspects of physiology, including functions related to metabolism, the immune system, behaviour, brain structure and function. Furthermore, it is now becoming increasingly clear that alterations in microbial composition or diversity are implicated in several disease states, including anxiety, depression, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), obesity, and diabetes. Therefore, therapeutic targeting of the gut microbiota has the potential to be useful in the treatment of both stress-related disorders and metabolic diseases. An important method by which the gut microbiome can influence the gut-brain axis is through microbial production of psychoactive metabolites. Several bacteria have been shown to produce metabolites which can impact host health, such as short-chain fatty acids, conjugated linoleic acid, antimicrobials, exopolysaccharides, and vitamins. Furthermore, several molecules with neuroactive functions, including serotonin, gamma-aminobutyric acid, catecholamines, and acetylcholine, have been isolated from bacteria within the human gut. This review aims to explore the psychoactive metabolites reported to be produced by gut bacteria, particularly those of relevance to stress-related disorders. Screening methods for psychoactive metabolite production, as well as the challenges and limitations of this research, will also be addressed. Finally, the implications of metabolite production for neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, and stress, behavioural disorders such as ASD, and neurodegenerative disorders such as AD and PD will be discussed.",Modern trends in psychiatry,2021,Niamh C Wiley; John F Cryan; Timothy G Dinan; R Paul Ross; Catherine Stanton
34347266,Fecal Microbiota Transplantation Exerts a Protective Role in MPTP-Induced Parkinson's Disease via the TLR4/PI3K/AKT/NF-ÎºB Pathway Stimulated by Î±-Synuclein.,"Gut microbiota is closely related to the Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis. Additionally, aggregation of Î±-synuclein (Î±-syn) is central to PD pathogenesis. Here we identified the further mechanisms of gut microbiota in PD. A mouse model with PD was established via injection of MPTP. Normal or MPTP-induced PD like animals were treated with FMT from healthy normal mice. Pole test and traction test were performed to examine the effectsÂ of FMT on motor function of PD mice. Fecal SCFAs were assessed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The Î±-syn level in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SN) of mice was measured using western blot. Dopaminergic neurons and microglial activation in the SN were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) staining. FMT alleviated physical impairment, decreased fecal SCFAs in a mouse model of PD. Additionally, FMT decreased the expression of Î±-syn, as well as inhibited the activation of microglia in the SN, and blocked the TLR4/PI3K/AKT/NF-ÎºB signaling in the SN and striatum. FMT could protect mice against PD via suppressing Î±-syn expression and inactivating the TLR4/PI3K/AKT/NF-ÎºB signaling.",Neurochemical research,2021,Zhe Zhong; Weijie Chen; Huan Gao; Ningning Che; Min Xu; Lanqing Yang; Yingfang Zhang; Min Ye
34012926,<i>Desulfovibrio</i> Bacteria Are Associated With Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most prevalent movement disorder known and predominantly affects the elderly. It is a progressive neurodegenerative disease wherein Î±-synuclein, a neuronal protein, aggregates to form toxic structures in nerve cells. The cause of Parkinson's disease (PD) remains unknown. Intestinal dysfunction and changes in the gut microbiota, common symptoms of PD, are evidently linked to the pathogenesis of PD. Although a multitude of studies have investigated microbial etiologies of PD, the microbial role in disease progression remains unclear. Here, we show that Gram-negative sulfate-reducing bacteria of the genus <i>Desulfovibrio</i> may play a potential role in the development of PD. Conventional and quantitative real-time PCR analysis of feces from twenty PD patients and twenty healthy controls revealed that all PD patients harbored <i>Desulfovibrio</i> bacteria in their gut microbiota and these bacteria were present at higher levels in PD patients than in healthy controls. Additionally, the concentration of <i>Desulfovibrio</i> species correlated with the severity of PD. <i>Desulfovibrio</i> bacteria produce hydrogen sulfide and lipopolysaccharide, and several strains synthesize magnetite, all of which likely induce the oligomerization and aggregation of Î±-synuclein protein. The substances originating from <i>Desulfovibrio</i> bacteria likely take part in pathogenesis of PD. These findings may open new avenues for the treatment of PD and the identification of people at risk for developing PD.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2021,Kari E Murros; Vy A Huynh; Timo M Takala; Per E J Saris
33327916,Modulation of Gut-Brain Axis by Probiotics: A Promising Anti-depressant Approach.,"The human digestive system is embedded with trillions of microbes of various species and genera. These organisms serve several purposes in the human body and exist in symbiosis with the host. Their major role is involved in the digestion and conversion of food materials into many useful substrates for the human body.

The connection between gut microbiota and the brain is termed as gut-brain axis (GBA), and these connections are established by neuronal, endocrine and immunological pathways. Thus, they are involved in neurophysiology and neuropathology of several diseases like Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), depression, and autism.

33963284,Molecular mechanisms underlying the antidepressant actions of arketamine: beyond the NMDA receptor.,"The discovery of robust antidepressant actions exerted by the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist (R,S)-ketamine has been a crucial breakthrough in mood disorder research. (R,S)-ketamine is a racemic mixture of equal amounts of (R)-ketamine (arketamine) and (S)-ketamine (esketamine). In 2019, an esketamine nasal spray from Johnson & Johnson was approved in the United States of America and Europe for treatment-resistant depression. However, an increasing number of preclinical studies show that arketamine has greater potency and longer-lasting antidepressant-like effects than esketamine in rodents, despite the lower binding affinity of arketamine for the NMDAR. In clinical trials, non-ketamine NMDAR-related compounds did not exhibit ketamine-like robust antidepressant actions in patients with depression, despite these compounds showing antidepressant-like effects in rodents. Thus, the rodent data do not necessarily translate to humans due to the complexity of human psychiatric disorders. Collectively, the available studies indicate that it is unlikely that NMDAR plays a major role in the antidepressant action of (R,S)-ketamine and its enantiomers, although the precise molecular mechanisms underlying antidepressant actions of (R,S)-ketamine and its enantiomers remain unclear. In this paper, we review recent findings on the molecular mechanisms underlying the antidepressant actions of (R,S)-ketamine and its potent enantiomer arketamine. Furthermore, we discuss the possible role of the brain-gut-microbiota axis and brain-spleen axis in stress-related psychiatric disorders and in the antidepressant-like action of arketamine. Finally, we discuss the potential of arketamine as a treatment for cognitive impairment in psychiatric disorders, Parkinson's disease, osteoporosis, inflammatory bowel diseases, and stroke.",Molecular psychiatry,2022,Yan Wei; Lijia Chang; Kenji Hashimoto
34795270,Micronutrient supplements can promote disruptive protozoan and fungal communities in the developing infant gut.,"Supplementation with micronutrients, including vitamins, iron and zinc, is a key strategy to alleviate child malnutrition. However, association of gastrointestinal disorders with iron has led to ongoing debate over their administration. To better understand their impact on gut microbiota, we analyse the bacterial, protozoal, fungal and helminth communities of stool samples collected from a subset of 80 children at 12 and 24 months of age, previously enrolled into a large cluster randomized controlled trial of micronutrient supplementation in Pakistan (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00705445). We show that while bacterial diversity is reduced in supplemented children, vitamins and iron (as well as residence in a rural setting) may promote colonization with distinct protozoa and mucormycetes, whereas the addition of zinc appears to ameliorate this effect. We suggest that the risks and benefits of micronutrient interventions may depend on eukaryotic communities, potentially exacerbated by exposure to a rural setting. Larger studies are needed to evaluate the clinical significance of these findings and their impact on health outcomes.",Nature communications,2021,Ana Popovic; Celine Bourdon; Pauline W Wang; David S Guttman; Sajid Soofi; Zulfiqar A Bhutta; Robert H J Bandsma; John Parkinson; Lisa G Pell

A common attribute of NADDs is neuroinflammation due to a chronic inflammatory response within the central nervous system (CNS), which is primarily modulated by microglia. This response within the CNS is positively regulated by cytokines, chemokines, secondary messengers or cyclic nucleotides, and free radicals. Microglia mediated immune activation is regulated by a positive feedback loop in NADDs. The present review focuses on evaluating the crosstalk between inflammatory mediators and microglia, which aggravates both the clinical progression and extent of NADDs by forming a persistent chronic inflammatory milieu within the CNS. We also discuss the role of the human gut microbiota and its effect on NADDs as well as the suitability of targeting toll-like receptors for an immunotherapeutic intervention targeting the deflation of an inflamed milieu within the CNS.",Metabolic brain disease,2021,Rohit Kumar Tiwari; Afrasim Moin; Syed Mohd Danish Rizvi; Syed Monowar Alam Shahid; Preeti Bajpai
34402617,Advances in Genome-Scale Metabolic Modeling toward Microbial Community Analysis of the Human Microbiome.,"A genome-scale metabolic model (GEM) represents metabolic pathways of an organism in a mathematical form and can be built using biochemistry and genome annotation data. GEMs are invaluable for understanding organisms since they analyze the metabolic capabilities and behaviors quantitatively and can predict phenotypes. The development of high-throughput data collection techniques led to an immense increase in omics data such as metagenomics, which expand our knowledge on the human microbiome, but this also created a need for systematic analysis of these data. In recent years, GEMs have also been reconstructed for microbial species, including human gut microbiota, and methods for the analysis of microbial communities have been developed to examine the interaction between the organisms or the host. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive guide for the applications of GEMs in microbial community analysis. Starting with GEM repositories, automatic GEM reconstruction tools, and quality control of models, this review will give insights into microbe-microbe and microbe-host interaction predictions and optimization of microbial community models. Recent studies that utilize microbial GEMs and personalized models to infer the influence of microbiota on human diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) or Parkinson's disease are exemplified. Being powerful system biology tools for both species-level and community-level analysis of microbes, GEMs integrated with omics data and machine learning techniques will be indispensable for studying the microbiome and their effects on human physiology as well as for deciphering the mechanisms behind human diseases.",ACS synthetic biology,2021,Elif Esvap; Kutlu O Ulgen
34829716,The Emerging Scenario of the Gut-Brain Axis: The Therapeutic Actions of the New Actor Kefir against Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"The fact that millions of people worldwide suffer from Alzheimer's disease (AD) or Parkinson's disease (PD), the two most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), has been a permanent challenge to science. New tools were developed over the past two decades and were immediately incorporated into routines in many laboratories, but the most valuable scientific contribution was the ""waking up"" of the gut microbiota. Disturbances in the gut microbiota, such as an imbalance in the beneficial/pathogenic effects and a decrease in diversity, can result in the passage of undesired chemicals and cells to the systemic circulation. Recently, the potential effect of probiotics on restoring/preserving the microbiota was also evaluated regarding important metabolite and vitamin production, pathogen exclusion, immune system maturation, and intestinal mucosal barrier integrity. Therefore, the focus of the present review is to discuss the available data and conclude what has been accomplished over the past two decades. This perspective fosters program development of the next steps that are necessary to obtain confirmation through clinical trials on the magnitude of the effects of kefir in large samples.","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2021,Thiago M C Pereira; Larissa Z CÃ´co; Alyne M M Ton; Silvana S Meyrelles; Manuel Campos-Toimil; Bianca P Campagnaro; Elisardo C Vasquez
34769091,Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth as Potential Therapeutic Target in Parkinson's Disease.,"Increasing evidence suggests that the gut microbiota and the brain are closely connected via the so-called gut-brain axis. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is a gut dysbiosis in which the small intestine is abundantly colonized by bacteria that are typically found in the colon. Though not a disease, it may result in intestinal symptoms caused by the accumulation of microbial gases in the intestine. Intestinal inflammation, malabsorption and vitamin imbalances may also develop. SIBO can be eradicated by one or several courses of antibiotics but reappears if the predisposing condition persists. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative proteinopathy for which disease modifying interventions are not available. Sporadic forms may start in the gut years before the development of clinical features. Increased gastrointestinal transit time is present in most people with PD early during the course of the disease, predisposing to gut dysbiosis, including SIBO. The role that gut dysbiosis may play in the etiopathogenesis of PD is not fully understood yet. Here, we discuss the possibility that SIBO could contribute to the progression of PD, by promoting or preventing neurodegeneration, thus being a potential target for treatments aiming at slowing down the progression of PD. The direct symptomatic impact of SIBO and its impact on symptomatic medication are also briefly discussed.",International journal of molecular sciences,2021,Adela DÄnÄu; Laura Dumitrescu; Antonia Lefter; Delia TulbÄ; Bogdan Ovidiu Popescu
34909657,Gauging the role and impact of drug interactions and repurposing in neurodegenerative disorders.,"Neurodegenerative diseases (ND) are of vast origin which are characterized by gradual progressive loss of neurons in the brain region. ND can be classified according to the clinical symptoms present (e.g. Cognitive decline, hyperkinetic, and hypokinetic movements disorder) or by the pathological protein deposited (e.g., Amyloid, tau, Alpha-synuclein, TDP-43). Alzheimer's disease preceded by Parkinson's is the most prevalent form of ND world-wide. Multiple factors like aging, genetic mutations, environmental factors, gut microbiota, blood-brain barrier microvascular complication, etc. may increase the predisposition towards ND. Genetic mutation is a major contributor in increasing the susceptibility towards ND, the concept of one disease-one gene is obsolete and now multiple genes are considered to be involved in causing one particular disease. Also, the involvement of multiple pathological mechanisms like oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, etc. contributes to the complexity and makes them difficult to be treated by traditional mono-targeted ligands. In this aspect, the Poly-pharmacological drug approach which targets multiple pathological pathways at the same time provides the best way to treat such complex networked CNS diseases. In this review, we have provided an overview of ND and their pathological origin, along with a brief description of various genes associated with multiple diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Multiple sclerosis (MS), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's and a comprehensive detail about the Poly-pharmacology approach (MTDLs and Fixed-dose combinations) along with their merits over the traditional single-targeted drug is provided. This review also provides insights into current repurposing strategies along with its regulatory considerations.",Current research in pharmacology and drug discovery,2021,Dharmendra Kumar Khatri; Amey Kadbhane; Monica Patel; Shweta Nene; Srividya Atmakuri; Saurabh Srivastava; Shashi Bala Singh
33571701,The pleiotropic neuroprotective effects of resveratrol in cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease pathology: From antioxidant to epigenetic therapy.,"While the elderly segment of the population continues growing in importance, neurodegenerative diseases increase exponentially. Lifestyle factors such as nutrition, exercise, and education, among others, influence ageing progression, throughout life. Notably, the Central Nervous System (CNS) can benefit from nutritional strategies and dietary interventions that prevent signs of senescence, such as cognitive decline or neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's Disease. The dietary polyphenol Resveratrol (RV) possesses antioxidant and cytoprotective effects, producing neuroprotection in several organisms. The oxidative stress (OS) occurs because of Reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation that has been proposed to explain the cause of the ageing. One of the most harmful effects of ROS in the cell is DNA damage. Nevertheless, there is also evidence demonstrating that OS can produce other molecular changes such as mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, apoptosis, and epigenetic modifications, among others. Interestingly, the dietary polyphenol RV is a potent antioxidant and possesses pleiotropic actions, exerting its activity through various molecular pathways. In addition, recent evidence has shown that RV mediates epigenetic changes involved in ageing and the function of the CNS that persists across generations. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that RV interacts with gut microbiota, showing modifications in bacterial composition associated with beneficial effects. In this review, we give a comprehensive overview of the main mechanisms of action of RV in different experimental models, including clinical trials and discuss how the interconnection of these molecular events could explain the neuroprotective effects induced by RV.",Ageing research reviews,2021,Christian GriÃ±Ã¡n-FerrÃ©; Aina Bellver-Sanchis; Vanessa Izquierdo; RubÃ©n Corpas; Joan Roig-Soriano; Miguel ChillÃ³n; Cristina Andres-Lacueva; MilÃ¡n SomogyvÃ¡ri; Csaba SÅti; Coral Sanfeliu; MercÃ¨ PallÃ s
33417221,Pathophysiological Clues to How the Emergent SARS-CoV-2 Can Potentially Increase the Susceptibility to Neurodegeneration.,"Along with emergence of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in late 2019, a myriad of neurologic symptoms, associated with structural brain changes, were reported. In this paper, we provide evidence to critically discuss the claim that the survived patients could possibly be at increased risk for neurodegenerative diseases via various mechanisms. This virus can directly invade the brain through olfactory bulb, retrograde axonal transport from peripheral nerve endings, or via hematogenous or lymphatic routes. Infection of the neurons along with peripheral leukocytes activation results in pro-inflammatory cytokine increment, rendering the brain to neurodegenerative changes. Also, occupation of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) with the virus may lead to a decline in ACE-2 activity, which acts as a neuroprotective factor. Furthermore, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and septicemia induce hypoxemia and hypoperfusion, which are locally exacerbated due to the hypercoagulable state and micro-thrombosis in brain vessels, leading to oxidative stress and neurodegeneration. Common risk factors for COVID-19 and neurodegenerative diseases, such as metabolic risk factors, genetic predispositions, and even gut microbiota dysbiosis, can contribute to higher occurrence of neurodegenerative diseases in COVID-19 survivors. However, it should be considered that severity of the infection, the extent of neurologic symptoms, and the persistence of viral infection consequences are major determinants of this association. Importantly, whether this pandemic will increase the overall incidence of neurodegeneration is not clear, as a high percentage of patients with severe form of COVID-19 might probably not survive enough to develop neurodegenerative diseases.",Molecular neurobiology,2021,Mahsa Dolatshahi; Mohammadmahdi Sabahi; Mohammad Hadi Aarabi
35035709,An analysis of the characteristics of the intestinal flora in patients with Parkinson's disease complicated with constipation.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a degenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS) and is common among the middle-aged and elderly populations. Increasing evidence shows that the gut microbiota may trigger PD through the ""gut-microbiota-brain"" axis. A previous study revealed that constipation, one of the non-motor symptoms of PD, affects gut microbiota and the progression of PD. However, whether constipation is involved in gut microbiota-associated PD is largely unknown. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between gut microbiota, PD, and constipation in this study. We carried out 16S rRNA sequencing in 15 constipated PD patients (C-PD), 14 non-constipated PD (NC-PD) patients, and 15 healthy controls to evaluate the microbial population. Furthermore, co-occurrence networks were used to assess the gut ecology of the three groups. Spearman analyses were used to analyze the correlation between the differential microbiota and the clinical features. The results showed that there were differences in the composition of the gut microbiota among the C-PD group, the NC-PD group, and the healthy controls. No significant differences were observed in the alpha diversity among the three groups, but the beta diversity differed significantly among the groups. Compared with the healthy controls, the abundance of <i>Hungatella and Collinsella</i> was increased and the abundance of <i>Lachnospira and Fusicatenibacter</i> was reduced in the PD patients' feces. Compared with the NC-PD group, the relative abundance of <i>Megamonas and Holdemanella</i> were lower, while <i>Hungatella, Streptococcus</i> and <i>Anaerotruncus</i> were enriched in the C-PD group. The co-occurrence network analysis showed that the C-PD group presented a different microbial community relationship compared with the NC-PD group and the healthy controls. Our study provides strong evidence that the gut microbiota may be related to constipation in PD. In addition, our data suggest an association between the differential microbiota genera and the clinical features of PD. Therefore, modulating gut microbiota may be another way to monitor and optimize PD treatment.",American journal of translational research,2021,Weijie Chen; Zaoan Bi; Qihui Zhu; Huan Gao; Yi Fan; Chenyang Zhang; Xingyin Liu; Min Ye
33935107,Plasma Short-Chain Fatty Acids Differences in Multiple System Atrophy from Parkinson's Disease.,"Multiple system atrophy (MSA) and Parkinson's disease (PD) have overlapping symptoms, making diagnosis challenging. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are produced exclusively by gut microbiota and were reduced in feces of MSA patients. However, plasma SCFA concentrations in MSA patients have not been investigated.We aimed to investigate the plasma SCFAs in MSA patients and to identify the potential differential diagnostic ability.Plasma SCFA were measured in 25 MSA patients, 46 healthy controls, and 46 PD patients using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants were evaluated.Acetic acid concentration was lower in MSA patients than in healthy controls. Acetic acid and propionic acid concentrations were lower in MSA and MSA with predominant parkinsonism (MSA-P) patients than in PD patients. A receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis revealed reduced acetic acid concentration discriminated MSA patients from healthy controls with 76% specificity but only 57% sensitivity and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.68 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.55-0.81). Combined acetic acid and propionic acid concentrations discriminated MSA patients from PD patients with an AUC of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.71-0.93), 84% specificity and 76% sensitivity. Especially, with combined acetic acid and propionic acid concentrations, MSA-P patients were separated from PD patients with an AUC of 0.89 (95% CI: 0.80-0.97), 91% specificity and 80% sensitivity.Plasma SCFAs were decreased in MSA patients. The combined acetic acid and propionic acid concentrations may be a potential biomarker for differentiating MSA patients from PD patients.",Journal of Parkinson's disease,2021,Xiaoqin He; Yiwei Qian; Shaoqing Xu; Yi Zhang; Chengjun Mo; Wentian Guo; Xiaodong Yang; Qin Xiao
33662500,"Korean red ginseng suppresses 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced inflammation in the substantia nigra and colon.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease involving dopaminergic neuronal death in the substantia nigra (SN); recent studies have shown that interactions between gut and brain play a critical role in the pathogenesis of PD. In this study, the anti-inflammatory effect of Korean red ginseng (KRG) and the changes in gut microbiota were evaluated in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse model. Male nine-week-old C57BL/6 mice were injected intraperitoneally with 30Â mg/kg of MPTP at 24-h intervals for 5Â days. Two hours after the daily MPTP injection, the mice were orally administered 100Â mg/kg of KRG, which continued for 7Â days beyond the MPTP injections, for a total of 12 consecutive days. Eight days after the final KRG administration, the pole and rotarod tests were performed and brain and colon samples of the mice were collected. Dopaminergic neuronal death, activation of microglia and astrocytes, Î±-synuclein and expressions of inflammatory cytokines and disruption of tight junction were evaluated. In addition, 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing of mouse fecal samples was performed to investigate microbiome changes. KRG treatment prevented MPTP-induced behavioral impairment, dopaminergic neuronal death, activation of microglia and astrocytes in the nigrostriatal pathway, disruption of tight junction and the increase in Î±-synuclein, interleukin-1Î² and tumor necrosis factor-Î± expression in the colon. The 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that MPTP altered the number of bacterial species and their relative abundances, which were partially suppressed by KRG treatment. Especially, KRG suppressed the abundance of the inflammation-related phylum Verrucomicrobia and genera Ruminococcus and Akkermansia (especially Akkermansia muciniphila), and elevated the abundance of Eubacterium, which produces the anti-inflammatory substances. These findings suggest that KRG prevents MPTP-induced dopaminergic neuronal death, activation of microglia and astrocytes, and accumulation of Î±-synuclein in the SN, and the regulation of inflammation-related factors in the colon may influence the effect.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2021,Hyongjun Jeon; Chang-Hwan Bae; Yukyoung Lee; Hee-Young Kim; Seungtae Kim
34413194,Genome-wide screen identifies curli amyloid fibril as a bacterial component promoting host neurodegeneration.,"Growing evidence indicates that gut microbiota play a critical role in regulating the progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease. The molecular mechanism underlying such microbe-host interaction is unclear. In this study, by feeding <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> expressing human Î±-syn with <i>Escherichia coli</i> knockout mutants, we conducted a genome-wide screen to identify bacterial genes that promote host neurodegeneration. The screen yielded 38 genes that fall into several genetic pathways including curli formation, lipopolysaccharide assembly, and adenosylcobalamin synthesis among others. We then focused on the curli amyloid fibril and found that genetically deleting or pharmacologically inhibiting the curli major subunit CsgA in <i>E. coli</i> reduced Î±-syn-induced neuronal death, restored mitochondrial health, and improved neuronal functions. CsgA secreted by the bacteria colocalized with Î±-syn inside neurons and promoted Î±-syn aggregation through cross-seeding. Similarly, curli also promoted neurodegeneration in <i>C. elegans</i> models of Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington's disease and in human neuroblastoma cells.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2021,Chenyin Wang; Chun Yin Lau; Fuqiang Ma; Chaogu Zheng
34783227,Response of <i>Escherichia coli</i> to hydrogen nanobubbles: an in vitro evaluation using synchrotron infrared spectroscopy.,"Hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>)-rich water, an apparent source of molecular H<sub>2</sub>, is an emerging functional drink with many purported benefits for human health (Yang et al., 2020; Ostojic, 2021). The preventive and therapeutic effects of H<sub>2</sub> on various pathological processes have been intensively investigated in numerous clinical trials; it is commonly believed that the beneficial effects are mainly attributed to its selective antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties (Lee et al., 2015; Ohta, 2015; LeBaron et al., 2019; Qiu et al., 2020). In recent years, a handful of rodent studies revealed that exogenous H<sub>2</sub> can affect the gut microbiota (Sha et al., 2018; Valdes et al., 2018). For example, H<sub>2</sub> was reported to induce a higher abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria in a rat model of Parkinson's disease (Bordoni et al., 2019). Recent first-in-human trials have explored the effects of the long-term consumption of H<sub>2</sub>-rich water on antioxidant activity and the gut flora (Sha et al., 2018; Suzuki et al., 2018). Although these promising results suggest that the intestinal microbiota may be another plausible target for molecular H<sub>2</sub>, more studies are highly warranted to explain the mechanism(s) of H<sub>2</sub> action on bacterial growth and functions.",Journal of Zhejiang University.

34802221,From the intestinal mucosal barrier to the enteric neuromuscular compartment: an integrated overview on the morphological changes in Parkinson's disease.,"Gastrointestinal dysfunctions represent the most common non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). Of note, changes in gut microbiota, impairments of intestinal epithelial barrier (IEB), bowel inflammation and neuroplastic rearrangements of the enteric nervous system (ENS) could be involved in the pathophysiology of the intestinal disturbances in PD. In this context, although several review articles have pooled together evidence on the alterations of enteric bacteria-neuro-immune network in PD, a revision of the literature on the specific morphological changes occurring in the intestinal mucosal barrier, the ENS and enteric muscular layers in PD, is lacking. The present review provides a complete appraisal of the available knowledge on the morphological alterations of intestinal mucosal barrier, with particular focus on IEB, ENS and enteric muscular layers in PD. In particular, our intent was to critically discuss whether, based on evidence from translational studies and pre-clinical models, morphological changes in the intestinal barrier and enteric neuromuscular compartment contribute to the pathophysiology of intestinal dysfunctions occurring in PD.",European journal of histochemistry : EJH,2021,Carolina Pellegrini; Vanessa D'Antongiovanni; Chiara Ippolito; Cristina Segnani; Luca Antonioli; Matteo Fornai; Nunzia Bernardini
34911958,Gut bacterial tyrosine decarboxylase associates with clinical variables in a longitudinal cohort study of Parkinsons disease.,"Gut microbiota influences the clinical response of a wide variety of orally administered drugs. However, the underlying mechanisms through which drug-microbiota interactions occur are still obscure. Previously, we reported that tyrosine decarboxylating (TDC) bacteria may restrict the levels of levodopa reaching circulation in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). We observed a significant positive association between disease duration and the abundance of the bacterial tdc-gene. The question arises whether increased exposure to anti-PD medication could affect the abundance of bacterial TDC, to ultimately impact drug efficacy. To this end, we investigated the potential association between anti-PD drug exposure and bacterial tdc-gene abundance over a period of 2 years in a longitudinal cohort of PD patients and healthy controls. Our data reveal significant associations between tdc-gene abundance, several anti-PD medications, including entacapone, rasagiline, pramipexole, and ropinirole but not levodopa, and gastrointestinal symptoms, warranting further research on the effect of anti-PD medication on microbial changes and gastrointestinal function.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2021,Sebastiaan P van Kessel; Petri Auvinen; Filip Scheperjans; Sahar El Aidy
33617267,Prebiotic Lactulose Ameliorates the Cognitive Deficit in Alzheimer's Disease Mouse Model through Macroautophagy and Chaperone-Mediated Autophagy Pathways.,"Lactulose, as a prebiotic, can be utilized by human gut microbiota and stimulate their growth. Although microbiota modulation has become an emerging approach to manage many diseases and can be achieved by the administration of prebiotics, fewer investigations have been carried out on the therapeutic mechanism of lactulose. Two trehalose analogs, lactulose and melibiose, were identified as having a neuroprotective effect in polyglutamine and Parkinson disease models. In this study, we examined lactulose and melibiose in a mouse primary hippocampal neuronal culture under the toxicity of oligomeric AÎ²<sub>25-35</sub>. Lactulose was further tested in vivo because its effective concentration is lower than that of melibiose. Lactulose and trehalose were applied individually to mice before a bilateral intrahippocampal CA1 injection of oligomeric AÎ²<sub>25-35</sub>. The administration of lactulose and trehalose attenuated the short-term memory and the learning retrieval of Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice. From a pathological analysis, we found that the pretreatment of lactulose and trehalose decreased neuroinflammation and increased the levels of the autophagic pathways. These results suggest that the neuroprotective effects of both lactulose and trehalose are achieved through anti-inflammation and autophagy. In addition, lactulose was better than trehalose in the enhancement of the synaptic protein expression level in AD mice. Therefore, lactulose could potentially be developed into a preventive and/or therapeutic disaccharide for AD.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2021,Yan-Suan Lee; Dar-Ming Lai; Hei-Jen Huang; Guey-Jen Lee-Chen; Ching-Hwa Chang; Hsiu Mei Hsieh-Li; Guan-Chiun Lee
34025392,Probiotic Supplementation Facilitates Recovery of 6-OHDA-Induced Motor Deficit via Improving Mitochondrial Function and Energy Metabolism.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with progressive impairment of motor and non-motor functions in aging people. Overwhelming evidence indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction is a central factor in PD pathophysiology, which impairs energy metabolism. While, several other studies have shown probiotic supplementations to improve host energy metabolism, alleviate the disease progression, prevent gut microbiota dysbiosis and alter commensal bacterial metabolites. But, whether probiotic and/or prebiotic supplementation can affect energy metabolism and cause the impediment of PD progression remains poorly characterized. Therefore, we investigated 8-weeks supplementation effects of probiotic [<i>Lactobacillus salivarius</i> subsp. <i>salicinius</i> AP-32 (AP-32)], residual medium (RM) obtained from the AP-32 culture medium, and combination of AP-32 and RM (A-RM) on unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced PD rats. We found that AP-32, RM and A-RM supplementation induced neuroprotective effects on dopaminergic neurons along with improved motor functions in PD rats. These effects were accompanied by significant increases in mitochondrial activities in the brain and muscle, antioxidative enzymes level in serum, and altered SCFAs profile in fecal samples. Importantly, the AP-32 supplement restored muscle mass along with improved motor function in PD rats, and produced the best results among the supplements. Our results demonstrate that probiotic AP-32 and A-RM supplementations can recover energy metabolism via increasing SCFAs producing and mitochondria function. This restoring of mitochondrial function in the brain and muscles with improved energy metabolism might additionally be potentiated by ROS suppression by the elevated generation of antioxidants, and which finally leads to facilitated recovery of 6-OHDA-induced motor deficit. Taken together, this work demonstrates that probiotic AP-32 supplementation could be a potential candidate for alternate treatment strategy to avert PD progression.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2021,Bira Arumndari Nurrahma; Shu-Ping Tsao; Chieh-Hsi Wu; Tu-Hsueh Yeh; Pei-Shan Hsieh; Binar Panunggal; Hui-Yu Huang
35127723,Human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells Improve Locomotor Function in Parkinson's Disease Mouse Model Through Regulating Intestinal Microorganisms.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder characterized by loss of neurons that synthesize dopamine, and subsequent impaired movement. Umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) exerted neuroprotection effects in a rodent model of PD. However, the mechanism underlying UC-MSC-generated neuroprotection was not fully elucidated. In the present study, we found that intranasal administration of UC-MSCs significantly alleviated locomotor deficits and rescued dopaminergic neurons by inhibiting neuroinflammation in a PD mouse model induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP, a toxic agent which selectively destroys nigrostriatal neurons but does not affect dopaminergic neurons elsewhere). Furthermore, UC-MSC treatment altered gut microbiota composition characterized by decreased phylum Proteobacteria, class Gammaproteobacteria, family Enterobacteriaceae, and genus <i>Escherichia-Shigella</i>. In addition, the neurotransmitter dopamine in the striatum and 5-hydroxytryptamine in the colon were also modulated by UC-MSCs. Meanwhile, UC-MSCs significantly maintained intestinal goblet cells, which secrete mucus as a mechanical barrier against pathogens. Furthermore, UC-MSCs alleviate the level of TNF-Î± and IL-6 as well as the conversion of NF-ÎºB expression in the colon, indicating that inflammatory responses were blocked by UC-MSCs. PICRUSt showed that some pathways including bacterial invasion of epithelial cells, fluorobenzoate degradation, and pathogenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> infection were significantly reversed by UC-MSCs. These data suggest that the beneficial effects were detected following UC-MSC intranasal transplantation in MPTP-treated mice. There is a possible neuroprotective role of UC-MSCs in MPTP-induced PD mice by cross talk between the brain and gut.",Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,2021,Zhengqin Sun; Ping Gu; Hongjun Xu; Wei Zhao; Yongjie Zhou; Luyang Zhou; Zhongxia Zhang; Wenting Wang; Rui Han; Xiqing Chai; Shengjun An
34896331,Sodium butyrate attenuates rotenone-induced toxicity by activation of autophagy through epigenetically regulating PGC-1Î± expression in PC12 cells.,"Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are considered the key molecular link between gut microbiota and pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the role of SCFAs in PD pathogenesis is controversial. Autophagy is important for the degradation of Î±-synuclein, which is critical to the development of PD. However, whether SCFAs can regulate autophagy in PD remains unknown. We aimed to investigate the role of SCFAs and explore the potential mechanisms in rat dopaminergic PC12 cells treated with rotenone. Expression levels of Î±-synuclein, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î³ coactivator-1Î± (PGC-1Î±) and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta (LC3B)-II were detected by Western blot. Histone acetylation levels at PGC-1Î± promoter region were measured using chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (ChIP-qPCR). Among the three SCFAs, sodium butyrate (NaB) protected against rotenone-induced toxicity. NaB activated autophagy pathway and reduced rotenone-induced Î±-synuclein expression through the activation of autophagy. Notably, NaB activated autophagy pathway through upregulating PGC-1Î± expression. More importantly, NaB promoted the levels of histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9Ac) and histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27Ac) at PGC-1Î± promoter region, indicating that NaB promotes PGC-1Î± expression via histone acetylation modification. In conclusion, NaB can protect against rotenone-induced toxicity through activation of the autophagy pathway by upregulating PGC-1Î± expression via epigenetic modification.",Brain research,2022,Yi Zhang; Shaoqing Xu; Yiwei Qian; Xiaoqin He; Chengjun Mo; Xiaodong Yang; Qin Xiao
34768765,Gastric <i>Helicobacter suis</i> Infection Partially Protects against Neurotoxicity in A 6-OHDA Parkinson's Disease Mouse Model.,"The exact etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) remains largely unknown, but more and more research suggests the involvement of the gut microbiota. Interestingly, idiopathic PD patients were shown to have at least a 10 times higher prevalence of <i>Helicobacter suis</i> (<i>H. suis</i>) DNA in gastric biopsies compared to control patients. <i>H. suis</i> is a zoonotic <i>Helicobacter</i> species that naturally colonizes the stomach of pigs and non-human primates but can be transmitted to humans. Here, we investigated the influence of a gastric <i>H. suis</i> infection on PD disease progression through a 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) mouse model. Therefore, mice with either a short- or long-term <i>H. suis</i> infection were stereotactically injected with 6-OHDA in the left striatum and sampled one week later. Remarkably, a reduced loss of dopaminergic neurons was seen in the <i>H. suis/</i>6-OHDA groups compared to the control/6-OHDA groups. Correspondingly, motor function of the <i>H. suis</i>-infected 6-OHDA mice was superior to that in the non-infected 6-OHDA mice. Interestingly, we also observed higher expression levels of antioxidant genes in brain tissue from <i>H. suis</i>-infected 6-OHDA mice, as a potential explanation for the reduced 6-OHDA-induced cell loss. Our data support an unexpected neuroprotective effect of gastric <i>H. suis</i> on PD pathology, mediated through changes in oxidative stress.",International journal of molecular sciences,2021,Helena Berlamont; Arnout Bruggeman; Eva Bauwens; Charysse Vandendriessche; Elien Clarebout; Junhua Xie; Sofie De Bruyckere; Griet Van Imschoot; Elien Van Wonterghem; Richard Ducatelle; Patrick Santens; Annemieke Smet; Freddy Haesebrouck; Roosmarijn E Vandenbroucke

These studies were divided into five groups: MeDi and AD risk (nÂ =Â 4), MeDi and PD risk (nÂ =Â 2), MeDi and microbial composition or metabolomics (nÂ =Â 21), AD and microbial composition or metabolomics (nÂ =Â 7), and PD and microbial composition or metabolomics (nÂ =Â 30). Adherence to the MeDi was associated with a lower risk of AD and PD development. Eight genera and two species of bacteria had an inverse relationship with MeDi and AD, and one family, eight genera and three species of bacteria had an inverse relationship with MeDi and PD. More studies are needed to investigate if MeDi, gut microbiota, and neurodegeneration are causally related.",Journal of the neurological sciences,2022,Rebecca J Solch; Julia O Aigbogun; Andrew G Voyiadjis; Grant M Talkington; Revonda M Darensbourg; Samantha O'Connell; Keith M Pickett; Sarah R Perez; Demetrius M Maraganore
36280322,Human gut microbiota and Parkinson's disease.,"The bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain has come up very fascinating in recent years. Many studies have reported that the onset of gastrointestinal issues appears long before the actual manifestation of Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms. Disturbances in the gut-brain axis have been found to be linked with PD. PD-linked neuropathological changes in the enteric nervous system and significant alteration of gut microbiota suggest a vital role of gut microbiota in PD pathogenesis. Studies have also suggested that aggregation of Î±-synuclein, one of the major proteins associated with PD neuropathology, might start from the gut and move to the central nervous system (CNS) through the vagus nerve and olfactory bulb. Inflammation in the gut has been suggested to be associated with PD initiation and progression. The flushing out of healthy gut microbiota and replacing with pathogens induces gut inflammation and promotes neuroinflammation in the CNS. Therefore, it is intriguing to understand the mechanism of gut-brain communications associated with the development of PD. This review sheds light on the PD pathology, the gut dysbiosis that is associated with PD and its medications, altered gene expression, pathways and microbial metabolites during PD.",Progress in molecular biology and translational science,2022,Archana Pant; Krishna Singh Bisht; Swati Aggarwal; Tushar Kanti Maiti
36087572,Probiotics for constipation and gut microbiota in Parkinson's disease.,"Constipation is one of the common non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease that significantly impacts patient quality of life. Probiotics supplementation may improve constipation symptoms, but its effect on the gut microbiota population is unclear.In this randomized controlled study, 46 PD patients with constipation according to Rome â¢ criteria were recruited. The number of complete bowel movements per week, degree of defecation effort, Bristol stool Scale (BSS), Patient Assessment of Constipation symptom (PAC-SYM) and Patient assessment of constipation quality of life questionnaire (PAC-QOL) were collected pre- and post-intervention to evaluate the constipation symptoms. In addition, fresh feces of subjects before and after intervention and healthy controls were collected for 16s rRNA gene V3-V4 region sequencing to compare bacterial flora differences.Compared with the control group, the treatment group increased the average number of complete bowel movements per week (1.09Â Â±Â 1.24 vs. 0.04Â Â±Â 0.64, PÂ &lt;Â 0.001). Probiotics supplementation reduced the BSS score (0.65Â Â±Â 0.93 vs. -0.17Â Â±Â 0.94, PÂ =Â 0.004), PAC-SYM score (4.09Â Â±Â 6.31 vs. -1.83Â Â±Â 4.14, PÂ &lt;Â 0.001), PAC-QOL score (10.65Â Â±Â 16.53 vs. 0.57Â Â±Â 12.82, PÂ =Â 0.042), and degree of defecation effort score (1.00Â Â±Â 0.80 vs. 0.00Â Â±Â 0.30, PÂ &lt;Â 0.001). The improvement rate of constipation in the probiotics group was significantly higher than that in the control group (52.2% vs. 8.7%, PÂ =Â 0.001). PD patients showed intestinal flora disorders compared to healthy controls. After 12 weeks of probiotics treatment, g_Christensenella_sp._Marseille-P2437 significantly increased, while g_Eubacterium_oxidoreducens_group, g_Eubacterium_hallii_group and s_Odoribacter_sp._N54.MGS-14 decreased (pÂ &lt;Â 0 0.05).Probiotics treatment can effectively improve the constipation symptoms of PD patients and positively affected the gut microbiota.",Parkinsonism & related disorders,2022,Yitong Du; Yue Li; Xiaojiao Xu; Rongxue Li; Mingkai Zhang; Ying Cui; Liyan Zhang; Zheng Wei; Shiya Wang; Houzhen Tuo
35464431,"Gut Microbiota Interact With the Brain Through Systemic Chronic Inflammation: Implications on Neuroinflammation, Neurodegeneration, and Aging.","It has been noticed in recent years that the unfavorable effects of the gut microbiota could exhaust host vigor and life, yet knowledge and theory are just beginning to be established. Increasing documentation suggests that the microbiota-gut-brain axis not only impacts brain cognition and psychiatric symptoms but also precipitates neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). How the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a machinery protecting the central nervous system (CNS) from the systemic circulation, allows the risky factors derived from the gut to be translocated into the brain seems paradoxical. For the unique anatomical, histological, and immunological properties underpinning its permeable dynamics, the BBB has been regarded as a biomarker associated with neural pathogenesis. The BBB permeability of mice and rats caused by GM dysbiosis raises the question of how the GM and its metabolites change BBB permeability and causes the brain pathophysiology of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration (NF&ND) and brain aging, a pivotal multidisciplinary field tightly associated with immune and chronic systemic inflammation. If not all, gut microbiota-induced systemic chronic inflammation (GM-SCI) mainly refers to excessive gut inflammation caused by gut mucosal immunity dysregulation, which is often influenced by dietary components and age, is produced at the interface of the intestinal barrier (IB) or exacerbated after IB disruption, initiates various common chronic diseases along its dispersal routes, and eventually impairs BBB integrity to cause NF&ND and brain aging. To illustrate the immune roles of the BBB in pathophysiology affected by inflammatory or ""leaky"" IB resulting from GM and their metabolites, we reviewed the selected publications, including the role of the BBB as the immune barrier, systemic chronic inflammation and inflammation influences on BBB permeability, NF&ND, and brain aging. To add depth to the bridging role of systemic chronic inflammation, a plausible mechanism indispensable for BBB corruption was highlighted; namely, BBB maintenance cues are affected by inflammatory cytokines, which may help to understand how GM and its metabolites play a major role in NF&ND and aging.",Frontiers in immunology,2022,Yi Mou; Yu Du; Lixing Zhou; Jirong Yue; Xianliang Hu; Yixin Liu; Sao Chen; Xiufang Lin; Gongchang Zhang; Hengyi Xiao; Birong Dong
36293176,The Interplay between Gut Microbiota and Parkinson's Disease: Implications on Diagnosis and Treatment.,"The bidirectional interaction between the gut microbiota (GM) and the Central Nervous System, the so-called gut microbiota brain axis (GMBA), deeply affects brain function and has an important impact on the development of neurodegenerative diseases. In Parkinson's disease (PD), gastrointestinal symptoms often precede the onset of motor and non-motor manifestations, and alterations in the GM composition accompany disease pathogenesis. Several studies have been conducted to unravel the role of dysbiosis and intestinal permeability in PD onset and progression, but the therapeutic and diagnostic applications of GM modifying approaches remain to be fully elucidated. After a brief introduction on the involvement of GMBA in the disease, we present evidence for GM alterations and leaky gut in PD patients. According to these data, we then review the potential of GM-based signatures to serve as disease biomarkers and we highlight the emerging role of probiotics, prebiotics, antibiotics, dietary interventions, and fecal microbiota transplantation as supportive therapeutic approaches in PD. Finally, we analyze the mutual influence between commonly prescribed PD medications and gut-microbiota, and we offer insights on the involvement also of nasal and oral microbiota in PD pathology, thus providing a comprehensive and up-to-date overview on the role of microbial features in disease diagnosis and treatment.",International journal of molecular sciences,2022,Angelica Varesi; Lucrezia Irene Maria Campagnoli; Foroogh Fahmideh; Elisa Pierella; Marcello Romeo; Giovanni Ricevuti; Marchesi Nicoletta; Salvatore Chirumbolo; Alessia Pascale
35246670,Inflammation and immune dysfunction in Parkinson disease.,"Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects peripheral organs as well as the central nervous system and involves a fundamental role of neuroinflammation in its pathophysiology. Neurohistological and neuroimaging studies support the presence of ongoing and end-stage neuroinflammatory processes in PD. Moreover, numerous studies of peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid from patients with PD suggest alterations in markers of inflammation and immune cell populations that could initiate or exacerbate neuroinflammation and perpetuate the neurodegenerative process. A number of disease genes and risk factors have been identified as modulators of immune function in PD and evidence is mounting for a role of viral or bacterial exposure, pesticides and alterations in gut microbiota in disease pathogenesis. This has led to the hypothesis that complex gene-by-environment interactions combine with an ageing immune system to create the 'perfect storm' that enables the development and progression of PD. We discuss the evidence for this hypothesis and opportunities to harness the emerging immunological knowledge from patients with PD to create better preclinical models with the long-term goal of enabling earlier identification of at-risk individuals to prevent, delay and more effectively treat the disease.",Nature reviews.

34996879,Association of Fecal and Plasma Levels of Short-Chain Fatty Acids With Gut Microbiota and Clinical Severity in Patients With Parkinson Disease.,"Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are gut microbial metabolites that promote the disease process in a rodent model of Parkinson disease (PD), but fecal levels of SCFAs in patients with PD are reduced. Simultaneous assessments of fecal and plasma SCFA levels, and their interrelationships with the PD disease process, are scarce. We aimed to compare fecal and plasma levels of different SCFA subtypes in patients with PD and healthy controls to delineate their interrelations and link to gut microbiota changes and clinical severity of PD.A cohort of 96 patients with PD and 85 controls were recruited from National Taiwan University Hospital. Fecal and plasma concentrations of SCFAs were measured using chromatography and mass spectrometry. Gut microbiota was analyzed using metagenomic shotgun sequencing. Body mass index and medical comorbidities were evaluated and dietary information was obtained using a food frequency questionnaire. To assess motor and cognitive impairment, we used the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) and the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE).Compared with controls, patients with PD had lower fecal but higher plasma concentrations of acetate, propionate, and butyrate. After adjustment for age, sex, disease duration, and anti-PD medication dosage, MDS-UPDRS part III motor scores correlated with reduced fecal levels of acetate (Ï = -0.37, <i>p</i> = 0.012), propionate (Ï = -0.32, <i>p</i> = 0.036), and butyrate (Ï = -0.40, <i>p</i> = 0.004) and with increased plasma propionate concentrations (Ï = 0.26, <i>p</i> = 0.042) in patients with PD. MMSE scores negatively correlated with plasma levels of butyrate (Ï = -0.09, <i>p</i> = 0.027) and valerate (Ï = -0.032, <i>p</i> = 0.033) after adjustment for confounders. SCFAs-producing gut bacteria correlated positively with fecal levels of SCFAs in healthy controls but revealed no association in patients with PD. In the PD patient group, the abundance of proinflammatory microbes, such as <i>Clostridiales bacterium NK3B98</i> and <i>Ruminococcus sp AM07-15</i>, significantly correlated with decreased fecal levels and increased plasma levels of SCFAs, especially propionic acid.Reductions in fecal SCFAs but increased plasma SCFAs were observed in patients with PD and corelated to specific gut microbiota changes and the clinical severity of PD.This study provides Class III evidence that gut metabolite SCFAs distinguish between patients with PD and controls and are associated with disease severity in patients with PD.",Neurology,2022,Szu-Ju Chen; Chieh-Chang Chen; Hsin-Yu Liao; Ya-Ting Lin; Yu-Wei Wu; Jyh-Ming Liou; Ming-Shiang Wu; Ching-Hua Kuo; Chin-Hsien Lin
35245613,Brain-gut-microbiota axis in Parkinson's disease: A historical review and future perspective.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common degenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS) after Alzheimer's disease. In addition to the typical motor symptoms, the clinical manifestations of patients with PD include gastrointestinal symptoms, which even precede the motor symptoms. Recent research has found that the gut microbiota regulates the brain-gut axial interaction through immune, endocrine, and direct neural mechanisms, supporting the hypothesis that the pathological process of PD spreads from the gut to the brain. In this review article, we highlight the landmark findings in the field of PD, with particular attention to the brain-gut-microbiota axis. We summarize the changes and their clinical effects on the gut microbiota and metabolites observed in PD. The intestinal microbiota may contain appropriate targets for the prevention and treatment of PD. Clinical cohort studies suggest that certain intestinal microbes have protective or pathogenic effects on the progression of PD. A better understanding of the interaction between the gut-brain axis, the gut microbiota, and PD has the potential to lead to new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Animal experiments suggest that fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is helpful for treating PD, and FMT is expected to be an effective treatment for PD in the future.",Brain research bulletin,2022,Siyu Dong; Mei Sun; Chuan He; Hong Cheng
35812394,Gut Microbiota: A Novel Therapeutic Target for Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor dysfunction. Growing evidence has demonstrated that gut dysbiosis is involved in the occurrence, development and progression of PD. Numerous clinical trials have identified the characteristics of the changed gut microbiota profiles, and preclinical studies in PD animal models have indicated that gut dysbiosis can influence the progression and onset of PD <i>via</i> increasing intestinal permeability, aggravating neuroinflammation, aggregating abnormal levels of Î±-synuclein fibrils, increasing oxidative stress, and decreasing neurotransmitter production. The gut microbiota can be considered promising diagnostic and therapeutic targets for PD, which can be regulated by probiotics, psychobiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, postbiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, diet modifications, and Chinese medicine. This review summarizes the recent studies in PD-associated gut microbiota profiles and functions, the potential roles, and mechanisms of gut microbiota in PD, and gut microbiota-targeted interventions for PD. Deciphering the underlying roles and mechanisms of the PD-associated gut microbiota will help interpret the pathogenesis of PD from new perspectives and elucidate novel therapeutic strategies for PD.",Frontiers in immunology,2022,Manlian Zhu; Xia Liu; Yiru Ye; Xiumei Yan; Yiwen Cheng; Longyou Zhao; Feng Chen; Zongxin Ling
36408101,Interactions between gut microbiota and Parkinson's disease: The role of microbiota-derived amino acid metabolism.,"Non-motor symptoms (NMS) of Parkinson's disease (PD), such as constipation, sleep disorders, and olfactory deficits, may emerge up to 20 years earlier than motor symptoms. A series of evidence indicates that the pathology of PD may occur from the gastrointestinal tract to the brain. Numerous studies support that the gut microbiota communicates with the brain through the immune system, special amino acid metabolism, and the nervous system in PD. Recently, there is growing recognition that the gut microbiota plays a vital role in the modulation of multiple neurochemical pathways <i>via</i> the ""gut microbiota-brain axis"" (GMBA). Many gut microbiota metabolites, such as fatty acids, amino acids, and bile acids, convey signaling functions as they mediate the crosstalk between gut microbiota and host physiology. Amino acids' abundance and species alteration, including glutamate and tryptophan, may disturb the signaling transmission between nerve cells and disrupt the normal basal ganglia function in PD. Specific amino acids and their receptors are considered new potential targets for ameliorating PD. The present study aimed to systematically summarize all available evidence on the gut microbiota-derived amino acid metabolism alterations associated with PD.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2022,Wang Wang; Shujun Jiang; Chengcheng Xu; Lili Tang; Yan Liang; Yang Zhao; Guoxue Zhu
36421902,Approaching the Gut and Nasal Microbiota in Parkinson's Disease in the Era of the Seed Amplification Assays.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder often associated with pre-motor symptoms involving both gastrointestinal and olfactory tissues. PD patients frequently suffer from hyposmia, hyposalivation, dysphagia and gastrointestinal dysfunctions. During the last few years it has been speculated that microbial agents could play a crucial role in PD. In particular, alterations of the microbiota composition (dysbiosis) might contribute to the formation of misfolded Î±-synuclein, which is believed to be the leading cause of PD. However, while several findings confirmed that there might be an important link between intestinal microbiota alterations and PD onset, little is known about the potential contribution of the nasal microbiota. Here, we describe the latest findings on this topic by considering that more than 80% of patients with PD develop remarkable olfactory deficits in their prodromal disease stage. Therefore, the nasal microbiota might contribute to PD, eventually boosting the gut microbiota in promoting disease onset. Finally, we present the applications of the seed amplification assays to the study of the gut and olfactory mucosa of PD patients, and how they could be exploited to investigate whether pathogenic bacteria present in the gut and the nose might promote Î±-synuclein misfolding and aggregation.",Brain sciences,2022,Alessandra Consonni; Martina Miglietti; Chiara Maria Giulia De Luca; Federico Angelo Cazzaniga; Arianna Ciullini; Ilaria Linda Dellarole; Giuseppe Bufano; Alessio Di Fonzo; Giorgio Giaccone; Fulvio Baggi; Fabio Moda
35304983,Modifying the diet and gut microbiota to prevent and manage neurodegenerative diseases.,"The global prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease is steadily increasing due to the aging population. The lack of effective drugs against these neurodegenerative disorders makes it imperative to identify new strategies for their prevention and treatment. Recent studies have revealed that harnessing the power of the gut microbiota through modification of diet may be a valuable approach for reducing the risk, modulating the symptoms, and ameliorating the pathophysiological aspects of neurodegenerative diseases. Consuming specific dietary components can alter the prevalence of bacterial communities within the gut to a healthy enterotype, which can influence the production of beneficial metabolites by microbiota. This article focuses on several dietary components, which have been demonstrated to affect the gut microbiota-brain axis and therefore could lead to attenuation of specific pathological processes in neurodegenerative diseases. Published evidence indicates that fermented foods, including kefir, and foods that are high in bioactive polyphenols and complex carbohydrates, such as grapes, pomegranates, and seaweed, may be effective at reducing neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, neurotransmitter dysfunction, and neuronal death associated with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Even though experimental evidence supporting the protective properties of the above dietary components in these diseases is emerging, it is evident that further human clinical studies are required to conclusively establish the benefits of any suggested dietary interventions. The translational potential of such research is illustrated by theÂ clinical success of the recently developed Alzheimer's drug, GV-971, which is a seaweed derivative that works by modulating the gut microbiota-brain axis.",Reviews in the neurosciences,2022,Ellen J Gates; Anna K Bernath; Andis Klegeris
36034698,Curcumin-driven reprogramming of the gut microbiota and metabolome ameliorates motor deficits and neuroinflammation in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder, accompanied by motor deficits as well as gastrointestinal dysfunctions. Recent studies have proved that the disturbance of gut microbiota and metabolism contributes to the pathogenesis of PD; however, the mechanisms underlying these effects have yet to be elucidated. Curcumin (CUR) has been reported to provide neuroprotective effects on neurological disorders and modulate the gut flora in intestinal-related diseases. Therefore, it is of significant interest to investigate whether CUR could exert a protective effect on PD and whether the effect of CUR is dependent on the intestinal flora and subsequent changes in metabolites.In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of CUR on a mouse model of PD induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). 16S rRNA sequencing was performed to explore the profile of the gut microbiota among controls, MPTP-treated mice and CUR-treated mice. Then, antibiotic treatment (ABX) and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiments were conducted to examine the role of intestinal microbes on the protective effects of CUR in PD mice. Furthermore, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS)-based metabolomics analysis was used to identify the landscape of the CUR-driven serum metabolome. Finally, Pearson's analysis was conducted to investigate correlations between the gut flora-metabolite axis and CUR-driven neuroprotection in PD.Our results showed that CUR intervention effectively improved motor deficits, glial cell activation, and the aggregation of Î±-synuclein (Î±-syn) in MPTP-treated mice. 16S rRNA sequencing showed elevated abundances of <i>Muribaculaceae</i>, <i>Lactobacillaceae</i>, <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> and <i>Eggerthellaceae</i> but depleted abundances of <i>Aerococcaceae</i> and <i>Staphylococcaceae</i> in CUR-treated mice when compared with MPTP mice. ABX and FMT experiments further confirmed that the gut microbiota was required for CUR-induced protection in PD mice. Serum metabolomics analysis showed that CUR notably upregulated the levels of tyrosine, methionine, sarcosine and creatine. Importantly, strong correlations were identified among crucial taxa (<i>Aerococcaceae</i>, <i>Staphylococcaceae</i>, <i>Muribaculaceae</i>, <i>Lactobacillaceae</i>, <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> and <i>Eggerthellaceae</i>), pivotal metabolites (tyrosine, methionine, sarcosine and creatine) and the motor function and pathological results of mice. CUR treatment led to a rapid increase in the brain levels of tyrosine and levodopa (dopa) these changes were related to the abundances of <i>Lactobacillaceae</i> and <i>Aerococcaceae</i>.CUR exerts a protective effect on the progression of PD by modulating the gut microbiota-metabolite axis. <i>Lactobacillaceae</i> and <i>Aerococcaceae</i>, along with key metabolites such as tyrosine and dopa play a dominant role in CUR-associated neuroprotection in PD mice. Our findings offer unique insights into the pathogenesis and potential treatment of PD.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2022,Can Cui; Yingying Han; Hongxia Li; Hongxiang Yu; Bei Zhang; Gang Li
36613486,Mediterranean Diet and Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder, diagnosed on the basis of typical motor disturbances, but also characterized by the presence of non-motor symptoms, such as rapid eye movement (REM)-sleep behavior disorders, olfactory impairment, and constipation, which are often prodromal to the onset of the disease. PD is often associated with the presence of oxidative brain injury and chronic neuroinflammation, with infiltration and accumulation of peripheral immune cells that have been found in affected brain regions of PD patients. Recently, the role of the gut-brain axis in the pathogenesis of PD is getting more and more attention, and several pieces of evidence indicate alterations in the gut microbiota of PD-affected patients. Diet exerts a central role in defining the microbiota composition and different dietetic patterns can result in a higher or lower abundance of specific bacteria that, in turn, can affect gut permeability and express anti- or pro-inflammatory metabolites. In the present review, the effects of the Mediterranean diet in modulating both PD onset and its progression will be considered with a special focus on the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of this dietetic regimen as well as on its effects on the microbiota composition.",International journal of molecular sciences,2022,Marco Bisaglia

Our results indicated that <i>L. plantarum</i> DP189 increased the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxide (GSH-Px), and interleukin-10 (IL-10) and decreased the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), reactive oxygen species (ROS), tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²). Moreover, <i>L. plantarum</i> DP189 reduced the Î±-SYN accumulation in SN. Mechanistically, <i>L. plantarum</i> DP189 activated the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2)/ARE and PGC-1Î± pathways and suppressed the NLRP3 inflammasome. Furthermore, fecal analysis showed that <i>L. plantarum</i> DP189 reshaped the gut microbiota in PD mice by reducing the number of pathogenic bacteria (<i>Proteobacteria</i> and <i>Actinobacteria</i>) and increased the abundance of probiotics (<i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Prevotella</i>). Our results suggested that <i>L. plantarum</i> DP189 could delay the neurodegeneration caused by the accumulation of Î±-SYN in the SN of PD mice via suppressing oxidative stress, repressing proinflammatory response, and modulating gut microbiota.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2022,Lei Wang; Zijian Zhao; Lei Zhao; Yujuan Zhao; Ge Yang; Chao Wang; Lei Gao; Chunhua Niu; Shengyu Li
35203645,Role of Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis in Regulating Dopaminergic Signaling.,"Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a critical role both peripherally and centrally in vital functions such as cognition, reward, satiety, voluntary motor movements, pleasure, and motivation. Optimal dopamine bioavailability is essential for normal brain functioning and protection against the development of neurological diseases. Emerging evidence shows that gut microbiota have significant roles in maintaining adequate concentrations of dopamine via intricate, bidirectional communication known as the microbiota-gut-brain axis. The vagus nerve, immune system, hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, and microbial metabolites serve as important mediators of the reciprocal microbiota-gut-brain signaling. Furthermore, gut microbiota contain intrinsic enzymatic activity that is highly involved in dopamine metabolism, facilitating dopamine synthesis as well as its metabolite breakdown. This review examines the relationship between key genera of gut microbiota such as <i>Prevotella, Bacteroides, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium,</i><i>Enterococcus,</i> and <i>Ruminococcus</i> and their effects on dopamine. The effects of gut dysbiosis on dopamine bioavailability and the subsequent impact on dopamine-related pathological conditions such as Parkinson's disease are also discussed. Understanding the role of gut microbiota in modulating dopamine activity and bioavailability both in the periphery and in the central nervous system can help identify new therapeutic targets as well as optimize available methods to prevent, delay, or restore dopaminergic deficits in neurologic and metabolic disorders.",Biomedicines,2022,Sevag Hamamah; Armin Aghazarian; Anthony Nazaryan; Andras Hajnal; Mihai Covasa
35923300,The Role of Gut Microbiota in the Progression of Parkinson's Disease and the Mechanism of Intervention by Traditional Chinese Medicine.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common degenerative disease of the nervous system that seriously affects the quality of life of the patients. The pathogenesis of PD is not yet fully clear. Previous studies have confirmed that patients with PD exhibit obvious gut microbiota imbalance, while intervention of PD by regulating the gut microbiota has become an important approach to the prevention and treatment of this disease. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been shown to be safe and effective in treating PD. It has the advantages of affecting multiple targets. Studies have shown TCM can regulate gut microbiota. However, the specific mechanism of action is still unclear. Therefore, this article will mainly discuss the association of the alteration of the gut microbiota and the incidence of PD, the advantages of TCM in treating PD, and the mechanism of regulating gut microbiota by TCM to treat PD. It will clarify the target and mechanism of TCM treating PD by acting gut microbiota and provided a novel methodology for the prevention and treatment of PD.",Neuropsychiatric disease and treatment,2022,Pengfei Huan; Li Wang; Zhuqing He; Jiancheng He
36075637,Enteric nervous system and intestinal epithelial regulation of the gut-brain axis.,"The gut-brain axis describes a bidirectional interplay within the enteric environment between the intestinal epithelium, the mucosal immune system, and the microbiota with the enteric nervous system. This interplay provides a link between exogenous environmental stimuli such as nutrient sensing, and nervous system function, as well as a mechanism of feedback from cortical and sensory centers of the brain to enteric activities. The intestinal epithelium is one of the human body's largest sources of hormones and neurotransmitters, which have critical effects on neuronal function. The influence of the gut microbiota on these processes appears to be profound; yet to date, it has been insufficiently explored. Disruption of the intestinal microbiota is linked not only to diseases in the gut but also to brain symptomatology, including neurodegenerative and behavioral disorders (Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, autism, and anxiety and/or depression). In this review we discuss the cellular wiring of the gut-brain axis, with a particular focus on the epithelial and neuronal interaction, the evidence that has led to our current understanding of the intestinal role in neurologic function, and future directions of research to unravel this important interaction in both healthÂ and allergic disease.",The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,2022,Laura R Dowling; Michael R Strazzari; Simon Keely; Gerard E Kaiko
35275534,"Investigating Casual Associations Among Gut Microbiota, Metabolites, and Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Mendelian Randomization Study.","Recent studies had explored that gut microbiota was associated with neurodegenerative diseases (including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)) through the gut-brain axis, among which metabolic pathways played an important role. However, the underlying causality remained unclear.Our study aimed to evaluate potential causal relationships between gut microbiota, metabolites, and neurodegenerative diseases through Mendelian randomization (MR) approach.We selected genetic variants associated with gut microbiota traits (Nâ=â18,340) and gut microbiota-derived metabolites (Nâ=â7,824) from genome-wide association studies. Summary statistics of neurodegenerative diseases were obtained from IGAP (AD, 17,008 cases; 37,154 controls), IPDGC (PD, 37,688 cases; 141,779 controls), and IALSC (ALS, 20,806 cases; 59,804 controls) respectively.Greater abundance of Ruminococcus (OR, 1.245; 95% CI, 1.103-1.405; pâ=â0.0004) was found significantly related to higher risk of ALS. Besides, our study found suggestive associations of Actinobacteria, Lactobacillaceae, Faecalibacterium, Ruminiclostridium, and Lachnoclostridium with AD, of Lentisphaerae, Lentisphaeria, Oxalobacteraceae, Victivallales, Bacillales, Eubacteriumhalliigroup, Anaerostipes, and Clostridiumsensustricto1 with PD, and of Lachnospira, Fusicatenibacter, Catenibacterium, and Ruminococcusgnavusgroup with ALS. Our study also revealed suggestive associations between 12 gut microbiome-dependent metabolites and neurodegenerative diseases. Glutamine was related to lower risk of AD. For the serotonin pathway, serotonin was found as a protective factor of PD, while kynurenine as a risk factor for ALS.Our study firstly applied a two-sample MR approach to detect causal relationships among gut microbiota, gut metabolites, and neurodegenerative diseases.

36126853,Role of gut microbiota-derived branched-chain amino acids in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease: An animal study.,"Neuroinflammation caused by the disorder of gut microbiota and its metabolites is associated with the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Thus, it is necessary to identify certain molecules derived from gut microbiota to verify whether they could become intervention targets for the treatment of PD. The branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), as a common dietary supplement, could modulate brain function. Herein, we investigated the longitudinal shifts of microbial community in mice treated with rotenone for 0, 3 and 4Â weeks by 16S rRNA gene sequencing to identify the microbial markers at different PD stages. Serum BCAAs were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Then, rotenone-induced mice were given a high BCAA diet to evaluate the motor and non-motor functions, dopaminergic neuron loss, and inflammation levels. Using a PD mouse model, we discovered that during PD progression, the alterations of gut microbiota compositions led to the peripheral decrease of BCAAs. Based on the serum lipopolysaccharide binding protein concentrations and the levels of pro-inflammatory factors (including tumor necrosis factor-Î±, interleukin [IL]-1Î², and IL-6) in the colon and substantia nigra, we found that the high BCAA diet could attenuate the inflammatory levels in PD mice, and reverse motor and non-motor dysfunctions and dopaminergic neuron impairment. Together, our results emphasize the dynamic changes of gut microbiota and BCAA metabolism and propose a novel strategy for PD therapy: a high BCAA diet intervention could improve PD progression by regulating the levels of inflammation.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2022,Zhenzhen Yan; Fan Yang; Linlin Sun; Jing Yu; Lina Sun; Yao Si; Lifen Yao
35456966,Biomarker of Neuroinflammation in Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is caused by abnormal accumulation of Î±-synuclein in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra, which subsequently causes motor symptoms. Neuroinflammation plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration in PD. This neuroinflammatory neurodegeneration involves the activation of microglia, upregulation of proinflammatory factors, and gut microbiota. In this review, we summarized the recent findings on detection of PD by using inflammatory biomarkers, such as interleukin (IL)-1Î², IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î±; regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and presumably secreted (RANTES) and high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hsCRP); and radiotracers such as [11C]PK11195 and [18F]-FEPPA, as well as by monitoring disease progression and the treatment response. Many PD-causing mutations in <i>SNCA</i>, <i>LRRK2</i>, <i>PRKN</i>, <i>PINK1</i>, and <i>DJ-1</i> are also associated with neuroinflammation. Several anti-inflammatory medications, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), inhibitors of TNF-Î± and NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), agonists of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-Î³), and steroids, have demonstrated neuroprotective effects in in vivo or in vitro PD models. Clinical trials applying objective biomarkers are required to investigate the therapeutic potential of anti-inflammatory medications for PD.",International journal of molecular sciences,2022,Tsai-Wei Liu; Chiung-Mei Chen; Kuo-Hsuan Chang
36334596,The intestinal barrier in disorders of the central nervous system.,"The intestinal barrier, which primarily consists of a mucus layer, an epithelial barrier, and a gut vascular barrier, has a crucial role in health and disease by facilitating nutrient absorption and preventing the entry of pathogens. The intestinal barrier is in close contact with gut microbiota on its luminal side and with enteric neurons and glial cells on its tissue side. Mounting evidence now suggests that the intestinal barrier is compromised not only in digestive disorders, but also in disorders of the central nervous system (CNS), such as Parkinson's disease, autism spectrum disorder, depression, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease. After providing an overview of the structure and functions of the intestinal barrier, we review existing preclinical and clinical studies supporting the notion that intestinal barrier dysfunction is present in neurological, neurodevelopmental, and psychiatric disorders. On the basis of this evidence, we discuss the mechanisms that possibly link gut barrier dysfunction and CNS disorders and the potential impact that evaluating enteric barriers in brain disorders could have on clinical practice, in terms of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, in the near future.",The lancet.

35849305,Psychobiotics: the Influence of Gut Microbiota on the Gut-Brain Axis in Neurological Disorders.,"Nervous system disorders are one of the common problems that affect many people around the world every year. Regarding the beneficial effects of the probiotics on the gut and the gut-brain axis, their application along with current medications has been the subject of intense interest. Psychobiotics are a probiotic strain capable to affect the gut-brain axis. The effective role of Psychobiotics in several neurological disorders is documented. Consumption of the Psychobiotics containing nutrients has positive effects on the improvement of microbiota as well as alleviation of some symptoms of central nervous system (CNS) disorders. In the present study, the effects of probiotic strains on some CNS disorders in terms of controlling the disease symptoms were reviewed. Finding suggests that Psychobiotics can efficiently alleviate the symptoms of several CNS disorders such as autism spectrum disorders, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, insomnia, depression, diabetic neuropathy, and anorexia nervosa. It can be concluded that functional foods containing psychotropic strains can help to improve mental health.",Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN,2022,Parvin Oroojzadeh; Saber Yari Bostanabad; Hajie Lotfi
35931717,Specific gut microbiota alterations in essential tremor and its difference from Parkinson's disease.,"Essential tremor (ET) is the most common movement disorder and share overlapping symptoms with Parkinson's disease (PD), making differential diagnosis challenging. Gut dysbiosis is regarded crucial in the pathogenesis of PD. Since ET patients also has comorbidity in gastrointestinal disorders, the relationship between gut microbiota and ET really worth investigating and may help distinguishing ET from PD. Fecal samples from 54 ET, 67 de novo PD and 54 normal controls (NC) were collected for 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR. ET showed lower species richness (Chao1 index) than NC and PD. ET was with Bacteroides-dominant enterotype, while PD was with Ruminococcus-dominant enterotype. Compared with NC, 7 genera were significantly reduced in ET, 4 of which (Ruminococcus, Romboutsia, Mucispirillum, and Aeromonas) were identified to be distinctive with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.705. Compared to PD, 26 genera were found significantly different from ET, 4 of which (Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Phascolarctobacterium, and Lachnospira) were found distinguishable with an AUC of 0.756. Clinical association results indicated that Proteus was associated with disease severity (TETRAS) of ET, while Klebsiella was linked to depression and anxiety in ET. Functional predictions revealed that 4 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways were altered in ET. This study reveals gut dysbiosis in ET and it provides new insight into the pathogenesis of ET and helps distinguishing ET from PD.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2022,Pingchen Zhang; Pei Huang; Juanjuan Du; Yixi He; Jin Liu; Guiying He; Shishuang Cui; Weishan Zhang; Gen Li; Shengdi Chen
35422756,Gut-Derived Sterile Inflammation and Parkinson's Disease.,"The etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) is unknown, but evidence is increasing that there is a prominent inflammatory component to the illness. Epidemiological, genetic, and preclinical evidence support a role for gut-derived sterile inflammation. Pro-inflammatory bacteria are over-represented in the PD gut microbiota. There is evidence for decreased gut barrier function and leak of bacterial antigen across the gut epithelium with sub-mucosal inflammation and systemic exposure to the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide. Preclinical evidence supports these clinical findings and suggests that systemic inflammation can affect the CNS through vagal pathways or the systemic circulation. We will review recent preclinical and clinical evidence to support this mechanism and suggest possible treatments directed at the gut-brain axis.",Frontiers in neurology,2022,Kathleen M Shannon

A total of 124 subjects were part of the study (63 PD patients and 61 HC subjects). 139 metabolite features were found to be predictive between the PD and Control groups. No associations were found between metabolite features and within-PD clinical variables. The results suggest alterations in serum metabolite profiles in PD, and the results of correlation analysis between metabolite features and microbiota suggest that several bacterial taxa are associated with altered lipid and energy metabolism in PD.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2022,Pedro A B Pereira; Drupad K Trivedi; Justin Silverman; Ilhan Cem Duru; Lars Paulin; Petri Auvinen; Filip Scheperjans
36359864,Rifaximin Modifies Gut Microbiota and Attenuates Inflammation in Parkinson's Disease: Preclinical and Clinical Studies.,"Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) exhibit distinct gut microbiota, which may promote gut-derived inflammation. Rifaximin is a nonabsorbable antibiotic that can modify gut microbiota. The present study investigated the effect of rifaximin on gut microbiota and inflammation status in PD. The study examined the effect of long-term rifaximin treatment on in vivo transgenic PD mice (MitoPark) and short-term rifaximin treatment on patients with PD. Rifaximin treatment caused a significant change in gut microbiota in the transgenic PD mice; in particular, it reduced the relative abundance of <i>Prevotellaceae UCG-001</i> and increased the relative abundance of <i>Bacteroides</i>, <i>Muribaculum</i>, and <i>Lachnospiraceae UCG-001</i>. Rifaximin treatment attenuated serum interleukin-1Î², interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-Î±, claudin-5 and occludin, which indicated the reduction of systemic inflammation and the protection of the blood-brain barrier integrity. The rifaximin-treated MitoPark mice exhibited better motor and memory performance than did the control mice, with lower microglial activation and increased neuronal survival in the hippocampus. In the patients with PD, 7-day rifaximin treatment caused an increase in the relative abundance of <i>Flavonifractor</i> 6 months after treatment, and the change in plasma proinflammatory cytokine levels was negatively associated with the baseline plasma interleukin-1Î± level. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that rifaximin exerted a neuroprotective effect on the transgenic PD mice by modulating gut microbiota. We observed that patients with higher baseline inflammation possibly benefited from rifaximin treatment. With consideration for the tolerability and safety of rifaximin, randomized controlled trials should investigate the disease-modification effect of long-term treatment on select patients with PD.",Cells,2022,Chien-Tai Hong; Lung Chan; Kai-Yun Chen; Hsun-Hua Lee; Li-Kai Huang; Yu-Chen S H Yang; Yun-Ru Liu; Chaur-Jong Hu
36467550,Curcumin Regulates Gut Microbiota and Exerts a Neuroprotective Effect in the MPTP Model of Parkinson's Disease.,"The experiment aimed to explore the effects of curcumin on motor impairment, dopamine neurons, and gut microbiota in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mice model.Mice were randomly assigned to six groups: normal control group, solvent control group, MPTP group, curcumin-low-dose group (40âmg/kg), curcumin-medium-dose group (80âmg/kg), and curcumin-high-dose group (160âmg/kg). After 14 days, each group of mice was subjected to the pole text, the hanging test, and the open-field test. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunohistochemistry was used to observe the survival of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons. Moreover, ultrastructural changes were observed with a transmission electron microscope in mice striatal tissue cells. Then, 16S rRNA was used to assess changes in the gut microbiota.(1) Each dose of curcumin reduced pole climbing time and increased suspension score and total distance moved dose-dependently. (2) All curcumin groups improved cell wrinkling and vacuolar degeneration, increased the number of TH positives, improved cell survival, and the higher the dose of curcumin, the better the effect. (3) There were differences in microbiota composition and a relative abundance among the groups. The relative abundance of <i>Patescibacteria</i>, <i>Proteobacteria</i>, and <i>Verrucomicrobia</i> was higher in the MPTP group. The relative abundance of <i>Patescibacteria</i>, <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i>, <i>Enterococcaceae</i> all decreased in all curcumin groups. In addition, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways showed a reduction in the superpathway of N-acetylneuraminate degradation after medium- and high-dose curcumin administration.Curcumin regulates gut microbiota and exerts a neuroprotective effect in the MPTP mice model. This preliminary study demonstrates the therapeutic potential of curcumin for Parkinson's disease, providing clues for microbially targeted therapies for Parkinson's disease.",Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,2022,Hong Zhu; Houwen Zhang; Bonan Hou; Bin Xu; Liting Ji; You Wu
36362150,Mucosal Immunity and the Gut-Microbiota-Brain-Axis in Neuroimmune Disease.,"Recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have opened the door to a wellspring of information regarding the composition of the gut microbiota. Leveraging NGS technology, early metagenomic studies revealed that several diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, autism, and myalgic encephalomyelitis, are characterized by alterations in the diversity of gut-associated microbes. More recently, interest has shifted toward understanding how these microbes impact their host, with a special emphasis on their interactions with the brain. Such interactions typically occur either systemically, through the production of small molecules in the gut that are released into circulation, or through signaling via the vagus nerves which directly connect the enteric nervous system to the central nervous system. Collectively, this system of communication is now commonly referred to as the gut-microbiota-brain axis. While equally important, little attention has focused on the causes of the alterations in the composition of gut microbiota. Although several factors can contribute, mucosal immunity plays a significant role in shaping the microbiota in both healthy individuals and in association with several diseases. The purpose of this review is to provide a brief overview of the components of mucosal immunity that impact the gut microbiota and then discuss how altered immunological conditions may shape the gut microbiota and consequently affect neuroimmune diseases, using a select group of common neuroimmune diseases as examples.",International journal of molecular sciences,2022,Kathryn G Sterling; Griffin Kutler Dodd; Shatha Alhamdi; Peter G Asimenios; Ruben K Dagda; Kenny L De Meirleir; Dorothy Hudig; Vincent C Lombardi
35730414,The role of nutrition on Parkinson's disease: a systematic review.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) in elderly patients is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease. The pathogenesis of PD is associated with dopaminergic neuron degeneration of the substantia nigra in the basal ganglia, causing classic motor symptoms. Oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation have been identified as possible pathways in laboratory investigations. Nutrition, a potentially versatile factor from all environmental factors affecting PD, has received intense research scrutiny.A systematic search was conducted in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and WEB OF SCIENCE databases from 2000 until the present. Only randomized clinical trials (RCTs), observational case-control studies, and follow-up studies were included.We retrieved fifty-two studies that met the inclusion criteria. Most selected studies investigated the effects of malnutrition and the Mediterranean diet (MeDiet) on PD incidence and progression. Other investigations contributed evidence on the critical role of microbiota, vitamins, polyphenols, dairy products, coffee, and alcohol intake.There are still many concerns regarding the association between PD and nutrition, possibly due to underlying genetic and environmental factors. However, there is a body of evidence revealing that correcting malnutrition, gut microbiota, and following the MeDiet reduced the onset of PD and reduced clinical progression. Other factors, such as polyphenols, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and coffee intake, can have a potential protective effect. Conversely, milk and its accessory products can increase PD risk. Nutritional intervention is essential for neurologists to improve clinical outcomes and reduce the disease progression of PD.",Nutritional neuroscience,2023,Vittorio Emanuele Bianchi; Laura Rizzi; Fahad Somaa
36558531,The Interaction of Polyphenols and the Gut Microbiota in Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Polyphenols are secondary metabolites of plants and play a potential role in the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases (NND) such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) due to their unique physiological functions such as acting as antioxidants, being anti-inflammatory, being neuroprotective, and promoting intestinal health. Since dietary polyphenols exist in plant foods in the form of glycosylation or esterification or are combined with polymers, they need to undergo extensive metabolism through phase I and phase II biotransformations by various intestinal enzymes, as well as metabolism by the intestinal microbiota before they can be fully absorbed. Polyphenols improve intestinal microbiota disorders by influencing the structure and function of intestinal microbiota, inducing beneficial bacteria to produce a variety of metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), promoting the secretion of hormones and neurotransmitters, and playing an important role in the prevention and treatment of NND by affecting the microbe-gut-brain axis. We review the ways in which some polyphenols can change the composition of the intestinal microbiota and their metabolites in AD or PD animal models to exert the role of slowing down the progression of NND, aiming to provide evidence for the role of polyphenols in slowing the progression of NND via the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis.",Nutrients,2022,Yuan Zhang; Wanpeng Yu; Lei Zhang; Man Wang; Wenguang Chang
36479494,Dietary supplements in neurological diseases and brain aging.,"A healthy diet shapes a healthy mind. Diet quality has a strong association with brain health. Diet influences the onset and consequences of neurological diseases, and dietary factors may influence mental health at individual and population level. The link between unhealthy diet, impaired cognitive function and neurodegenerative diseases indicates that adopting a healthy diet would ultimately afford prevention and management of neurological diseases and brain aging. Neurodegenerative diseases are of multifactorial origin and result in progressive loss of neuronal function in the brain, leading to cognitive impairment and motoneuron disorders. The so-called Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) with its healthy ingredients rich in antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immune, neuroprotective, antidepressant, antistress and senolytic activity plays an essential role in the prevention and management of neurological diseases and inhibits cognitive decline in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. The MedDiet also modulates the gut-brain axis by promoting a diversity of gut microbiota. In view of the importance of diet in neurological diseases management, this review focuses on the dietary components, natural compounds and medicinal plants that have proven beneficial in neurological diseases and for brain health. Among them, polyphenols, omega-3 fatty acids, B vitamins and several ayurvedic herbs have promising beneficial effects.",Journal of preventive medicine and hygiene,2022,Zakira Naureen; Kristjana Dhuli; Maria Chiara Medori; Paola Caruso; Paolo Manganotti; Pietro Chiurazzi; Matteo Bertelli
36200207,Microbiota- Brain-Gut-Axis Relevance to Parkinson's Disease: Potential Therapeutic Effects of Probiotics.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common type of neurogenerative disease among middleaged and older people, characterized by aggregation of alpha-synuclein and dopaminergic neuron loss. The microbiota- gut-brain axis is a dynamic bidirectional communication network and is involved in the pathogenesis of PD. The aggregation of misfolded protein alpha-synuclein is a neuropathological characteristic of PD, originates in the gut and migrates to the central nervous system (CNS) through the vagus nerve and olfactory bulb. The change in the architecture of gut microbiota increases the level short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and other metabolites, acting on the neuroendocrine system and modulating the concentrations of gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), serotonin, and other neurotransmitters. It also alters the vagus and intestinal signalling, influencing the brain and behaviour by activating microglia and systemic cytokines. Both experimental and clinical reports indicate the role of intestinal dysbiosis and microbiota host interaction in neurodegeneration. Probiotics are live microorganisms that modify the gut microbiota in the small intestine to avoid neurological diseases. Probiotics have been shown in clinical and preclinical studies to be effective in the treatment of PD by balancing the gut microbiota. In this article, we described the role of gut-microbiota in the pathogenesis of PD. The article aims to explore the mechanistic strategy of the gut-brain axis and its relation with motor impairment and the use of probiotics to maintain gut microbial flora and prevent PD-like symptoms.",Current pharmaceutical design,2022,Khadga Raj; Shamsher Singh; Shivani Chib; Sudhanshu Mallan
35599496,"Effects of Gut Microbiota Alterations on Motor, Gastrointestinal, and Behavioral Phenotype in a Mouse Model of Parkinson's Disease.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multi-system disorder consisting of not only classic motor symptoms but also a variety of non-motor symptoms including gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction and mood disorders. The gut microbiota has been suggested to play a role in modulating PD motor and non-motor features, although the causality and mechanisms behind these proposed interactions remains largely understudied.In this study, we aimed to provide in-depth characterization of an established mouse model of PD (transgenic (TG) SNCA A53T) and experimentally address how changes to the gut microbiota impact the PD-like phenotype.We profiled the PD-like phenotype of transgenic mice through a panel of motor, GI, and behavioral tests. We then investigated how antibiotic treatment or gut microbial community transfer (via cohousing with wild-type mice) impacted the PD-like phenotype.We found that this mouse model demonstrated early (6 weeks of age) motor symptoms when compared to a wild-type control mouse strain. Transgenic mice also exhibited early GI dysfunction, as well as behavioral alterations, including reduced anxiety-like behavior, and increased depression-like and apathy-like behavior. Compared to wild-type mice, the transgenic fecal microbiota was less diverse and compositionally distinct. Interestingly, drastic alterations to the gut microbiota, through antibiotic treatment or cohousing with wild-type mice, had a minimal effect on the motor, GI, and behavioral phenotype of transgenic mice.We concluded that this mouse model effectively recapitulates motor and non-motor features of PD; however, the gut microbiota appears to exhibit a minor impact on the pathophysiology of this PD model.",Journal of Parkinson's disease,2022,Nina Radisavljevic; Mihai Cirstea; Kylynda Bauer; Christine Lo; Avril Metcalfe-Roach; Tahereh Bozorgmehr; Haggai Bar-Yoseph; B Brett Finlay
36569929,"Parasite infections, neuroinflammation, and potential contributions of gut microbiota.","Many parasitic diseases (including cerebral malaria, human African trypanosomiasis, cerebral toxoplasmosis, neurocysticercosis and neuroschistosomiasis) feature acute or chronic brain inflammation processes, which are often associated with deregulation of glial cell activity and disruption of the brain blood barrier's intactness. The inflammatory responses of astrocytes and microglia during parasite infection are strongly influenced by a variety of environmental factors. Although it has recently been shown that the gut microbiota influences the physiology and immunomodulation of the central nervous system in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's, the putative link in parasite-induced neuroinflammatory diseases has not been well characterized. Likewise, the central nervous system can influence the gut microbiota. In parasite infections, the gut microbiota is strongly perturbed and might influence the severity of the central nervous system inflammation response through changes in the production of bacterial metabolites. Here, we review the roles of astrocytes and microglial cells in the neuropathophysiological processes induced by parasite infections and their possible regulation by the gut microbiota.",Frontiers in immunology,2022,JÃ©rÃ©my Alloo; Ines Leleu; Corinne Grangette; Sylviane Pied

However, the pathogenesis of PD is still unclear. Host health is closely related to gut microbiota, which are affected by factors such as age, diet, and exercise. Recent studies have found that gut microbiota may play key roles in the progression of a wide range of diseases, including PD. Changes in the abundance of gut bacteria, such as Helicobacter pylori, Enterococcus faecalis, and Desulfovibrio, might be involved in PD pathogenesis or interfere with PD therapy.

31340904,Role of the gut microbiota in the development of various neurological diseases.,"In recent years, the scientific evidence supporting a relationship between the microbiota and various diseases has increased significantly; this trend has also been observed for neurological diseases. This has given rise to the concept of the gut-brain axis and the idea of a relationship between the gut microbiota and several neurological diseases whose aetiopathogenesis is yet to be clearly defined.We review the role of the gut microbiota in the gut-brain axis and analyse those neurological diseases in which alterations in the gut microbiota have been described as a result of human studies: specifically, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, and multiple sclerosis.The body of evidence linking the gut microbiota to various neurological diseases has grown considerably. Several interesting studies show a relationship between the gut microbiota and Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer disease, neuromyelitis optica, and multiple sclerosis, whereas other controversial studies implicate it in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Many of these studies place considerable emphasis on modulation of inflammation, particularly by bacteria capable of producing short-chain fatty acids. Despite these encouraging results, many questions remain, and there is a need to demonstrate causality, determine the role of fungi or viruses, and research possible treatment through diet, probiotics, or faecal microbiota transplantation.",Neurologia,2022,F Castillo-Ãlvarez; M E Marzo-Sola
36018501,"Diet, Gut Microbiome, and Cognitive Decline.","An epidemic of age-associated cognitive decline, most commonly ascribed to neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, is causing healthcare costs to soar and devastating caregivers. An estimated 6.5 million Americans are living today with Alzheimer's disease, with 13.8 million cases projected by mid-century. Although genetic mutations are known to cause neurodegeneration, autosomal dominant disease is very rare and most sporadic cases can be attributed, at least in part, to modifiable risk factors.Diet is a potential modifiable risk factor in cognitive decline. Food communicates with the brain through a complex signaling web involving multiple cells, mediators and receptors. Gut-brain communication is modulated by microorganisms including bacteria, archaea, viruses, and unicellular eukaryotes, which together constitute the microbiota. Microbes not only play major roles in the digestion and fermentation of the food, providing nutrients and bioactive metabolites, but also reflect the type and amount of food consumed and food-borne toxic exposures. Food components modify the diversity and abundance of the microbial populations, maintain the integrity of the gut barrier, and regulate the passage of microbes and their metabolites into the blood stream where they modulate the immune system and communicate with body systems including the brain. This paper will focus on selected mechanisms through which interactions between diet and the gut microbiota can modify brain integrity and cognitive function with emphasis on the pathogenesis of the most common dementia, Alzheimer's disease.",Current nutrition reports,2022,Susan Ettinger

35890040,Gut Microbes and Neuropathology: Is There a Causal Nexus?,"The gut microbiota is a virtual organ which produces a myriad of molecules that the brain and other organs require. Humans and microbes are in a symbiotic relationship, we feed the microbes, and in turn, they provide us with essential molecules. Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes phyla account for around 80% of the total human gut microbiota, and approximately 1000 species of bacteria have been identified in the human gut. In adults, the main factors influencing microbiota structure are diet, exercise, stress, disease and medications. In this narrative review, we explore the involvement of the gut microbiota in Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis and autism, as these are such high-prevalence disorders. We focus on preclinical studies that increase the understanding of disease pathophysiology. We examine the potential for targeting the gut microbiota in the development of novel therapies and the limitations of the currently published clinical studies. We conclude that while the field shows enormous promise, further large-scale studies are required if a causal link between these disorders and gut microbes is to be definitively established.","Pathogens (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,Katherine Dinan; Timothy G Dinan
35965446,The gut microbiome and cognition in Parkinson's disease: a systematic review.,"The pathology underlying cognitive changes in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) is not well understood. In healthy older adults, gut microbiome composition has been associated with cognitive function. In people with PD, preliminary evidence suggests that cortical spreading of abnormal alpha-synuclein aggregates may be associated with cognitive impairment. As changes in the gut have been linked to PD onset and associated Lewy body pathology, an investigation of the gut microbiome and cognition in PD is warranted.To synthesise existing evidence on the relationship between the gut microbiome and cognitive function in PD.A systematic review was conducted to search for peer-reviewed articles and grey literature published to July 2021 across seven electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Scopus, Cochrane Library, ProQuest, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses). English language articles reporting the relationship between cognition and the gut microbiome in human participants with PD were considered for inclusion. Results were qualitatively synthesised and evidence quality was assessed using the QualSyst tool for quantitative studies.Five cross-sectional studies reporting the association between the gut microbiome and cognition in 395 participants with PD were included. Studies provided preliminary evidence of a relationship between cognition and gut microbiota within the <i>Bacteroidetes</i> and <i>Firmicutes</i> phyla, however, associations with specific genera were inconsistent across studies.Some species of short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria (e.g. acetate, butyrate, and propionate producers) appear to be reduced in participants with PD with cognitive impairment.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder, and the microbiota-gut-brain axis might be the potential mechanism in the pathogenesis and development of PD. The results obtained in this study demonstrated that oral pretreatments of CA significantly prevented the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced motor dysfunctions and death of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons along with the inhibition of glial hyperactivation and the increment in striatal neurotrophins. 16S rRNA sequence results showed that CA significantly reduced MPTP-induced microbial dysbiosis and partially restored the composition of the gut microbiota to normal, including decreased phylum <i>Bacteroidetes</i> and genera <i>Parabacteroide</i>, as well as increased phylum <i>Firmicutes</i>, genera <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Ruminiclostridium</i>. Besides, CA promoted colonic epithelial integrity and restored normal SCFA production. We also observed that proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-Î± and IL-1Î² in the serum, striatum and colon were reduced by CA, indicating that CA prevented neuroinflammation and gut inflammation, in which the suppression of the TLR4/MyD88/NF-ÎºB signaling pathway might be the underlying molecular mechanism. These findings demonstrated that CA had neuroprotective effects on MPTP-induced PD mice possibly <i>via</i> modulating the gut microbiota and inhibiting inflammation throughout the brain-gut axis.",Food & function,2022,Ning Wang; Bai-Nian Feng; Bin Hu; Yu-Liang Cheng; Ya-Hui Guo; He Qian

35449203,Plasma branched-chain and aromatic amino acids correlate with the gut microbiota and severity of Parkinson's disease.,"Disturbances of circulating amino acids have been demonstrated in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, there have been no consistent results for branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and aromatic amino acids (AAAs), and related factors have not been explored. We aimed to explore plasma BCAA and AAA profiles in PD patients, and identify their correlations with clinical characteristics and the gut microbiota. Plasma BCAA (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) and AAA (tyrosine and phenylalanine) levels were measured in 106 PD patients and 114 controls. Fecal samples were collected from PD patients for microbiota sequencing and functional analysis. We found that plasma BCAAs and tyrosine were decreased in PD patients. BCAAs and AAAs were correlated with clinical characteristics and microbial taxa, and, in particular, they were negatively correlated with the Hoehn and Yahr stage. Compared with early PD patients, BCAA and AAA levels were even lower, and microbial composition was altered in advanced PD patients. Predictive functional analysis indicated that predicted genes numbers involved in BCAA biosynthesis were lower in advanced PD patients. What's more, the fecal abundances of critical genes (ilvB, ilvC, ilvD, and ilvN) involved in BCAA biosynthesis were reduced and fecal BCAA concentrations were lower in advanced PD patients. In conclusion, the disturbances of plasma BCAAs and AAAs in PD patients may be related to the gut microbiota and exacerbated with PD severity. The microbial amino acid metabolism may serve as a potential mechanistic link.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2022,Yi Zhang; Xiaoqin He; Yiwei Qian; Shaoqing Xu; Chengjun Mo; Zheng Yan; Xiaodong Yang; Qin Xiao
36243356,Emerging insights between gut microbiome dysbiosis and Parkinson's disease: Pathogenic and clinical relevance.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complicated neurodegenerative disease, of which gastrointestinal disturbance appears prior to motor symptoms. Numerous studies have shed light on the roles of gastrointestinal tract and its neural connection to brain in PD pathology. In the past decades, the fields of microbiology and neuroscience have become ever more entwined. The emergence of gut microbiome has been considered as one of the key regulators of gut-brain function. With the advent of multi-omics sequencing techniques, gut microbiome of PD patients has been shown unique characteristics. The resident gut microbiota can exert considerable effects in PD and there are suggestions of a link between gut microbiome dysbiosis and PD progression. In this review, we summarize the latest progresses of gut microbiome dysbiosis in PD pathogenesis, further highlight the clinical relevance of gut microbiota and its metabolites in both the non-motor and motor symptoms of PD. Furthermore, we draw attention to the complex interplay between gut microbiota and PD drugs, with the purpose of improving drug efficacy and prescription accordingly. Further studies at specific strain level and longitudinal prospective clinical trials using optimized methods are still needed for the development of diagnostic markers and novel therapeutic regimens for PD.",Ageing research reviews,2022,Mingxia Bi; Lijuan Feng; Jiahui He; Chang Liu; Yulin Wang; Hong Jiang; Shuang-Jiang Liu
36257595,Gut microbiota manipulation as an epilepsy treatment.,"Many studies have documented the important role of the gut microbiota (GM) in the regulation of several central nervous system (CNS) processes through the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis. This latter represents the connection between the CNS, the enteric nervous system, the gut and its microbiota through several ascending and descending pathways. The variation of the GM composition is associated with the pathogenesis and/or progression as well as severity of various neuropsychiatric/neurological diseases such as depression, autism spectrum disorder, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's diseases. Recently, changes in the bacterial composition of the GM have also been linked to epilepsy and seizures, with some studies exploring the potential role of GM in the regulation of neuronal hyperexcitability, seizure occurrence and epileptogenesis. Accordingly, there are potential novel treatments which are currently being investigated such as probiotics, prebiotics and symbiotic that may represent innovative therapeutic approaches. The aim of this review is to explore the effect of gut microbiota manipulation as a therapeutic strategy in epilepsy and the methodological challenges to design (translational) clinical trial investigating the gut microbiota.",Neurobiology of disease,2022,Luigi Francesco Iannone; Maria GÃ³mez-EguÃ­laz; Carmen De Caro
35807841,Overlapping Mechanisms of Action of Brain-Active Bacteria and Bacterial Metabolites in the Pathogenesis of Common Brain Diseases.,"The involvement of the gut microbiota and the metabolites of colon-residing bacteria in brain disease pathogenesis has been covered in a growing number of studies, but comparative literature is scarce. To fill this gap, we explored the contribution of the microbiota-gut-brain axis to the pathophysiology of seven brain-related diseases (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, major depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder). In this article, we discussed changes in bacterial abundance and the metabolic implications of these changes on disease development and progression. Our central findings indicate that, mechanistically, all seven diseases are associated with a leaky gut, neuroinflammation, and over-activated microglial cells, to which gut-residing bacteria and their metabolites are important contributors. Patients show a pro-inflammatory shift in their colon microbiota, harbouring more Gram-negative bacteria containing immune-triggering lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in their cell walls. In addition, bacteria with pro-inflammatory properties (<i>Alistipes</i>, <i>Eggerthella</i>, <i>Flavonifractor</i>) are found in higher abundances, whereas lower abundances of anti-inflammatory bacteria (<i>Bifidobacterium</i>, <i>Coprococcus</i>, <i>Eucbacterium</i>, <i>Eubacterium rectale</i>, <i>Faecalibacterium</i>, <i>Faecalibacterium prasunitzii</i>, <i>Lactobacillus</i>, <i>Prevotella</i>, <i>Roseburia</i>) are reported, when compared to healthy controls. On the metabolite level, aberrant levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are involved in disease pathogenesis and are mostly found in lower quantities. Moreover, bacterial metabolites such as neurotransmitters (acetylcholine, dopamine, noradrenaline, GABA, glutamate, serotonin) or amino acids (phenylalanine, tryptophan) also play an important role. In the future, defined aberrations in the abundance of bacteria strains and altered bacterial metabolite levels could likely be possible markers for disease diagnostics and follow-ups. Moreover, they could help to identify novel treatment options, underlining the necessity for a deeper understanding of the microbiota-gut-brain axis.",Nutrients,2022,Tanja Patricia Eicher; M Hasan Mohajeri
35225349,Rethinking Parkinson Disease: Exploring Gut-Brain Interactions and the Potential Role of Exercise.,"Although Parkinson disease (PD) has traditionally been considered a disease of the central nervous system, a bidirectional communication system known as the gut-brain axis can influence PD pathogenesis. The dual-hit hypothesis proposed that PD is due to peripheral dysregulations to the gut microbiota, known as dysbiosis. Since then, further investigation has shown that there are multiple pathological sources associated with PD. However, dysbiosis plays a critical role in the disease process. Substantial evidence has identified that cardinal motor symptoms of PD and disease progression are associated with dysbiosis. In other neurodegenerative disorders, dysbiosis has been linked to cognition. Non-PD research has shown that exercise can effectively restore the gut microbiota. Likewise, exercise has become a well-established strategy to improve cognitive and motor function in PD. However, despite the interaction between the gut and brain, and the exercise benefits on gut health, no research to date has considered the effects of exercise on the gut microbiota in PD. Therefore, the purpose of this Perspective is to explore whether exercise benefits observed in PD could partly be due to restorations to the gut microbiota. First, we will review the gut-brain axis and its influence on motor and cognitive function. Next, we will outline evidence regarding exercise-induced restoration of the gut microbiota in non-PD populations. Finally, we will summarize benefits of exercise on motor-cognitive function in PD, proposing that benefits of exercise seen in PD might actually be due to restorations to the gut microbiota. By positing the gut microbiota as a moderator of exercise improvements to motor and cognitive function, we aim to provide a new perspective for physical therapists to prioritize exercise regimens for individuals with PD that can specifically restore the gut microbiota to better improve PD symptoms and prognosis.This Perspective raises awareness that dysregulations to the gut microbiota have recently been attributed to PD symptoms and pathology and that exercise can be an effective therapeutic strategy to improve gut health in individuals with PD.People with PD have been found to have reduced microbial diversity in their gut, which can play an important role in the progression of the disease. Physical therapists can design therapeutic exercises that might help improve gut health in people with PD.",Physical therapy,2022,Kaylie Zapanta; E Todd Schroeder; Beth E Fisher
36034146,The relationship between Parkinson's disease and gastrointestinal diseases.,"An increasing number of studies have provided evidence for the hypothesis that the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) may derive from the gut. Firstly, Lewy pathology can be induced in the enteric nervous system (ENS) and be transported to the central nervous system (CNS) via the vagal nerve. Secondly, the altered composition of gut microbiota causes an imbalance between beneficial and deleterious microbial metabolites which interacts with the increased gut permeability and the gut inflammation as well as the systemic inflammation. The activated inflammatory status then affects the CNS and promotes the pathology of PD. Given the above-mentioned findings, researchers start to pay attention to the connection between PD and gastrointestinal diseases including irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), microscopic colitis (MC), gastrointestinal infections, gastrointestinal neoplasms, and colonic diverticular disease (CDD). This review focuses on the association between PD and gastrointestinal diseases as well as the pathogenesis of PD from the gut.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2022,Jiaqi Zeng; Xinchan Wang; Fei Pan; Zhiqi Mao
37693045,Neuroprotective effects of an engineered <i>Escherichia coli</i> Nissle 1917 on Parkinson's disease in mice by delivering GLP-1 and modulating gut microbiota.,"Considerable evidence suggests that insulin resistance is closely linked to Parkinson's disease (PD), leading to agents aiming at treating diabetes can be regarded as new neuroprotective strategies in PD, notably glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). However, the extremely short half-life of GLP-1 due to degradation by the ubiquitous proteolytic enzyme limits its clinical application. In this study, we engineered the recombinant integrant probiotic strain <i>Escherichia coli</i> Nissle 1917 (EcN) to create a strain EcN-GLP-1 that effectively delivers the heterologous GLP-1 molecule. Subsequently, we assessed its neuroprotective effects on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mice. We demonstrated that EcN-GLP-1 treatment could improve motor deficits, increase tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons, suppress microglia and astrocyte activation, reduce brain and colon inflammation, and ameliorate colonic barrier function damaged by MPTP induction. Meanwhile, we confirmed that the oral administration of EcN-GLP-1 could restore the disturbance of gut microbiota in the MPTP-induced PD mice, by reducing the relative abundances of <i>Akkermansia</i> and <i>Oscillospira</i>, and increasing the level of <i>Prevotella</i> in the gut. These results support further development of an engineered probiotic platform in which production of GLP-1 for gut-brain disorders, such as PD.",Bioengineering & translational medicine,2023,Heng Wu; Jing Wei; Xiumiao Zhao; Ying Liu; Zhihang Chen; Kehong Wei; Jiachen Lu; Wenjie Chen; Meixiu Jiang; Shengjie Li; Tingtao Chen
36182642,Gut-oriented disease modifying therapy for Parkinson's disease.,"Neuropathology studies have shown that the pathognomonic feature of Parkinson's disease (PD), one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders, may start from the gut enteric nervous system and then spread to the central dopaminergic neurons through the gut-brain axis. With the advent of metagenomic sequencing and metabolomic analysis, a plethora of evidence has revealed different gut microbiomes and gut metabolites in patients with PD compared with unaffected controls. Currently, although dopaminergic treatments and deep brain stimulation can provide some symptomatic benefits for motor symptoms of the disease, their long-term use is problematic. A mechanism-targeted therapy to halt the neurodegeneration is lacking. The recently observed gut microenvironmental changes in the early stages of the disease play a vital role in the PD pathogenesis. Patients whose disease begins in the gut may benefit most from interventions that target the gut microenvironments. In this review, we will summarize the current studies demonstrating multifunctional roles of gut microbiota in the gut-brain axis of PD and the currently available evidence for targeting the gut microbiota as a novel approach to potential disease-modifying therapy in PD.",Journal of the Formosan Medical Association = Taiwan yi zhi,2023,Chin-Hsien Lin; Hsin-Chih Lai; Ming-Shiang Wu
35463646,"A Pilot Study Exploring the Association of Entacapone, Gut Microbiota, and the Subsequent Side Effects in Patients With Parkinson's Disease.","Entacapone, one of the most common drugs distributed among patients with Parkinson's disease, is a peripherally acting catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor that is used in addition to levodopa to control symptoms. However, there have been negative effects reported against entacapone, namely, gastrointestinal (GI) problems and drowsiness. In this pilot study, we aim to examine the hypothesis that the discomfort induced by entacapone might be originated from the shift of microbial composition by adjusting the effect of levodopa.The population in this pilot study consisted of 13 PD patients treated with levodopa only and 11 with both levodopa and entacapone. The 16S rRNA gene sequence data were processed, aligned, and categorized using the DADA2. Alpha diversity indices for Observed, Chao1, Shannon, and Simpson metrics were calculated with Phyloseq 1.32.0. Dissimilarities were calculated using unweighted unique fraction metrics (Unifrac), weighted Unifrac, and Canberra distance. Functional differences were calculated by PICRUSt2 based on the KEGG database.Results of 16S rRNA sequencing analysis showed that while entacapone did not influence the species richness, the composition of the microbial community shifted considerably. Relative abundances of bacteria related to constipation and other GI disorders also altered significantly. Functional enrichment analysis revealed changes in the metabolic activity of alanine, aspartate, and glutamate. These amino acids are related to common side effects of entacapone such as auditory hallucinations, fatigue, and nightmare.Our findings provide testable hypothesis on the cause of unpleasant side effects of entacapone, which in the long run could possibly be reduced through gut microbiota manipulation.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2022,Shih-Chen Fu; Chung-Han Lee; Yi-Chen Hsieh; Pei-Hua Wu; Sheng-Hsuan Lin; Hsiuying Wang
36140158,Microbiota Dysbiosis in Parkinson Disease-In Search of a Biomarker.,"Numerous studies have highlighted the role of the gastrointestinal system in Parkinson disease pathogenesis. It is likely triggered by proinflammatory markers produced by specific gut bacteria. This review's aim is to identify gut bacterial biomarkers of Parkinson disease. A comprehensive search for original research papers on gut microbiota composition in Parkinson disease was conducted using the PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases. Research papers on intestinal permeability, nasal and oral microbiomes, and interventional studies were excluded. The yielded results were categorized into four groups: Parkinson disease vs. healthy controls; disease severity; non-motor symptoms; and clinical phenotypes. This review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA 2020 statement. A total of 51 studies met the eligibility criteria. In the Parkinson disease vs. healthy controls group, 22 bacteria were deemed potentially important. In the disease severity category, two bacteria were distinguished. In the non-motor symptoms and clinical phenotypes categories, no distinct pathogen was identified. The studies in this review report bacteria of varying taxonomic levels, which prevents the authors from reaching a clear conclusion. Future research should follow a unified methodology in order to identify potential biomarkers for Parkinson disease.",Biomedicines,2022,Julia Maya Nowak; Mateusz KopczyÅski; Andrzej Friedman; Dariusz Koziorowski; Monika Figura
35677440,Gut Microbial Dysbiosis and Cognitive Impairment in Bipolar Disorder: Current Evidence.,"Recent studies have reported that the gut microbiota influences mood and cognitive function through the gut-brain axis, which is involved in the pathophysiology of neurocognitive and mental disorders, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia. These disorders have similar pathophysiology to that of cognitive dysfunction in bipolar disorder (BD), including neuroinflammation and dysregulation of various neurotransmitters (i.e., serotonin and dopamine). There is also emerging evidence of alterations in the gut microbial composition of patients with BD, suggesting that gut microbial dysbiosis contributes to disease progression and cognitive impairment in BD. Therefore, microbiota-centered treatment might be an effective adjuvant therapy for BD-related cognitive impairment. Given that studies focusing on connections between the gut microbiota and BD-related cognitive impairment are lagging behind those on other neurocognitive disorders, this review sought to explore the potential mechanisms of how gut microbial dysbiosis affects cognitive function in BD and identify potential microbiota-centered treatment.",Frontiers in pharmacology,2022,Wenyu Dai; Jieyu Liu; Yan Qiu; Ziwei Teng; Sujuan Li; Hui Yuan; Jing Huang; Hui Xiang; Hui Tang; Bolun Wang; Jindong Chen; Haishan Wu
36458227,Modulating the Gut Microbiota as a Therapeutic Intervention for Alzheimer's Disease.,"Growing evidence suggested that the change of composition and proportion of intestinal microbiota may be related to many diseases, such as irritable bowel syndrome, bipolar disorder, Parkinson's disease, as well as Alzheimer's disease. Current literature supports the fact that unbalanced gut microbial composition (gut dysbiosis) is a risk factor for AD. In our review, we briefly sum up the recent progress regarding the correlations between the gut microbiota and AD. Therapeutic interventions capable of modulating the make-up of the gut microflora may exert beneficial effects on AD, preventing or delaying the beginning of AD or counteracting its development. Additionally, well-documented approaches that can positively influence AD may exert their beneficial effects through modifying the gut microbiota. Therefore, other novel interventions which can target on gut microbiota will also be potential therapies for AD. The chances and challenges that AD is confronted with in the research field of microbiomics are also discussed in this review.",Indian journal of microbiology,2022,Mingli Liu; Ping Zhong
35076270,Parkinson's Disease Medication Alters Small Intestinal Motility and Microbiota Composition in Healthy Rats.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is known to be associated with altered gastrointestinal function and microbiota composition. To date, the effect of PD medication on the gastrointestinal function and microbiota, at the site of drug absorption, the small intestine, has not been studied, although it may represent an important confounder in reported microbiota alterations observed in PD patients. To this end, healthy (non-PD) wild-type Groningen rats were employed and treated with dopamine, pramipexole (in combination with levodopa-carbidopa), or ropinirole (in combination with levodopa-carbidopa) for 14 sequential days. Rats treated with dopamine agonists showed a significant reduction in small intestinal motility and an increase in bacterial overgrowth in the distal small intestine. Notably, significant alterations in microbial taxa were observed between the treated and vehicle groups; analogous to the changes previously reported in human PD versus healthy control microbiota studies. These microbial changes included an increase in <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Bifidobacterium</i> and a decrease in <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> and <i>Prevotellaceae</i>. Markedly, certain <i>Lactobacillus</i> species correlated negatively with levodopa levels in the systemic circulation, potentially affecting the bioavailability of levodopa. Overall, the study highlights a significant effect of PD medication intrinsically on disease-associated comorbidities, including gastrointestinal dysfunction and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, as well as the gut microbiota composition. The results urge future studies to take into account the influence of PD medication <i>per se</i> when seeking to identify microbiota-related biomarkers for PD. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder and is known to be associated with altered gastrointestinal function and microbiota composition. We previously showed that the gut bacteria harboring tyrosine decarboxylase enzymes interfere with levodopa, the main treatment for PD (S. P. van Kessel, A. K. Frye, A. O. El-Gendy, M. Castejon, A. Keshavarzian, G. van Dijk, and S. El Aidy, Nat Commun 10:310, 2019). Although PD medication could be an important confounder in the reported alterations, its effect, apart from the disease itself, on the microbiota composition or the gastrointestinal function at the site of drug absorption, the small intestine, has not been studied. The findings presented here show a significant impact of commonly prescribed PD medication on the small intestinal motility, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, and microbiota composition, irrespective of the PD. Remarkably, we observed negative associations between bacterial species harboring tyrosine decarboxylase activity and levodopa levels in the systemic circulation, potentially affecting the bioavailability of levodopa. Overall, this study shows that PD medication is an important factor in determining gastrointestinal motility and, in turn, microbiota composition and may, partly, explain the differential abundant taxa previously reported in the cross-sectional PD microbiota human studies. The results urge future studies to take into account the influence of PD medication on gut motility and microbiota composition when seeking to identify microbiota-related biomarkers for PD.",mSystems,2022,Sebastiaan P van Kessel; Amber Bullock; Gertjan van Dijk; Sahar El Aidy
36365188,Membrane Vesicles Derived from Gut Microbiota and Probiotics: Cutting-Edge Therapeutic Approaches for Multidrug-Resistant Superbugs Linked to Neurological Anomalies.,"Multidrug-resistant (MDR) superbugs can breach the blood-brain barrier (BBB), leading to a continuous barrage of pro-inflammatory modulators and induction of severe infection-related pathologies, including meningitis and brain abscess. Both broad-spectrum or species-specific antibiotics (Î²-lactamase inhibitors, polymyxins, vancomycin, meropenem, plazomicin, and sarecycline) and biocompatible poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles have been used to treat these infections. However, new therapeutic platforms with a broad impact that do not exert off-target deleterious effects are needed. Membrane vesicles or extracellular vesicles (EVs) are lipid bilayer-enclosed particles with therapeutic potential owing to their ability to circumvent BBB constraints. Bacteria-derived EVs (bEVs) from gut microbiota are efficient transporters that can penetrate the central nervous system. In fact, bEVs can be remodeled via surface modification and CRISPR/Cas editing and, thus, represent a novel platform for conferring protection against infections breaching the BBB. Here, we discuss the latest scientific research related to gut microbiota- and probiotic-derived bEVs, and their therapeutic modifications, in terms of regulating neurotransmitters and inhibiting quorum sensing, for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. We also emphasize the benefits of probiotic-derived bEVs to human health and propose a novel direction for the development of innovative heterologous expression systems to combat BBB-crossing pathogens.",Pharmaceutics,2022,Prakhar Srivastava; Kwang-Sun Kim
35263739,Is There Any Link between Cognitive Impairment and Gut Microbiota?

Growing evidence in recent years has indicated the association between the brain and gut microbiota, which has been described as the ""gut-brain axis."" This systematic review seeks to summarize the primary results from recent human and animal studies regarding the alteration of gut microbiota composition in cognitive disorders.A systematic literature search was conducted on PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases up to August 2020. The full texts of the papers were analyzed to retrieve the relevant information.Totally, 24 observational studies (14 animal and 13 human studies) were included. Most of the animal studies were performed on mouse models of AD. Human studies were conducted on patients with Parkinson's disease (3 studies), AD (4 studies), poststroke cognitive impairment patients (1 study), and patients with mild to severe cognitive impairment without mention to the cause of disease (5 studies). More recent evidence suggests that throughout aging Firmicutes and Bifidobacteria decrease but Proteobacteria increases.The gut microbiota may alter brain function or trigger various psychiatric conditions through the gut-brain axis.

35611932,Urolithins: potential biomarkers of gut dysbiosis and disease stage in Parkinson's patients.,"Gut microbiota alteration (gut dysbiosis) occurs during the onset and progression of Parkinson's disease. Gut dysbiosis biomarkers could be relevant to prodromal disease. Urolithins, anti-inflammatory metabolites produced from some dietary polyphenols by specific gut microbial ecologies (urolithin metabotypes), have been proposed as biomarkers of gut microbiota composition and functionality. However, this has not been explored in Parkinson's disease patients. The current study aimed to assess associations between urolithin metabotypes, gut dysbiosis and disease severity in Parkinson's disease patients. Participants (52 patients and 117 healthy controls) provided stool samples for microbiota sequencing and urine samples for urolithin profiling before and after consuming 30 g of walnuts for three days. Data on demographics, medication, disease duration and Hoehn and Yahr disease stage were collected. We observed a significant gradual increase of urolithin non-producers (metabotype-0) as the disease severity increased. The gut microbiome of metabotype-0 patients and patients with the greatest severity was characterized by a more altered bacterial composition, <i>i.e.</i>, increased pro-inflammatory Enterobacteriaceae and reduced protective bacteria against autoimmune and inflammatory processes, including butyrate and urolithin-producing bacteria (Lachnospiraceae members and <i>Gordonibacter</i>). Besides, their microbiome was characterized by predictive functions of lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and metabolism of glutathione, cysteine and methionine that could indirectly reflect the gut pro-inflammatory status. Urolithin detection in urine is a feasible, non-invasive and fast approach that can reflect gut microbiome dysbiosis and intestinal inflammation in Parkinson's disease patients. Our current study could provide novel strategies for improving diagnostics, and for preventing and treating disease progression in microbiota-based interventions.",Food & function,2022,MarÃ­a Romo-Vaquero; Emiliano FernÃ¡ndez-Villalba; Ana-Luisa Gil-Martinez; Lorena Cuenca-Bermejo; Juan Carlos EspÃ­n; MarÃ­a Trinidad Herrero; MarÃ­a Victoria Selma
35889124,"Nasal Microbiota, Olfactory Health, Neurological Disorders and Aging-A Review.","The nasal region is one of the distinct environments for the survival of various microbiota. The human microbial niche begins to inhabit the human body right from birth, and the microbiota survive as commensals or opportunistic pathogens throughout the life of humans in their bodies in various habitats. These microbial communities help to maintain a healthy microenvironment by preventing the attack of pathogens and being involved in immune regulation. Any dysbiosis of microbiota residing in the mucosal surfaces, such as the nasal passages, guts, and genital regions, causes immune modulation and severe infections. The coexistence of microorganisms in the mucosal layers of respiratory passage, resulting in infections due to their co-abundance and interactions, and the background molecular mechanisms responsible for such interactions, need to be considered for investigation. Additional clinical evaluations can explain the interactions among the nasal microbiota, nasal dysbiosis and neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). The respiratory airways usually act as a substratum place for the microbes and can act as the base for respiratory tract infections. The microbial metabolites and the microbes can cross the blood-brain barrier and may cause NDs, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). The scientific investigations on the potential role of the nasal microbiota in olfactory functions and the relationship between their dysfunction and neurological diseases are limited. Recently, the consequences of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in patients with neurological diseases are under exploration. The crosstalk between the gut and the nasal microbiota is highly influential, because their mucosal regions are the prominent microbial niche and are connected to the olfaction, immune regulation, and homeostasis of the central nervous system. Diet is one of the major factors, which strongly influences the mucosal membranes of the airways, gut, and lung. Unhealthy diet practices cause dysbiosis in gut microbiota and the mucosal barrier. The current review summarizes the interrelationship between the nasal microbiota dysbiosis, resulting olfactory dysfunctions, and the progression of NDs during aging and the involvement of coronavirus disease 2019 in provoking the NDs.",Microorganisms,2022,Subramanian Thangaleela; Bhagavathi Sundaram Sivamaruthi; Periyanaina Kesika; Muruganantham Bharathi; Chaiyavat Chaiyasut
36013962,"Role of the Gut-Brain Axis, Gut Microbial Composition, Diet, and Probiotic Intervention in Parkinson's Disease.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second-most prevalent neurodegenerative or neuropsychiatric disease, affecting 1% of seniors worldwide. The gut microbiota (GM) is one of the key access controls for most diseases and disorders. Disturbance in the GM creates an imbalance in the function and circulation of metabolites, resulting in unhealthy conditions. Any dysbiosis could affect the function of the gut, consequently disturbing the equilibrium in the intestine, and provoking pro-inflammatory conditions in the gut lumen, which send signals to the central nervous system (CNS) through the vagus enteric nervous system, possibly disturbing the blood-brain barrier. The neuroinflammatory conditions in the brain cause accumulation of Î±-syn, and progressively develop PD. An important aspect of understanding and treating the disease is access to broad knowledge about the influence of dietary supplements on GM. Probiotics are live microorganisms which, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host. Probiotic supplementation improves the function of the CNS, and improves the motor and non-motor symptoms of PD. Probiotic supplementation could be an adjuvant therapeutic method to manage PD. This review summarizes the role of GM in health, the GM-brain axis, the pathogenesis of PD, the role of GM and diet in PD, and the influence of probiotic supplementation on PD. The study encourages further detailed clinical trials in PD patients with probiotics, which aids in determining the involvement of GM, intestinal mediators, and neurological mediators in the treatment or management of PD.",Microorganisms,2022,Subramanian Thangaleela; Bhagavathi Sundaram Sivamaruthi; Periyanaina Kesika; Muruganantham Bharathi; Chaiyavat Chaiyasut
36619150,Gut Microbiota Modification via Glucagon-like Peptide-1 with Beneficial Neuroprotective Effects.,"<b>BACKGROUND</b>: In recent decades, it has been shown that the association between intestinal bacterial imbalance (dysbiosis) and various diseases such as type 2 diabetes can play a role in the development of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. In this study, the beneficial effects of intestinal microbiota glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) in cognitive disorders were investigated. <b>METHODS</b>: PubMed-Medline, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched to identify experimental studies based on the bacterial strains along with GLP-1 1 expression in preventing or reducing cognitive impairment. Of the 233 studies, six were eligible for inclusion, and the Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) risk of bias tool was used to evaluate the risk of bias in individual studies. <b>RESULTS</b>: The results showed that intestinal expression of GLP-1 1 could reduce the intestinal pathogenic genus such as <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> and was obviously associated with a greater number of beneficial genera such as <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Akkermansia</i>. Also, the neuroprotective effects of <i>Clostridium butyricum</i> with GLP-1 1 in a mice were approved. Therefore, the modulation of the intestinal microbiota, mediated by an increase in the intestinal GLP-1 1 level, consequently improved cognitive function. <b>CONCLUSION</b>: In this review, we have indicated that the gut microbiota, by stimulating the expression of the intestinal hormones like GLP-1 1, and also with a beneficial effect in inhibiting some involved genes in inflammation, can declined the development of cognitive disorders.",Middle East journal of digestive diseases,2022,Fatemeh Sayehmiri; Mohammad Samadian; Ashraf Mohamadkhani; Abbas Tafakhori; Somayeh Haghighat; Aryoobarzan Rahmatian; Mohammad Ali Mohammadkhani; Hamid Reza Fazli; Mostafa Rezaei Tavirani
36355147,Dysbiosis of Gut Microbiota from the Perspective of the Gut-Brain Axis: Role in the Provocation of Neurological Disorders.,"The gut-brain axis is a bidirectional communication network connecting the gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system. The axis keeps track of gastrointestinal activities and integrates them to connect gut health to higher cognitive parts of the brain. Disruption in this connection may facilitate various neurological and gastrointestinal problems. Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the progressive dysfunction of specific populations of neurons, determining clinical presentation. Misfolded protein aggregates that cause cellular toxicity and that aid in the collapse of cellular proteostasis are a defining characteristic of neurodegenerative proteinopathies. These disorders are not only caused by changes in the neural compartment but also due to other factors of non-neural origin. Mounting data reveal that the majority of gastrointestinal (GI) physiologies and mechanics are governed by the central nervous system (CNS). Furthermore, the gut microbiota plays a critical role in the regulation and physiological function of the brain, although the mechanism involved has not yet been fully interpreted. One of the emerging explanations of the start and progression of many neurodegenerative illnesses is dysbiosis of the gut microbial makeup. The present understanding of the literature surrounding the relationship between intestinal dysbiosis and the emergence of certain neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and multiple sclerosis, is the main emphasis of this review. The potential entry pathway of the pathogen-associated secretions and toxins into the CNS compartment has been explored in this article at the outset of neuropathology. We have also included the possible mechanism of undelaying the synergistic effect of infections, their metabolites, and other interactions based on the current understanding.",Metabolites,2022,Meenakshi Kandpal; Omkar Indari; Budhadev Baral; Shweta Jakhmola; Deeksha Tiwari; Vasundhra Bhandari; Rajan Kumar Pandey; Kiran Bala; Avinash Sonawane; Hem Chandra Jha
35895243,Role of the gut-microbiota-metabolite axis in the rotenone model of early-stage Parkinson's Disease.,"Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in the early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD), but its potential pathogenesis remains unclear. Therefore, in the present study, we used the 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry-based metabolomics to investigate the alterations of gut microbiome and serum amino acid levels in the early-stage PD mice model induced with rotenone. The results demonstrated that the microbial taxa at phylum, family and genus levels remarkably altered in rotenone-induced mice relative to vehicle-induced mice. The rotenone-induced mice had higher relative abundance of Flavobacteriaceae, Staphylococcaceae, and Prevotellaceae as well as lower relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae_UCG-001, Ruminiclostridium, and Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group than vehicle-induced mice. The evaluation of serum amino acids revealed the alterations in several classes of amino acids, including L-proline, L-alanine, L-serine, L-asparagine, L-threonine, L-glutamine, L-methionine, and L-4-hydroxyproline. Notably, the altered serum amino acid levels were significantly associated with the abundance of gut microbiota, especially Ruminococcaceae and Ruminiclostridium. Our study explored the possible role of the gut-microbiota-metabolite axis in the early-stage PD and provided the possibility of prevention and treatment of PD by gut-microbiota-metabolite axis in the future.",Metabolic brain disease,2022,Zhenzhen Yan; Ruihua Li; Wanying Shi; Lifen Yao
36361826,Molecular and Cellular Interactions in Pathogenesis of Sporadic Parkinson Disease.,"An increasing number of the population all around the world suffer from age-associated neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease (PD). This disorder presents different signs of genetic, epigenetic and environmental origin, and molecular, cellular and intracellular dysfunction. At the molecular level, Î±-synuclein (Î±Syn) was identified as the principal molecule constituting the Lewy bodies (LB). The gut microbiota participates in the pathogenesis of PD and may contribute to the loss of dopaminergic neurons through mitochondrial dysfunction. The most important pathogenetic link is an imbalance of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, which is associated with redox imbalance in the cells and increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this review, genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors that cause these disorders and their cause-and-effect relationships are considered. As a constituent of environmental factors, the example of organophosphates (OPs) is also reviewed. The role of endothelial damage in the pathogenesis of PD is discussed, and a 'triple hit hypothesis' is proposed as a modification of Braak's dual hit one. In the absence of effective therapies for neurodegenerative diseases, more and more evidence is emerging about the positive impact of nutritional structure and healthy lifestyle on the state of blood vessels and the risk of developing these diseases.",International journal of molecular sciences,2022,Lyudmila P Dolgacheva; Valery P Zinchenko; Nikolay V Goncharov
36494405,Gut microbiota in dementia with Lewy bodies.,"Gut microbiota and fecal bile acids were analyzed in 278 patients with Î±-synucleinopathies, which were comprised of 28 patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), 224 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), and 26 patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD). Similarly to PD, short-chain fatty acids-producing genera were decreased in DLB. Additionally, Ruminococcus torques and Collinsella were increased in DLB, which were not changed in PD. Random forest models to differentiate DLB and PD showed that high Ruminococcus torques and high Collinsella, which presumably increase intestinal permeability, as well as low Bifidobacterium, which are also observed in Alzheimer's disease, were predictive of DLB. As Ruminococcus torques and Collinsella are also major secondary bile acids-producing bacteria, we quantified fecal bile acids and found that the production of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) was high in DLB. Increased UDCA in DLB may mitigate neuroinflammation at the substantia nigra, whereas neuroinflammation may not be critical at the neocortex. Theraeutic intervention to increase Bifidobacteirum and its metabolites may retard the development and progression of DLB.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2022,Hiroshi Nishiwaki; Jun Ueyama; Kenichi Kashihara; Mikako Ito; Tomonari Hamaguchi; Tetsuya Maeda; Yoshio Tsuboi; Masahisa Katsuno; Masaaki Hirayama; Kinji Ohno
36406865,Gut Microbiota Alternation in Disease Progression of Neurosyphilis.,"The gut microbiota plays an important role in the development of neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. However, studies on the gut microbiota of patients with neurosyphilis (NS) were rarely reported.In this study, we collected fecal samples from 62 syphilis patients, including 39 with NS and 23 with non-NS. Among the NS patients, 18 were general paresis (GP). The white blood cell counts, protein concentrations, and Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test positive rates of cerebrospinal fluid from patients in NS or GP group were significantly higher than those from patients in non-NS group. 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing results revealed that the alpha and beta diversities of the gut microbiota were similar between NS and non-NS patients or GP and non-NS patients.Linear discriminant analysis with effect size (LEfSe) analysis showed that some taxa, such as <i>Coprobacter</i>, were increased in both NS group and GP group, compared with non-NS group. Besides, the clade of <i>Akkermansia</i> was also overrepresented in GP Patients. Meanwhile, some taxa such as <i>Clostridia_UCG-014</i> and <i>SC-I-84</i> were underrepresented in NS patients. The abundances of class <i>Bacilli</i> and genus <i>Alloprevotella</i> were decreased in GP patients. Among them, the abundances of some taxa such as <i>Coprobacter</i> and <i>Akkermansia</i> have been reported to be associated with other neuropsychiatric disorders.Our findings suggest that the alternation of the gut microbiota in NS patients may contribute to the course of NS, which will deepen our understanding of NS.",Infection and drug resistance,2022,Guixuan Wang; Danyang Zou; Xinying Lu; Xin Gu; Yuanyuan Cheng; Tengfei Qi; Yanchun Cheng; Junjun Yu; Meiping Ye; Pingyu Zhou
36543925,Helicobacter hepaticus augmentation triggers Dopaminergic degeneration and motor disorders in mice with Parkinson's disease.,"Gut dysbiosis contributes to Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis. Gastrointestinal disturbances in PD patients, along with gut leakage and intestinal inflammation, take place long before motor disorders. However, it remains unknown what bacterial species in gut microbiomes play the key role in driving PD pathogenesis. Here we show that Helicobacter hepaticus (H. hepaticus), abundant in gut microbiota from rotenone-treated human Î±-Synuclein gene (SNCA) transgenic mice and PD patients, initiates Î±-Synuclein pathology and motor deficits in an AEP-dependent manner in SNCA mice. Chronic Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) treatment, an inflammatory inducer in the gut, activates AEP (asparagine endopeptidase) that cleaves Î±-Synuclein N103 and triggers its aggregation, promoting inflammation in the gut and the brain and motor defects in SNCA mice. PD fecal microbiota transplant or live H. hepaticus administration into antibiotics cocktail (Abx)-pretreated SNCA mice induces Î±-Synuclein pathology, inflammation in the gut and brain, and motor dysfunctions, for which AEP is indispensable. Hence, Helicobacter hepaticus enriched in PD gut microbiomes may facilitate Î±-Synuclein pathologies and motor impairments via activating AEP.",Molecular psychiatry,2023,Eun Hee Ahn; Xia Liu; Ashfaqul M Alam; Seong Su Kang; Keqiang Ye
35337376,Shedding light on biological sex differences and microbiota-gut-brain axis: a comprehensive review of its roles in neuropsychiatric disorders.,"Women and men are suggested to have differences in vulnerability to neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), schizophrenia, eating disorders, including anorexia nervosa, and bulimia nervosa, neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease. Genetic factors and sex hormones are apparently the main mediators of these differences. Recent evidence uncovers that reciprocal interactions between sex-related features (e.g., sex hormones and sex differences in the brain) and gut microbiota could play a role in the development of neuropsychiatric disorders via influencing the gut-brain axis. It is increasingly evident that sex-microbiota-brain interactions take part in the occurrence of neurologic and psychiatric disorders. Accordingly, integrating the existing evidence might help to enlighten the fundamental roles of these interactions in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders. In addition, an increased understanding of the biological sex differences on the microbiota-brain may lead to advances in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders and increase the potential for precision medicine. This review discusses the effects of sex differences on the brain and gut microbiota and the putative underlying mechanisms of action. Additionally, we discuss the consequences of interactions between sex differences and gut microbiota on the emergence of particular neuropsychiatric disorders.",Biology of sex differences,2022,Parnian Shobeiri; Amirali Kalantari; AntÃ´nio L Teixeira; Nima Rezaei
35275538,The Oral and Fecal Microbiota in a Canadian Cohort of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Despite decades of research, our understanding of Alzheimer's disease (AD) etiology remains incomplete. InÂ recent years, appreciation has grown for potential roles for the microbiota in shaping neurological health.This study aimed to examine associations between the microbiota and AD in a human cross-sectional cohort.Forty-five AD patients and 54 matched controls were recruited in Vancouver, Canada. Fecal and oral samples underwent 16S microbiota sequencing. A wide array of demographic and clinical data were collected. Differences between participant groups were assessed, and associations between microbes and clinical variables were examined within the AD population.The gut microbiota of AD patients displayed lower diversity relative to controls, although taxonomic differences were sparse. In contrast, the AD oral microbiota displayed higher diversity, with several taxonomic differences relative to controls, including a lower abundance of the families Streptococcaceae and Actinomycetaceae, and a higher abundance of Weeksellaceae, among others. The periodontitis-associated oral microbe Porphyromonas gingivalis was 5 times more prevalent among patients. No significant associations between gut or oral microbes and cognition were detected, but several correlations existed between microbes and mood disorders and BMI among patients, including a strong positive correlation between Alphaproteobacteria and depression score.The gut microbiota of AD patients was not overtly different from controls, although it displayed lower diversity, an overall marker of microbiota health. The oral microbiota did display marked differences. Cognition was not associated with a microbial signature, but other relevant AD factors including mood and BMI did demonstrate an association.",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,2022,Mihai S Cirstea; Daniel Kliger; Abbey D MacLellan; Adam C Yu; Jenna Langlois; Mannie Fan; Seti Boroomand; Faezeh Kharazyan; Robin G Y Hsiung; Brian A MacVicar; Howard Chertkow; Victor Whitehead; B Brett Finlay; Silke Appel-Cresswell
35886849,"Impact of Nutrition, Microbiota Transplant and Weight Loss Surgery on Dopaminergic Alterations in Parkinson's Disease and Obesity.","Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disorder worldwide, is characterized by dopaminergic neuron degeneration and Î±-synuclein aggregation in the substantia nigra pars compacta of the midbrain. Emerging evidence has shown that dietary intake affects the microbial composition in the gut, which in turn contributes to, or protects against, the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in affected regions of the brain. More specifically, the Mediterranean diet and Western diet, composed of varying amounts of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats, exert contrasting effects on PD pathophysiology via alterations in the gut microbiota and dopamine levels. Interestingly, the negative changes in the gut microbiota of patients with PD parallel changes that are seen in individuals that consume a Western diet, and are opposite to those that adhere to a Mediterranean diet. In this review, we first examine the role of prominent food groups on dopamine bioavailability, how they modulate the composition and function of the gut microbiota and the subsequent effects on PD and obesity pathophysiology. We then highlight evidence on how microbiota transplant and weight loss surgery can be used as therapeutic tools to restore dopaminergic deficits through optimizing gut microbial composition. In the process, we revisit dietary metabolites and their role in therapeutic approaches involving dopaminergic pathways. Overall, understanding the role of nutrition on dopamine bioavailability and gut microbiota in dopamine-related pathologies such as PD will help develop more precise therapeutic targets to rescue dopaminergic deficits in neurologic and metabolic disorders.",International journal of molecular sciences,2022,Sevag Hamamah; Andras Hajnal; Mihai Covasa
37529095,Influence of aerobic exercise training on mice gut microbiota in Parkinson's disease.,"Accumulating evidence shows that gut microbial dysbiosis may represent a risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD). Exercise has a positive effect on microbiota in general. The effect of aerobic exercise training (AET) on the gut microbial environment in PD remains to be explored. Here, we performed the 16S rRNA gene sequencing on feces from sham operated-mice (sham), PD mice model, and mice receiving AET (AET). Results indicated that AET had no remarkable effect on species richness and bacterial diversity of PD mice. The relative abundance of the <i>Bacteroidetes</i> was reduced, while <i>Firmicutes</i>, <i>Actinobacteria</i>, <i>Lactobacillaceae</i>, <i>Streptococcaceae</i>, <i>Lactobacillus</i>, <i>Streptococcus</i>, <i>Lactococcus</i>, <i>Lysinibacillus</i>, <i>Pelomonas</i>, and <i>Prevotellaceae_UCG-001</i> were increased in PD mice compared with those of sham operated-mice, whereas AET partly rescued their abundance. Additionally, the composition proportion of beneficial <i>Lactobacillus_gasseri</i> and u<i>ncultured_Erysipelotrichales_bacterium</i> significantly increased in AET mice compared to PD mice. Moreover, discriminative bacteria, such as <i>Bacilli</i>, <i>Lactobacillales</i>, <i>Lactobacillaceae</i>, <i>Lactobacillus</i>, and <i>Lactococcus</i> were identified as a specific taxon in AET mice. Here we provide evidence that AET can improve the gut microbiota of PD mice.",Turkish journal of biology = Turk biyoloji dergisi,2022,Tianlun Fan; Xiating Li; Xiang Zhang; Jing Zhang; Lichun Sun; Jingjing Chen; Chuan Fu
35433746,Guts Imbalance Imbalances the Brain: A Review of Gut Microbiota Association With Neurological and Psychiatric Disorders.,"Over the last 10 years, there has been a growing interest in the relationship between gut microbiota, the brain, and neurologic-associated affections. As multiple preclinical and clinical research studies highlight gut microbiota's potential to modulate the general state of health state, it goes without saying that gut microbiota plays a significant role in neurogenesis, mental and cognitive development, emotions, and behaviors, and in the progression of neuropsychiatric illnesses. Gut microbiota produces important biologic products that, through the gut-brain axis, are directly connected with the appearance and evolution of neurological and psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, autism, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy. This study reviews recent research on the link between gut microbiota and the brain, and microbiome's role in shaping the development of the most common neurological and psychiatric illnesses. Moreover, special attention is paid to the use of probiotic formulations as a potential non-invasive therapeutic opportunity for prevention and management of neuropsychiatric-associated affections.",Frontiers in medicine,2022,Laura Mitrea; Silvia-Amalia NemeÅ; Katalin Szabo; Bernadette-EmÅke Teleky; Dan-Cristian Vodnar
35879588,Implication of Paraprobiotics in Age-Associated Gut Dysbiosis and Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, are major age-related concerns in elderly people. Since no drug fully addresses the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, advance treatment strategies are urgently needed. Several studies have noted the senescence of immune system and the perturbation of gut microbiota in the aged population. In recent years, the role of gut microbiota has been increasingly studied in the manifestation of age-related CNS disorders. In this context, prebiotics, probiotics, and paraprobiotics are reported to improve the behavioural and neurobiological abnormalities in elderly patients. As live microbiota, prescribed in the form of probiotics, shows some adverse effects like sepsis, translocation, and horizontal gene transfer, paraprobiotics could be a possible alternative strategy in designing microbiome-based therapeutics.

35897024,Gut microenvironmental changes as a potential trigger in Parkinson's disease through the gut-brain axis.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease attributed to the synergistic effects of genetic risk and environmental stimuli. Although PD is characterized by motor dysfunction resulting from intraneuronal alpha-synuclein accumulations, termed Lewy bodies, and dopaminergic neuronal degeneration in the substantia nigra, multiple systems are involved in the disease process, resulting in heterogenous clinical presentation and progression. Genetic predisposition to PD regarding aberrant immune responses, abnormal protein aggregation, autophagolysosomal impairment, and mitochondrial dysfunction leads to vulnerable neurons that are sensitive to environmental triggers and, together, result in neuronal degeneration. Neuropathology studies have shown that, at least in some patients, Lewy bodies start from the enteric nervous system and then spread to the central dopaminergic neurons through the gut-brain axis, suggesting the contribution of an altered gut microenvironment in the pathogenesis of PD. A plethora of evidence has revealed different gut microbiomes and gut metabolites in patients with PD compared to unaffected controls. Chronic gut inflammation and impaired intestinal barrier integrity have been observed in human PD patients and mouse models of PD. These observations led to the hypothesis that an altered gut microenvironment is a potential trigger of the PD process in a genetically susceptible host. In this review, we will discuss the complex interplay between genetic factors and gut microenvironmental changes contributing to PD pathogenesis.",Journal of biomedical science,2022,Szu-Ju Chen; Chin-Hsien Lin
34982206,Challenges of repurposing tetracyclines for the treatment of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.,"The novel antibiotic-exploiting strategy in the treatment of Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's (PD) disease has emerged as a potential breakthrough in the field. The research in animal AD/PD models provided evidence on the antiamyloidogenic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antiapoptotic activity of tetracyclines, associated with cognitive improvement. The neuroprotective effects of minocycline and doxycycline in animals initiated investigation of their clinical efficacy in AD and PD patients which led to inconclusive results and additionally to insufficient safety data on a long-standing doxycycline and minocycline therapy in these patient populations. The safety issues should be considered in two levels; in AD/PD patients (particularly antibiotic-induced alteration of gut microbiota and its consequences), and as a world-wide threat of development of bacterial resistance to these antibiotics posed by a fact that AD and PD are widespread incurable diseases which require daily administered long-lasting antibiotic therapy. Recently proposed subantimicrobial doxycycline doses should be thoroughly explored for their effectiveness and long-term safety especially in AD/PD populations. Keeping in mind the antibacterial activity-related far-reaching undesirable effects both for the patients and globally, further work on repurposing these drugs for a long-standing therapy of AD/PD should consider the chemically modified tetracycline compounds tailored to lack antimicrobial but retain (or introduce) other activities effective against the AD/PD pathology. This strategy might reduce the risk of long-term therapy-related adverse effects (particularly gut-related ones) and development of bacterial resistance toward the tetracycline antibiotic agents but the therapeutic potential and desirable safety profile of such compounds in AD/PD patients need to be confirmed.","Journal of neural transmission (Vienna, Austria : 1996)",2022,Iva Markulin; Marija Matasin; Viktorija Erdeljic Turk; Melita SalkoviÄ-Petrisic
34719435,"The Role of Pathogens and Anti-Infective Agents in Parkinson's Disease, from Etiology to Therapeutic Implications.","Parkinson's disease is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder whose etiology is still unclear, hampering the development of effective treatments. There is an urgent need to identify the etiology and provide further effective treatments. Recently, accumulating evidence has indicated that infection may play a role in the etiology of Parkinson's disease. The infective pathogens may act as a trigger for Parkinson's disease, the most common of which are hepatitis C virus, influenza virus, and Helicobacter pylori. In addition, gut microbiota is increasingly recognized to influence brain function through the gut-brain axis, showing an important role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, a series of anti-infective agents exhibit surprising neuroprotective effects via various mechanisms, such as interfering with Î±-synuclein aggregation, inhibiting neuroinflammation, attenuating oxidative stress, and preventing from cell death, independent of their antimicrobial effects. The pleiotropic agents affect important events in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Moreover, most of them are less toxic, clinically safe and have good blood-brain penetrability, making them hopeful candidates for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. However, the use of antibiotics and subsequent gut dysbiosis may also play a role in Parkinson's disease, making the long-term effects of anti-infective drugs worthy of further consideration and exploration. This review summarizes the current evidence for the association between infective pathogens and Parkinson's disease and subsequently explores the application prospects of anti-infective drugs in Parkinson's disease treatment, providing novel insights into the pathogenesis and treatment of Parkinson's disease.",Journal of Parkinson's disease,2022,Si Shen; Chan Zhang; Yu-Ming Xu; Chang-He Shi

This review underlines the importance of gut-derived metabolites and gut metabolic status as the main players in gut-brain crosstalk and their implications on the severity of neural conditions. Scientific evidence indicates that the administration of probiotic bacteria exerts beneficial and protective effects as reduced systemic inflammation, neuroinflammation, and inhibited neurodegeneration.

However, when the gut microbiota shift toward dysbiosis in the PD process remains unclear.We aim to investigate the changes in gut microbiota, locomotor function, and neuropathology longitudinally in PD rodent models.Fecal microbiota were longitudinally assessed by sequencing the V4-V5 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene in a human mutant Î±-synuclein over-expressing mouse model of PD, SNCA p.A53T mice, and the non-transgenic littermate controls. The locomotor function, neuronal integrity, and Î±-synuclein expression in the different brain regions were compared between groups. Human fecal microbiota communities from 58 patients with PD and 46 unaffected controls were also analyzed using metagenomic sequencing for comparison.Compared to non-transgenic littermate controls, the altered gut microbiota of the SNCA p.A53T mice can be detected as early as 2 months old, and the diurnal oscillation of the gut microbiome was dampened throughout PD progression starting from 4 months old. However, neuropathology changes and motor deficits were observed starting at 6 months old. Similar changes in altered gut microbiota were also observed in another PD genetic mouse model carrying the LRRK2 p.G2019S mutation at 2 months old. Among the commonly enriched gut microbiota in both PD genetic mouse models, the abundance of Parabateroides Merdae and Ruminococcus torques were also increased in human PD patients compared to controls.These findings revealed the altered gut microbiota communities and oscillations preceding the occurrence of neuropathy and motor dysfunction in the PD process.",Journal of Parkinson's disease,2022,Feng Liang; Cheng-Yu Chen; Yun-Pu Li; Yi-Ci Ke; En-Pong Ho; Chih-Fan Jeng; Chin-Hsien Lin; Shih-Kuo Chen

It has been recognized as the risk factor of neurodegenerative diseases by affecting gut microbiota compositions, microglia, and cognition abilities. Aging-induced changes in gut microbiota compositions have a critical role in orchestrating the morphology and functions of microglia through the gut-brain axis. Gut microbiota communicates with microglia by its secreted metabolites and neurotransmitters. This is highly associated with age-related cognitive declines. Here, we review the main composition of microbiota in the aged individuals, outline the changes of the brain in age-related cognitive decline from a neuroinflammation perspective, especially the changes of morphology and functions of microglia, discuss the crosstalk between microbiota and microglia in the aged brain and further highlight the role of microbiota-microglia connections in neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease).",Aging cell,2022,Rui Zhou; Shufang Qian; William C S Cho; Jinyun Zhou; Chentao Jin; Yan Zhong; Jing Wang; Xiaohui Zhang; Zhoujiao Xu; Mei Tian; Lawrence W C Chan; Hong Zhang
35016506,Effect of Coffee against MPTP-Induced Motor Deficits and Neurodegeneration in Mice Via Regulating Gut Microbiota.,"The mechanisms of coffee against Parkinson disease (PD) remained incompletely elucidated. Numerous studies suggested that gut microbiota played a crucial role in the pathogenesis of PD. Here, we explored the further mechanisms of coffee against PD via regulating gut microbiota. C57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally injected with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to induce a PD mouse model, then treated with coffee for 4 consecutive weeks. Behavioral tests consisting of the pole test and beam-walking test were conducted to evaluate the motor function of mice. The levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and Î±-synuclein (Î±-syn) were assessed for dopaminergic neuronal loss. The levels of occludin, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), Bcl-2, Bax, cleaved caspase-3, and cytochrome c (Cyt c) were detected. Moreover, microbial components were measured by 16s rRNA sequencing. Our results showed that coffee significantly improved the motor deficits and TH neuron loss, and reduced the level of Î±-syn in the MPTP-induced mice. Moreover, coffee increased the level of BBB tight junction protein occludin and reduced the level of astrocyte activation marker GFAP in the MPTP-induced mice. Furthermore, coffee significantly decreased the levels of proapoptotic proteins, including Bax, cleaved caspase-3, and cytochrome c, while it increased the level of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2, consequently preventing MPTP-induced apoptotic cascade. Moreover, coffee improved MPTP-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis. These findings suggested that the neuroprotective effects of coffee on PD were involved in the regulation of gut microbiota, which might provide a novel option to elucidate the effects of coffee on PD.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2022,Jiaming Liu; Yuhe Zhang; Tao Ye; Qingxia Yu; Jiaheng Yu; Shushu Yuan; Xinxin Gao; Xinxin Wan; Rui Zhang; Weihua Han; Yang Zhang
35607987,Parkinson's Disease Is Associated with Impaired Gut-Blood Barrier for Short-Chain Fatty Acids.,"Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by gut microbiota are reduced in feces but paradoxically increased in plasma of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), which may stem from intestinal wall leakage. Gut function should be taken into consideration when conducting microbial-metabolite research.The objective was to investigate synchronous changes of SCFAs in feces and plasma of patients with PD, taking constipation as a confounder to better disentangle the SCFA metabolism exclusively associated with PD.The concentrations of fecal and plasma SCFAs in 33 healthy control subjects and 95 patients with PD were measured using liquid and gas chromatography mass spectrometry, respectively. Patients with PD were divided into patients with PD without constipation (nÂ =Â 35) and patients with PD with constipation (nÂ =Â 60). Gut-blood barrier (GBB) permeability was assessed by plasma/fecal ratio of SCFA concentrations and fecal Î±1-antitrypsin concentration.Patients with PD displayed decreased concentrations of fecal acetic, propionic, and butyric acid and increased concentrations of plasma acetic and propionic acid. Fecal acetic, isobutyric, and isovaleric acid were lower and plasma acetic and propionic acid were higher in patients with PD with constipation than in patients with PD without constipation. Constipation aggravated GBB permeability in patients with PD. Combined fecal and plasma SCFAs could discriminate patients with PD from healthy control subjects. Fecal SCFAs, except propionic acid, were negatively correlated with disease severity, while plasma acetic, propionic, and valeric acid showed a positive correlation.Our study showed alterations of fecal and plasma SCFAs in patients with PD that were associated with an impaired GBB and might be aggravated by constipation.

35873830,Update to the Treatment of Parkinson's Disease Based on the Gut-Brain Axis Mechanism.,"Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms represented by constipation were significant non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) and were considered early manifestations and aggravating factors of the disease. This paper reviewed the research progress of the mechanism of the gut-brain axis (GBA) in PD and discussed the roles of Î±-synuclein, gut microbiota, immune inflammation, neuroendocrine, mitochondrial autophagy, and environmental toxins in the mechanism of the GBA in PD. Treatment of PD based on the GBA theory has also been discussed, including (1) dietary therapy, such as probiotics, vitamin therapy, Mediterranean diet, and low-calorie diet, (2) exercise therapy, (3) drug therapy, including antibiotics; GI peptides; GI motility agents, and (4) fecal flora transplantation can improve the flora. (5) Vagotomy and appendectomy were associated but not recommended.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2022,Xiaohui Sun; Li Xue; Zechen Wang; Anmu Xie
36263629,Intestinal histomorphological and molecular alterations in patients with Parkinson's disease.,"Changes in gut microbiota composition, enteric inflammation, impairments of the intestinal epithelial barrier and neuroplastic changes in the enteric nervous systemÂ have been reported in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and could contribute to the onset of both neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms. However, their mutual interplay has rarely been investigated. This study evaluated, in an integrated manner, changes in faecal microbiota composition, morphofunctional alterations of colonic mucosal barrier and changes of inflammatory markers in blood and stools of PD patients.Nineteen PD patients and nineteen asymptomatic subjects were enrolled. Blood lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP, marker of altered intestinal permeability) and interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²) levels, as well as stool IL-1Î² and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) levels, were evaluated. Gut microbiota analysis was performed. Epithelial mucins, collagen fibres, claudin-1 and S100-positive glial cells as markers of an impairment of the intestinal barrier, mucosal remodelling and enteric glial activationÂ were evaluated on colonic mucosal specimens collected during colonoscopy.Faecal microbiota analysis revealed a significant difference in the Î±-diversity in PD patients compared to controls, while no differences were found in the Î²-diversity. Compared to controls, PD patients showed significant chenags in plasma LBP levels, as well as faecal TNF and IL-1Î² levels. The histological analysis showed a decrease in epithelial neutral mucins and claudin-1 expression and an increased expression of acidic mucins, collagen fibres and S100-positive glial cells.Parkinson's disease patients are characterized by enteric inflammation and increased intestinal epithelial barrier permeability, as well as colonic mucosal barrier remodelling, associated with changes in gut microbiota composition.",European journal of neurology,2023,Gabriele Bellini; Laura Benvenuti; Chiara Ippolito; Daniela Frosini; Cristina Segnani; Francesco Rettura; Andrea Pancetti; Lorenzo Bertani; Vanessa D'Antongiovanni; Giovanni Palermo; Eleonora Del Prete; Luca Antonioli; Vincenzo Nardini; Riccardo Morganti; Carolina Pellegrini; Nunzia Bernardini; Roberto Ceravolo; Matteo Fornai; Massimo Bellini
35741624,Not just a Snapshot: An Italian Longitudinal Evaluation of Stability of Gut Microbiota Findings in Parkinson's Disease.,"Most research analyzed gut-microbiota alterations in Parkinson's disease (PD) through cross-sectional studies, as single snapshots, without considering the time factor to either confirm methods and findings or observe longitudinal variations. In this study, we introduce the time factor by comparing gut-microbiota composition in 18 PD patients and 13 healthy controls (HC) at baseline and at least 1 year later, also considering PD clinical features. PD patients and HC underwent a fecal sampling at baseline and at a follow-up appointment. Fecal samples underwent sequencing and 16S rRNA amplicons analysis. Patients'clinical features were valued through Hoehn&Yahr (H&Y) staging-scale and Movement Disorder Society Unified PD Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part-III. Results demonstrated stability in microbiota findings in both PD patients and HC over a period of 14 months: both alfa and beta diversity were maintained in PD patients and HC over the observation period. In addition, differences in microbiota composition between PD patients and HC remained stable over the time period. Moreover, during the same period, patients did not experience any worsening of either staging or motor impairment. Our findings, highlighting the stability and reproducibility of the method, correlate clinical and microbiota stability over time and open the scenario to more extensive longitudinal evaluations.",Brain sciences,2022,Rocco Cerroni; Daniele Pietrucci; Adelaide Teofani; Giovanni Chillemi; Claudio Liguori; Mariangela Pierantozzi; Valeria Unida; Sidorela Selmani; Nicola Biagio Mercuri; Alessandro Stefani
35076890,Gastrointestinal Dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease.,"There has been exponential growth in the awareness and understanding of gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD) over the past 3 decades. The clinical features of GI dysfunction in PD have been clearly identified and innovative research has demonstrated the presence of pathology within the enteric nervous system (ENS) in individuals with PD, leading to suggestions that the GI system may be ground zero for the genesis and the portal of entry of PD pathology, which then ascends via the vagus nerve to the central nervous system (CNS). This theory, as well as the more recent recognition of the association of PD with dysbiosis within the gut microbiota, has been the object of intense study and scrutiny. Since most PD medications are absorbed through the GI system, the need for better understanding of changes within the GI tract that may potentially affect the pattern of response to medications has become evident. In this review, current knowledge of the pathophysiology of changes within the GI tract and the gut microbiome of individuals with PD, including changes that occur with progression of the disease, will be addressed. We focus on common clinical GI problems in PD that can arise from different segments of the GI tract. Relevant diagnostic evaluations and treatment options for each of these problems will be reviewed.",Drugs,2022,Delaram Safarpour; Kaveh Sharzehi; Ronald F Pfeiffer
35837118,Differences in Alpha Diversity of Gut Microbiota in Neurological Diseases.,"Neurological diseases are difficult to diagnose in time, and there is currently a lack of effective predictive methods. Previous studies have indicated that a variety of neurological diseases cause changes in the gut microbiota. Alpha diversity is a major indicator to describe the diversity of the gut microbiota. At present, the relationship between neurological diseases and the alpha diversity of the gut microbiota remains unclear.We performed a systematic literature search of Pubmed and Bioproject databases up to January 2021. Six indices were used to measure alpha diversity, including community richness (observed species, Chao1 and ACE), community diversity (Shannon, Simpson), and phylogenetic diversity (PD). Random-effects meta-analyses on the standardized mean difference (SMD) were carried out on the alpha diversity indices. Subgroup analyses were performed to explore the sources of interstudy heterogeneity. Meta-analysis was performed on articles by matching the age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) of the disease group with the control group. Meanwhile, subgroup analysis was performed to control the variability of the sequencing region, platform, geographical region, instrument, and diseases. The area under the curve (AUC) value of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was calculated to assess the prediction effectiveness of the microbial alpha diversity indices.We conducted a meta-analysis of 24 published studies on 16S rRNA gene amplified sequencing of the gut microbiota and neurological diseases from the Pubmed and Bioproject database (patients, <i>n</i> = 1,469; controls, <i>n</i> = 1,289). The pooled estimate demonstrated that there was no significant difference in the alpha diversity between patients and controls (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Alpha diversity decreased only in Parkinson's disease patients, while it increased in anorexia nervosa patients compared to controls. After adjusting for age, sex, BMI, and geographical region, none of the alpha diversity was associated with neurological diseases. In terms of Illumina HiSeq 2000 and the V3-V5 sequencing region, the results showed that alpha diversity increased significantly in comparison with the controls, while decreased in Illumina HiSeq 2500. ROC curves suggested that alpha diversity could be used as a biomarker to predict the AD (Simpson, AUC= 0.769, <i>P</i> = 0.0001), MS (observed species, AUC= 0.737, <i>P</i> = 0.001), schizophrenia (Chao1, AUC = 0.739, <i>P</i> = 0.002).Our review summarized the relationship between alpha diversity of the gut microbiota and neurological diseases. The alpha diversity of gut microbiota could be a promising predictor for AD, schizophrenia, and MS, but not for all neurological diseases.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2022,Zhuoxin Li; Jie Zhou; Hao Liang; Li Ye; Liuyan Lan; Fang Lu; Qing Wang; Ting Lei; Xiping Yang; Ping Cui; Jiegang Huang
35091889,Vancomycin Pretreatment on MPTP-Induced Parkinson's Disease Mice Exerts Neuroprotection by Suppressing Inflammation Both in Brain and Gut.,"A growing body of evidence implies that gut microbiota was involved in pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), but the mechanism is still unclear. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of antibiotics pretreatment on the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mice. In this study, vancomycin pretreatment was given by gavage once daily with either vancomycin or distilled water for 14Â days to mice, then mice were administered with MPTP (20Â mg/kg, i.p) for four times in one day to establish an acute PD model. Results show that vancomycin pretreatment significantly improved motor dysfunction of mice in pole and traction tests. Although vancomycinÂ pretreatment had no effect on dopamine (DA) or the process of DA synthesis, it inhibited the metabolism of DA by suppressing the expression of striatal monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B). Furthermore, vancomycin pretreatment reduced the number of astrocytes and microglial cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) to alleviate neuroinflammation, decreased the expression of TLR4/MyD88/NF-ÎºB/TNF-Î± signaling pathway in both brain and gut. Meanwhile, vancomycin pretreatment changed gut microbiome composition and the levels of fecal short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). The abundance of Akkermansia and Blautia increased significantly after vancomycin pretreatment, which might be related to inflammation and inhibition of TLR4 signaling pathway. In summary, these results demonstrate that the variation of gut microbiota and its metabolites induced by vancomycin pretreatment might decrease dopamine metabolic rate and relieve inflammation in both gut and brain via the microbiota-gut-brain axis in MPTP-induced PD mice. The neuroprotection of vancomycin pretreatment on MPTP-induced Parkinson's disease mice The alterations of gut microbiota and SCFAs induced by vancomycin pretreatment might not only improve motor dysfunction, but also decrease dopamine metabolism and relieve inflammation in both brain and gut via TLR4/MyD88/NF-ÎºB/TNF-Î± pathway in MPTP-induced PD mice.",Journal of neuroimmune pharmacology : the official journal of the Society on NeuroImmune Pharmacology,2023,Chun Cui; Hui Hong; Yun Shi; Yu Zhou; Chen-Meng Qiao; Wei-Jiang Zhao; Li-Ping Zhao; Jian Wu; Wei Quan; Gu-Yu Niu; Yi-Bo Wu; Chao-Sheng Li; Li Cheng; Yan Hong; Yan-Qin Shen

35491707,"Modulation of GPCR receptors common to gut inflammatory diseases and neuronal disorders, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases as druggable targets through <i>Withania somnifera</i> bioactives: an <i>in silico</i> study.","Microorganisms in human gastrointestinal tract have profound influence on the transformation of food into metabolites which can impact human health. Along with playing crucial roles in regulating and modulating various metabolic reactions and life processes, dysbiosis of gut microbiota also affects the permeability of gut and blood-brain barrier. This increases the chance of age-related neurological disorders' like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. <i>Withania somnifera</i> (<i>W. somnifera</i>) has been proclaimed as a virtuous plant for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and many other problems. We have studied the bioactive components of <i>W. somnifera</i> for combined treatment of gut-dysbiosis led bowel diseases (Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Irritable Bowel Syndrome) and the most common neurodegenerative diseases through common potential targets. This approach can solve along with curing the neurodegenerative diseases, the factors causing these diseases would also be obstructed from entering the brain, consonantly curing Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Irritable Bowel Syndrome. Our work on GPCR receptors common to gut inflammatory diseases and neuronal disorders through Network Pharmacology, Molecular docking and Dynamic Simulation approach has shown that modulation of these receptors with bioactive compounds present in <i>W. somnifera</i> can result in effective control of these diseases. We have found five proteins (HTR1A, HTR1B, HTR2A, HTR2B & HTR7) and five best lead compounds (Withanolide A, B, E, Q & Anahygrine) against these targets after molecular docking analysis. Our simulation studies have finally shown that amongst these five HTR1A and HTR7 proteins are the best targets with the leads Withanolide E and Withanolide A against them, respectively.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

35603160,Gut Dysbiosis Is Associated With the Severity of Cryptogenic Stroke and Enhanced Systemic Inflammatory Response.,"Studies implicate that gut dysbiosis is related with many neurological diseases. However, the potential role of gut dysbiosis in cryptogenic stroke (CS) has not been elucidated yet. In this study, a high prevalence of gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction and gut inflammation with increased intestinal permeability have been found in CS patients compared with normal controls (NCs). The systemic inflammation in CS patients was also identified by measuring the levels of plasma C-reactive protein (CRP), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), LPS-binding protein (LBP), and white blood cells (WBC) count. Using 16S rRNA sequencing, we found increased alpha diversity, accompanied by a higher abundance of Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcaceae, and Lactobacillaceae at the family level and <i>Escherichia-Shigella</i>, <i>Streptococcus</i>, <i>Lactobacillus</i>, and <i>Klebsilla</i> at the genus level in the intestinal microbiota of CS patients compared to NCs. Our results showed that the abundance of <i>Klebsilla</i> was positively correlated with the systemic inflammation, the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores, and the infarct volumes. In conclusion, gut dysbiosis in CS patients was associated with the severity of CS and the systemic inflammation. Maintaining the intestinal homeostasis may be a potential strategy for the treatment of CS.",Frontiers in immunology,2022,Qianyi Zheng; Yongkang Chen; Yanping Zhai; Lin Meng; Han Liu; Haiyan Tian; Renyi Feng; Jiuqi Wang; Rui Zhang; Kedi Sun; Lina Gao; Yijing Wang; Xuejing Wang; Erxi Wu; Junfang Teng; Xuebing Ding
36619768,The contribution of gut-brain axis to development of neurological symptoms in COVID-19 recovered patients: A hypothesis and review of literature.,"The gut microbiota undergoes significant alterations in response to viral infections, particularly the novel SARS-CoV-2. As impaired gut microbiota can trigger numerous neurological disorders, we suggest that the long-term neurological symptoms of COVID-19 may be related to intestinal microbiota disorders in these patients. Thus, we have gathered available information on how the virus can affect the microbiota of gastrointestinal systems, both in the acute and the recovery phase of the disease, and described several mechanisms through which this gut dysbiosis can lead to long-term neurological disorders, such as Guillain-Barre syndrome, chronic fatigue, psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety, and even neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. These mechanisms may be mediated by inflammatory cytokines, as well as certain chemicals such as gastrointestinal hormones (e.g., CCK), neurotransmitters (e.g., 5-HT), etc. (e.g., short-chain fatty acids), and the autonomic nervous system. In addition to the direct influences of the virus, repurposed medications used for COVID-19 patients can also play a role in gut dysbiosis. In conclusion, although there are many dark spots in our current knowledge of the mechanism of COVID-19-related gut-brain axis disturbance, based on available evidence, we can hypothesize that these two phenomena are more than just a coincidence and highly recommend large-scale epidemiologic studies in the future.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2022,Kimia Vakili; Mobina Fathi; Shirin Yaghoobpoor; Fatemeh Sayehmiri; Yasaman Nazerian; Amirhossein Nazerian; Ashraf Mohamadkhani; Pariya Khodabakhsh; Gislaine Z RÃ©us; Ramtin Hajibeygi; Mostafa Rezaei-Tavirani
36552604,Mangosteen Pericarp Extract Supplementation Boosts Antioxidant Status via Rebuilding Gut Microbiota to Attenuate Motor Deficit in 6-OHDA-Induced Parkinson's Disease.,"Oxidative stress and gut dysbiosis have been known to precede Parkinson's disease (PD). An antioxidant-rich product, mangosteen pericarp (MP), has the ability to counterbalance excessive free radicals and the imbalanced gut microbiota composition, suggesting the MP's capacity to delay PD progression. In this study, we explored the effects of two doses of MP extract in a unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced PD rat model. We revealed that the 8-week supplementation of a low dose (LMP) and a high dose of the MP extract (HMP) improved motor function, as observed in decreased contralateral rotation, improved time spent on rod, and higher dopamine binding transporter (DAT) in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). The MP extract, especially the HMP, also increased antioxidant-related gene expressions, restored muscle mitochondrial function, and remodeled fecal microbiota composition, which were followed by reduced reactive oxygen species levels in brain and inflammation in plasma. Importantly, bacterial genera <i>Sutterella</i>, <i>Rothia</i>, and <i>Aggregatibacter</i>, which were negatively correlated with antioxidant gene expressions, decreased in the HMP group. It is imperative to note that in addition to directly acting as an antioxidant to reduce excessive free radicals, MP extract might also increase antioxidant state by rebuilding gut microbiota, thereby enhanced anti-inflammatory capacity and restored mitochondrial function to attenuate motor deficit in 6-OHDA-induced PD-like condition. All in all, MP extract is a potential candidate for auxiliary therapy for PD.","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,Bira Arumndari Nurrahma; Tu-Hsueh Yeh; Rong-Hong Hsieh; Shu-Ping Tsao; Chia-Wen Chen; Yen-Peng Lee; Chun-Hsu Pan; Hui-Yu Huang
36439235,Probiotic <i>Pediococcus pentosaceus</i> ameliorates MPTP-induced oxidative stress <i>via</i> regulating the gut microbiota-gut-brain axis.,"Recent evidence demonstrated that functional bacteria were involved in the regulation of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the mechanism of probiotics in improving PD was unclear. Here the antioxidant effect and the mechanism of probiotics <i>Pediococcus pentosaceus</i> (PP) on PD were studied by regulating the gut-brain axis. In this study, male C57BL/6J mice were injected with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) intraperitoneally to establish a PD model and were then treated with PP for 4 weeks. Subsequently, a series of neurobehavioral tests to evaluate the motor function of the mice was performed. Additionally, degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, accumulation of Î±-synuclein, the production of an oxidative stress response, and the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway-related proteins were evaluated. Moreover, the gut microbial composition and the level of metabolite Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were assessed. The results showed that PP treatment could improve MPTP-induced motor deficits, the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, and the accumulation of Î±-synuclein. Moreover, PP treatment significantly increased the levels of SOD1, Gpx1, and Nrf2, while it decreased the levels of Keap1 in the brain of MPTP-induced mice. Notably, PP treatment improved the gut microbial dysbiosis and increased the level of GABA in MPTP-induced mice. These findings indicated that PP might represent a promising candidate, due to the metabolite of GABA, that could be used for the treatment of PD.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2022,Sipei Pan; Hongming Wei; Shushu Yuan; Yu Kong; Huiqun Yang; Yuhe Zhang; Xiaorui Cui; Weian Chen; Jiaming Liu; Yang Zhang
36504794,Reviewing the state of the art of probiotics as clinical modalities for brain-gut-microbiota axis associated disorders.,"The rise in prevalence of mental and neurological disorders is causing a high burden on society, however adequate interventions are not always available. The brain-gut-microbiota axis (BGMA) may provide a new angle for the development of clinical modalities. Due to the intricate bi-directional signaling between the brain and the gut, it may be helpful to look into interventions that target the gut, such as probiotics. Therefore, this review aimed to investigate the state of the art of probiotics and their potential as clinical modalities for BGMA-associated indications by gaining insight into patents and clinical trials that have been applied for and executed since 1999. A total of 565 patents and 390 clinical trials were found, focusing on probiotic applications for 83 indications. Since the start of the 21st century, the highest numbers of patents and clinical trials were related to primary neuropsychological, affective (depression, anxiety) and cognitive disorders, neurodegenerative and/or inflammatory brain disorders (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amongst others), and gastrointestinal disorders (irritable bowel syndrome). The locations where the most patents and clinical trials were registered included China, the United States, and Iran. From 1999 to ~2013 a slight growth could be seen in the numbers of patents and clinical trials, followed by an almost exponential growth from ~2013 onwards. Overall, the developments of the state of the art were in accordance with previous research, however it appeared that clinical trials showed a slightly slower growth compared to patents, which may have implications for the future implementation of probiotics as clinical modalities for BGMA-associated indications.",Frontiers in microbiology,2022,Cato Wiegers; MariÃ«t A Veerman; Robert Jan Brummer; Olaf F A Larsen
36570528,The effects of microbiota abundance on symptom severity in Parkinson's disease: A systematic review.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is neurodegenerative disease with a multifactorial etiopathogenesis with accumulating evidence identifying microbiota as a potential factor in the earliest, prodromal phases of the disease. Previous research has already shown a significant difference between gut microbiota composition in PD patients as opposed to healthy controls, with a growing number of studies correlating gut microbiota changes with the clinical presentation of the disease in later stages, through various motor and non-motor symptoms. Our aim in this systematic review is to compose and assess current knowledge in the field and determine if the findings could influence future clinical practice as well as therapy in PD.We have conducted a systematic review according to PRISMA guidelines through MEDLINE and Embase databases, with studies being selected for inclusion via a set inclusion and exclusion criteria.20 studies were included in this systematic review according to the selected inclusion and exclusion criteria. The search yielded 18 case control studies, 1 case study, and 1 prospective case study with no controls. The total number of PD patients encompassed in the studies cited in this review is 1,511.The link between gut microbiota and neurodegeneration is a complex one and it depends on various factors. The relative abundance of various microbiota taxa in the gut has been consistently shown to have a correlation with motor and non-motor symptom severity. The answer could lie in the products of gut microbiota metabolism which have also been linked to PD. Further research is thus warranted in the field, with a focus on the metabolic function of gut microbiota in relation to motor and non-motor symptoms.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2022,EliÅ¡a PapiÄ; Valentino RaÄki; Mario Hero; Zoran TomiÄ; Nada StarÄeviÄ-ÄiÅ¾mareviÄ; Anja Kovanda; Miljenko KapoviÄ; Goran Hauser; Borut Peterlin; Vladimira VuletiÄ
35342048,Alteration of Gut Microbial Metabolites in the Systemic Circulation of Patients with Parkinson's Disease.,"Emerging evidence suggests that gut dysbiosis contributes to Parkinson's disease (PD) by signaling through microbial metabolites. Hippuric acid (HA), indole derivatives, and secondary bile acids are among the most common gut metabolites.To examine the relationship of systemic concentrations of these microbial metabolites associated with changes of gut microbiota, PD status, and severity of PD.We enrolled 56 patients with PD and 43 age- and sex-matched healthy participants. Motor and cognitive severity were assessed with Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) part III motor score and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), respectively. Plasma concentrations of targeted gut metabolites were measured with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Gut microbiota was analyzed with shotgun metagenomic sequencing.Compared with controls, PD patients had significantly higher plasma levels of HA, indole-3-propionic acid (IPA), deoxycholic acid (DCA), and glycodeoxycholic acid (GDCA). After adjustment for age and sex in a multivariate logistic regression analysis, plasma levels of HA (odds ratio [OR] 3.21, pâ<â0.001), IPA (OR 2.59, pâ=â0.031), and GDCA (OR 2.82, pâ=â0.036) were associated with positive PD status. Concentrations of these gut metabolites did not correlate with MDS-UPDRS part III score or MMSE after adjustment for confounders. Microbial metabolite levels were associated with the relative abundance of pro-inflammatory gut bacteria.Aberrant gut microbial metabolites of HA, indole derivatives and secondary bile acids associated with specific gut microbiota changes were observed in patients with PD.",Journal of Parkinson's disease,2022,Szu-Ju Chen; Chieh-Chang Chen; Hsin-Yu Liao; Yu-Wei Wu; Jyh-Ming Liou; Ming-Shiang Wu; Ching-Hua Kuo; Chin-Hsien Lin
35572129,Multi-Omics Integration in Mice With Parkinson's Disease and the Intervention Effect of Cyanidin-3-<i>O</i>-Glucoside.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multifactorial degenerative disease of the central nervous system, which affects mostly older adults. To date, research has focused on the progression of PD. Simultaneously, it was confirmed that the imbalances in gut microbiota are associated with the onset and progression of PD. Accurate diagnosis and precise treatment of PD are currently deficient due to the absence of effective biomarkers.In this study, the pharmacodynamic study of cyanidin-3-<i>O</i>-glucoside in PD mice was used. It intends to use the ""imbalance"" and ""balance"" of intestinal microecology as the starting point to investigate the ""gut-to-brain"" hypothesis using metabolomic-combined 16S rRNA gene sequencing methods. Simultaneously, metabolomic analysis was implemented to acquire differential metabolites, and microbiome analysis was performed to analyze the composition and filter the remarkably altered gut microbiota at the phylum/genera level. Afterward, metabolic pathway and functional prediction analysis of the screened differential metabolites and gut microbiota were applied using the MetaboAnalyst database. In addition, Pearson's correlation analysis was used for the differential metabolites and gut microbiota. We found that cyanidin-3-<i>O</i>-glucoside could protect 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6- tetrahydropy ridine (MPTP)-induced PD mice.Metabolomic analysis showed that MPTP-induced dysbiosis of the gut microbiota significantly altered sixty-seven metabolites. The present studies have also shown that MPTP-induced PD is related to lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and so on. The 16S rRNA sequencing analysis indicated that 5 phyla and 22 genera were significantly altered. Furthermore, the differential gut microbiota was interrelated with amino acid metabolism, and so on. The metabolites and gut microbiota network diagram revealed significant correlations between 11 genera and 8 differential metabolites.In combination, this study offers potential molecular biomarkers that should be validated for future translation into clinical applications for more accurately diagnosing PD. Simultaneously, the results of this study lay a basis for further study of the association between host metabolisms, gut microbiota, and PD.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2022,Wang Wang; Guoxue Zhu; Yuwen Wang; Wei Li; Shilin Yi; Kai Wang; Lu Fan; Juanjuan Tang; Ruini Chen
34996385,Serum short-chain fatty acids and its correlation with motor and non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease patients.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with enteric nervous system dysfunction and gut microbiota dysbiosis. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), derived from gut microbiota, are supposed to anticipate PD pathogenesis via the pathway of spinal cord and vagal nerve or the circulatory system. However, the serum concentration of SCFAs in PD patients is poorly known. This study aims to investigate the exact level of SCFAs in PD patients and its correlation with Parkinson's symptoms.50 PD patients and 50 healthy controls were recruited, and their demographic and clinical characteristics were collected. The serum concentration of SCFAs was detected using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometer. SCFAs were compared between PD and control groups. The correlation between serum SCFAs and Parkinson's symptoms and the potential effects of medications on the serum SCFAs was analyzed.Serum propionic acid, butyric acid and caproic acid were lower, while heptanoic acid was higher in PD patients than in control subjects. However, only the serum level of propionic acid was correlated with Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRs) part III score (RÂ =Â -0.365, PÂ =Â 0.009), Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE) score (RÂ =Â -0.416, PÂ =Â 0.003), and Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) score (RÂ =Â 0.306, PÂ =Â 0.03). There was no correlation between other serum SCFAs and motor complications. The use of trihexyphenidyl or tizanidine increased the serum concentration of propionic acid.Serum SCFAs are altered in PD patients, and the decrease of serum propionic acid level is correlated with motor symptoms, cognitive ability and non-depressed state. Thus, the gut microbial-derived SCFAs potentially affect Parkinson's symptoms through the blood circulation. Propionic acid supplementation might ameliorate motor and non-motor symptoms of PD patients, although clinical trials are needed to test this hypothesis.",BMC neurology,2022,Gang Wu; Zhengli Jiang; Yaling Pu; Shiyong Chen; Tingling Wang; Yajing Wang; Xiaoping Xu; Shanshan Wang; Minya Jin; Yangyang Yao; Yang Liu; Shaofa Ke; Suzhi Liu
36056826,Microbiome-Based Therapies in Parkinson's Disease: Can Tuning the Microbiota Become a Viable Therapeutic Strategy?,"Progressive neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD) have continued to baffle medical science, despite strides in the understanding of their pathology. The inability of currently available therapies to halt disease progression is a testament to an incomplete understanding of pathways crucial to disease initiation, progression and management. Science has continued to link the activities and equilibrium of the gut microbiome to the health and proper functioning of brain neurons. They also continue to stir interest in the potential applications of technologies that may shift the balance of the gut microbiome towards achieving a favourable outcome in PD management. There have been suggestions that an improved understanding of the roles of the gut microbiota is likely to lead to the emergence of an era where their manipulation becomes a recognized strategy for PD management. This review examines the current state of our journey in the quest to understand how the gut microbiota can influence several aspects of PD. We highlight the relationship between the gut microbiome/microbiota and PD pathogenesis, as well as preclinical and clinical evidence evaluating the effect of postbiotics, probiotics and prebiotics in PD management. This is with a view to ascertaining if we are at the threshold of discovering the application of a usable tool in our quest for disease modifying therapies in PD.",CNS & neurological disorders drug targets,2022,Adejoke Y Onaolapo; Folusho O Ojo; Anthony T Olofinnade; Joshua Falade; Ismail A Lawal; Olakunle J Onaolapo
36358513,Neurodegenerative Microbially-Shaped Diseases: Oxidative Stress Meets Neuroinflammation.,"Inflammation and oxidative stress characterize a number of chronic conditions including neurodegenerative diseases and aging. Inflammation is a key component of the innate immune response in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease of which oxidative stress is an important hallmark. Immune dysregulation and mitochondrial dysfunction with concomitant reactive oxygen species accumulation have also been implicated in both diseases, both systemically and within the Central Nervous System. Mitochondria are a centrally positioned signalling hub for inflammatory responses and inflammatory cells can release reactive species at the site of inflammation often leading to exaggerated oxidative stress. A growing body of evidence suggests that disruption of normal gut microbiota composition may induce increased permeability of the gut barrier leading to chronic systemic inflammation, which may, in turn, impair the blood-brain barrier function and promote neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. The gastrointestinal tract is constantly exposed to myriad exogenous substances and microbial pathogens, which are abundant sources of reactive oxygen species, oxidative damage and pro-inflammatory events. Several studies have demonstrated that microbial infections may also affect the balance in gut microbiota composition (involving oxidant and inflammatory processes by the host and indigenous microbiota) and influence downstream Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease pathogenesis, in which blood-brain barrier damage ultimately occurs. Therefore, the oxidant/inflammatory insults triggered by a disrupted gut microbiota and chronic dysbiosis often lead to compromised gut barrier function, allowing inflammation to ""escape"" as well as uncontrolled immune responses that may ultimately disrupt mitochondrial function upwards the brain. Future therapeutic strategies should be designed to ""restrain"" gut inflammation, a goal that could ideally be attained by microbiota modulation strategies, in alternative to classic anti-inflammatory agents with unpredictable effects on the microbiota architecture itself.","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,Diana Filipa Silva; Nuno Empadinhas; Sandra Morais Cardoso; Ana Raquel Esteves
35405323,Linking circadian rhythms to microbiome-gut-brain axis in aging-associated neurodegenerative diseases.,"Emerging evidence suggests that both disruption of circadian rhythms and gut dysbiosis are closely related to aging-associated neurodegenerative diseases. Over the last decade, the microbiota-gut-brain axis has been an emerging field and revolutionized studies in pathology, diagnosis, and treatment of neurological disorders. Crosstalk between the brain and gut microbiota can be accomplished via the endocrine, immune, and nervous system. Recent studies have shown that the composition and diurnal oscillation of gut microbiota are influenced by host circadian rhythms. This provides a new perspective for investigating the microbiome-gut-brain axis. We aim to review current understanding and research on the dynamic interaction between circadian rhythms and the microbiome-gut-brain axis. Furthermore, we will address the possible neurodegenerative disease contribution through circadian rhythms and microbiome-gut-brain axis crosstalk.",Ageing research reviews,2022,Wai-Yin Cheng; Yuen-Shan Ho; Raymond Chuen-Chung Chang
36144449,Advanced Glycation End Products in Health and Disease.,"Advanced glycation end products (AGEs), formed through the nonenzymatic reaction of reducing sugars with the side-chain amino groups of lysine or arginine of proteins, followed by further glycoxidation reactions under oxidative stress conditions, are involved in the onset and exacerbation of a variety of diseases, including diabetes, atherosclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) as well as in the secondary stages of traumatic brain injury (TBI). AGEs, in the form of intra- and interprotein crosslinks, deactivate various enzymes, exacerbating disease progression. The interactions of AGEs with the receptors for the AGEs (RAGE) also result in further downstream inflammatory cascade events. The overexpression of RAGE and the AGE-RAGE interactions are especially involved in cases of Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases, including TBI and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Maillard reactions are also observed in the gut bacterial species. The protein aggregates found in the bacterial species resemble those of AD and Parkinson's disease (PD), and AGE inhibitors increase the life span of the bacteria. Dietary AGEs alter the gut microbiota composition and elevate plasma glycosylation, thereby leading to systemic proinflammatory effects and endothelial dysfunction. There is emerging interest in developing AGE inhibitor and AGE breaker compounds to treat AGE-mediated pathologies, including diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases. Gut-microbiota-derived enzymes may also function as AGE-breaker biocatalysts. Thus, AGEs have a prominent role in the pathogenesis of various diseases, and the AGE inhibitor and AGE breaker approach may lead to novel therapeutic candidates.",Microorganisms,2022,V Prakash Reddy; Puspa Aryal; Emmanuel K Darkwah
35684340,The Role of Microbiome in Brain Development and Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Hundreds of billions of commensal microorganisms live in and on our bodies, most of which colonize the gut shortly after birth and stay there for the rest of our lives. In animal models, bidirectional communications between the central nervous system and gut microbiota (Gut-Brain Axis) have been extensively studied, and it is clear that changes in microbiota composition play a vital role in the pathogenesis of various neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, such as Autism Spectrum Disorder, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, anxiety, stress, and so on. The makeup of the microbiome is impacted by a variety of factors, such as genetics, health status, method of delivery, environment, nutrition, and exercise, and the present understanding of the role of gut microbiota and its metabolites in the preservation of brain functioning and the development of the aforementioned neurological illnesses is summarized in this review article. Furthermore, we discuss current breakthroughs in the use of probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics to address neurological illnesses. Moreover, we also discussed the role of boron-based diet in memory, boron and microbiome relation, boron as anti-inflammatory agents, and boron in neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, in the coming years, boron reagents will play a significant role to improve dysbiosis and will open new areas for researchers.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,Varsha Nandwana; Nitesh K Nandwana; Yogarupa Das; Mariko Saito; Tanisha Panda; Sasmita Das; Frankis Almaguel; Narayan S Hosmane; Bhaskar C Das
36226922,Fucosylated Chondroitin Sulfate against Parkinson's Disease through Inhibiting Inflammation Induced by Gut Dysbiosis.,"Growing evidence for the importance of the gut-brain axis in Parkinson's disease (PD) has attracted researchers' interest in the possible application of microbiota-based treatment approaches. Using a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced mouse model, we looked into the prospect of treating PD with fucosylated chondroitin sulfate obtained from sea cucumbers <i>Isostichopus badionotus</i> (fCS-<i>Ib</i>). We showed that giving fCS-<i>Ib</i> polysaccharide orally greatly reduced the motor deficits, dopamine depletion, and alpha-synuclein increase caused by MPTP in the substantia nigra (SN). It appears that the anti-PD action of fCS-<i>Ib</i> polysaccharide could be attained by squelching inflammation. Glial cell hyperactivation in SN and overproduction of proinflammatory substances in serum could both be suppressed by fCS-<i>Ib</i> polysaccharide injection. The bacterial DNA in fresh colonic feces was submitted to 16S rRNA and untargeted metabolic analyses to confirm the participation of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in the aforementioned interpretation. The findings showed that the MPTP treatment-induced decrease in <i>norank_f_Muribaculaceae</i> and the increase in <i>Staphylococcus</i> were reversed by the administration of fCS-<i>Ib</i> polysaccharide. The NF-ÎºB signaling pathway was shown to be involved in the fCS-<i>Ib</i> polysaccharide-induced anti-inflammation. In conclusion, our research demonstrated for the first time how fCS-<i>Ib</i> polysaccharide combats PD by reducing inflammation caused by gut microbial dysbiosis.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2022,Yimeng Liu; Xuyu Liu; Qiantao Ye; Yida Wang; Jiafu Zhang; Song Lin; Guang Wang; Xuesong Yang; Jichun Zhang; Shiguo Chen; Nian Wu
35829770,Studying the Parkinson's disease metabolome and exposome in biological samples through different analytical and cheminformatics approaches: a pilot study.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease, with an increasing incidence in recent years due to the aging population. Genetic mutations alone only explainâ<10% of PD cases, while environmental factors, including small molecules, may play a significant role in PD. In the present work, 22 plasma (11 PD, 11 control) and 19 feces samples (10 PD, 9 control) were analyzed by non-target high-resolution mass spectrometry (NT-HRMS) coupled to two liquid chromatography (LC) methods (reversed-phase (RP) and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC)). A cheminformatics workflow was optimized using open software (MS-DIAL and patRoon) and open databases (all public MSP-formatted spectral libraries for MS-DIAL, PubChemLite for Exposomics, and the LITMINEDNEURO list for patRoon). Furthermore, five disease-specific databases and three suspect lists (on PD and related disorders) were developed, using PubChem functionality to identifying relevant unknown chemicals. The results showed that non-target screening with the larger databases generally provided better results compared with smaller suspect lists. However, two suspect screening approaches with patRoon were also good options to study specific chemicals in PD. The combination of chromatographic methods (RP and HILIC) as well as two ionization modes (positive and negative) enhanced the coverage of chemicals in the biological samples. While most metabolomics studies in PD have focused on blood and cerebrospinal fluid, we found a higher number of relevant features in feces, such as alanine betaine or nicotinamide, which can be directly metabolized by gut microbiota. This highlights the potential role of gut dysbiosis in PD development.",Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry,2022,BegoÃ±a Talavera AndÃºjar; Dagny Aurich; Velma T E Aho; Randolph R Singh; Tiejun Cheng; Leonid Zaslavsky; Evan E Bolton; Brit Mollenhauer; Paul Wilmes; Emma L Schymanski
36001607,A Metabologenomic approach reveals alterations in the gut microbiota of a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,"The key role played by host-microbiota interactions on human health, disease onset and progression, and on host response to treatments has increasingly emerged in the latest decades. Indeed, dysbiosis has been associated to several human diseases such as obesity, diabetes, cancer and also neurodegenerative disease, such as Parkinson, Huntington and Alzheimer's disease (AD), although whether causative, consequence or merely an epiphenomenon is still under investigation. In the present study, we performed a metabologenomic analysis of stool samples from a mouse model of AD, the 3xTgAD. We found a significant change in the microbiota of AD mice compared to WT, with a longitudinal divergence of the F/B ratio, a parameter suggesting a gut dysbiosis. Moreover, AD mice showed a significant decrease of some amino acids, while data integration revealed a dysregulated production of desaminotyrosine (DAT) and dihydro-3-coumaric acid. Collectively, our data show a dysregulated gut microbiota associated to the onset and progression of AD, also indicating that a dysbiosis can occur prior to significant clinical signs, evidenced by early SCFA alterations, compatible with gut inflammation.",PloS one,2022,Francesco Favero; Elettra Barberis; Mara Gagliardi; Stefano Espinoza; Liliana Contu; Stefano Gustincich; Francesca Boccafoschi; Chiara Borsotti; Dmitry Lim; Vito Rubino; Flavio Mignone; Edoardo Pasolli; Marcello Manfredi; Silvia Zucchelli; Davide CorÃ ; Marco Corazzari
35959396,<i>Porphyromonas gingivalis</i>: A key role in Parkinson's disease with cognitive impairment?,"Cognitive impairment (CI) is a common complication of Parkinson's disease (PD). The major features of Parkinson's disease with cognitive impairment (PD-CI) include convergence of Î±-Synuclein (Î±-Syn) and Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like pathologies, neuroinflammation, and dysbiosis of gut microbiota. <i>Porphyromonas gingivalis</i> (<i>P. gingivalis</i>) is an important pathogen in periodontitis. Recent research has suggested a role of P. gingivalis and its virulence factor in the pathogenesis of PD and AD, in particular concerning neuroinflammation and deposition of Î±-Synuclein (Î±-Syn) and amyloid-Î² (AÎ²). Furthermore, in animal models, oral <i>P. gingivalis</i> could cause neurodegeneration through regulating the gut-brain axis, suggesting an oral-gut-brain axis might exist. In this article, we discussed the pathological characteristics of PD-CI and the role of <i>P. gingivalis</i> in them.",Frontiers in neurology,2022,Dongcheng Li; Tengzhu Ren; Hao Li; Geng Liao; Xiong Zhang
36289839,Involvement of Intestinal Enteroendocrine Cells in Neurological and Psychiatric Disorders.,"Neurological and psychiatric patients have increased dramatically in number in the past few decades. However, effective treatments for these diseases and disorders are limited due to heterogeneous and unclear pathogenic mechanisms. Therefore, further exploration of the biological aspects of the disease, and the identification of novel targets to develop alternative treatment strategies, is urgently required. Systems-level investigations have indicated the potential involvement of the brain-gut axis and intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis and regulation of neurological and psychiatric disorders. While intestinal microbiota is crucial for maintaining host physiology, some important sensory and regulatory cells in the host should not be overlooked. Intestinal epithelial enteroendocrine cells (EECs) residing in the epithelium throughout intestine are the key regulators orchestrating the communication along the brain-gut-microbiota axis. On one hand, EECs sense changes in luminal microorganisms via microbial metabolites; on the other hand, they communicate with host body systems via neuroendocrine molecules. Therefore, EECs are believed to play important roles in neurological and psychiatric disorders. This review highlights the involvement of EECs and subtype cells, via secretion of endocrine molecules, in the development and regulation of neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD), schizophrenia, visceral pain, neuropathic pain, and depression. Moreover, the current paper summarizes the potential mechanism of EECs in contributing to disease pathogenesis. Examination of these mechanisms may inspire and lead to the development of new aspects of treatment strategies for neurological and psychiatric disorders in the future.",Biomedicines,2022,Liangen Yu; Yihang Li
35742813,Dual-Hit Model of Parkinson's Disease: Impact of Dysbiosis on 6-Hydroxydopamine-Insulted Mice-Neuroprotective and Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Butyrate.,"Recent evidence highlights Parkinson's disease (PD) initiation in the gut as the prodromal phase of neurodegeneration. Gut impairment due to microbial dysbiosis could affect PD pathogenesis and progression. Here, we propose a two-hit model of PD through ceftriaxone (CFX)-induced dysbiosis and gut inflammation before the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) intrastriatal injection to mimic dysfunctional gut-associated mechanisms preceding PD onset. Therefore, we showed that dysbiosis and gut damage amplified PD progression, worsening motor deficits induced by 6-OHDA up to 14 days post intrastriatal injection. This effect was accompanied by a significant increase in neuronal dopaminergic loss (reduced tyrosine hydroxylase expression and increased Bcl-2/Bax ratio). Notably, CFX pretreatment also enhanced systemic and colon inflammation of dual-hit subjected mice. The exacerbated inflammatory response ran in tandem with a worsening of colonic architecture and gut microbiota perturbation. Finally, we demonstrated the beneficial effect of post-biotic sodium butyrate in limiting at once motor deficits, neuroinflammation, and colon damage and re-shaping microbiota composition in this novel dual-hit model of PD. Taken together, the bidirectional communication of the microbiota-gut-brain axis and the recapitulation of PD prodromal/pathogenic features make this new paradigm a useful tool for testing or repurposing new multi-target compounds in the treatment of PD.",International journal of molecular sciences,2022,Carmen Avagliano; Lorena Coretti; Adriano Lama; Claudio Pirozzi; Carmen De Caro; Davide De Biase; Luigia Turco; Maria Pina Mollica; Orlando Paciello; Antonio Calignano; Rosaria Meli; Francesca Lembo; Giuseppina Mattace Raso
35779628,(R)-ketamine as prophylactic and therapeutic drug for neurological disorders: Beyond depression.,"Neurological disorders are the leading cause of disability and the second leading cause of death worldwide. The increasing social and economic burdens of neurological disorders are driven by global population growth and aging. Depression is a common psychiatric symptom in numerous neurological disorders. It is also a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias, Parkinson's disease (PD), and stroke. The rapid-acting and sustained antidepressant actions of (R,S)-ketamine for severe depression was accidentally discovered. Interestingly, (R)-ketamine has greater potency and longer-lasting antidepressant-like effects than (S)-ketamine in rodents. Importantly, its side effects in rodents and humans are lower than those of (R,S)-ketamine and (S)-ketamine. Furthermore, (R)-ketamine could elicit beneficial actions in various rodent models of neurological disorders, including PD, multiple sclerosis (MS), and stroke. In this article, we review the potential of (R)-ketamine as a prophylactic or therapeutic drug for neurological disorders including AD and other dementias, PD, MS, and stroke.",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,2022,Xingming Wang; Jianjun Yang; Kenji Hashimoto

Probiotics are live microbes, which are found in fermented foods, beverages, and cultured milk and, when administered in an adequate dose, confer health benefits to the host. They are known as ""health-friendly bacteria"", normally residing in the human gut and involved in maintaining homeostatic conditions. Imbalance in gut microbiota results in the pathophysiology of several diseases entailing the GIT tract, skin, immune system, inflammation, and gut-brain axis. Recently, the use of probiotics has gained tremendous interest, because of their profound effects on the management of these disease conditions. Recent findings suggest that probiotics enrichment in different human and mouse disease models showed promising beneficial effects and results in the amelioration of disease symptoms. Thus, this review focuses on the current probiotics-based products, different disease models, variable markers measured during trials, and evidence obtained from past studies on the use of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of different diseases, covering the skin to the central nervous system diseases.",International journal of molecular sciences,2022,Arifa Un-Nisa; Amjad Khan; Muhammad Zakria; Sami Siraj; Shakir Ullah; Muhammad Khalid Tipu; Muhammad Ikram; Myeong Ok Kim
36364961,Direct Action of Non-Digestible Oligosaccharides against a Leaky Gut.,"The epithelial monolayer is the primary determinant of mucosal barrier function, and tight junction (TJ) complexes seal the paracellular space between the adjacent epithelial cells and represent the main ""gate-keepers"" of the paracellular route. Impaired TJ functionality results in increased permeation of the ""pro-inflammatory"" luminal contents to the circulation that induces local and systemic inflammatory and immune responses, ultimately triggering and/or perpetuating (chronic) systemic inflammatory disorders. Increased gut leakiness is associated with intestinal and systemic disease states such as inflammatory bowel disease and neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease. Modulation of TJ dynamics is an appealing strategy aiming at inflammatory conditions associated with compromised intestinal epithelial function. Recently there has been a growing interest in nutraceuticals, particularly in non-digestible oligosaccharides (NDOs). NDOs confer innumerable health benefits via microbiome-shaping and gut microbiota-related immune responses, including enhancement of epithelial barrier integrity. Emerging evidence supports that NDOs also exert health-beneficial effects on microbiota independently via direct interactions with intestinal epithelial and immune cells. Among these valuable features, NDOs promote barrier function by directly regulating TJs via AMPK-, PKC-, MAPK-, and TLR-associated pathways. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the epithelial barrier-protective effects of different NDOs with a special focus on their microbiota-independent modulation of TJs.",Nutrients,2022,Maria Eleni Mavrogeni; Mostafa Asadpoor; Paul A J Henricks; Ali Keshavarzian; Gert Folkerts; Saskia Braber

The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs) of gut microbiota-based models for Hoehn & Yahr (HY) stages 1 and 2 were 0.799 and 0.705, respectively. Similarly, gut microbiota predicted the progression of Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) III scores in an early stage of PD with AUROCâ=â0.728. Decreases of short-chain fatty acid-producing genera, Fusicatenibacter, Faecalibacterium, and Blautia, as well as an increase of mucin-degrading genus Akkermansia, predicted accelerated disease progression. The four genera remained unchanged in two years in PD, indicating that the taxonomic changes were not the consequences of disease progression.

36240098,Association Between Microbial Tyrosine Decarboxylase Gene and Levodopa Responsiveness in Patients With Parkinson Disease.,"Interindividual variability in levodopa efficacy is a challenge for the personalized treatment of Parkinson disease (PD). Gut microbiota might represent a new approach for personalized medicine. Recently, a novel microbial levodopa metabolism pathway was identified, which is mediated by tyrosine decarboxylase mainly encoded by tyrosine decarboxylase gene (<i>tyrDC</i>) in <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i>. In this study, we aimed to identify whether the abundance of microbial <i>tyrDC</i> gene and <i>E faecalis</i> is associated with levodopa responsiveness and could predict the drug response.This cross-sectional study enrolled patients with PD between December 2019 and January 2022 and evaluated levodopa responsiveness using a levodopa challenge test. Patients were stratified into moderate and good responders based on levodopa responsiveness. The <i>tyrDC</i> gene and <i>E. faecalis</i> abundance in fecal samples were measured using quantitative real-time PCR. Plasma levodopa concentrations were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis. The predictive models for levodopa responsiveness were constructed and verified through cross-validation and external validation.A total of 101 patients with PD were enrolled in the primary cohort and 43 were enrolled in the external validation cohort. Moderate responders had higher abundances of the <i>tyrDC</i> gene (3.6 [3.1-4.3] vs 2.6 [2.1-2.9], <i>p</i> < 0.001) and <i>E faecalis</i> (3.2 [2.5-4.4] vs 2.6 [2.1-3.6], <i>p</i> = 0.010) than good responders. The <i>tyrDC</i> gene abundance was independently associated with levodopa responsiveness (OR: 5.848; 95% CI: 2.664-12.838; <i>p</i> < 0.001). Notably, <i>tyrDC</i> gene abundance showed certain discriminative power for levodopa responsiveness in primary cohort (sensitivity: 80.0%; specificity: 84.3%; area under the curve [AUC]: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.77-0.93; <i>p</i> < 0.001) and external validation cohort (sensitivity: 85.0%; specificity: 95.7%; AUC: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.89-1.02; <i>p</i> < 0.001). The prediction of levodopa responsiveness based on <i>tyrDC</i> gene abundance had good calibration and discrimination in cross-validation (C-index in training and test sets: 0.856 and 0.851, respectively) and external validation (C-index: 0.952).The microbial <i>tyrDC</i> gene abundance could serve as a potential biomarker of levodopa responsiveness. Novel strategies targeting the <i>tyrDC</i> gene may provide new approaches for personalized levodopa treatment.",Neurology,2022,Yi Zhang; Xiaoqin He; Chengjun Mo; Xiaoqian Liu; Jian Li; Zheng Yan; Yiwei Qian; Yiqiu Lai; Shaoqing Xu; Xiaodong Yang; Qin Xiao
35806985,The Risk of Developing Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Meta-Analysis.,"Recently, a growing body of research has linked gut microbiota dysbiosis to central nervous system diseases, such as Alzheimerâs disease (AD) and Parkinsonâs disease (PD), and has suggested that AD and PD pathology may take its origin from chronic inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. Thus, this study aimed to elucidate whether inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with a higher risk of developing AD and PD as compared to the non-IBD population by conducting a meta-analysis. A thorough search of Pubmed and Embase databases was performed to identify all relevant articles. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were analyzed using a fixed-effect model. To assess publication bias and heterogeneity among the studies, Eggerâs test and LâAbbÃ© plots were used, respectively. A total of eight eligible studies were included in this meta-analysis. No significant heterogeneity or significant publication bias was detected. The risk of developing AD in IBD patients was higher than in non-IBD patients (OR = 0.37; 95% CI = 0.14â1.00; p = 0.05), and there was a relationship between the occurrence of AD and Crohnâs disease or ulcerative colitis (OR = 0.11; 95% CI = 0.04â0.30; p < 0.0001, OR = 0.14; 95% CI = 0.04â0.49; p = 0.0024, respectively). The risk of developing both of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, AD and PD, was also significantly higher in patients diagnosed with Crohnâs disease or ulcerative colitis (OR = 0.21; 95% CI = 0.09â0.49; p = 0.0003, OR = 0.25; 95% CI = 0.13â0.51; p = 0.0001, respectively). This meta-analysis revealed a higher risk of AD and PD among CD and UC patients compared to the general population. It may suggest a key role for the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of not only Crohnâs disease and ulcerative colitis but also AD and PD. The identification of this potential risk may provide earlier preventive measures to be implemented to reduce comorbidity and mortality rate.",Journal of clinical medicine,2022,Marta Szandruk-Bender; Benita Wiatrak; Adam SzelÄg
36422338,Role of Probiotics and Diet in the Management of Neurological Diseases and Mood States: A Review.,"Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's diseases (PD) are common in older people. Autism spectrum disorders (ASD), anxiety, depression, stress, and cognitive impairment are prevalent among people irrespective of age. The incidence of neurological disorders has been increasing in recent decades. Communication between the gut microbiota and the brain is intrinsically complicated, and it is necessary for the maintenance of the gut, brain, and immune functions of the host. The bidirectional link among the gut, gut microbiota and the brain is designated as the ""microbiota-gut-brain axis."" Gut microbiota modulates the host immune system and functions of tissue barriers such as gut mucosa and blood-brain barrier (BBB). Gut microbial dysfunction disturbs the gut-brain interplay and may contribute to various gut disorders, neurocognitive and psychiatric disorders. Probiotics could protect intestinal integrity, enhance gut functions, promote intestinal mucosal and BBB functions, and support the synthesis of brain-derived neurotrophic factors, which enhance neuronal survival and differentiation. Probiotics could be considered an adjunct therapy to manage metabolic and psychiatric diseases. Predominantly, <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Bifidobacterium</i> strains are documented as potent probiotics, which help to maintain the bidirectional interactions between the gut and brain. The consumption of probiotics and probiotics containing fermented foods could improve the gut microbiota. The diet impacts gut microbiota, and a balanced diet could maintain the integrity of gut-brain communication by facilitating the production of neurotrophic factors and other neuropeptides. However, the beneficial effects of probiotics and diet might depend upon several factors, including strain, dosage, duration, age, host physiology, etc. This review summarizes the importance and involvement of probiotics and diet in neuroprotection and managing representative neurological disorders, injuries and mood states.",Microorganisms,2022,Subramanian Thangaleela; Bhagavathi Sundaram Sivamaruthi; Periyanaina Kesika; Chaiyavat Chaiyasut

35844606,T<sub>REG</sub>king From Gut to Brain: The Control of Regulatory T Cells Along the Gut-Brain Axis.,"The human gastrointestinal tract has an enormous and diverse microbial community, termed microbiota, that is necessary for the development of the immune system and tissue homeostasis. In contrast, microbial dysbiosis is associated with various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases as well as neurological disorders in humans by affecting not only the immune system in the gastrointestinal tract but also other distal organs. FOXP3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a subset of CD4<sup>+</sup> helper T cell lineages that function as a gatekeeper for immune activation and are essential for peripheral autoimmunity prevention. Tregs are crucial to the maintenance of immunological homeostasis and tolerance at barrier regions. Tregs reside in both lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues, and tissue-resident Tregs have unique tissue-specific phenotype and distinct function. The gut microbiota has an impact on Tregs development, accumulation, and function in periphery. Tregs, in turn, modulate antigen-specific responses aimed towards gut microbes, which supports the host-microbiota symbiotic interaction in the gut. Recent studies have indicated that Tregs interact with a variety of resident cells in central nervous system (CNS) to limit the progression of neurological illnesses such as ischemic stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. The gastrointestinal tract and CNS are functionally connected, and current findings provide insights that Tregs function along the gut-brain axis by interacting with immune, epithelial, and neuronal cells. The purpose of this study is to explain our current knowledge of the biological role of tissue-resident Tregs, as well as the interaction along the gut-brain axis.",Frontiers in immunology,2022,Juli Choi; Bo-Ram Kim; Begum Akuzum; Leechung Chang; June-Yong Lee; Ho-Keun Kwon
35600818,Network Pharmacology and Absolute Bacterial Quantification-Combined Approach to Explore the Mechanism of Tianqi Pingchan Granule Against 6-OHDA-Induced Parkinson's Disease in Rats.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. Tianqi Pingchan Granule (TPG) is a clinically effective formula of traditional Chinese medicine to treat PD. However, the therapeutic effect and underlying mechanisms of TPG in PD remain unclear. Based on network pharmacology, the corresponding targets of TPG were identified using the Traditional Chinese Medicine Database and Analysis Platform Database. Differentially expressed genes in PD were obtained from the Therapeutic Target Database, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, GeneCards, and DrugBank databases. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks of intersected targets were constructed using the STRING database and visualized using Cytoscape. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed, and the pathways directly related to the pathogenesis of PD were integrated manually. Furthermore, <i>in vivo</i> studies were carried out based on network pharmacology. The gut microbiota, peripheral inflammatory cytokines, and glia-mediated neuroinflammation in substantia nigra were evaluated. A total of 99 target genes were intersected between targets of TPG and deferentially expressed genes in PD. The PPI network analysis indicated the proinflammatory cytokine as essential targets. GO and KEGG analyses indicated that inflammatory response and its related signaling pathways were closely associated with TPG-mediated PD treatment. <i>In vivo</i> studies revealed that class Negativicutes and order Selenomonadales decreased, whereas class Mollicutes, order Enterobacteriales, and Mycoplasmatales increased in fecal samples of PD rats <i>via</i> 16S rRNA sequence analysis. Furthermore, the function prediction methods purposely revealed that TPG therapy may be involved in flavonoid biosynthesis, which have anti-inflammatory properties. In addition, <i>in vivo</i> studies revealed that TPG exposure was found to not only attenuate the production of peripheral inflammatory cytokines but also inhibit the activation of microglia and astrocytes in substantia nigra of PD rats. Through network pharmacology and <i>in vivo</i> experiment-combined approach, the mechanisms of TPG in the treatment of PD were revealed, and the role of TPG in the regulation of gut microbiota and inflammatory response was confirmed.",Frontiers in nutrition,2022,Zhihua Liu; Jiahao Zhao; Shuyuan Yang; Yu Zhang; Lu Song; Na Wu; Zhenguo Liu

There are evidences that nutraceutical supplementations can alter the commensal gut microbiota and help to prevent or fight against chronic non-communicable degenerative diseases in adults, including neurological disorders (Autism Spectrum Disorder [ASD], Parkinson's disease [PD], Multiple sclerosis [MS]) and metabolic disorders (Type-II diabetes, obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease). They can even lessen the complexities of preterm babies like extra-uterine growth restriction, necrotizing enterocolitis, infant eczema and allergy (during pregnancy) as well as bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Molecular perception of inflammatory and apoptotic modulators regulating the pathogenesis of these health risks, their control and management by probiotics and prebiotics could further emphasize the scientific overview of their utility. In this study, the pivotal role of nutraceutical supplementations in regulating or modulating molecular pathways in the above non-communicable diseases is briefly described. This work also gives an overall introduction of the sophisticated genome-editing techniques and advanced delivery systems in therapeutic activities applicable under these health risks.",Current pharmaceutical biotechnology,2022,Rout George Kerry; Gitishree Das; Upendarrao Golla; Maria Del Pilar Rodriguez-Torres; Han-Seung Shin; Jayanta Kumar Patra
36516809,Neurotensin-Binding Immunoglobulin G in Patients with Parkinson's Disease.,"Neurotensin (NTS) is a 13-amino acid neuropeptide functionally linked with the brain dopaminergic system via expression of the NTS peptide or its receptor in dopamine neurons. Neuropeptide-binding immunoglobulins (Igs) are present in humans and can be involved in both physiological and pathological processes. Considering the functional link between NTS and dopamine neurons, we studied the occurrence of NTS-binding IgG autoantibodies in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).Plasma levels of NTS-binding IgG were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in both male and female PD patents and in age-matched healthy controls. Possible microbial origin of NTS cross-reactive IgG was analyzed by sequence alignment of the 6-amino acid C-terminal NTS pharmacophore with bacterial and viral proteins from the public NCBI database.NTS-binding IgG were detected in the plasma of all study subjects, while their levels were consistently lower in PD patients versus controls (p = 0.0001), independently from age or sex of the study participants. Moreover, PD patients with a more severe stage (2.5-3.0) of the disease had lower levels of NTS-binding IgG (p = 0.0004) than those with a milder stage (1.0-2.0). Furthermore, PD patients taking amantadine or high doses of levodopa had higher levels of NTS-binding IgG than those without medication. Contiguous sequence homology for the NTS pharmacophore was present in several microbial proteins occurring in human gut microbiota.The study revealed that NTS-binding IgG occur naturally in humans and that PD patients display their low plasma levels accentuated by disease severity. The functional significance of this finding and its relevance to the pathophysiology of PD, including putative link to gut microbiota, remain to be studied.",Neuroimmunomodulation,2023,Zamira M Muruzheva; Daniil S Egorov; Margarita T Absalyamova; Dmitrii S Traktirov; Marina N Karpenko; Serguei O Fetissov
35272713,The microbiota restrains neurodegenerative microglia in a model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"The gut microbiota can affect neurologic disease by shaping microglia, the primary immune cell in the central nervous system (CNS). While antibiotics improve models of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and the C9orf72 model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), antibiotics worsen disease progression the in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> model of ALS. In ALS, microglia transition from a homeostatic to a neurodegenerative (MGnD) phenotype and contribute to disease pathogenesis, but whether this switch can be affected by the microbiota has not been investigated.In this short report, we found that a low-dose antibiotic treatment worsened motor function and decreased survival in the SOD1 mice, which is consistent with studies using high-dose antibiotics. We also found that co-housing SOD1 mice with wildtype mice had no effect on disease progression. We investigated changes in the microbiome and found that antibiotics reduced Akkermansia and butyrate-producing bacteria, which may be beneficial in ALS, and cohousing had little effect on the microbiome. To investigate changes in CNS resident immune cells, we sorted spinal cord microglia and found that antibiotics downregulated homeostatic genes and increased neurodegenerative disease genes in SOD1 mice. Furthermore, antibiotic-induced changes in microglia preceded changes in motor function, suggesting that this may be contributing to disease progression.Our findings suggest that the microbiota play a protective role in the SOD1 model of ALS by restraining MGnD microglia, which is opposite to other neurologic disease models, and sheds new light on the importance of disease-specific interactions between microbiota and microglia.

36615279,Potential Benefits of Anthocyanins in Chronic Disorders of the Central Nervous System.,"Anthocyanins have been shown to be effective in chronic diseases because of their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects together with changes in the gut microbiota and modulation of neuropeptides such as insulin-like growth factor-1. This review will examine whether these mechanisms may be effective to moderate the symptoms of disorders of the central nervous system in humans, including schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, autism spectrum disorder, depression, anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and epilepsy. Thus, anthocyanins from fruits and berries should be considered as complementary interventions to improve these chronic disorders.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,Sunil K Panchal; Lindsay Brown
35362965,Light-Sensitive <i>Lactococcus lactis</i> for Microbe-Gut-Brain Axis Regulating via Upconversion Optogenetic Micro-Nano System.,"The discovery of the gut-brain axis has proven that brain functions can be affected by the gut microbiota's metabolites, so there are significant opportunities to explore new tools to regulate gut microbiota and thus work on the brain functions. Meanwhile, engineered bacteria as oral live biotherapeutic agents to regulate the host's healthy homeostasis have attracted much attention in microbial therapy. However, whether this strategy is able to remotely regulate the host's brain function <i>in vivo</i> has not been investigated. Here, we engineered three blue-light-responsive probiotics as oral live biotherapeutic agents. They are spatiotemporally delivered and controlled by the upconversion optogenetic micro-nano system. This micro-nano system promotes the small intestine targeting and production of the exogenous <i>L. lactis</i> in the intestines, which realizes precise manipulation of brain functions including anxiety behavior, Parkinson's disease, and vagal afferent. The noninvasive and real-time probiotic intervention strategy makes the communiation from the gut to the host more controllable, which will enable the potential for engineered microbes accurately and effectively regulating a host's health.",ACS nano,2022,Huizhuo Pan; Tao Sun; Meihui Cui; Ning Ma; Chun Yang; Jing Liu; Gaoju Pang; Baona Liu; Lianyue Li; Xinyu Zhang; Weiwen Zhang; Jin Chang; Hanjie Wang
35563197,Bacteria-Derived Protein Aggregates Contribute to the Disruption of Host Proteostasis.,"Neurodegenerative protein conformational diseases are characterized by the misfolding and aggregation of metastable proteins encoded within the host genome. The host is also home to thousands of proteins encoded within exogenous genomes harbored by bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Yet, their contributions to host protein-folding homeostasis, or proteostasis, remain elusive. Recent studies, including our previous work, suggest that bacterial products contribute to the toxic aggregation of endogenous host proteins. We refer to these products as bacteria-derived protein aggregates (BDPAs). Furthermore, antibiotics were recently associated with an increased risk for neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-possibly by virtue of altering the composition of the human gut microbiota. Other studies have shown a negative correlation between disease progression and antibiotic administration, supporting their protective effect against neurodegenerative diseases. These contradicting studies emphasize the complexity of the human gut microbiota, the gut-brain axis, and the effect of antibiotics. Here, we further our understanding of bacteria's effect on host protein folding using the model <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. We employed genetic and chemical methods to demonstrate that the proteotoxic effect of bacteria on host protein folding correlates with the presence of BDPAs. Furthermore, the abundance and proteotoxicity of BDPAs are influenced by gentamicin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic that induces protein misfolding, and by butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid that we previously found to affect host protein aggregation and the associated toxicity. Collectively, these results increase our understanding of host-bacteria interactions in the context of protein conformational diseases.",International journal of molecular sciences,2022,Alyssa C Walker; Rohan Bhargava; Autumn S Dove; Amanda S Brust; Ali A Owji; Daniel M CzyÅ¼
36686268,High levels of <i>Bifidobacteriaceae</i> are associated with the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.,"The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is complex and there are no biomarkers for early identification. Many studies have reported altered gut microbiota in patients with PD compared with healthy individuals. However, results from previous studies vary across countries.The aim of this study was to identify gut microbiota biomarkers that could be used as a marker for the diagnosis of PD.Firstly, the differential gut microbiota was obtained by meta-analysis, and then the results of meta-analysis were validated through metagenomic cohort. Finally, the ROC curve was drawn based on the metagenomic validation results.The meta-analysis showed a lower relative abundance of <i>Prevotellaceae</i> (<i>p</i> < 0.00001) and <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.002), and a higher of <i>Ruminococcaceae</i> (<i>p</i> < 0.00001), <i>Christensenellaceae</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.03), <i>Bifidobacteriaceae</i> (<i>p</i> < 0.00001), and <i>Verrucomicrobiaceae</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.02) in patients with PD. Only <i>Bifidobacteriaceae</i> was also at high levels in the validation cohort of the metagenome. Meanwhile, three species from the <i>Bifidobacteriaceae</i>, including <i>Scardovia_inopinata</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.022), <i>Bifidobacterium_dentium</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.005), and <i>Scardovia_wiggsiae</i> (<i>p</i> = 0.024) were also high. The ROC curve showed that the three species (71.2%) from <i>Bifidobacteriaceae</i> had good predictive efficiency for PD.Elevated <i>Bifidobacteriaceae</i> may be associated with PD. Elevated three species from the <i>Bifidobacteriaceae</i>, including <i>Scardovia_inopinata</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium_dentium</i> and <i>Scardovia_wiggsiae</i> may provide new potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of PD.",Frontiers in integrative neuroscience,2022,ShuJia Zuo; HaiJing Wang; Qiang Zhao; Jie Tang; Min Wang; Yu Zhang; Ming Sang; Jing Tian; Puqing Wang
35924055,Neuroprotective Effects of Oligosaccharides From <i>Periplaneta Americana</i> on Parkinson's Disease Models <i>In Vitro</i> and <i>In Vivo</i>.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the neurodegenerative diseases that is characterized by obvious motor and some nonmotor symptoms. Various therapeutics failed in the effective treatment of PD because of impaired neurological function in the brain and various complications. <i>Periplaneta Americana</i> oligosaccharides (OPA), the main active ingredients extracted from the medicine residues of <i>Periplaneta Americana</i> (<i>P. Americana</i>), have been reported to exert anti-inflammatory effects. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the possible mechanisms of OPA against 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP<sup>+</sup>)-induced apotosis in SH-SY5Y cells and its potential neuroprotective effects in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD subacute model mice. The data demonstrated that OPA significantly reversed the MPP<sup>+</sup>-induced decrease in SH-SY5Y cell viability, reduced the proportion of apoptotic cells, and protected SH-SY5Y cells from apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner by regulating the expression of apoptosis-related genes. Furthermore, OPA also alleviated the motor dysfunction of PD model mice, prevented the loss of tyrosine hydroxylase positive cells, suppressed the apoptosis of substantia nigra cells, and improved the dysbiosis of gut microbiota <i>in vivo</i>, suggesting that OPA demonstrated a significantly neuroprotective effect on PD model mice. These results indicated that OPA might be the possibility of PD therapeutics with economic utility and high safety.",Frontiers in pharmacology,2022,Miao-Miao Liu; Nan Zhou; Na Jiang; Kai-Min Lu; Chuan-Fang Wu; Jin-Ku Bao
36110534,Global trends in research on miRNA-microbiome interaction from 2011 to 2021: A bibliometric analysis.,"An increasing number of research suggests that the microRNA (miRNA)-microbiome interaction plays an essential role in host health and diseases. This bibliometric analysis aimed to identify the status of global scientific output, research hotspots, and frontiers regarding the study of miRNA-microbiome interaction over the past decade. We retrieved miRNA-microbiome-related studies published from 2011 to 2021 from the Web of Science Core Collection database; the R package bibliometrix was used to analyze bibliometric indicators, and VOSviewer was used to visualize the field status, hotspots, and research trends of miRNA-microbiome interplay. In total, 590 articles and reviews were collected. A visual analysis of the results showed that significant increase in the number of publications over time. China produced the most papers, and the United States contributed the highest number of citations. Shanghai Jiaotong University and the University of California Davis were the most active institutions in the field. Most publications were published in the areas of biochemistry and molecular biology. Yu Aiming was the most prolific writer, as indicated by the h-index and m-index, and Liu Shirong was the most commonly co-cited author. A paper published in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences in 2017 had the highest number of citations. The keywords ""expression"" and ""gut microbiota"" appeared most frequently, and the top three groups of diseases that appeared among keywords were cancer (colorectal, et al.), inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), and neurological disorders (anxiety, Parkinson's disease, et al.). This bibliometric study revealed that most studies have focused on miRNAs (e.g., miR-21, miR-155, and miR-146a), gut microbes (e.g., <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, and <i>Fusobacterium nucleatum</i>), and gut bacteria metabolites (e.g., butyric acid), which have the potential to improve the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of diseases. We found that therapeutic strategies targeting the miRNA-microbiome axis focus on miRNA drugs produced <i>in vitro</i>; however, some studies suggest that <i>in vivo</i> fermentation can greatly increase the stability and reduce the degradation of miRNA. Therefore, this method is worthy of further research.",Frontiers in pharmacology,2022,Xiang-Yun Yan; Jun-Peng Yao; Yan-Qiu Li; Wei Zhang; Meng-Han Xi; Min Chen; Ying Li
35127957,Molecular and pharmacological aspects of piperine as a potential molecule for disease prevention and management: evidence from clinical trials.,"Piperine is a type of amide alkaloid that exhibits pleiotropic properties like antioxidant, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antihypertensive, hepatoprotective, neuroprotective and enhancing bioavailability and fertility-related activities. Piperine has the ability to alter gastrointestinal disorders, drug-metabolizing enzymes, and bioavailability of several drugs. The present review explores the available clinical and preclinical data, nanoformulations, extraction process, structure-activity relationships, molecular docking, bioavailability enhancement of phytochemicals and drugs, and brain penetration properties of piperine in the prevention, management, and treatment of various diseases and disorders.Piperine provides therapeutic benefits in patients suffering from diabetes, obesity, arthritis, oral cancer, breast cancer, multiple myeloma, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, cerebral stroke, cardiovascular diseases, kidney diseases, inflammatory diseases, and rhinopharyngitis. The molecular basis for the pleiotropic activities of piperine is based on its ability to regulate multiple signaling molecules such as cell cycle proteins, anti-apoptotic proteins, P-glycoprotein, cytochrome P450 3A4, multidrug resistance protein 1, breast cancer resistance protein, transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 proinflammatory cytokine, nuclear factor-ÎºB, c-Fos, cAMP response element-binding protein, activation transcription factor-2, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma, Human G-quadruplex DNA, Cyclooxygenase-2, Nitric oxide synthases-2, MicroRNA, and coronaviruses. Piperine also regulates multiple signaling pathways such as Akt/mTOR/MMP-9, 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase-activated NLR family pyrin domain containing-3 inflammasome, voltage-gated K+ current, PKCÎ±/ERK1/2, NF-ÎºB/AP-1/MMP-9, Wnt/Î²-catenin, JNK/P38 MAPK, and gut microbiota.Based on the current evidence, piperine can be the potential molecule for treatment of disease, and its significance of this molecule in the clinic is discussed.",Beni-Suef University journal of basic and applied sciences,2022,Amit Kumar Tripathi; Anup Kumar Ray; Sunil Kumar Mishra
36687704,Mechanisms of the <i>Ping-wei-san plus</i> herbal decoction against Parkinson's disease: Multiomics analyses.,"Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder involving loss of dopaminergic neurons. Multiple studies implicate the microbiota-gut-brain axis in Parkinson's disease pathophysiology. <i>Ping-wei-san plus</i> Herbal Decoction, a traditional Chinese medicine composition with beneficial effects in Parkinson's disease, may have a complex array of actions. Here we sought to determine whether gut microbiota and metabolic pathways are involved in <i>Ping-wei-san plus</i> herbal therapy for Parkinson's disease and to identify functional pathways to guide research.The model of Parkinson's disease were induced with the rotenone. The <i>Ping-wei-san plus</i> group received the PWP herbal decoction for 90 days, after which all groups were analyzed experimentally. PWP herbal treatment improved motor behavior and emotional performance, balanced gut microbiota, and benefited dietary metabolism. Tandem Mass Tags mass spectrometry identified many differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in the substantia nigra and duodenum in the PWP group, and these DEPs were enriched in pathways such as those involving cAMP signaling, glutamatergic synapses, dopaminergic synapses, and ribosome-rich functions in the gut. The PWP group showed increases in recombinant tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase 3, and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine rich repeat, and pyrin domain containing proteins 6 in the substantia nigra and decreased parkin, gasdermin D, recombinant tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase 3, and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine rich repeat and pyrin domain containing proteins 6 in the duodenum.In conclusion, this study combined gut microbiota, metabolomics, and proteomics to evaluate the mechanism of action of <i>Ping-wei-san plus</i> on Parkinson's disease and revealed that PWP herbal treatment modulated gut microbiota, altered metabolite biological pathways, and affected functional pathway protein expression in Parkinson's disease mice, resulting in therapeutic effects.",Frontiers in nutrition,2022,Ding Li; Hong-Juan You; Guo-Jie Hu; Ru-Yong Yao; An-Mu Xie; Xiao-Yuan Li
35257836,Central dopaminergic control of cell proliferation in the colonic epithelium.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease, mainly characterized by the loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra. Several non-motor symptoms, including those associated with gastrointestinal dysfunction, precede the classical motor symptoms in PD. However, the mechanisms underlying gastrointestinal dysfunction in the prodromal phase of PD remain elusive. Here, we investigated the contribution of the central DA system to cell proliferation in the colonic epithelium. Degeneration of nigrostriatal DA pathway induced by striatal 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) injection resulted in a marked reduction in cell proliferation in the colonic epithelium as assessed by Ki-67 and bromodeoxyuridine labeling assays. RNA-sequencing analysis confirmed the suppression of cell cycle-related gene expression in the colonic epithelium of 6-OHDA-lesioned mice. Mesencephalic DA neuron degeneration also caused the gut microbiota dysbiosis. Moreover, 6-OHDA-lesioned mice showed profoundly increased vulnerability to dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis. Together, our study uncovers a crucial role for the integrity of nigral DA neurons in the maintenance of colonic epithelial cell homeostasis. Our data also provide a new strategy for protecting intestinal homeostasis in PD.",Neuroscience research,2022,Shui Yu; Hai-Rong Peng; Yu-Kai Zhang; Yan-Qing Yin; Jia-Wei Zhou
36742204,Effects of a probiotic suspension Symproveâ¢ on a rat early-stage Parkinson's disease model.,"An increasing number of studies in recent years have focused on the role that the gut may play in Parkinson's Disease (PD) pathogenesis, suggesting that the maintenance of a healthy gut may lead to potential treatments of the disease. The health of microbiota has been shown to be directly associated with parameters that play a potential role in PD including gut barrier integrity, immunity, function, metabolism and the correct functioning of the gut-brain axis. The gut microbiota (GM) may therefore be employed as valuable indicators for early diagnosis of PD and potential targets for preventing or treating PD symptoms. Preserving the gut homeostasis using probiotics may therefore lead to a promising treatment strategy due to their known benefits in improving constipation, motor impairments, inflammation, and neurodegeneration. However, the mechanisms underlying the effects of probiotics in PD are yet to be clarified. In this project, we have tested the efficacy of an oral probiotic suspension, Symproveâ¢, on an established animal model of PD. Symproveâ¢, unlike many commercially available probiotics, has been shown to be resistant to gastric acidity, improve symptoms in gastrointestinal diseases and improve gut integrity in an <i>in vitro</i> PD model. In this study, we used an early-stage PD rat model to determine the effect of Symproveâ¢ on neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in the brain and on plasma cytokine levels, GM composition and short chain fatty acid (SCFA) release. Symproveâ¢ was shown to significantly influence both the gut and brain of the PD model. It preserved the gut integrity in the PD model, reduced plasma inflammatory markers and changed microbiota composition. The treatment also prevented the reduction in SCFAs and striatal inflammation and prevented tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive cell loss by 17% compared to that observed in animals treated with placebo. We conclude that Symproveâ¢ treatment may have a positive influence on the symptomology of early-stage PD with obvious implications for the improvement of gut integrity and possibly delaying/preventing the onset of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in human PD patients.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2022,Marco Sancandi; Carmen De Caro; Neringa Cypaite; Nadia Marascio; Carmen Avagliano; Carmela De Marco; Emilio Russo; Andrew Constanti; Audrey Mercer
36551872,Milmed Yeast Alters the LPS-Induced M1 Microglia Cells to Form M2 Anti-Inflammatory Phenotype.,"Microglial cells polarized towards a proinflammatory phenotype are considered the main cellular players of neuroinflammation, underlying several neurodegenerative diseases. Many studies have suggested that imbalance of the gut microbial composition is associated with an increase in the pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress that underlie chronic neuroinflammatory diseases, and perturbations to the gut microbiota were detected in neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. The importance of gut-brain axis has been uncovered and the relevance of an appropriate microbiota balance has been highlighted. Probiotic treatment, rebalancing the gut microbioma, may reduce inflammation. We show that Milmed yeast, obtained from <i>S. cerevisiae</i> after exposure to electromagnetic millimeter wavelengths, induces a reversal of LPS-M1 polarized microglia towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype, as demonstrated morphologically by the recovery of resting phenotype by microglia, by the decrease in the mRNAs of IL-1Î², IL-6, TNF-Î± and in the expression of iNOS. Moreover, Milmed stimulated the secretion of IL-10 and the expression of Arginase-1, cell markers of M2 anti-inflammatory polarized cells. The present findings data suggest that Milmed may be considered to be a probiotic with diversified anti-inflammatory activity, capable of directing the polarization of microglial cells.",Biomedicines,2022,Federica Armeli; Beatrice Mengoni; Elisa Maggi; Cristina Mazzoni; Adele Preziosi; Patrizia Mancini; Rita Businaro; Thomas Lenz; Trevor Archer
35466109,Effects of Subdiaphragmatic Vagotomy in the MPTP-induced Neurotoxicity in the Striatum and Colon of Mice.,"Gut-microbiota-brain axis plays a role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). The subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve serves as a major modulatory pathway between the gut microbiota and the brain. However, the role of subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve in PD pathogenesis are unknown. Here, we investigated the effects of subdiaphragmatic vagotomy (SDV) on the neurotoxicity in the mouse striatum and colon after administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6- tetrahydropyridine (MPTP).Sham or SVD was performed. Subsequently, saline or MPTP (10 mg/kg Ã 3, 2-hour interval) was administered to mice. Western blot analysis of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine transporter (DAT) in the striatum and phosphorylated Î±-synuclein (p-Î±-Syn) in the colon was performed.Repeated administration of MPTP significantly caused reduction of TH and DAT in the striatum and increase of p-Î±-Syn in the colon of mice. However, SDV did not affect the reduction of TH and DAT in the striatum and increases in p-Î±-Syn in the colon after repeated MPTP administration.These data suggest that subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve doses not play a role in the MPTP-induced neurotoxicity in the brain and colon.",Clinical psychopharmacology and neuroscience : the official scientific journal of the Korean College of Neuropsychopharmacology,2022,Jiajing Shan; Youge Qu; Jiancheng Zhang; Li Ma; Kenji Hashimoto
36168204,<i>Agathobaculum butyriciproducens</i> Shows Neuroprotective Effects in a 6-OHDA-Induced Mouse Model of Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second-most prevalent neurodegenerative disease and is characterized by dopaminergic neuronal death in the midbrain. Recently, the association between alterations in PD pathology and the gut microbiota has been explored. Microbiota-targeted interventions have been suggested as a novel therapeutic approach for PD. <i>Agathobaculum butyriciproducens</i> SR79<sup>T</sup> (SR79) is an anaerobic bacterium. Previously, we showed that SR79 treatment induced cognitive improvement and reduced Alzheimer's disease pathologies in a mouse model. In this study, we hypothesized that SR79 treatment may have beneficial effects on PD pathology. To investigate the therapeutic effects of SR79 on PD, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced mouse models were used. D-Amphetamine sulfate (d-AMPH)-induced behavioral rotations and dopaminergic cell death were analyzed in unilateral 6-OHDA-lesioned mice. Treatment with SR79 significantly decreased ipsilateral rotations induced by d-AMPH. Moreover, SR79 treatment markedly activated the AKT/GSK3Î² signaling pathway in the striatum. In addition, SR79 treatment affected the Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway and its downstream target genes in the striatum of 6-OHDA-lesioned mice. Our findings suggest a protective role of SR79 in 6-OHDA-induced toxicity by regulating the AKT/Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway and astrocyte activation. Thus, SR79 may be a potential microbe-based intervention and therapeutic strategy for PD.",Journal of microbiology and biotechnology,2022,Da Woon Lee; Young-Kyoung Ryu; Dong-Ho Chang; Hye-Yeon Park; Jun Go; So-Young Maeng; Dae Youn Hwang; Byoung-Chan Kim; Chul-Ho Lee; Kyoung-Shim Kim
36698474,"The different trends in the burden of neurological and mental disorders following dietary transition in China, the USA, and the world: An extension analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019.","The highly processed western diet is substituting the low-processed traditional diet in the last decades globally. Increasing research found that a diet with poor quality such as western diet disrupts gut microbiota and increases the susceptibility to various neurological and mental disorders, while a balanced diet regulates gut microbiota and prevents and alleviates the neurological and mental disorders. Yet, there is limited research on the association between the disease burden expanding of neurological and mental disorders with a dietary transition.We compared the disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) trend by age for neurological and mental disorders in China, in the United States of America (USA), and across the world from 1990 to 2019, evaluated the dietary transition in the past 60 years, and analyzed the association between the burden trend of the two disorders with the changes in diet composition and food production.We identified an age-related upward pattern in disease burden in China. Compared with the USA and the world, the Chinese neurological and mental disorders DALY percent was least in the generation over 75 but rapidly increased in younger generations and surpassed the USA and/or the world in the last decades. The age-related upward pattern in Chinese disease burdens had not only shown in the presence of cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms, and diabetes mellitus but also appeared in the presence of depressive disorders, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, schizophrenia, headache disorders, anxiety disorders, conduct disorders, autism spectrum disorders, and eating disorders, successively. Additionally, the upward trend was associated with the dramatic dietary transition including a reduction in dietary quality and food production sustainability, during which the younger generation is more affected than the older. Following the increase in total calorie intake, alcohol intake, ratios of animal to vegetal foods, and poultry meat to pulses, the burdens of the above diseases continuously rose. Then, following the rise of the ratios of meat to pulses, eggs to pulses, and pork to pulses, the usage of fertilizers, the farming density of pigs, and the burdens of the above disease except diabetes mellitus were also ever-increasing. Even the usage of pesticides was positively correlated with the burdens of Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, cardiovascular diseases, and neoplasms. Contrary to China, the corresponding burdens of the USA trended to reduce with the improvements in diet quality and food production sustainability.Our results suggest that improving diet quality and food production sustainability might be a promising way to stop the expanding burdens of neurological and mental disorders.",Frontiers in nutrition,2022,Shan Liang; Li Wang; Xiaoli Wu; Xu Hu; Tao Wang; Feng Jin
35917710,Fecal microbiome transplantation attenuates manganese-induced neurotoxicity through regulation of the apelin signaling pathway by inhibition of autophagy in mouse brain.,"Manganese (Mn) is a common environmental pollutant. Mn exposure can lead to neurodegenerative diseases resembling Parkinson's disease, and has become a major public health concern. However, the mechanism of Mn-induced neurotoxicity in the brain is not clear. Fecal microbiome transplantation (FMT) may alleviate the neurotoxicity of Mn exposure by remodeling the gut microbiota. In this study, MnCl<sub>2</sub> (manganese chloride) was administered to mice as in drinking water (Mn: 200Â mg/L), and fecal matter from donor mice was administered by oral gavage every other day to the recipient mice. The Mn exposure model (Mn group) and FMT model (Mn+FMT group) were established and analyzed 5 weeks post-exposure. The Wipi1 gene exhibited the most significant increase associated with Mn exposure and Mn+FMT treatment groups based on transcriptome analysis. Combined analysis of transcriptomics and proteomics demonstrated that the apelin signaling pathway is the main pathway affected by FMT during Mn exposure. Immunofluorescence and Western blot showed that the expression of key proteins (Beclin-1, LC-3B, and PINK1) associated with autophagy in the hippocampus was robustly activated in the Mn exposure group, but attenuation was observed in Mn+FMT mice, suggesting a critical role of autophagy in neurotoxicity induced by Mn exposure. Our research provides evidence for the neurotoxic effects of Mn exposure through autophagy activation and provides an underlying mechanism of FMT protection against Mn-induced neurotoxicity through regulation of the apelin signaling pathway.",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2022,Jingjing Liu; Xin Zhang; Xiaojuan Ta; Miaomiao Luo; Xuhong Chang; Hui Wang
35243260,<i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> induces mitochondrial calcium overload and Î± -synuclein aggregation in an enteroendocrine cell line.,"The gut microbiota influence neurodevelopment, modulate behavior, and contribute to neurodegenerative disorders. Several studies have consistently reported a greater abundance of <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> in Parkinson disease (PD) fecal samples. Therefore, we investigated whether <i>A.muciniphila</i>-conditioned medium (CM) could initiate Î±-synuclein (Î±Syn) misfolding in enteroendocrine cells (EEC) - a component of the gut epithelium featuring neuron-like properties. We found that <i>A</i>. <i>muciniphila</i> CM composition is influenced by the ability of the strain to degrade mucin. Our <i>inÂ vitro</i> experiments showed that the protein-enriched fraction of mucin-free CM induces RyR-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and increased mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake leading to ROS generation and Î±Syn aggregation. Oral administration of <i>A.Â muciniphila</i> cultivated in the absence of mucin to mice ledÂ to Î±Syn aggregation in cholecystokinin (CCK)-positive EECs but no motor deficitsÂ were observed.

36455673,"Exercise training has a protective effect in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine mice model with improved neural and intestinal pathology and modified intestinal flora.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease with the exact etiology still unclear, but gut microbial disorders are thought to be related to the initiation and progression of it. Exercise training has a significant effect on the intestinal flora, so to investigate the promotion effect of exercise training on Parkinson's disease, we performed a rotarod walking training (5 times a week at 25Â rpm for 20Â min for 8 weeks) on a chronic mouse model of Parkinson's disease induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and observed the locomotor function of mice, function of dopaminergic neurons, intestinal mucosal barrier condition, intestinal inflammation and the structure and composition of intestinal flora. The results showed in these PD mice, exercise training improved their motility, increased the dopamine (DA) content in the striatum, along with promoted the gene expression of tyrosine hydroxylase and brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the striatum, which suggests this exercise training might protect striatal dopaminergic neurons from MPTP damage; the results also showed exercise training promoted recovery from ileal pathology, reduced the gene expression of intestinal inflammatory factors, and significantly altered the composition and structure of the intestinal flora in these mice.",Behavioural brain research,2023,Yongjun Wang; Zhengjia Pu; Yiran Zhang; Zhaohui Du; Zeming Guo; Qunhua Bai
35400445,Polymannuronic acid prebiotic plus Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG probiotic as a novel synbiotic promoted their separate neuroprotection against Parkinson's disease.,"Gut microbiota (GM) dysbiosis plays key roles in aggravating Parkinson's disease (PD) and discovery of agents targeting GM may open new avenues for PD therapy. This study aims to investigate the potentially neuroprotective effects and underlying mechanisms of polymannuronic acid (PM) or Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), or their combination in a chronic PD mice model. Our results found oral administration of prebiotic PM or LGG separately or in combination for 5Â weeks could prevent dopaminergic neuronal loss via improving reduced walking distance and activity or weakened muscle strength in behavior tests by enhancing tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene and/or protein expressions in the midbrain and striatum of PD mice. Strikingly, PM and LGG in combination had a much better neuroprotective effects than separate PM or LGG. PM provided neuroprotection via a short chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-mediated anti-inflammation and anti-apoptosis mechanism. The neuroprotective effects of LGG might be associated with its ability to improve the expression of striatal glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and to increase bacteria abundance of Clostridiales. When PD mice were administered with PMÂ +Â LGG, PM as prebiotic favored bacterial growth (from Bacilli class to Lactobacillus genus) in the colon, which helped to improve blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity and increase brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and GDNF expressions, thereby inhibiting apoptosis in the striatum. In conclusion, PM and LGG in combination promoted their separate neuroprotection against PD. Our study discovered and testified a novel synbiotic that might be one of the ideal oral agents for PD therapy.","Food research international (Ottawa, Ont.)",2022,Xin Liu; Zhong Rui Du; Xiong Wang; Xiang Rong Sun; Qing Zhao; Fang Zhao; Wing Tak Wong; Ka Hing Wong; Xiao-Li Dong
38098067,Parkinson's disease and gut microbiota: from clinical to mechanistic and therapeutic studies.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases. The typical symptomatology of PD includes motor symptoms; however, a range of nonmotor symptoms, such as intestinal issues, usually occur before the motor symptoms. Various microorganisms inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract can profoundly influence the physiopathology of the central nervous system through neurological, endocrine, and immune system pathways involved in the microbiota-gut-brain axis. In addition, extensive evidence suggests that the gut microbiota is strongly associated with PD. This review summarizes the latest findings on microbial changes in PD and their clinical relevance, describes the underlying mechanisms through which intestinal bacteria may mediate PD, and discusses the correlations between gut microbes and anti-PD drugs. In addition, this review outlines the status of research on microbial therapies for PD and the future directions of PD-gut microbiota research.",Translational neurodegeneration,2023,Xuxiang Zhang; Beisha Tang; Jifeng Guo
37159496,Associations between gut microbiota and Parkinson disease: AÂ bidirectional Mendelian randomization analysis.,"Parkinson disease (PD)-associated alterations in the gut microbiome have been observed in clinical and animal studies. However, it remains unclear whether this association reflects a causal effect in humans.We performed two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization using summary statistics from the international consortium MiBioGen (Nâ=â18,340), the Framingham Heart Study (Nâ=â2076), and the International Parkinson's Disease Genomics Consortium for PD (33,674 cases and 449,056 controls) and PD age at onset (17,996 cases).Twelve microbiota features presented suggestive associations with PD risk or age at onset. Genetically increased Bifidobacterium levels correlated with decreased PD risk (odds ratioâ=â0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] =â0.60-0.99, pâ=â0.040). Conversely, high levels of five short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria (LachnospiraceaeUCG010, RuminococcaceaeUCG002, Clostridium sensustricto1, Eubacterium hallii group, and Bacillales) correlated with increased PD risk, and three SCFA-producing bacteria (Roseburia, RuminococcaceaeUCG002, and Erysipelatoclostridium) correlated with an earlier age at PD onset. Gut production of serotonin was associated with an earlier age at PD onset (beta = -0.64, 95% CI = -1.15 to -0.13, pâ=â0.013). In the reverse direction, genetic predisposition to PD was related to altered gut microbiota composition.These results support a bidirectional relationship between gut microbiome dysbiosis and PD, and highlight the role of elevated endogenous SCFAs and serotonin in PD pathogenesis. Future clinical studies and experimental evidence are needed to explain the observed associations and to suggest new therapeutic approaches, such as dietary probiotic supplementation.",European journal of neurology,2023,Li Jiang; Jin-Chen Li; Bei-Sha Tang; Ji-Feng Guo
37404311,Signalling cognition: the gut microbiota and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.,"Cognitive function in humans depends on the complex and interplay between multiple body systems, including the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The gut microbiota, which vastly outnumbers human cells and has a genetic potential that exceeds that of the human genome, plays a crucial role in this interplay. The microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis is a bidirectional signalling pathway that operates through neural, endocrine, immune, and metabolic pathways. One of the major neuroendocrine systems responding to stress is the HPA axis which produces glucocorticoids such as cortisol in humans and corticosterone in rodents. Appropriate concentrations of cortisol are essential for normal neurodevelopment and function, as well as cognitive processes such as learning and memory, and studies have shown that microbes modulate the HPA axis throughout life. Stress can significantly impact the MGB axis <i>via</i> the HPA axis and other pathways. Animal research has advanced our understanding of these mechanisms and pathways, leading to a paradigm shift in conceptual thinking about the influence of the microbiota on human health and disease. Preclinical and human trials are currently underway to determine how these animal models translate to humans. In this review article, we summarize the current knowledge of the relationship between the gut microbiota, HPA axis, and cognition, and provide an overview of the main findings and conclusions in this broad field.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2023,Jody A Rusch; Brian T Layden; Lara R Dugas
36593694,Gut microbiota dysbiosis in Parkinson disease: A systematic review and pooled analysis.,"The role of the gut microbiome in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease (PD) is under intense investigation, and the results presented are still very heterogeneous. These discrepancies arise not only from the highly heterogeneous pathology of PD, but also from widely varying methodologies at all stages of the workflow, from sampling to final statistical analysis. The aim of the present work is to harmonize the workflow across studies to reduce the methodological heterogeneity and to perform a pooled analysis to account for other sources of heterogeneity.We performed a systematic review to identify studies comparing the gut microbiota of PD patients to healthy controls. A workflow was designed to harmonize processing across all studies from bioinformatics processing to final statistical analysis using a Bayesian random-effects meta-analysis based on individual patient-level data.The results show that harmonizing workflows minimizes differences between statistical methods and reveals only a small set of taxa being associated with the pathogenesis of PD. Increased shares of the genera Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium and decreased shares of the genera Roseburia and Faecalibacterium were most characteristic for PD-associated microbiota.Our study summarizes evidence that reduced levels of butyrate-producing taxa in combination with possible degradation of the mucus layer by Akkermansia may promote intestinal inflammation and reduced permeability of the gut mucosal layer. This may allow potentially pathogenic metabolites to transit and enter the enteric nervous system.",European journal of neurology,2023,Sven Kleine Bardenhorst; Emanuele Cereda; Marco Severgnini; Michela Barichella; Gianni Pezzoli; Ali Keshavarzian; Alessandro Desideri; Daniele Pietrucci; Velma T E Aho; Filip Scheperjans; Falk Hildebrand; Severin Weis; Markus Egert; AndrÃ© Karch; Marius Vital; Nicole RÃ¼bsamen
37892440,Gut Microbiota Composition in Patients with Neurodegenerative Disorders (Parkinson's and Alzheimer's) and Healthy Controls: A Systematic Review.,"This systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current literature regarding gut microbiota composition in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared to healthy controls. To identify the relevant studies, a thorough search of PubMed, Medline, and Embase was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. Out of 5627 articles, 73 studies were assessed for full-text eligibility, which led to the inclusion of 42 studies (26 PD and 16 AD studies). The risk of bias assessment showed a medium risk in 32 studies (20 PD studies and 12 AD studies), a low risk in 9 studies (5 PD studies and 4 AD studies), and 1 PD study with a high risk. Among the PD studies, 22 out of 26 studies reported a different gut microbiota composition between the PD cases and the healthy controls, and 15 out of 16 AD studies reported differences in gut microbiota composition between the AD cases and the healthy controls. The PD and AD studies consistently identified the phyla Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria as prevalent in the gut microbiota in both the healthy groups and the case groups. Microbial dysbiosis was specifically characterized in the PD studies by a high abundance of <i>Akkermansia</i>, <i>Verrucomicrobiaceae</i>, <i>Lachnospiraceae</i>, and <i>Ruminococcaceae</i> in the cases and a high abundance of <i>Blautia</i>, <i>Coprococcus</i>, <i>Prevotellaceae</i>, and <i>Roseburia</i> in the controls. Similarly, Bacteroides and Acidobacteriota were abundant in the AD cases, and <i>Acidaminococcaceae</i>, Firmicutes, <i>Lachnospiraceae</i>, and <i>Ruminiclostridium</i> were abundant in the AD controls. The microbial signature assessment showed the association of several microbial taxa, including <i>Akkermansia</i>, <i>Lachnospiraceae</i>, <i>Verrucomicrobiaceae</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, <i>Ruminococcacea</i>, and Verrucomicrobia with PD and <i>Ruminococcaceae</i>, <i>Bacteroides</i>, and Actinobacteria with AD. The microbial diversity evaluations in the PD and AD studies indicated comparable alpha diversity in some groups and distinct gut microbiota composition in others, with consistent beta diversity differences between the cases and the controls across multiple studies. The bacterial signatures identified in this study that are associated with PD and AD may offer promising prospects for efficient management and treatment approaches.",Nutrients,2023,Fatemah Sadeghpour Heravi; Kaveh Naseri; Honghua Hu
37208728,Dysbiosis of gut microbiota inhibits NMNAT2 to promote neurobehavioral deficits and oxidative stress response in the 6-OHDA-lesioned rat model of Parkinson's disease.,"New data are accumulating on gut microbial dysbiosis in Parkinson's disease (PD), while the specific mechanism remains uncharacterized. This study aims to investigate the potential role and pathophysiological mechanism of dysbiosis of gut microbiota in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced PD rat models.The shotgun metagenome sequencing data of fecal samples from PD patients and healthy individuals were obtained from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database. The diversity, abundance, and functional composition of gut microbiota were further analyzed in these data. After the exploration of the functional pathway-related genes, KEGG and GEO databases were used to obtain PD-related microarray datasets for differential expression analysis. Finally, in vivo experiments were performed to confirm the roles of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and upregulated NMNAT2 in neurobehavioral symptoms and oxidative stress response in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats.Significant differences were found in the diversity, abundance, and functional composition of gut microbiota between PD patients and healthy individuals. Dysbiosis of gut microbiota could regulate NAD<sup>+</sup> anabolic pathway to affect the occurrence and development of PD. As a NAD<sup>+</sup> anabolic pathway-related gene, NMNAT2 was poorly expressed in the brain tissues of PD patients. More importantly, FMT or overexpression of NMNAT2 alleviated neurobehavioral deficits and reduced oxidative stress in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats.Taken together, we demonstrated that dysbiosis of gut microbiota suppressed NMNAT2 expression, thus exacerbating neurobehavioral deficits and oxidative stress response in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, which could be rescued by FMT or NMNAT2 restoration.",Journal of neuroinflammation,2023,Jianjun Yu; Jianhong Meng; Zhengwei Qin; Yuan Yu; Yingxin Liang; Yanjun Wang; Dongmei Min

37600019,The gut microbiota-brain axis in neurological disorder.,"The gut microbiota (GM) plays an important role in the physiology and pathology of the host. Microbiota communicate with different organs of the organism by synthesizing hormones and regulating body activity. The interaction of the central nervous system (CNS) and gut signaling pathways includes chemical, neural immune and endocrine routes. Alteration or dysbiosis in the gut microbiota leads to different gastrointestinal tract disorders that ultimately impact host physiology because of the abnormal microbial metabolites that stimulate and trigger different physiologic reactions in the host body. Intestinal dysbiosis leads to a change in the bidirectional relationship between the CNS and GM, which is linked to the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental and neurological disorders. Increasing preclinical and clinical studies/evidence indicate that gut microbes are a possible susceptibility factor for the progression of neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In this review, we discuss the crucial connection between the gut microbiota and the central nervous system, the signaling pathways of multiple biological systems and the contribution of gut microbiota-related neurological disorders.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2023,Hanif Ullah; Safia Arbab; Yali Tian; Chang-Qing Liu; Yuwen Chen; Li Qijie; Muhammad Inayat Ullah Khan; Inam Ul Hassan; Ka Li
37913731,"Flavonoids: Their putative neurologic roles, epigenetic changes, and gut microbiota alterations in Parkinson's disease.","Parkinson's Disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by the degeneration of progressive dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra region of the human midbrain. Although just what causes PD remains a mystery, it is known that oxidative stress (OS) as well as mitochondrial dysfunction, neuro-inflammation, and insufficient neurotrophic support play a role in the disease's pathophysiology. Phytochemicals are a diverse small molecule group derived from plants that can be classified into numerous classes on the basis of their biological activities and chemical structure. Of these groups of phytochemicals, the most abundant, which has well-established anti-Parkinson's effects, are polyphenols. Flavonoids, including naringin and naringenin, genistein, kaempferol, anthocyanins, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, and baicalein are plant-based biologically active polyphenols, which have been shown to exhibit therapeutic potential when used as treatment for a variety of pathological illnesses, such as neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) and PD. Recently, it was reported that flavonoids have beneficial effects on PD, such as the protection of DA neurons, improvement of motor and cognitive abilities, regulation of signaling pathways, and modulation of OS and neuro-inflammation. In addition, by changing the composition of bacteria in gut microbiota, flavonoids reduce pathogenic strains and promote the growth of beneficial strains. In this context, the current paper will provide a literature review on the neurological roles that flavonoids play, as one of the most abundant phytochemical families, in PD.",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2023,Yasemin AÃ§ar; Duygu AÄagÃ¼ndÃ¼z; Paola De Cicco; Raffaele Capasso
37823531,Role of Bmal1 and Gut Microbiota in Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease Pathophysiology: The Probable Effect of Melatonin on Their Association.,"In recent years, the role of new factors in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases has been investigated. Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are the most common neurodegenerative diseases worldwide. Although pathological changes such as the accumulation of aggregated proteins in the brain and inflammatory responses are known as the main factors involved in the development of these diseases, new studies show the role of gut microbiota and circadian rhythm in the occurrence of these changes. However, the association between circadian rhythm and gut microbiota in AD and PD has not yet been investigated. Recent results propose that alterations in circadian rhythm regulators, mainly Bmal1, may regulate the abundance of gut microbiota. This correlation has been linked to the regulation of the expression of immune-related genes and Bmal-1 mediated oscillation of IgA and hydrogen peroxide production. These data seem to provide new insight into the molecular mechanism of melatonin inhibiting the progression of AD and PD. Therefore, this manuscript aims to review the role of the gut microbiota and circadian rhythm in health and AD and PD and also presents a hypothesis on the effect of melatonin on their communication.",ACS chemical neuroscience,2023,Mohammad Rafi Khezri; Ayda Esmaeili; Morteza Ghasemnejad-Berenji
36934020,Oral and intestinal dysbiosis in Parkinson's disease.,"The suspicion of an origin of Parkinson's disease (PD) at the periphery of the body and the involvement of environmental risk factors in the pathogenesis of PD have directed the attention of the scientific community towards the microbiota. The microbiota represents all the microorganisms residing both in and on a host. It plays an essential role in the physiological functioning of the host. In this article, we review the dysbiosis repeatedly demonstrated in PD and how it influences PD symptoms. Dysbiosis is associated with both motor and non-motor PD symptoms. In animal models, dysbiosis only promotes symptoms in individuals genetically susceptible to Parkinson's disease, suggesting that dysbiosis is a risk factor but not a cause of Parkinson's disease. We also review how dysbiosis contributes to the pathophysiology of PD. Dysbiosis induces numerous and complex metabolic changes, resulting in increased intestinal permeability, local and systemic inflammation, production of bacterial amyloid proteins that promote Î±-synuclein aggregation, as well as a decrease in short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria that have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective potential. In addition, we review how dysbiosis decreases the efficacy of dopaminergic treatments. We then discuss the interest of dysbiosis analysis as a biomarker of Parkinson's disease. Finally, we give an overview of how interventions modulating the gut microbiota such as dietary interventions, pro-biotics, intestinal decontamination and fecal microbiota transplantation could influence the course of PD.",Revue neurologique,2023,E Berthouzoz; V Lazarevic; A Zekeridou; M Castro; I Debove; S Aybek; J Schrenzel; P R Burkhard; V Fleury
37967548,Gut Frailty: Its Concept and Pathogenesis.,"There is still a considerable gap between average life expectancy and healthy life expectancy in Japan. Recent research has revealed that gut frailty may be a worsening factor for various diseases, a cause of chronic inflammation, and a precursor to frailty.Among self-reported symptoms, constipation is particularly significant as one of the key symptoms of gut frailty. Studies have demonstrated that individuals with constipation have significantly lower survival rates and are also at a higher risk of developing various diseases such as chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's disease. Various molecular mechanisms could contribute to gut frailty, and the decrease in mucus secretion is an extremely early-stage pathology. Dysbiosis of gut microbiota has a major impact on many conditions associated with gut frailty. Prebiotics, probiotics, post-biotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation are under investigation as a treatment option for gut frailty.Although the concept of gut frailty has not yet gained widespread recognition, we hope to propose more practical screening methods, diagnostic approaches, and specific interventions in the future.",Digestion,2024,Yuji Naito

Interventions targeting the gut microbiota in PD, including the use of prebiotics, probiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation, have also shown efficacy in treating PD. However, the causal relationship between the gut microbiota and Parkinson's disease remains intricate. This study reviewed the association between the microbiota-gut-brain axis and PD from the perspectives of humoral pathway, cellular immune pathway and neuronal pathway.

37960284,Understanding the Gut-Brain Axis and Its Therapeutic Implications for Neurodegenerative Disorders.,"The gut-brain axis (GBA) is a complex bidirectional communication network connecting the gut and brain. It involves neural, immune, and endocrine communication pathways between the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the central nervous system (CNS). Perturbations of the GBA have been reported in many neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs), such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), among others, suggesting a possible role in disease pathogenesis. The gut microbiota is a pivotal component of the GBA, and alterations in its composition, known as gut dysbiosis, have been associated with GBA dysfunction and neurodegeneration. The gut microbiota might influence the homeostasis of the CNS by modulating the immune system and, more directly, regulating the production of molecules and metabolites that influence the nervous and endocrine systems, making it a potential therapeutic target. Preclinical trials manipulating microbial composition through dietary intervention, probiotic and prebiotic supplementation, and fecal microbial transplantation (FMT) have provided promising outcomes. However, its clear mechanism is not well understood, and the results are not always consistent.

37179826,Mitochondria: It is all about energy.,"Mitochondria play a key role in both health and disease. Their function is not limited to energy production but serves multiple mechanisms varying from iron and calcium homeostasis to the production of hormones and neurotransmitters, such as melatonin. They enable and influence communication at all physical levels through interaction with other organelles, the nucleus, and the outside environment. The literature suggests crosstalk mechanisms between mitochondria and circadian clocks, the gut microbiota, and the immune system. They might even be the hub supporting and integrating activity across all these domains. Hence, they might be the (missing) link in both health and disease. Mitochondrial dysfunction is related to metabolic syndrome, neuronal diseases, cancer, cardiovascular and infectious diseases, and inflammatory disorders. In this regard, diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), and chronic pain are discussed. This review focuses on understanding the mitochondrial mechanisms of action that allow for the maintenance of mitochondrial health and the pathways toward dysregulated mechanisms. Although mitochondria have allowed us to adapt to changes over the course of evolution, in turn, evolution has shaped mitochondria. Each evolution-based intervention influences mitochondria in its own way. The use of physiological stress triggers tolerance to the stressor, achieving adaptability and resistance. This review describes strategies that could recover mitochondrial functioning in multiple diseases, providing a comprehensive, root-cause-focused, integrative approach to recovering health and treating people suffering from chronic diseases.",Frontiers in physiology,2023,Amaloha Casanova; Anne Wevers; Santiago Navarro-Ledesma; Leo Pruimboom
37619773,The role of the indoles in microbiota-gut-brain axis and potential therapeutic targets: A focus on human neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases.,"At present, a large number of relevant studies have suggested that the changes in gut microbiota are related to the course of nervous system diseases, and the microbiota-gut-brain axis is necessary for the proper functioning of the nervous system. Indole and its derivatives, as the products of the gut microbiota metabolism of tryptophan, can be used as ligands to regulate inflammation and autoimmune response in vivo. In recent years, some studies have found that the levels of indole and its derivatives differ significantly between patients with central nervous system diseases and healthy individuals, suggesting that they may be important mediators for the involvement of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in the disease course. Tryptophan metabolites produced by gut microbiota are involved in multiple physiological reactions, take indole for example, it participates in the process of inflammation and anti-inflammatory effects through various cellular physiological activities mediated by aromatic hydrocarbon receptors (AHR), which can influence a variety of neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases. This review mainly explores and summarizes the relationship between indoles and human neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, including ischemic stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, cognitive impairment, depression and anxiety, and puts forward that the level of indoles can be regulated through various direct or indirect ways to improve the prognosis of central nervous system diseases and reverse the dysfunction of the microbiota-gut-brain axis.

37389240,Epidemiology of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.,"Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is defined as an increase in the bacterial content of the small intestine above normal values. The presence of SIBO is detected in 33.8% of patients with gastroenterological complaints who underwent a breath test, and is significantly associated with smoking, bloating, abdominal pain, and anemia. Proton pump inhibitor therapy is a significant risk factor for SIBO. The risk of SIBO increases with age and does not depend on gender or race. SIBO complicates the course of a number of diseases and may be of pathogenetic significance in the development of their symptoms. SIBO is significantly associated with functional dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome, functional abdominal bloating, functional constipation, functional diarrhea, short bowel syndrome, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, lactase deficiency, diverticular and celiac diseases, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, cirrhosis, metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), primary biliary cholangitis, gastroparesis, pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, gallstone disease, diabetes, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, acromegaly, multiple sclerosis, autism, Parkinson's disease, systemic sclerosis, spondylarthropathy, fibromyalgia, asthma, heart failure, and other diseases. The development of SIBO is often associated with a slowdown in orocecal transit time that decreases the normal clearance of bacteria from the small intestine. The slowdown of this transit may be due to motor dysfunction of the intestine in diseases of the gut, autonomic diabetic polyneuropathy, and portal hypertension, or a decrease in the motor-stimulating influence of thyroid hormones. In a number of diseases, including cirrhosis, MAFLD, diabetes, and pancreatitis, an association was found between disease severity and the presence of SIBO.

The gut microbiota can also influence the metabolism of levodopa, which is the mainstay of treatment of PD. Therefore, modifying the gut microbiota by faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) could be a supportive treatment strategy.We have developed a study protocol for a single-centre, prospective, self-controlled, interventional, safety and feasibility donor-FMT pilot study with randomisation and double-blinded allocation of donor faeces. The primary objectives are feasibility and safety of FMT in patients with PD. Secondary objectives include exploring whether FMT leads to alterations in motor complications (fluctuations and dyskinesias) and PD motor and non-motor symptoms (including constipation), determining alterations in gut microbiota composition, assessing donor-recipient microbiota similarities and their association with PD symptoms and motor complications, evaluating the ease of the study protocol and examining FMT-related adverse events in patients with PD. The study population will consist of 16 patients with idiopathic PD that use levodopa and experience motor complications. They will receive FMT with faeces from one of two selected healthy human donors. FMT will be administered via a gastroscope into the duodenum, after treatment with oral vancomycin, bowel lavage and domperidone.

37798868,Erythrocytic Î±-Synuclein and the Gut Microbiome: Kindling of the Gut-Brain Axis in Parkinson's Disease.,"Progressive spreading of Î±-synuclein via gut-brain axis has been hypothesized in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the source of seeding-capable Î±-synuclein in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) has not been fully investigated. Additionally, the mechanism by which the GIT microbiome contributes to PD pathogenesis remains to be characterized.We aimed to investigate whether blood-derived Î±-synuclein might contribute to PD pathology via a gut-driven pathway and involve GIT microbiota.The GIT expression of Î±-synuclein and the transmission of extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from erythrocytes/red blood cells (RBCs), with their cargo Î±-synuclein, to the GIT were explored with various methods, including radioactive labeling of RBC-EVs and direct analysis of the transfer of Î±-synuclein protein. The potential role of microbiota on the EVs transmission was further investigated by administering butyrate, the short-chain fatty acids produced by gut microbiota and studying mice with different Î±-synuclein genotypes.This study demonstrated that RBC-EVs can effectively transport Î±-synuclein to the GIT in a region-dependent manner, along with variations closely associated with regional differences in the expression of gut-vascular barrier markers. The investigation further revealed that the infiltration of Î±-synuclein into the GIT was influenced significantly by butyrate and Î±-synuclein genotypes, which may also affect the GIT microbiome directly.By demonstrating the transportation of Î±-synuclein through RBC-EVs to the GIT, and its potential association with gut-vascular barrier markers and gut microbiome, this work highlights a potential mechanism by which RBC Î±-synuclein may impact PD initiation and/or progression.

37492530,<i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> in neuropsychiatric disorders: friend or foe?,"An accumulating body of evidence suggests that the bacterium <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> exhibits positive systemic effects on host health, mainly by improving immunological and metabolic functions, and it is therefore regarded as a promising potential probiotic. Recent clinical and preclinical studies have shown that <i>A. muciniphila</i> plays a vital role in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders by influencing the host brain through the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA). Numerous studies observed that <i>A. muciniphila</i> and its metabolic substances can effectively improve the symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders by restoring the gut microbiota, reestablishing the integrity of the gut mucosal barrier, regulating host immunity, and modulating gut and neuroinflammation. However, <i>A. muciniphila</i> was also reported to participate in the development of neuropsychiatric disorders by aggravating inflammation and influencing mucus production. Therefore, the exact mechanism of action of <i>A. muciniphila</i> remains much controversial. This review summarizes the proposed roles and mechanisms of <i>A. muciniphila</i> in various neurological and psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, strokes, and autism spectrum disorders, and provides insights into the potential therapeutic application of <i>A. muciniphila</i> for the treatment of these conditions.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2023,Wenhui Lei; Yiwen Cheng; Jie Gao; Xia Liu; Li Shao; Qingming Kong; Nengneng Zheng; Zongxin Ling; Weiming Hu

The enteric nervous system (ENS) has also been reported to exhibit neuropathological characteristics of PD.To evaluate the relationship between the incidence of parkinsonism and alteration in gut microbiota and pathogens.Studies in different languages that evaluate the relationship between gut microorganisms and PD were included into this meta-analysis. The outcomes of these studies were analyzed using a random effects model; it was also used to calculate the mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) in order to quantify the impact of different rehabilitation techniques on clinical parameters. Dichotomous and continuous models were used for the analysis of extracted data.A total of 28 studies were included in our analysis. The analysis of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth showed a significant correlation with Parkinson's subjects compared with controls (p < 0.001). In addition, the presence of Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection was significantly related to the Parkinson's group (p < 0.001). On the other hand, there was a significantly higher abundance level of Bifidobacteriaceae (p = 0.008), Verrucomicrobiaceae (p < 0.001) and Christensenellaceae (p = 0.003) in Parkinson's subjects. In contrast, a significantly lower abundance levels in Parkinson's subjects were found in Faecalibacterium (p = 0.03), Lachnospiraceae (p = 0.005) and Prevotellaceae (p = 0.005).

37515687,Gut microbiota bridges the iron homeostasis and host health.,"The gut microbiota acts as a symbiotic microecosystem that plays an indispensable role in the regulation of a number of metabolic processes in the host by secreting secondary metabolites and impacting the physiology and pathophysiology of numerous organs and tissues through the circulatory system. This relationship, referred to as the ""gut-X axis"", is associated with the development and progression of disorders, including obesity, fatty liver and Parkinson's disease. Given its importance, the gut flora is a vital research area for the understanding and development of the novel therapeutic approaches for multiple disorders. Iron is a common but necessary element required by both mammals and bacteria. As a result, iron metabolism is closely intertwined with the gut microbiota. The host's iron homeostasis affects the composition of the gut microbiota and the interaction between host and gut microbiota through various mechanisms such as nutrient homeostasis, intestinal peaceability, gut immunity, and oxidative stress. Therefore, understanding the relationship between gut microbes and host iron metabolism is not only of enormous significance to host health but also may offer preventative and therapeutic approaches for a number of disorders that impact both parties. In this review, we delve into the connection between the dysregulation of iron metabolism and dysbiosis of gut microbiota, and how it contributes to the onset and progression of metabolic and chronic diseases.",Science China.

36958817,Faecal metabolome and its determinants in inflammatory bowel disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a multifactorial immune-mediated inflammatory disease of the intestine, comprising Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. By characterising metabolites in faeces, combined with faecal metagenomics, host genetics and clinical characteristics, we aimed to unravel metabolic alterations in IBD.We measured 1684 different faecal metabolites and 8 short-chain and branched-chain fatty acids in stool samples of 424 patients with IBD and 255 non-IBD controls. Regression analyses were used to compare concentrations of metabolites between cases and controls and determine the relationship between metabolites and each participant's lifestyle, clinical characteristics and gut microbiota composition. Moreover, genome-wide association analysis was conducted on faecal metabolite levels.We identified over 300 molecules that were differentially abundant in the faeces of patients with IBD. The ratio between a sphingolipid and L-urobilin could discriminate between IBD and non-IBD samples (AUC=0.85). We found changes in the bile acid pool in patients with dysbiotic microbial communities and a strong association between faecal metabolome and gut microbiota. For example, the abundance of <i>Ruminococcus gnavus</i> was positively associated with tryptamine levels. In addition, we found 158 associations between metabolites and dietary patterns, and polymorphisms near <i>NAT2</i> strongly associated with coffee metabolism.In this large-scale analysis, we identified alterations in the metabolome of patients with IBD that are independent of commonly overlooked confounders such as diet and surgical history.

38097625,Plasma metabolites of aromatic amino acids associate with clinical severity and gut microbiota of Parkinson's disease.,"Gut microbial proteolytic metabolism has been reportedly altered in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the circulating aromatic amino acids (AAA) described in PD are inconsistent. Here we aimed to investigate plasma AAA profiles in a large cohort of PD patients, and examine their correlations with clinical severity and gut microbiota changes. We enrolled 500 participants including 250 PD patients and 250 neurologically normal controls. Plasma metabolites were measured using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Faecal samples were newly collected from 154 PD patients for microbiota shotgun metagenomic sequencing combined with data derived from 96 PD patients reported before. Data were collected regarding diet, medications, and motor and non-motor symptoms of PD. Compared to controls, PD patients had higher plasma AAA levels, including phenylacetylglutamine (PAGln), p-cresol sulfate (Pcs), p-cresol glucuronide (Pcg), and indoxyl sulfate (IS). Multivariable linear regression analyses, with adjustment for age, sex, and medications, revealed that the plasma levels of PAGln (coefficient 4.49, 95% CI 0.40-8.58, Pâ=â0.032) and Pcg (coefficient 1.79, 95% CI 0.07-3.52, Pâ=â0.042) positively correlated with motor symptom severity but not cognitive function. After correcting for abovementioned potential confounders, these AAA metabolites were also associated with the occurrence of constipation in PD patients (all Pâ<â0.05). Furthermore, plasma levels of AAA metabolites were correlated with the abundance of specific gut microbiota species, including Bacteroides sp. CF01-10NS, Bacteroides vulgatus, and Clostridium sp. AF50-3. In conclusion, elevated plasma AAA metabolite levels correlated with disease characteristics in PD, suggesting that upregulated proteolytic metabolism may contribute to the pathophysiology of PD.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2023,Szu-Ju Chen; Yu-Jun Wu; Chieh-Chang Chen; Yu-Wei Wu; Jyh-Ming Liou; Ming-Shiang Wu; Ching-Hua Kuo; Chin-Hsien Lin
37490970,The Role of Gut Microbiota in Glaucoma Progression and Other Retinal Diseases.,"As a rapidly growing field, microbiota research offers novel approaches to promoting ocular health and treating major retinal diseases, such as glaucoma. Gut microbiota changes throughout life; however, certain patterns of population changes have been increasingly associated with specific diseases. It has been well established that a disrupted microbiome contributes to central nervous system diseases, including Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, and glioma, suggesting a prominent role of microbiome in neurodegenerative diseases. This review summarizes the progress in identifying significant changes in the microbial composition of patients with glaucoma by compiling studies on the association between microbiota and disease progression. Of interest is the relationship between increased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma, increased taurocholic acid, decreased glutathione, and a reduction in retinal ganglion cell survival. Connecting these microbes to specific metabolites sheds light on the pathogenic mechanism and novel treatment strategies. In summary, the current review synthesizes the findings of several studies investigating the effects of shifting bacterial population in retinal diseases, particularly glaucoma, with the aim to identify the current direction of treatment and help direct future endeavors.",The American journal of pathology,2023,Julie Chen; Dong Feng Chen; Kin-Sang Cho

The effects of curcumin against Parkinson's disease have been demonstrated; however, its neuroprotective mechanisms remain unknown. Our study investigated the potential mechanisms through which curcumin ameliorates Parkinson's disease via the microbiota-gut-brain axis. <b>Methods:</b> Mice were randomly divided into four groups: control, Curcumin, MPTP, and MPTP + Curcumin. Motor deficits and gastrointestinal dysfunction were assessed using behavioral test, intestinal motility test, and fecal parameter measurement. The loss of dopaminergic neurons and intestinal barrier function was measured using Western blot and immunofluorescence. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing and LC-MS were parallelly performed on mice feces to investigate alterations in microbiota and metabolites. <b>Results:</b> Curcumin alleviated motor deficits and the loss of dopaminergic neurons in MPTP-induced mice. Curcumin ameliorated gastrointestinal and intestinal barrier dysfunctions in MPTP-induced mice. Curcumin reduced gut microbial dysbiosis and modulated carbohydrate metabolism in MPTP-induced mice. Curcumin restored short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) profiles in MPTP-induced mice. <b>Conclusion:</b> Concurrently, these results indicate that curcumin inhibits Parkinson's disease by regulating the gut microbiota and short-chain fatty acids.",Frontiers in pharmacology,2023,Benchi Cai; Lifan Zhong; Qitong Wang; Wendi Xu; Xi Li; Tao Chen
37121952,Connecting the Gut Microbiota and Neurodegenerative Diseases: the Role of Bile Acids.,"With the acceleration of global population aging, neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) will become the second leading cause of death in the world, which seriously threatens human life and health. Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease are the most common and typical NDs. The exact mechanisms of the NDs occurrence and development remain unclear, which may be related to immune, oxidative stress, and abnormal aggregation of pathogenic proteins. Studies have suggested that gut microbiota (GM) influences brain function and plays an important role in regulating emotional and cognitive function. Recently, bile acids (BAs) have become the ""star molecule"" in the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis research. BAs have been reported to exert anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective activities in NDs. However, the role of BAs in the connection between GM and the central nervous system (CNS) is still unclear. In this review, we will review the possible mechanisms of BAs between GM and NDs and explore the function of BAs to provide ideas for the prevention and treatment of NDs in the future.",Molecular neurobiology,2023,Shixu Wang; Chongchong Xu; Hongyan Liu; Wei Wei; Xuemei Zhou; Haipeng Qian; Li Zhou; Haiqing Zhang; Li Wu; Chen Zhu; Yuting Yang; Lin He; Kuan Li
37423520,Alterations of gut microbiota and its correlation with the liver metabolome in the process of ameliorating Parkinson's disease with Buyang Huanwu decoction.,"Buyang Huanwu decoction (BHD), a famous traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula, was first recorded in Qing Dynasty physician Qingren Wang's Yi Lin Gai Cuo. BHD has been widely utilized in the treatment of patients with neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the underlying mechanism has not been fully elucidated. In particular, little is known about the role of gut microbiota.We aimed to reveal the alterations and functions of gut microbiota and its correlation with the liver metabolome in the process of improving PD with BHD.The cecal contents were collected from PD mice treated with or without BHD. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiSeq-PE250 platform, and the ecological structure, dominant taxa, co-occurrence patterns, and function prediction of the gut microbial community were analyzed by multivariate statistical methods. The correlation between differential microbial communities in the gut and differentially accumulated metabolites in the liver was analyzed using Spearman's correlation analysis.The abundance of Butyricimonas, Christensenellaceae, Coprococcus, Peptococcaceae, Odoribacteraceae, and Roseburia was altered significantly in the model group, which was by BHD. Ten genera, namely Dorea, unclassified_Lachnospiraceae, Oscillospira, unidentified_Ruminococcaceae, unclassified_Clostridiales, unidentified_Clostridiales, Bacteroides, unclassified_Prevotellaceae, unidentified_Rikenellaceae, and unidentified_S24-7, were identified as key bacterial communities. According to the function prediction of differential genera, the mRNA surveillance pathway might be a target of BHD. Integrated analysis of gut microbiota and the liver metabolome revealed that several gut microbiota genera such as Parabacteroides, Ochrobactrum, Acinetobacter, Clostridium, and Halomonas, were positively or negatively correlated with some nervous system-related metabolites, such as L-carnitine, L-pyroglutamic acid, oleic acid, and taurine.Gut microbiota might be a target of BHD in the process of ameliorating PD. Our findings provide novel insight into the mechanisms underlying the effects of BHD on PD and contribute to the development of TCM.",Journal of ethnopharmacology,2024,Jianran Hu; Ping Li; Hongmei Zhao; Pengyu Ji; Yanjun Yang; Jianhua Ma; Xin Zhao
37819112,Gut microbiota-associated taurine metabolism dysregulation in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease.,"PD is recognized as a multisystem disease concerning GI dysfunction and microbiota dysbiosis but still lacks ideal therapies. Recently, aberrant microbiota-derived metabolites are emerging as important participants in PD etiology. However, the alterations of gut microbiota community and serum untargeted metabolite profile have not been fully investigated in a PD mice model. Here, we discover sharply reduced levels of <i>Lactobacillus</i> and taurine in MPTP-treated mice. Moreover, <i>Lactobacillus</i>, <i>Adlercreutzia</i>, and taurine-related metabolites showed the most significant correlation with pathological and GI performance of PD mice. The abundances of microbial transporter and enzymes participating in the degeneration of taurine were disturbed in PD mice. Most importantly, taurine supplement ameliorates MPTP-induced motor deficits, DA neuron loss, and microglial activation. Our data highlight the impaired taurine-based microbiome-metabolism axis during the progression of PD and reveal a novel and previously unrecognized role of genera in modulating taurine metabolism.",mSphere,2023,Can Cui; Huan Song; Yingying Han; Hongxiang Yu; Hongxia Li; Yumei Yang; Bei Zhang
37736791,"The link between the gut microbiome, inflammation, and Parkinson's disease.","As our society ages, the growing number of people with Parkinson's disease (PD) puts tremendous pressure on our society. Currently, there is no effective treatment for PD, so there is an urgent need to find new treatment options. In recent years, increasing studies have shown a strong link between gut microbes and PD. In this review, recent advances in research on gut microbes in PD patients were summarized. Increased potential pro-inflammatory microbes and decreased potential anti-inflammatory microbes are prominent features of gut microbiota in PD patients. These changes may lead to an increase in pro-inflammatory substances (such as lipopolysaccharide and H<sub>2</sub>S) and a decrease in anti-inflammatory substances (such as short-chain fatty acids) to promote inflammation in the gut. This gut microbiota-mediated inflammation will lead to pathological Î±-synuclein accumulation in the gut, and the inflammation and Î±-synuclein can spread to the brain via the microbiota-gut-brain axis, thereby promoting neuroinflammation, apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons, and ultimately the development of PD. This review also showed that therapies based on gut microbiota may have a bright future for PD. However, more research and new approaches are still needed to clarify the causal relationship between gut microbes and PD and to determine whether therapies based on gut microbiota are effective in PD patients. KEY POINTS: â¢ There is a strong association between gut microbes and PD. â¢ Inflammation mediated by gut microbes may promote the development of PD. â¢ Therapies based on the gut microbiome provide a promising strategy for PD prevention.",Applied microbiology and biotechnology,2023,Shiqing Nie; Yuan Ge
37620311,Gut microbiota and fecal short chain fatty acids differ with adiposity and country of origin: the METS-microbiome study.,"The relationship between microbiota, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and obesity remains enigmatic. We employ amplicon sequencing and targeted metabolomics in a large (nâ=â1904) African origin cohort from Ghana, South Africa, Jamaica, Seychelles, and the US. Microbiota diversity and fecal SCFAs are greatest in Ghanaians, and lowest in Americans, representing each end of the urbanization spectrum. Obesity is significantly associated with a reduction in SCFA concentration, microbial diversity, and SCFA synthesizing bacteria, with country of origin being the strongest explanatory factor. Diabetes, glucose state, hypertension, obesity, and sex can be accurately predicted from the global microbiota, but when analyzed at the level of country, predictive accuracy is only universally maintained for sex. Diabetes, glucose, and hypertension are only predictive in certain low-income countries. Our findings suggest that adiposity-related microbiota differences differ between low-to-middle-income compared to high-income countries.

37807941,The gut microbiota metabolite butyrate mitigates MPTP/MPP<sup>+</sup> -induced Parkinson's disease by inhibiting the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway.,"Butyrate (BU), a gut microbiota-derived metabolite, has been reported to play a neuroprotective role in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the specific molecular mechanism of BU has not been fully interpreted. This work aimed to verify the protective effects of BU against MPTP/MPP<sup>+</sup> -induced neurotoxicity and explore the mechanisms involved. The results showed that BU protected against MPTP-induced motor dysfunction and decreased tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine transporter (DAT) levels. Additionally, BU pretreatment improved PC12 cell viability and reduced MPP<sup>+</sup> -induced PC12 cell apoptosis. BU treatment also attenuated MPP<sup>+</sup> -stimulated oxidative stress and inflammatory response in PC12 cells. Furthermore, BU inhibited MPTP/MPP<sup>+</sup> -induced hyperactivation of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling in mice and PC12 cells. Besides, a JAK2 agonist, Coumermycin A1 (C-A1), substantially reversed BU-mediated inhibition on JAK2/STAT3 phosphorylation in MPP<sup>+</sup> -challenged PC12 cells and abated BU-induced repression on MPP<sup>+</sup> -triggered apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammatory response in PC12 cells.

37502423,Exploring the alteration of gut microbiota and brain function in gender-specific Parkinson's disease based on metagenomic sequencing.,"The role of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in Parkinson's disease (PD) has received increasing attention. Although gender differences are known to an essential role in the epidemiology and clinical course of PD, there are no studies on the sex specificity of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in the development and progression of PD.Fresh fecal samples from 24 PD patients (13 males, 11 females) were collected for metagenomic sequencing. The composition and function of the gut microbiota were analyzed by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Gender-dependent differences in brain ALFF values and their correlation with microbiota were further analyzed.The relative abundance of <i>Propionivibrio</i>, <i>Thermosediminibacter</i>, and <i>Flavobacteriaceae_noname</i> was increased in male PD patients. LEfse analysis showed that <i>Verrucomicrobial</i>, <i>Akkermansiaceae</i>, and <i>Akkermansia</i> were dominant in the males. In female patients, the relative abundance of <i>Propionicicella</i> was decreased and <i>Escherichia</i>, <i>Escherichia_coli</i>, and <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> were predominant. The expression of the sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis pathways was increased in male PD patients and was statistically different from females. Compared to the Male PD patients, female patients showed decreased ALFF values in the left inferior parietal regions, and the relative abundance of <i>Propionivibrio</i> was positively correlated with the regional ALFF values.Our study provides novel clinical evidence of the gender-specific relationship between gut microbiota alterations and brain function in PD patients, highlighting the critical role of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in gender differences in PD.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2023,Minna Zhang; Zhiyuan Zhai; Bo Yang; Le He; Jingyi Wang; Weijie Dai; Liujun Xue; Xiaozhong Yang; Yun Feng; Honggang Wang
38237261,"Rubusoside mitigates neuroinflammation and cellular apoptosis in Parkinson's disease, and alters gut microbiota and metabolite composition.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons within the substantia nigra. Neuroinflammation plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of PD, involving the activation of microglia cells, heightened production of proinflammatory cytokines, and perturbations in the composition of the gut microbiota. Rubusoside (Ru), the principal steviol bisglucoside present in Rubus chingii var. suavissimus (S.K.Lee) L.T.Lu (Rosaceae), has been documented for its anti-inflammatory properties in diverse disease models. Nonetheless, there is an imperative need to comprehensively assess and elucidate the protective and anti-inflammatory attributes of Ru concerning PD, as well as to uncover the underlying mechanism involved.The aim of this study is to evaluate the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of Ru on PD and investigate its potential mechanisms associated with microbes.We pre-treated mice and cell lines with Ru in order to simulate the progression of PD and the neuroinflammatory state. The mouse model was induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), SN4741 cells were induced by 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridine (mpp<sup>+</sup>), and BV-2 cells were induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We assessed the impact of Ru on motor function, neuroinflammation, neuron apoptosis, the composition of gut microbes, and their metabolites.Ru treatment reduces the release of pro-inflammatory mediators by inhibiting microglia activation. It also prevents neuronal apoptosis, thereby safeguarding dopaminergic neurons and ameliorating motor dysfunction. Furthermore, it induces alterations in the fecal microbiota composition and metabolites profile in PD mice. In vitro experiments have demonstrated that Ru inhibits neuronal apoptosis in SN4741 cells induced by mpp<sup>+</sup>, suppresses the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, and activates the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-ÎºB) signaling pathways.Ru exhibits inhibitory effects on the MPTP-induced PD model by mitigating neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis while also inducing changes in the gut microbiota and metabolite composition.",Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,2024,Tianyu Meng; Yufei Zhang; Jing Huang; Vijay Pandey; Shoupeng Fu; Shaohua Ma
38022117,The Role of Gut Microbiota in Neurodegenerative Diseases: Current Insights and Therapeutic Implications.,"Small microscopic entities known as microbes, having a population of hundreds of billions or perhaps even in trillions, reside in our gastrointestinal tract. A healthy immune system, digestion, and creation of vitamins and enzymes are all thanks to these microbes. However, new research has shown a hitherto unrecognized connection between the microbiota of the intestines and the genesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Neurons in the CNS gradually deteriorate in neurodegenerative illnesses like multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease (PD). This deterioration impairs cognitive and physical function. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), PD, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are just a few examples of neurodegenerative illnesses that pose a serious threat to world health and have few effective treatments. Recent research suggests that the gut microbiota, a diverse microbial population found in the gastrointestinal system, may substantially impact the cause and development of various diseases. The discovery of altered gut microbiota composition in people with these illnesses is one of the most critical lines of evidence connecting gut microbiota dysbiosis to neurodegenerative diseases. AD patients have a distinct characteristic of having a particular microbiota profile. In addition, an excess population of a specific microbe data profile is seen as compared to a healthy individual. Similar changes in the gut microbiota composition have been noted in people with multiple sclerosis and PD. The latest study indicates the potential that dysbiosis, a condition characterized by alteration in the intestinal microbiota's makeup and functioning, may have an effect on the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, including PD and multiple sclerosis. In order to emphasize any potential underlying mechanisms and examine potential treatment repercussions, the review article's goal is to summarize current knowledge about the connection between gut microbiota and neurodegenerative disorders.

37200942,Ketogenic diet protects MPTP-induced mouse model of Parkinson's disease via altering gut microbiota and metabolites.,"The ketogenic diet (KD) is a low-carbohydrate, high-fat regime that is protective against neurodegenerative diseases. However, the impact of KD on Parkinson's disease (PD) and its mechanisms remains unclear. 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced mouse model of PD was fed with KD for 8Â weeks. Motor function and dopaminergic neurons were evaluated. Inflammation in the brain, plasma, and colon tissue were also measured. Fecal samples were assessed by 16S rDNA gene sequencing and untargeted metabolomics. We found that KD protected motor dysfunction, dopaminergic neuron loss, and inflammation in an MPTP mouse model of PD. 16S rDNA sequencing revealed that MPTP administration significantly increased <i>Citrobacter</i>, <i>Desulfovibrio</i>, and <i>Ruminococcus</i>, and decreased <i>Dubosiella</i>, whereas KD treatment reversed the dysbiosis. Meanwhile, KD regulated the MPTP-induced histamine, N-acetylputrescine, d-aspartic acid, and other metabolites. Fecal microbiota transplantation using feces from the KD-treated mice attenuated the motor function impairment and dopaminergic neuron loss in antibiotic-pretreated PD mice. Our current study demonstrates that KD played a neuroprotective role in the MPTP mouse model of PD through the diet-gut microbiota-brain axis, which may involve inflammation in the brain and colon. However, future research is warranted to explore the explicit anti-inflammatory mechanisms of the gut-brain axis in PD models fed with KD.",MedComm,2023,Ziying Jiang; Xinyu Wang; Haoqiang Zhang; Jian Yin; Peiqing Zhao; Qingqing Yin; Zhenfu Wang
37323141,Effects of gut microbiota on neurodegenerative diseases.,"A progressive degradation of the brain's structure and function, which results in a reduction in cognitive and motor skills, characterizes neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington's disease (HD). The morbidity linked to NDs is growing, which poses a severe threat to human being's mental and physical ability to live well. The gut-brain axis (GBA) is now known to have a crucial role in the emergence of NDs. The gut microbiota is a conduit for the GBA, a two-way communication system between the gut and the brain. The myriad microorganisms that make up the gut microbiota can affect brain physiology by transmitting numerous microbial chemicals from the gut to the brain <i>via</i> the GBA or neurological system. The synthesis of neurotransmitters, the immunological response, and the metabolism of lipids and glucose have all been demonstrated to be impacted by alterations in the gut microbiota, such as an imbalance of helpful and harmful bacteria. In order to develop innovative interventions and clinical therapies for NDs, it is crucial to comprehend the participation of the gut microbiota in these conditions. In addition to using antibiotics and other drugs to target particular bacterial species that may be a factor in NDs, this also includes using probiotics and other fecal microbiota transplantation to maintain a healthy gut microbiota. In conclusion, the examination of the GBA can aid in understanding the etiology and development of NDs, which may benefit the improvement of clinical treatments for these disorders and ND interventions. This review indicates existing knowledge about the involvement of microbiota present in the gut in NDs and potential treatment options.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2023,Saima Khatoon; Nida Kalam; Summya Rashid; Gulnaz Bano
36692876,Causal effect of gut-microbiota-derived metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide on Parkinson's disease: A Mendelian randomization study.,"It has been suggested that trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is related to Parkinson's disease (PD) in observational studies. However, the direction of this association is inconsistent. An exploratory Mendelian randomization study was conducted to investigate whether TMAO and its precursors have a causal relationship with PD.Summary statistics were obtained for single nucleotide polymorphisms related to circulating levels of TMAO, betaine, carnitine and choline, and the corresponding data for the risk, age at onset and progression of PD from genome-wide association studies. Inverse-variance weighting was used as the primary method for effect estimation. The false discovery rate was applied to the correction of multiple testing. A p value of association <0.05 but above the false discovery rate corrected threshold was deemed suggestive evidence of a possible association. A range of robust Mendelian randomization methods were used for sensitivity analysis.Suggestive evidence was observed of an inverse causal effect of TMAO on motor fluctuations (odds ratio [OR] 0.851, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.731, 0.990, pÂ =Â 0.037) and carnitine on insomnia (OR 0.817, 95% CI 0.700, 0.954, pÂ =Â 0.010) and a positive causal effect of betaine on Hoehn-Yahr stage (OR 1.397, 95% CI 1.112, 1.756, pÂ =Â 0.004), Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) III score (Î²Â =Â 0.138, 95% CI 0.051, 0.225, pÂ =Â 0.002), motor fluctuations (OR 1.236, 95% CI 1.011, 1.511, pÂ =Â 0.039), and choline on UPDRS IV (Î²Â =Â 0.106, 95% CI 0.026, 0.185, pÂ =Â 0.009) and modified Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living Scale score (Î²Â =Â 0.806, 95% CI 0.127, 1.484, pÂ =Â 0.020).Our findings provide suggestive evidence that TMAO and its precursors have a causal effect on the progression of PD.

38127816,Autophagic dysfunction and gut microbiota dysbiosis cause chronic immune activation in a Drosophila model of Gaucher disease.,"Mutations in the GBA1 gene cause the lysosomal storage disorder Gaucher disease (GD) and are the greatest known genetic risk factors for Parkinson's disease (PD). Communication between the gut and brain and immune dysregulation are increasingly being implicated in neurodegenerative disorders such as PD. Here, we show that flies lacking the Gba1b gene, the main fly orthologue of GBA1, display widespread NF-kB signalling activation, including gut inflammation, and brain glial activation. We also demonstrate intestinal autophagic defects, gut dysfunction, and microbiome dysbiosis. Remarkably, modulating the microbiome of Gba1b knockout flies, by raising them under germ-free conditions, partially ameliorates lifespan, locomotor and immune phenotypes. Moreover, we show that modulation of the immune deficiency (IMD) pathway is detrimental to the survival of Gba1 deficient flies. We also reveal that direct stimulation of autophagy by rapamycin treatment achieves similar benefits to germ-free conditions independent of gut bacterial load. Consistent with this, we show that pharmacologically blocking autophagosomal-lysosomal fusion, mimicking the autophagy defects of Gba1 depleted cells, is sufficient to stimulate intestinal immune activation. Overall, our data elucidate a mechanism whereby an altered microbiome, coupled with defects in autophagy, drive chronic activation of NF-kB signaling in a Gba1 loss-of-function model. It also highlights that elimination of the microbiota or stimulation of autophagy to remove immune mediators, rather than prolonged immunosuppression, may represent effective therapeutic avenues for GBA1-associated disorders.",PLoS genetics,2023,Magda L Atilano; Alexander Hull; Catalina-Andreea Romila; Mirjam L Adams; Jacob Wildfire; Enric UreÃ±a; Miranda Dyson; Jorge Ivan-Castillo-Quan; Linda Partridge; Kerri J Kinghorn
37334756,Fibroblast growth factor 21 ameliorates behavior deficits in Parkinson's disease mouse model via modulating gut microbiota and metabolic homeostasis.,"The effects of FGF21 on Parkinson's disease (PD) and its relationship with gut microbiota have not been elucidated. This study aimed to investigate whether FGF21 would attenuate behavioral impairment through microbiota-gut-brain metabolic axis in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) induced PD mice model.Male C57BL/6 mice were rendomized into 3 groups: vehicle (CON); MPTP 30âmg/kg/dayâi.p. injection (MPTP); FGF21 1.5âmg/kg/d i.p. injection plus MPTP 30âmg/kg/dayâi.p. injection (FGF21â+âMPTP). The behavioral features, metabolimics profiling, and 16âs rRNA sequencing were performed after FGF21 treatment for 7âdays.MPTP-induced PD mice showed motor and cognitive deficits accompanied by gut microbiota dysbiosis and brain-region-specific metabolic abnormalities. FGF21 treatment dramatically attenuated motor and cognitive dysfunction in PD mice. FGF21 produced a region-specific alteration in the metabolic profile in the brain in ways indicative of greater ability in neurotransmitter metabolism and choline production. In addition, FGF21 also re-structured the gut microbiota profile and increased the relative abundance of Clostridiales, Ruminococcaceae, and Lachnospiraceae, thereby rescuing the PD-induced metabolic disorders in the colon.These findings indicate that FGF21 could affect behavior and brain metabolic homeostasis in ways that promote a favorable colonic microbiota composition and through effects on the microbiota-gut-brain metabolic axis.",CNS neuroscience & therapeutics,2023,Changwei Yang; Wuqiong Wang; Pengxi Deng; Xinyi Wang; Lin Zhu; Liangcai Zhao; Chen Li; Hongchang Gao
37049578,<i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> CCFM405 against Rotenone-Induced Parkinson's Disease Mice via Regulating Gut Microbiota and Branched-Chain Amino Acids Biosynthesis.,"Recent studies have demonstrated that disturbances in the gut microbiota and microbiota -derived metabolites contribute to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), suggesting that probiotic treatments that restore them may delay disease progression. This study aimed to examine the attenuating efficacy of <i>L. plantarum</i> CCFM405 and the potential mechanisms in mice with rotenone-induced PD. Our results indicate that <i>L. plantarum</i> CCFM405 ameliorated rotenone-induced motor deficits and constipation, decreased dopaminergic neuronal death, reduced intestinal inflammation and neuroinflammation, and raised dopamine levels, 5-HT, and associated metabolites in the striatal region of the brain in mice with PD. Sequencing of 16S rRNA from fecal microbiota revealed that <i>L. plantarum</i> CCFM405 normalized the gut bacterial composition in mice with PD, as evidenced by the increased relative abundance of the following genus, <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, <i>Turicibacter</i>, and <i>Faecalibaculum</i>, and decreased relative abundance of <i>Alistipes</i>, <i>Bilophila</i>, <i>Akkermansia</i>, and <i>Escherichia-Shigella</i>. The PICRUSt-predicted gut microbiota function revealed that <i>L. plantarum</i> CCFM405 enhanced the biosynthesis of amino acid pathways, particularly valine, leucine, and isoleucine (branched-chain amino acids, BCAAs). A non-metabolomic analysis of the serum and feces showed that <i>L. plantarum</i> CCFM405 markedly increased the levels of BCAAs. Pathway enrichment analysis based on the KEGG database further suggested that <i>L. plantarum</i> CCFM405 supplementation can promote BCAAs biosynthesis. Collectively, <i>L. plantarum</i> CCFM405 can help to prevent rotenone-induced PD by modulating the gut microbiota-metabolite axis. BCAAs may play a dominant role in <i>L. plantarum</i> CCFM405-associated neuroprotection in PD mice. This probiotic could be utilized as a potential food supplement in the management of PD.",Nutrients,2023,Chuanqi Chu; Leilei Yu; Yiwen Li; Hang Guo; Qixiao Zhai; Wei Chen; Fengwei Tian
36761177,Sodium butyrate ameliorates gut dysfunction and motor deficits in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease by regulating gut microbiota.,"A growing body of evidence showed that gut microbiota dysbiosis might be associated with the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Microbiota-targeted interventions could play a protective role in PD by regulating the gut microbiota-gut-brain axis. Sodium butyrate (NaB) could improve gut microbiota dysbiosis in PD and other neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the potential mechanism associated with the complex interaction between NaB and gut microbiota-gut-brain communication in PD needs further investigation.C57BL/6 mice were subjected to a rotenone-induced PD model and were treated intragastrically with NaB for 4âweeks. The gut function and motor function were evaluated. The Î±-synuclein expression in colon and substantia nigra were detected by western blotting. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons in substantia nigra were measured by immunofluorescence. Moreover, gut microbiota composition was analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing. Fecal short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) levels were determined by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The levels of glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) in tissues and serum were evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).NaB ameliorated gut dysfunction and motor deficits in rotenone-induced mice. Meanwhile, NaB protected against rotenone-induced Î±-synuclein expression in colon and substantia nigra, and prevented the loss of TH-positive neurons. In addition, NaB could remodel gut microbiota composition, and regulate gut SCFAs metabolism, and restore GLP-1 levels in colon, serum, and substantia nigra in PD mice.NaB could ameliorate gut dysfunction and motor deficits in rotenone-induced PD mice, and the mechanism might be associated with the regulation of gut microbiota dysbiosis.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2023,Yi Zhang; Shaoqing Xu; Yiwei Qian; Chengjun Mo; Penghui Ai; Xiaodong Yang; Qin Xiao
37460569,Association of fecal short-chain fatty acids with clinical severity and gut microbiota in essential tremor and its difference from Parkinson's disease.,"Diagnosis of essential tremor (ET) at an early stage can be difficult, especially when distinguishing it from healthy controls (HCs) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Recently, stool sample analysis of gut microbiota and its metabolites provides new ways to detect novel biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), as the main metabolites of gut microbiota, were reduced in the feces of PD. However, fecal SCFAs in ET have never been investigated. We aimed to investigate the fecal SCFA levels in ET, assess their relationships with clinical symptoms and gut microbiota, and identify their potential diagnostic abilities. Fecal SCFAs and gut microbiota in 37 ET, 37 de novo PD and 35 HC were measured. Constipation, autonomic dysfunction and tremor severity were evaluated by scales. ET had lower fecal propionic, butyric and isobutyric acid levels than HC. Combined propionic, butyric and isobutyric acid distinguished ET from HC with an AUC of 0.751 (95% CI: 0.634-0.867). ET had lower fecal isovaleric and isobutyric acid levels than PD. Isovaleric and isobutyric acid differentiated ET from PD with an AUC of 0.743 (95% CI: 0.629-0.857). Fecal propionic acid was negatively correlated with constipation and autonomic dysfunction. Isobutyric and isovaleric acid were negatively associated with tremor severity. Lowered fecal SCFAs were related to a decreased abundance of Faecalibacterium and Catenibacterium in ET. In conclusion, fecal SCFAs were decreased in ET and correlated with clinical severity and gut microbiota changes. Fecal propionic, butyric, isobutyric and isovaleric acid might be potential diagnostic and differential diagnostic biomarkers for ET.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2023,Pei Huang; Pingchen Zhang; Juanjuan Du; Chao Gao; Jin Liu; Yuyan Tan; Shengdi Chen
37754772,The impact of Parkinson's disease-associated gut microbiota on the transcriptome in <i>Drosophila</i>.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease in middle-aged and elderly people, and many studies have confirmed that the disorder of gut microbiota is involved in the pathophysiological process of PD. However, the molecular mechanism of gut microbiota in regulating the pathogenesis of PD is still lacking. In this study, to investigate the impact of PD-associated gut microbiota on host transcriptome, we established various PD models with fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in the model organism <i>Drosophila</i> followed by integrative data analysis of microbiome and transcriptome. We first constructed rotenone-induced PD models in <i>Drosophila</i> followed by FMT in different groups. Microbial analysis by 16S rDNA sequencing showed that gut microbiota from PD <i>Drosophila</i> could affect bacterial structure of normal <i>Drosophila</i>, and gut microbiota from normal <i>Drosophila</i> could affect bacterial structure of PD <i>Drosophila</i>. Transcriptome analysis revealed that PD-associated gut microbiota influenced expression patterns of genes enriched in neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, lysosome, and diverse metabolic pathways. Importantly, to verify our findings, we transplanted <i>Drosophila</i> with fecal samples from clinical PD patients. Compared to the control, <i>Drosophila</i> transplanted with fecal samples from PD patients had reduced microbiota <i>Acetobacter</i> and <i>Lactobacillus</i>, and differentially expressed genes enriched in diverse metabolic pathways. In summary, our results reveal the influence of PD-associated gut microbiota on host gene expression, and this study can help better understand the link between gut microbiota and PD pathogenesis through gut-brain axis. IMPORTANCE Gut microbiota plays important roles in regulating host gene expression and physiology through complex mechanisms.

37863655,Regulation of Pain Perception by Microbiota in Parkinson Disease.,"Pain perception involves current stimulation in peripheral nociceptive nerves and the subsequent stimulation of postsynaptic excitatory neurons in the spinal cord. Importantly, in chronic pain, the neural activity of both peripheral nociceptors and postsynaptic neurons in the central nervous system is influenced by several inflammatory mediators produced by the immune system. Growing evidence has indicated that the commensal microbiota plays an active role in regulating pain perception by either acting directly on nociceptors or indirectly through the modulation of the inflammatory activity on immune cells. This symbiotic relationship is mediated by soluble bacterial mediators or intrinsic structural components of bacteria that act on eukaryotic cells, including neurons, microglia, astrocytes, macrophages, T cells, enterochromaffin cells, and enteric glial cells. The molecular mechanisms involve bacterial molecules that act directly on neurons, affecting their excitability, or indirectly on non-neuronal cells, inducing changes in the production of proinflammatory or anti-inflammatory mediators. Importantly, Parkinson disease, a neurodegenerative and inflammatory disorder that affects mainly the dopaminergic neurons implicated in the control of voluntary movements, involves not only a motor decline but also nonmotor symptomatology, including chronic pain. Of note, several recent studies have shown that Parkinson disease involves a dysbiosis in the composition of the gut microbiota. In this review, we first summarize, integrate, and classify the molecular mechanisms implicated in the microbiota-mediated regulation of chronic pain. Second, we analyze the changes on the commensal microbiota associated to Parkinson disease and propose how these changes affect the development of chronic pain in this pathology. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The microbiota regulates chronic pain through the action of bacterial signals into two main locations: the peripheral nociceptors and the postsynaptic excitatory neurons in the spinal cord. The dysbiosis associated to Parkinson disease reveals increased representation of commensals that potentially exacerbate chronic pain and reduced levels of bacteria with beneficial effects on pain. This review encourages further research to better understand the signals involved in bacteria-bacteria and bacteria-host communication to get the clues for the development of probiotics with therapeutic potential.",Pharmacological reviews,2023,Zulmary Manjarres; Margarita Calvo; Rodrigo Pacheco
35830286,Gut microbiota: a new insight into neurological diseases.,"In the last decade, it has become increasingly recognized that a balanced gut microbiota plays an important role in maintaining the health of the host. Numerous clinical and preclinical studies have shown that changes in gut microbiota composition are associated with a variety of neurological diseases, e.g., Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and myasthenia gravis. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are complex and remain unclear. Behavioral phenotypes can be transmitted from humans to animals through gut microbiota transplantation, indicating that the gut microbiota may be an important regulator of neurological diseases. However, further research is required to determine whether animal-based findings can be extended to humans and to elucidate the relevant potential mechanisms by which the gut microbiota regulates neurological diseases. Such investigations may aid in the development of new microbiota-based strategies for diagnosis and treatment and improve the clinical management of neurological disorders. In this review, we describe the dysbiosis of gut microbiota and the corresponding mechanisms in common neurological diseases, and discuss the potential roles that the intestinal microbiome may play in the diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders.",Chinese medical journal,2023,Lanxiang Liu; Haiyang Wang; Xueyi Chen; Peng Xie
36839287,Neuroprotective Effects of Sodium Butyrate by Restoring Gut Microbiota and Inhibiting TLR4 Signaling in Mice with MPTP-Induced Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent type of neurodegenerative disease. There is mounting evidence that the gut microbiota is involved in the pathogenesis of PD. Sodium butyrate (NaB) can regulate gut microbiota and improve brain functioning in neurological disorders. Hence, we examined whether the neuroprotective function of NaB on PD was mediated by the modulation of gut microbial dysbiosis and revealed its possible mechanisms. Mice were administered 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) for 7 consecutive days to construct the PD model. NaB gavage was given 2 h after the daily MPTP injections for 21 days. NaB improved the motor functioning of PD mice, increased striatal neurotransmitter levels, and reduced the death of dopaminergic neurons. The 16S rRNA sequencing analysis revealed that NaB restored the gut microbial dysbiosis. NaB also attenuated the intestinal barrier's disruption and reduced serum, colon, and striatal pro-inflammatory cytokines, along with inhibiting the overactivation of glial cells, suggesting an inhibitory effect on inflammation from NaB throughout the gut-brain axis of the PD mice. Mechanistic studies revealed that NaB treatment suppressed the TLR4/MyD88/NF-kB pathway in the colon and striatum. In summary, NaB had a neuroprotective impact on the PD mice, likely linked to its regulation of gut microbiota to inhibit gut-brain axis inflammation.",Nutrients,2023,Tong-Tong Guo; Zheng Zhang; Yan Sun; Rui-Yang Zhu; Fei-Xia Wang; Lian-Ju Ma; Lin Jiang; Han-Deng Liu
37418977,Low and high doses of oral maslinic acid protect against Parkinson's disease via distinct gut microbiota-related mechanisms.,"The use of oral agents that can modify the gut microbiota (GM) could be a novel preventative or therapeutic option for Parkinson's disease (PD). Maslinic acid (MA), a pentacyclic triterpene acid with GM-dependent biological activities when it is taken orally, has not yet been reported to be effective against PD. The present study found both low and high dose MA treatment significantly prevented dopaminergic neuronal loss in a classical chronic PD mouse model by ameliorating motor functions and improving tyrosine hydroxylase expressions in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and increasing dopamine and its metabolite homovanillic acid levels in the striatum. However, the effects of MA in PD mice were not dose-responsive, since similar beneficial effects for low and high doses of MA were observed. Further mechanism studies indicated that low dose MA administration favored probiotic bacterial growth in PD mice, which helped to increase striatal serotonin, 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid, and Î³-aminobutyric acid levels. High dose MA treatment did not influence GM composition in PD mice but significantly inhibited neuroinflammation as indicated by reduced levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 1Î² in the SNpc; moreover, these effects were mainly mediated by microbially-derived acetic acid in the colon. In conclusion, oral MA at different doses protected against PD via distinct mechanisms related to GM. Nevertheless, our study lacked in-depth investigations of the underlying mechanisms involved; future studies will be designed to further delineate the signaling pathways involved in the interactive actions between different doses of MA and GM.",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2023,Xu Cao; Zhong-Rui Du; Xin Liu; Xiong Wang; Chong Li; Sai-Nan Zhou; Jia-Rui Liu; Ping-Yi Xu; Jun-Li Ye; Qing Zhao; Fang Zhao; Ka-Hing Wong; Xiao-Li Dong
37774944,Gut-muscle-brain axis: Molecular mechanisms in neurodegenerative disorders and potential therapeutic efficacy of probiotic supplementation coupled with exercise.,"Increased longevity is often associated with age-related conditions. The most common neurodegenerative disorders in the older population are Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), associated with progressive neuronal loss leading to functional and cognitive impairments. Although symptomatic treatments are available, there is currently no cure for these conditions. Gut dysbiosis has been involved in the pathogenesis of AD and PD, thus interventions targeting the ""gut-brain axis"" could potentially prevent or delay these pathologies. Recent evidence suggests that the skeletal muscle and the gut microbiota can affect each other via the ""gut-muscle axis"". Importantly, cognitive functions in AD and PD patients significantly benefit from physical activity. In this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive picture of the crosstalk between the brain, the skeletal muscle and the gut microbiota, introducing the concept of ""gut-muscle-brain axis"". Moreover, we discuss human and animal studies exploring the modulatory role of exercise and probiotics on cognition in AD and PD. Collectively, the findings presented here support the potential benefits of physical activity and probiotic supplementation in AD and PD.

36901907,What the Gut Tells the Brain-Is There a Link between Microbiota and Huntington's Disease?,"The human intestinal microbiota is a diverse and dynamic microenvironment that forms a complex, bi-directional relationship with the host. The microbiome takes part in the digestion of food and the generation of crucial nutrients such as short chain fatty acids (SCFA), but is also impacts the host's metabolism, immune system, and even brain functions. Due to its indispensable role, microbiota has been implicated in both the maintenance of health and the pathogenesis of many diseases. Dysbiosis in the gut microbiota has already been implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, not much is known about the microbiome composition and its interactions in Huntington's disease (HD). This dominantly heritable, incurable neurodegenerative disease is caused by the expansion of CAG trinucleotide repeats in the huntingtin gene (<i>HTT</i>). As a result, toxic RNA and mutant protein (mHTT), rich in polyglutamine (polyQ), accumulate particularly in the brain, leading to its impaired functions. Interestingly, recent studies indicated that mHTT is also widely expressed in the intestines and could possibly interact with the microbiota, affecting the progression of HD. Several studies have aimed so far to screen the microbiota composition in mouse models of HD and find out whether observed microbiome dysbiosis could affect the functions of the HD brain. This review summarizes ongoing research in the HD field and highlights the essential role of the intestine-brain axis in HD pathogenesis and progression. The review also puts a strong emphasis on indicating microbiome composition as a future target in the urgently needed therapy for this still incurable disease.",International journal of molecular sciences,2023,Dorota Wronka; Anna Karlik; Julia O Misiorek; Lukasz Przybyl
37470081,Effect of <i>Lacticaseibacillus paracasei</i> strain Shirota supplementation on clinical responses and gut microbiome in Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor issues and a range of non-motor symptoms. Microbial therapy may be a useful approach for the treatment of PD. However, comprehensive analyses of the impact of probiotic supplementation on motor and non-motor symptoms are still lacking and the mechanisms whereby the treatment works remain unclear. This study investigated <i>Lacticaseibacillus paracasei</i> strain Shirota (LcS) supplementation on clinical responses, gut microbiota and faecal metabolites in PD patients. Patients (<i>n</i> = 128) were randomised to receive either probiotics (LcS-fermented milk, containing 1 Ã 10<sup>10</sup> living LcS cells) or placebo for 12 weeks. All participants were examined and the basic clinical features were recorded using questionnaires. Fecal and blood samples were collected at the baseline and after 12 weeks for further omics analysis. We found that LcS intervention significantly alleviated patients' constipation-related symptoms and non-motor symptoms. We found no significant shifts in the composition of gut microbiota or faecal metabolites. Several taxa were differentially abundant between the groups, especially with regard to LcS intake, which increased the abundance of the genus <i>Lacticaseibacillus</i> in the probiotic group compared with those at the baseline and in the placebo group. The faecal concentration of L-tyrosine was significantly decreased and the plasma concentration of L-tyrosine was increased in the probiotic group compared with the placebo group. Our study demonstrated that although supplementation with LcS did not induce major changes in the global gut microbiome, the probiotic had favorable effects in managing constipation and other non-motor symptoms in PD patients.

38098666,Exploring the role of gut microbiota in advancing personalized medicine.,"Ongoing extensive research in the field of gut microbiota (GM) has highlighted the crucial role of gut-dwelling microbes in human health. These microbes possess 100 times more genes than the human genome and offer significant biochemical advantages to the host in nutrient and drug absorption, metabolism, and excretion. It is increasingly clear that GM modulates the efficacy and toxicity of drugs, especially those taken orally. In addition, intra-individual variability of GM has been shown to contribute to drug response biases for certain therapeutics. For instance, the efficacy of cyclophosphamide depends on the presence of <i>Enterococcus hirae</i> and <i>Barnesiella intestinihominis</i> in the host intestine. Conversely, the presence of inappropriate or unwanted gut bacteria can inactivate a drug. For example, dehydroxylase of <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> and <i>Eggerthella lenta</i> A2 can metabolize L-dopa before it converts into the active form (dopamine) and crosses the blood-brain barrier to treat Parkinson's disease patients. Moreover, GM is emerging as a new player in personalized medicine, and various methods are being developed to treat diseases by remodeling patients' GM composition, such as prebiotic and probiotic interventions, microbiota transplants, and the introduction of synthetic GM. This review aims to highlight how the host's GM can improve drug efficacy and discuss how an unwanted bug can cause the inactivation of medicine.",Frontiers in microbiology,2023,Gouxin Huang; Raees Khan; Yilin Zheng; Ping-Chin Lee; Qingnan Li; Imran Khan

37147392,Gastrointestinal disorders in Parkinson's disease and other Lewy body diseases.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is pathologically characterized by the abnormal accumulation of Î±-synuclein fibrils (Lewy bodies) in the substantia nigra and other brain regions, although the role of Lewy bodies remains elusive. Constipation usually precedes the motor symptoms in PD, which is in accordance with the notion that Î±-synuclein fibrils start from the intestinal neural plexus and ascend to the brain in at least half of PD patients. The gut microbiota is likely to be involved in intestinal and brain pathologies. Analyses of the gut microbiota in PD, rapid-eye-movement sleep behavior disorder, and dementia with Lewy bodies suggest three pathological pathways. First, Akkermansia, which is increased in PD, degrades the intestinal mucus layer and increases intestinal permeability, which triggers inflammation and oxidative stress in the intestinal neural plexus. Second, decreased short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producing bacteria in PD reduce the number of regulatory T cells. Third, SCFAs also aggravate microglial activation with an unelucidated pathway. In addition, in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), which is another form of Î±-synucleinopathies, increased genera, Ruminococcus torques and Collinsella, may mitigate neuroinflammation in the substantia nigra by increasing secondary bile acids. Interventions for the gut microbiota and their metabolites may potentially delay or mitigate the development and progression of PD and other Lewy body diseases.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2023,Masaaki Hirayama; Hiroshi Nishiwaki; Tomonari Hamaguchi; Kinji Ohno

We aimed to determine whether gut microbiota is altered in PD patients and whether non-motor symptoms of PD and disease duration had any relation with alterations of microbiota profiles among patients.Microbial taxa in stool samples obtained from 84 subjects (42-PD patients and 42-healthy spouses) were analyzed using 16S rRNA amplicon-sequencing.We observed a significant decrease of Firmicutes and a significant increase of Verrucomicrobiota at the phylum level. At the family level, Lactobacillaceae and Akkermansiaceae were significantly increased and Coriobacteriales Incertae Sedis were significantly decreased in the PD patients compared to their healthy spouses. Genus level comparison inferred significant increase in abundance only in Lactobacillus while the abundance of Lachnospiraceae ND3007 group, Tyzzerella, Fusicatenibacter, Eubacterium hallii group and Ruminococcus gauvreauii group were all decreased. We determined that the abundance of Prevotella genus decreased, but not significantly in PD patients. In addition, we found differences in microbiota composition between patients with and without non-motor symptoms.We observed differences in gut microbiota composition between PD patients and their healthy spouses. Our findings suggest that disease duration influenced microbiota composition, which in turn influenced development of non-motor symptoms in PD. This study is the first in terms of both gut microbiota research in Turkish PD patients and the probable effect of microbiota on non-motor symptoms of PD.",Acta neurologica Belgica,2023,Gulsen Babacan Yildiz; Zeynep Cigdem Kayacan; Ilker Karacan; Bilge Sumbul; Birsen Elibol; Ozlem Gelisin; Ozer Akgul
37047769,Neuroprotective Effects of <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> PS128 in a Mouse Model of Parkinson's Disease: The Role of Gut Microbiota and MicroRNAs.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor deficits and marked neuroinflammation in various brain regions. The pathophysiology of PD is complex and mounting evidence has suggested an association with the dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) and gut dysbiosis. Using a rotenone-induced PD mouse model, we observed that administration of <i>Lactobacillus plantarum</i> PS128 (PS128) significantly improved motor deficits in PD-like mice, accompanied by an increased level of dopamine, reduced dopaminergic neuron loss, reduced microglial activation, reduced levels of inflammatory factors, and enhanced expression of neurotrophic factor in the brain. Notably, the inflammation-related expression of miR-155-5p was significantly upregulated in the proximal colon, midbrain, and striatum of PD-like mice. PS128 reduced the level of miR-155-5p, whereas it increased the expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1), a direct target of miR-155-5p and a critical inhibitor of the inflammatory response in the brain. Alteration of the fecal microbiota in PD-like mice was partially restored by PS128 administration. Among them, <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, <i>Ruminiclostridium</i>_6, <i>Bacteroides</i>, and <i>Alistipes</i> were statistically correlated with the improvement of rotenone-induced motor deficits and the expression of miR-155-5p and SOCS1. Our findings suggested that PS128 ameliorates motor deficits and exerts neuroprotective effects by regulating the gut microbiota and miR-155-5p/SOCS1 pathway in rotenone-induced PD-like mice.",International journal of molecular sciences,2023,Yan Zhang Lee; Shih-Hsuan Cheng; Min-Yu Chang; Yu-Fen Lin; Chien-Chen Wu; Ying-Chieh Tsai
37897083,Gut microbiota-derived short chain fatty acids act as mediators of the gut-brain axis targeting age-related neurodegenerative disorders: a narrative review.,"Neurodegenerative diseases associated with aging are often accompanied by cognitive decline and gut microbiota disorder. But the impact of gut microbiota on these cognitive disturbances remains incompletely understood. Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are major metabolites produced by gut microbiota during the digestion of dietary fiber, serving as an energy source for gut epithelial cells and/or circulating to other organs, such as the liver and brain, through the bloodstream. SCFAs have been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier and played crucial roles in brain metabolism, with potential implications in mediating Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the underlying mechanisms that SCFAs might influence psychological functioning, including affective and cognitive processes and their neural basis, have not been fully elucidated. Furthermore, the dietary sources which determine these SCFAs production was not thoroughly evaluated yet. This comprehensive review explores the production of SCFAs by gut microbiota, their transportation through the gut-brain axis, and the potential mechanisms by which they influence age-related neurodegenerative disorders. Also, the review discusses the importance of dietary fiber sources and the challenges associated with harnessing dietary-derived SCFAs as promoters of neurological health in elderly individuals. Overall, this study suggests that gut microbiota-derived SCFAs and/or dietary fibers hold promise as potential targets and strategies for addressing age-related neurodegenerative disorders.",Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2023,Bingbing Guo; Jingyi Zhang; Weihao Zhang; Feng Chen; Bin Liu
37719758,Acupuncture for Parkinson's disease-related constipation: current evidence and perspectives.,"Parkinson's disease-related constipation (PDC) is commonly associated with impaired dopamine transmission and gastrointestinal dysfunction. Current pharmacological treatments have limited efficacy and potential side effects. Acupuncture has shown promise as an alternative or adjunct therapy by modulating the brain-gut axis, gastrointestinal hormones, and autonomic function. Preliminary randomized trials have shown that acupuncture significantly improves constipation symptoms, bowel movements, and comfort compared to sham or drug treatments and is well-tolerated. The mechanisms of action may involve regulating the gut microbiota and mucosal immunity to improve dysbiosis and gastrointestinal motility. However, more rigorous studies are required to optimize acupuncture protocols and determine long-term efficacy and safety. In summary, acupuncture shows promise as an adjunct therapy for PDC, but further research is needed to confirm its efficacy and safety.",Frontiers in neurology,2023,Jiale Zhang; Xiaolei Ge; Kaiqi Zhang; Yun Qi; Shuo Ren; Xu Zhai
37150399,Differences in the gut microbiome across typical ageing and in Parkinson's disease.,"The microbiota-gut-brain axis' role in Parkinson's disease (PD) pathophysiology, and how this differs from typical ageing, is poorly understood. Presently, gut-bacterial diversity, taxonomic abundance and metabolic bacterial pathways were compared across healthy young (nÂ =Â 22, 18-35 years), healthy older (nÂ =Â 33, 50-80 years), and PD groups (nÂ =Â 18, 50-80 years) using shotgun sequencing and compositional data analysis. Associations between the gut-microbiome and PD symptoms, and between lifestyle factors (fibre intake, physical activity, and sleep) and the gut-microbiome were conducted. Alpha-diversity did not differ between PD participants and older adults, whilst beta-diversity differed between these groups. Lower abundance of Butyricimonas synergistica, a butyrate-producer, was associated with worse PD non-motor symptoms in the PD group. Regarding typical ageing, Bifidobacterium bifidum, was greater in the younger compared to older group, with no difference between the older and PD group. Abundance of metabolic pathways related to butyrate production did not differ among the groups, while other metabolic pathways differed among the three groups. Sleep efficiency was positively associated with Roseburia inulinivorans in the older group. These results highlight the relevance of gut-microbiota to PD and that reduced butyrate-production may be involved with PD pathophysiology. Future studies should account for lifestyle factors when investigating gut-microbiomes across ageing and in PD.

37508017,Urolithin A in Health and Diseases: Prospects for Parkinson's Disease Management.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a complex pathophysiology and a range of symptoms. The prevalence increases with age, putting the ageing population at risk. Disease management includes the improvement of symptoms, the comfort of the patient's life, and palliative care. As there is currently no cure, growing evidence points towards the beneficial role of polyphenols on neurodegeneration. Numerous studies indicate the health benefits of the family of urolithins, especially urolithin A (UA). UA is a bacterial metabolite produced by dietary ellagitannins and ellagic acid. An expanding body of literature explores the involvement of the compound in mitochondrial health, and its anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-apoptotic properties. The review organizes the existing knowledge on the role of UA in health and diseases, emphasizing neurodegenerative diseases, especially PD. We gathered data on the potential neuroprotective effect in in vivo and in vitro models. We discussed the possible mechanisms of action of the compound and related health benefits to give a broader perspective of potential applications of UA in neuroprotective strategies. Moreover, we projected the future directions of applying UA in PD management.","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,Olga Wojciechowska; MaÅgorzata Kujawska
36757367,Targeting the gut-microbiota-brain axis in irritable bowel disease to improve cognitive functionÂ - recent knowledge and emerging therapeutic opportunities.,"The brain-gut axis forms a bidirectional communication system between the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and cognitive brain areas. Disturbances to this system in disease states such as inflammatory bowel disease haveÂ consequences for neuronal activity and subsequent cognitive function. The gut-microbiota-brain axis refers to the communication between gut-resident bacteria and the brain. This circuits exists to detect gut microorganisms andÂ relay information to specific areas of the central nervous system (CNS) that in turn, regulate gut physiology. Changes in both the stability and diversity of the gut microbiota have been implicated in several neuronal disorders, including depression, autism spectrum disorder Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. Correcting this imbalance with medicinal herbs, the metabolic products of dysregulated bacteria and probiotics have shown hope for the treatment of these neuronal disorders. In this review, we focus on recent advances in our understanding of the intricate connections between the gut-microbiota and the brain. We discuss the contribution of gut microbiota to neuronal disorders and the tangible links between diseases of the GI tract with cognitive function and behaviour. In this regard, we focus on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) given its strong links toÂ brain function and anxiety disorders. This adds to the growing body of evidence supporting targeted therapeutic strategies to modulate the gut microbiota for the treatment of brain/mental-health-related disease.",Reviews in the neurosciences,2023,Heyong Tang; Xiaoqi Chen; Shun Huang; Gang Yin; Xiyang Wang; Guoming Shen
38115597,Gut microbiota modification by diosgenin mediates antiepileptic effects in a mouse model of epilepsy.,"Diosgenin, a natural steroid saponin, holds promise as a multitarget therapeutic for various diseases, including neurodegenerative conditions. Its efficacy in slowing Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and stroke progression has been demonstrated. However, the role of diosgenin in anti-epilepsy and its potential connection to the modulation of the intestinal microbiota remain poorly understood. In this study, exogenous diosgenin significantly mitigated pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures, learning and memory deficits, and hippocampal neuronal injury. 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) sequencing revealed a reversal in the decrease of Bacteroides and Parabacteroides genera in the PTZ-induced mouse epileptic model following diosgenin treatment. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiments illustrated the involvement of diosgenin in modulating gut microbiota and providing neuroprotection against epilepsy. Our results further indicated the repression of enteric glial cells (EGCs) activation and the TLR4-MyD88 pathway, coupled with reduced production of inflammatory cytokines in the colonic lumen, and improved intestinal barrier function in epilepsy mice treated with diosgenin or FMT. This study suggests that diosgenin plays a role in modifying gut microbiota, contributing to the alleviation of intestinal inflammation and neuroinflammation, ultimately inhibiting epilepsy progression in a PTZ-induced mouse model. Diosgenin emerges as a potential therapeutic option for managing epilepsy and its associated comorbidities.",Journal of neurochemistry,2023,Xinyu Li; Jing Li; Jia Ji; Saisai Li; Xiaoyu Yao; Hongbin Fan; Ruiqin Yao
38287957,Causal relationship between gut microflora and dementia: a Mendelian randomization study.,"Numerous pertinent investigations have demonstrated a correlation between gut microflora (GM) and the occurrence of dementia. However, a causal connection between GM and dementia and its subtypes has not yet been clarified.To explore the causal association between GM and dementia, including its subtypes, a two-sample Mendelian randomization (TSMR) analysis was used.Our data comes from the Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS). The principal approach employed for the Mendelian randomization study was the inverse-variance weighted method, supplemented by four methods: MR-Egger, weighted median, simple mode, and weighted mode. This was followed by Cochrane's Q test, MR-Egger intercept test, MR-PRESSO global test, and leave-one-out as sensitivity analysis validation.Twenty-one GMs associated with any dementia, Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, Parkinson's disease, and dementia under other disease classifications were derived from the analysis, and 21 passed sensitivity tests.We confirmed the causal relationship between GM and dementia and its subtypes, derived specific flora associated with increased or decreased risk of dementia, and provided new ideas for preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic interventions for dementia mediated by gut microbiota.",Frontiers in microbiology,2023,Jinjie Fu; Yuan Qin; Lingyong Xiao; Xiaoyu Dai
36278467,Relationship Between Gut Bacteria and Levodopa Metabolism.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, characterized by the reduction of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra. Levodopa, as a dopamine supplement, is the gold-standard therapeutic drug for PD. The metabolism of levodopa in the periphery not only decreases its bioavailability but also affects its efficacy. Thus, it is necessary to investigate how levodopa is metabolized. A growing number of studies have shown that intestinal bacteria, such as Enterococcus faecalis, Eggerthella lenta and Clostridium sporogenes, could metabolize levodopa in different ways. In addition, several pathways to reduce levodopa metabolism by gut microbiota were confirmed to improve levodopa efficacy. These pathways include aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) inhibitors, antibiotics, pH and (S)-Î±-fluoromethyltyrosine (AFMT). In this review, we have summarized the metabolic process of levodopa by intestinal bacteria and analyzed potential approaches to reduce the metabolism of levodopa by gut microbiota, thus improving the efficacy of levodopa.",Current neuropharmacology,2023,Kaifei Xu; Shuo Sheng; Feng Zhang
37191418,Gut Microbiota is an Impact Factor based on the Brain-Gut Axis to Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative disease of the central nervous system. The pathogenesis of AD has been explained using cholinergic, Î²-amyloid toxicity, tau protein hyperphosphorylation, and oxidative stress theories. However, an effective treatment method has not been developed. In recent years, with the discovery of the brain-gut axis (BGA) and breakthroughs made in Parkinson's disease, depression, autism, and other diseases, BGA has become a hotspot in AD research. Several studies have shown that gut microbiota can affect the brain and behavior of patients with AD, especially their cognitive function. Animal models, fecal microbiota transplantation, and probiotic intervention also provide evidence regarding the correlation between gut microbiota and AD. This article discusses the relationship and related mechanisms between gut microbiota and AD based on BGA to provide possible strategies for preventing or alleviating AD symptoms by regulating gut microbiota.",Aging and disease,2023,Bin Zou; Jia Li; Rui-Xia Ma; Xiao-Yu Cheng; Rui-Yin Ma; Ting-Yuan Zhou; Zi-Qi Wu; Yao Yao; Juan Li
37782386,5-HT4 Receptor is Protective for MPTP-induced Parkinson's Disease Mice Via Altering Gastrointestinal Motility or Gut Microbiota.,"Serotonergic dysfunction is related to both motor and nonmotor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). As a 5-HT receptor, 5-HT4 receptor (5-HT4R) is well-studied and already-used in clinical therapy of constipation, which is a typical non-motor symptom in PD. In this study, we investigated the role of 5-HT4R as a regulator of gut function in MPTP-induced acute PD mice model. Daily intraperitoneal injection of GR 125487 (5-HT4R antagonist) was administered 3 days before MPTP treatment until sacrifice. Seven days post-MPTP treatment, feces were collected and gastrointestinal transit time (GITT) was measured, 8 days post-MPTP treatment, behavioral tests were performed, and then animals were sacrificed for the further analysis. We found GR 125487 pretreatment not only increased GITT, but also aggravated MPTP-induced motor bradykinesia. In addition, GR 125487 pretreatment exacerbated the loss of dopaminergic neurons probably by suppressing JAK2/PKA/CREB signaling pathway and increased reactive glia and neuroinflammation in the striatum. 16Â S rRNA sequencing of fecal microbiota showed that GR 125487 pretreatment altered the composition of gut microbiota, in which the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila and Clostridium clostridioforme was increased, whereas that of Parabacteroides distasonis and Bacteroides fragilis was decreased, which are closely associated with inflammation condition. Taken together, we demonstrated that GR 125487 pretreatment exacerbates MPTP-induced striatal neurodegenerative processes possibly via the JAK2/PKA/CREB pathway and neuroinflammation by altering gut microbiota composition. In the microbiota-gut-brain axis of PD, 5-HT4R should be further explored and might serve as a target for PD diagnosis and treatment.",Journal of neuroimmune pharmacology : the official journal of the Society on NeuroImmune Pharmacology,2023,Chun Cui; Yun Shi; Hui Hong; Yu Zhou; Chenmeng Qiao; Liping Zhao; Xuebing Jia; Weijiang Zhao; Yanqin Shen
36993742,Gut microbiota and fecal short chain fatty acids differ with adiposity and country of origin: The METS-Microbiome Study.,"The relationship between the gut microbiota, short chain fatty acid (SCFA) metabolism, and obesity remains unclear due to conflicting reports from studies with limited statistical power. Additionally, this association has rarely been explored in large scale diverse populations. Here, we investigated associations between fecal microbial composition, predicted metabolic potential, SCFA concentrations, and obesity in a large ( <i>N</i> = 1,934) adult cohort of African-origin spanning the epidemiologic transition, from Ghana, South Africa, Jamaica, Seychelles, and the United States (US). The greatest gut microbiota diversity and total fecal SCFA concentration was found in the Ghanaian population, while the lowest levels were found in the US population, respectively representing the lowest and the highest end of the epidemiologic transition spectrum. Country-specific bacterial taxa and predicted-functional pathways were observed, including an increased prevalence of <i>Prevotella</i> , <i>Butyrivibrio</i> , <i>Weisella</i> and <i>Romboutsia</i> in Ghana and South Africa, while <i>Bacteroides</i> and <i>Parabacteroides</i> were enriched in Jamaican and the US populations. Importantly, 'VANISH' taxa, including <i>Butyricicoccus and Succinivibrio</i> , were significantly enriched in the Ghanaian cohort, reflecting the participants' traditional lifestyles. Obesity was significantly associated with lower SCFA concentrations, a decrease in microbial richness, and dissimilarities in community composition, and reduction in the proportion of SCFA synthesizing bacteria including <i>Oscillospira</i> , <i>Christensenella</i> , <i>Eubacterium</i> , <i>Alistipes</i> , <i>Clostridium</i> and <i>Odoribacter</i> . Further, the predicted proportions of genes in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) synthesis pathway were enriched in obese individuals, while genes associated with butyrate synthesis via the dominant pyruvate pathway were significantly reduced in obese individuals. Using machine learning, we identified features predictive of metabolic state and country of origin. Country of origin could accurately be predicted by the fecal microbiota (AUC = 0.97), whereas obesity could not be predicted as accurately (AUC = 0.65). Participant sex (AUC = 0.75), diabetes status (AUC = 0.63), hypertensive status (AUC = 0.65), and glucose status (AUC = 0.66) could all be predicted with different success. Interestingly, within country, the predictive accuracy of the microbiota for obesity was inversely correlated to the epidemiological transition, being greatest in Ghana (AUC = 0.57). Collectively, our findings reveal profound variation in the gut microbiota, inferred functional pathways, and SCFA synthesis as a function of country of origin. While obesity could be predicted accurately from the microbiota, the variation in accuracy in parallel with the epidemiological transition suggests that differences in the microbiota between obesity and non-obesity may be larger in low-to-middle countries compared to high-income countries. Further examination of independent study populations using multi-omic approaches will be necessary to determine the factors that drive this association.",bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,2023,Gertrude Ecklu-Mensah; Candice Choo-Kang; Maria Gjerstad Maseng; Sonya Donato; Pascal Bovet; Kweku Bedu-Addo; Jacob Plange-Rhule; Terrence E Forrester; Estelle V Lambert; Dale Rae; Amy Luke; Brian T Layden; Stephen O'Keefe; Jack A Gilbert; Lara R Dugas
38141735,Does gut brain axis has an impact on Parkinson's disease (PD)?,"Parkinson's Disease (PD) is becoming a growing global concern by being the second most prevalent disease next to Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Henceforth new exploration is needed in search of new aspects towards the disease mechanism and origin. Evidence from recent studies has clearly stated the role of Gut Microbiota (GM) in the maintenance of the brain and as a root cause of various diseases and disorders including other neurological conditions. In the case of PD, with an unknown etiology, the GM is said to have a larger impact on the disease pathophysiology. Although GM and its metabolites are crucial for maintaining the normal physiology of the host, it is an undeniable fact that there is an influence of GM in the pathophysiology of PD. As such the Enteroendocrine Cells (EECs) in the epithelium of the intestine are one of the significant regulators of the gut-brain axis and act as a communication mediator between the gut and the brain. The communication is established via the molecules of neuroendocrine which are said to have a crucial part in neurological diseases such as AD, PD, and other psychiatry-related disorders. This review is focused on understanding the proper role of GM and EECs in PD. Here, we also focus on some of the metabolites and compounds that can interact with the PD genes causing various dysfunctions in the cell and facilitating the disease conditions using bioinformatical tools.

37978405,Oral pathogens exacerbate Parkinson's disease by promoting Th1 cell infiltration in mice.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common chronic neurological disorder with a high risk of disability and no cure. Periodontitis is an infectious bacterial disease occurring in periodontal supporting tissues. Studies have shown that periodontitis is closely related to PD. However, direct evidence of the effect of periodontitis on PD is lacking. Here, we demonstrated that ligature-induced periodontitis with application of subgingival plaque (LIP-SP) exacerbated motor dysfunction, microglial activation, and dopaminergic neuron loss in 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mice.The 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that LIP-SP induced oral and gut dysbiosis. Particularly, Veillonella parvula (V. parvula) and Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) from oral ligatures were increased in the fecal samples of MPTPâ+âLIP-SP treated mice. We further demonstrated that V. parvula and S. mutans played crucial roles in LIP-SP mediated exacerbation of motor dysfunction and neurodegeneration in PD mice. V. parvula and S. mutans caused microglial activation in the brain, as well as T helper 1 (Th1) cells infiltration in the brain, cervical lymph nodes, ileum and colon in PD mice. Moreover, we observed a protective effect of IFNÎ³ neutralization on dopaminergic neurons in V. parvula- and S. mutans-treated PD mice.Our study demonstrates that oral pathogens V. parvula and S. mutans necessitate the existence of periodontitis to exacerbate motor dysfunction and neurodegeneration in MPTP-induced PD mice. The underlying mechanisms include alterations of oral and gut microbiota, along with immune activation in both brain and peripheral regions.

37850544,Influence of gut microbiota on the development of most prevalent neurodegenerative dementias and the potential effect of probiotics in elderly: A scoping review.,"Dementia is one of today's greatest public health challenges. Its high socio-economic impact and difficulties in diagnosis and treatment are of increasing concern to an aging world population. In recent years, the study of the relationship between gut microbiota and different neurocognitive disorders has gained a considerable interest. Several studies have reported associations between gut microbiota dysbiosis and some types of dementia. Probiotics have been suggested to restore dysbiosis and to improve neurocognitive symptomatology in these dementias. Based on these previous findings, the available scientific evidence on the gut microbiota in humans affected by the most prevalent dementias, as well as the probiotic trials conducted in these patients in recent years, have been here reviewed. Decreased concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and other bacterial metabolites appear to play a major role in the onset of neurocognitive symptoms in Alzheimer disease (AD) and Parkinson disease dementia (PDD). Increased abundance of proinflammatory taxa could be closely related to the more severe clinical symptoms in both, as well as in Lewy Bodies dementia. Important lack of information was noted in Frontotemporal dementia behavioral variant. Moreover, geographical differences in the composition of the gut microbiota have been reported in AD. Some potential beneficial effects of probiotics in AD and PDD have been reported.

37375632,The Impact of a Very-Low-Calorie Ketogenic Diet in the Gut Microbiota Composition in Obesity.,"The very-low-calorie KD (VLCKD) is characterized by a caloric intake of under 800 kcal/day divided into less than 50 g/day of carbohydrate (13%) and 1 to 1.5 g of protein/kg of body weight (44%) and 43% of fat. This low carbohydrate intake changes the energy source from glucose to ketone bodies. Moreover, clinical trials have consistently shown a beneficial effect of VLCKD in several diseases, such as heart failure, schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's, and obesity, among others. The gut microbiota has been associated with the metabolic conditions of a person and is regulated by diet interactions; furthermore, it has been shown that the microbiota has a role in body weight homeostasis by regulating metabolism, appetite, and energy. Currently, there is increasing evidence of an association between gut microbiota dysbiosis and the pathophysiology of obesity. In addition, the molecular pathways, the role of metabolites, and how microbiota modulation could be beneficial remain unclear, and more research is needed.

37674043,Gut microbiota-induced CXCL1 elevation triggers early neuroinflammation in the substantia nigra of Parkinsonian mice.,"Gut microbiota disturbance and systemic inflammation have been implicated in the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD). How the alteration of gut microbiota results in neuropathological events in PD remains elusive. In this study, we explored whether and how environmental insults caused early neuropathological events in the substantia nigra (SN) of a PD mouse model. Aged (12-month-old) mice were orally administered rotenone (6.25âmgÂ·kg<sup>-1</sup>Â·d<sup>-1</sup>) 5 days per week for 2 months. We demonstrated that oral administration of rotenone to ageing mice was sufficient to establish a PD mouse model and that microglial activation and iron deposition selectively appeared in the SN of the mice prior to loss of motor coordination and dopaminergic neurons, and these events could be fully blocked by microglial elimination with a PLX5622-formulated diet. 16âS rDNA sequencing analysis showed that the gut microbiota in rotenone-treated mice was altered, and mice receiving faecal microbial transplantation (FMT) from ageing mice treated with rotenone for 2 months exhibited the same pathology in the SN. We demonstrated that C-X-C motif chemokine ligand-1 (CXCL1) was an essential molecule, as intravenous injection of CXCL1 mimicked almost all the pathology in serum and SN induced by oral rotenone and FMT. Using metabolomics and transcriptomics analyses, we identified the PPAR pathway as a key pathway involved in rotenone-induced neuronal damage. Inhibition of the PPARÎ³ pathway was consistent in the above models, whereas its activation by linoleic acid (60Â mgÂ·kg<sup>-1</sup>Â·d<sup>-1</sup>, i.g. for 1 week) could block these pathological events in mice intravenously injected with CXCL1. Altogether, these results reveal that the altered gut microbiota resulted in neuroinflammation and iron deposition occurring early in the SN of ageing mice with oral administration of rotenone, much earlier than motor symptoms and dopaminergic neuron loss. We found that CXCL1 plays a crucial role in this process, possibly via PPARÎ³ signalling inhibition. This study may pave the way for understanding the ""brain-gut-microbiota"" molecular regulatory networks in PD pathogenesis. The aged C57BL/6 male mice with rotenone intragastric administration showed altered gut microbiota, which caused systemic inflammation, PPARÎ³ signalling inhibition and neuroinflammation, brain iron deposition and ferroptosis, and eventually dopaminergic neurodegeneration in PD.",Acta pharmacologica Sinica,2024,Xi-Zhen Ma; Lei-Lei Chen; Le Qu; Hui Li; Jun Wang; Ning Song; Jun-Xia Xie

37034781,Machine learning based gut microbiota pattern and response to fiber as a diagnostic tool for chronic inflammatory diseases.,"Gut microbiota has been implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple gastrointestinal (GI) and systemic metabolic and inflammatory disorders where disrupted gut microbiota composition and function (dysbiosis) has been found in multiple studies. Thus, human microbiome data has a potential to be a great source of information for the diagnosis and disease characteristics (phenotypes, disease course, therapeutic response) of diseases with dysbiotic microbiota community. However, multiple attempts to leverage gut microbiota taxonomic data for diagnostic and disease characterization have failed due to significant inter-individual variability of microbiota community and overlap of disrupted microbiota communities among multiple diseases. One potential approach is to look at the microbiota community pattern and response to microbiota modifiers like dietary fiber in different disease states. This approach is now feasible by availability of machine learning that is able to identify hidden patterns in the human microbiome and predict diseases. Accordingly, the aim of our study was to test the hypothesis that application of machine learning algorithms can distinguish stool microbiota pattern and microbiota response to fiber between diseases where overlapping dysbiotic microbiota have been previously reported. Here, we have applied machine learning algorithms to distinguish between Parkinson's disease, Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), human immune deficiency virus (HIV), and healthy control (HC) subjects in the presence and absence of fiber treatments. We have shown that machine learning algorithms can classify diseases with accuracy as high as 95%. Furthermore, machine learning methods applied to the microbiome data to predict UC vs CD led to prediction accuracy as high as 90%.",bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,2023,Miad Boodaghidizaji; Thaisa Jungles; Tingting Chen; Bin Zhang; Alan Landay; Ali Keshavarzian; Bruce Hamaker; Arezoo Ardekani
37561259,Compound Dihuang Granule Changes Gut Microbiota of MPTP-Induced Parkinson's Disease Mice via Inhibiting TLR4/NF-ÎºB Signaling.,"Intestinal microbiota was connected to Parkinson's Disease (PD) pathology. The ancient Chinese medication for PD is Compound Dihuang Granule (CDG), and we found a neuroprotective function in treating the constipation of PD patients. Nevertheless, the mechanism of action still needs to be clarified. We predicted the probable targets of CDG against PD through Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) network pharmacology and verified the analysis through animal experiments in vivo. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis screened PD-related genes, including Toll-like receptor 4(TLR4), TANK-binding kinase 1(TBK1), Nuclear Factor- Kappa B (NF-ÎºB), and Tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses proved that the NF-ÎºB and toll-like receptor signaling pathways serve a key function in CDG therapy of PD. Molecular docking analysis demonstrated that CDG strongly connected to TLR4/NF-ÎºB. Experiments findings indicated that CDG improved the damage of dopaminergic neurons and gut microbial dysbiosis, ameliorated motor impairments, and suppressed the PD-associated inflammation and oxidative stress in mice induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahy dropyridine (MPTP). CDG suppressed the inflammatory proteins in the colon and protected the intestinal barrier. Overall, CDG improved gut microbial in PD by blocking the pathway of TLR4/NF-ÎºB.",Neurochemical research,2023,Zhu-Qing He; Peng-Fei Huan; Li Wang; Jian-Cheng He
36805171,The importance of gut-brain axis and use of probiotics as a treatment strategy for multiple sclerosis.,"It has been shown that the dysbiosis of the gut's microbes substantially impacts CNS illnesses, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, autism, and autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is a CNS-affected autoimmune demyelination condition. Through a two-way communication pathway known as the gut-brain axis, gut microbes communicate with the CNS. When there is a disruption in the gut microbiome, cytokines and other immune cells are secreted, which affects the BBB and gastrointestinal permeability. Recent research using animal models has revealed that the gut microbiota may greatly influence the pathophysiology of EAE/MS. Any change in the gut might increase inflammatory cytokinesand affect the quantity of SCFAs, and other metabolites that cause neuroinflammation and demyelination. In- vivo and in-vitro studies have concluded that probiotics affect the immune system and can be utilized to treat gastrointestinal dysbiosis. Any alteration in the gut microbial composition caused by probiotic intake may serve as a preventive and treatment strategy for MS. The major goal of this review is to emphasize an overview of recent research on the function of gut microbiota in the onset of MS and how probiotics have a substantial impact on gastrointestinal disruption in MS and other neuro disorders. It will be easier to develop new therapeutic approaches, particularly probiotic-based supplements, for treating multiple sclerosis (MS) if we know the link between the gut and CNS.",Multiple sclerosis and related disorders,2023,Nitish Kumar; Nalini Kanta Sahoo; Sidharth Mehan; Bharti Verma
37647997,Biomarkers of aging in frailty and age-associated disorders: State of the art and future perspective.,"According to the Geroscience concept that organismal aging and age-associated diseases share the same basic molecular mechanisms, the identification of biomarkers of age that can efficiently classify people as biologically older (or younger) than their chronological (i.e. calendar) age is becoming of paramount importance. These people will be in fact at higher (or lower) risk for many different age-associated diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, neurodegeneration, cancer, etc. In turn, patients suffering from these diseases are biologically older than healthy age-matched individuals. Many biomarkers that correlate with age have been described so far. The aim of the present review is to discuss the usefulness of some of these biomarkers (especially soluble, circulating ones) in order to identify frail patients, possibly before the appearance of clinical symptoms, as well as patients at risk for age-associated diseases. An overview of selected biomarkers will be discussed in this regard, in particular we will focus on biomarkers related to metabolic stress response, inflammation, and cell death (in particular in neurodegeneration), all phenomena connected to inflammaging (chronic, low-grade, age-associated inflammation). In the second part of the review, next-generation markers such as extracellular vesicles and their cargos, epigenetic markers and gut microbiota composition, will be discussed. Since recent progresses in omics techniques have allowed an exponential increase in the production of laboratory data also in the field of biomarkers of age, making it difficult to extract biological meaning from the huge mass of available data, Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches will be discussed as an increasingly important strategy for extracting knowledge from raw data and providing practitioners with actionable information to treat patients.",Ageing research reviews,2023,Stefano Salvioli; Maria Sofia Basile; Leonardo Bencivenga; Sara Carrino; Maria Conte; Sarah Damanti; Rebecca De Lorenzo; Eleonora Fiorenzato; Alessandro Gialluisi; Assunta Ingannato; Angelo Antonini; Nicola Baldini; Miriam Capri; Simone Cenci; Licia Iacoviello; Benedetta Nacmias; Fabiola Olivieri; Giuseppe Rengo; Patrizia Rovere Querini; Fabrizia Lattanzio
37171224,Possible Signaling Pathways in the Gut Microbiota-Brain Axis for the Development of Parkinson's Disease Caused by Chronic Consumption of Food Additives.,"It is well-known that consumption of synthetic and natural food additives has both positive and negative effects in the human body. However, it is not clear yet how food additives are related to the development of Parkinson's disease. Therefore, in this review work, the food additive effects related to the gut microbiota-brain axis and the processes that are carried out to develop Parkinson's disease are studied. To this end, a systematic literature analysis is performed with the selected keywords and the food additive effects are studied to draw possible routes of action. This analysis leads to the proposition of a model that explains the pathways that relate the ingestion of food additives to the development of Parkinson's disease. This work motivates further research that ponders the safety of food additives by measuring their impacts over the gut microbiota-brain axis.",ACS chemical neuroscience,2023,Melanie VerÃ³nica Martinez-Vega; SebastiÃ¡n GalvÃ¡n-MenÃ©ndez-Conde; VerÃ³nica Freyre-Fonseca
37630539,Personalized Response of Parkinson's Disease Gut Microbiota to Nootropic Medicinal Herbs In Vitro: A Proof of Concept.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons. Although the etiology of PD remains elusive, it has been hypothesized that initial dysregulation may occur in the gastrointestinal tract and may be accompanied by gut barrier defects. A strong clinical interest in developing therapeutics exists, including for the treatment of gut microbiota and physiology. We previously reported the impact of healthy fecal microbiota anaerobic cultures supplemented with nootropic herbs. Here, we evaluated the effect of nootropic Ayurvedic herbs on fecal microbiota derived from subjects with PD in vitro using 16S rRNA sequencing. The microbiota underwent substantial change in response to each treatment, comparable in magnitude to that observed from healthy subjects. However, the fecal samples derived from each participant displayed unique changes, consistent with a personalized response. We used genome-wide metabolic reconstruction to predict the community's metabolic potential to produce products relevant to PD pathology, including SCFAs, vitamins and amino acid degradation products. These results suggest the potential value of conducting in vitro cultivation and analyses of PD stool samples as a means of prescreening patients to select the medicinal herbs for which that individual is most likely to respond and derive benefit.",Microorganisms,2023,Christine Tara Peterson; Stanislav N Iablokov; Dmitry A Rodionov; Scott N Peterson
37267589,"A Low-Protein, High-Carbohydrate Diet Exerts a Neuroprotective Effect on Mice with 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-Induced Parkinson's Disease by Regulating the Microbiota-Metabolite-Brain Axis and Fibroblast Growth Factor 21.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is closely linked to lifestyle factors, particularly dietary patterns, which have attracted interest as potential disease-modifying factors. Eating a low-protein, high-carbohydrate (LPHC) diet is a promising dietary intervention against brain aging; however, its protective effect on PD remains elusive. Here, we found that an LPHC diet ameliorated 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrathydropyridine (MPTP)-induced motor deficits, decreased dopaminergic neuronal death, and increased the levels of striatal dopamine, serotonin, and their metabolites in PD mice. Levels of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF-21), a member of the fibroblast growth factor family, were elevated in PD mice following LPHC treatment. Furthermore, the administration of FGF-21 exerted a protective effect on MPTP-induced PC12 cells, similar to the effect of an LPHC diet in MPTP-induced mice. Sequencing of the 16S rDNA from fecal microbiota revealed that an LPHC diet normalized the gut bacterial composition imbalance in PD mice, as evidenced by the increased abundance of the genera <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, <i>Ileibacterium</i>, <i>Turicibacter</i>, and <i>Blautia</i> and decreased abundance of <i>Bilophila, Alistipes</i>, and <i>Bacteroides</i>. PICRUSt-predicted fecal microbiome function revealed that an LPHC diet suppressed lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and the citrate cycle (TCA cycle), biosynthesis of ubiquinone and other terpenoid-quinones, and oxidative phosphorylation pathways caused by MPTP, and enhanced the biosynthesis of amino acids, carbohydrate metabolism, and biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites. A nonmetabolomic analysis of the serum and feces showed that an LPHC diet significantly increased the levels of aromatic amino acids (AAAs), including tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine. In addition, an LPHC diet elevated the serum concentrations of bile acids (BAs), particularly tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) and taurine. Collectively, our current findings point to the potential mechanism of administering an LPHC diet in attenuating movement impairments in MPTP-induced PD mice, with AAAs, microbial metabolites (TUDCA and taurine), and FGF-21 as key mediators along the gut-microbiota-brain axis.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2023,Chuanqi Chu; Tiantian Li; Leilei Yu; Yiwen Li; Miaoyu Li; Min Guo; Jianxin Zhao; Qixiao Zhai; Fengwei Tian; Wei Chen
36676436,Latent Potential of Multifunctional Selenium Nanoparticles in Neurological Diseases and Altered Gut Microbiota.,"Neurological diseases remain a major concern due to the high world mortality rate and the absence of appropriate therapies to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Therefore, the major focus is on the development of such strategies that not only enhance the efficacy of drugs but also increase their permeability in the BBB. Currently, nano-scale materials seem to be an appropriate approach to treating neurological diseases based on their drug-loading capacity, reduced toxicity, targeted delivery, and enhanced therapeutic effect. Selenium (Se) is an essential micronutrient and has been of remarkable interest owing to its essential role in the physiological activity of the nervous system, i.e., signal transmission, memory, coordination, and locomotor activity. A deficiency of Se leads to various neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, and Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, owing to the neuroprotective role of Se (selenium) nanoparticles (SeNPs) are of particular interest to treat neurological diseases. To date, many studies investigate the role of altered microbiota with neurological diseases; thus, the current review focused not only on the recent advancement in the field of nanotechnology, considering SeNPs to cure neurological diseases, but also on investigating the potential role of SeNPs in altered microbiota.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,Hajra Ashraf; Davide Cossu; Stefano Ruberto; Marta Noli; Seyedesomaye Jasemi; Elena Rita Simula; Leonardo A Sechi
37458987,Dissecting the Relationship Between Neuropsychiatric and Neurodegenerative Disorders.,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) and neuropsychiatric disorders (NPDs) are two common causes of death in elderly people, which includes progressive neuronal cell death and behavioral changes. NDDs include Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and motor neuron disease, characterized by cognitive defects and memory impairment, whereas NPDs include depression, seizures, migraine headaches, eating disorders, addictions, palsies, major depressive disorders, anxiety, and schizophrenia, characterized by behavioral changes. Mounting evidence demonstrated that NDDs and NPDs share an overlapping mechanism, which includes post-translational modifications, the microbiota-gut-brain axis, and signaling events. Mounting evidence demonstrated that various drug molecules, namely, natural compounds, repurposed drugs, multitarget directed ligands, and RNAs, have been potentially implemented as therapeutic agents against NDDs and NPDs. Herein, we highlighted the overlapping mechanism, the role of anxiety/stress-releasing factors, cytosol-to-nucleus signaling, and the microbiota-gut-brain axis in the pathophysiology of NDDs and NPDs. We summarize the therapeutic application of natural compounds, repurposed drugs, and multitarget-directed ligands as therapeutic agents. Lastly, we briefly described the application of RNA interferences as therapeutic agents in the pathogenesis of NDDs and NPDs. Neurodegenerative diseases and neuropsychiatric diseases both share a common signaling molecule and molecular phenomenon, namely, pro-inflammatory cytokines, Î³CaMKII and MAPK/ERK, chemokine receptors, BBB permeability, and the gut-microbiota-brain axis. Studies have demonstrated that any alterations in the signaling mentioned above molecules and molecular phenomena lead to the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases, namely, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and neuropsychiatric disorders, such as bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, autism spectrum disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder.",Molecular neurobiology,2023,Rohan Gupta; Dia Advani; Divya Yadav; Rashmi K Ambasta; Pravir Kumar
37755674,Relationship Between Short-chain Fatty Acids and Parkinson's Disease: A Review from Pathology to Clinic.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complicated neurodegenerative disease, characterized by the accumulation of Î±-synuclein (Î±-syn) in Lewy bodies and neurites, and massive loss of midbrain dopamine neurons. Increasing evidence suggests that gut microbiota and microbial metabolites are involved in the development of PD. Among these, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), the most abundant microbial metabolites, have been proven to play a key role in brain-gut communication. In this review, we analyze the role of SCFAs in the pathology of PD from multiple dimensions and summarize the alterations of SCFAs in PD patients as well as their correlation with motor and non-motor symptoms. Future research should focus on further elucidating the role of SCFAs in neuroinflammation, as well as developing novel strategies employing SCFAs and their derivatives to treat PD.",Neuroscience bulletin,2024,Wen-Xiang Duan; Fen Wang; Jun-Yi Liu; Chun-Feng Liu
37460539,Neuroprotective effect of a medium-chain triglyceride ketogenic diet on MPTP-induced Parkinson's disease mice: a combination of transcriptomics and metabolomics in the substantia nigra and fecal microbiome.,"The ketogenic diet (KD) is a low carbohydrate and high-fat protein diet. It plays a protective role in neurodegenerative diseases by elevating the levels of ketone bodies in blood, regulating central and peripheral metabolism and mitochondrial functions, inhibiting neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, and altering the gut microbiota. However, studies on ketogenic therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD) are still in their infancy. Therefore, we examined the possible protective effect of KD in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse model, examined the mouse gut microbiota and its metabolites, and performed transcriptomics and metabolomics on the substantia nigra of mice. Our results showed that a long-term medium-chain triglyceride KD (MCT-KD) significantly reduced MPTP-induced damage to dopaminergic (DA) neurons, exerted antioxidant stress through the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 pathway, and reversed oxidative stress in DA neurons. The MCT-KD also reduced mitochondrial loss, promoted ATP production, and inhibited the activation of microglia to protect DA neurons in MPTP-induced PD mice. MCT-KD altered the gut microbiota and consequently changed the metabolism of substantia nigra neurons through gut microbiota metabolites. Compared to the MPTP group, MCT-KD increased the abundance of gut microbiota, including Blautia and Romboutsia. MCT-KD also affects purine metabolism in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) by altering fecal metabolites. This study shows that MCT-KD has multiple protective effects against PD.",Cell death discovery,2023,Wenlong Zhang; Shiyu Chen; Xingting Huang; Huichun Tong; Hongxin Niu; Lingli Lu
37107583,Role of Microbiota-Modified Bile Acids in the Regulation of Intracellular Organelles and Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Bile acids (BAs) are amphiphilic steroidal molecules generated from cholesterol in the liver and facilitate the digestion and absorption of fat-soluble substances in the gut. Some BAs in the intestine are modified by the gut microbiota. Because BAs are modified in a variety of ways by different types of bacteria present in the gut microbiota, changes in the gut microbiota can affect the metabolism of BAs in the host. Although most BAs absorbed from the gut are transferred to the liver, some are transferred to the systemic circulation. Furthermore, BAs have also been detected in the brain and are thought to migrate into the brain through the systemic circulation. Although BAs are known to affect a variety of physiological functions by acting as ligands for various nuclear and cell-surface receptors, BAs have also been found to act on mitochondria and autophagy in the cell. This review focuses on the BAs modified by the gut microbiota and their roles in intracellular organelles and neurodegenerative diseases.",Genes,2023,Yoshimitsu Kiriyama; Hiromi Nochi
37589449,"Communal interaction of glycation and gut microbes in diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease pathogenesis.","Diabetes and its complications, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD) are increasing gradually, reflecting a global threat vis-Ã -vis expressing the essentiality of a substantial paradigm shift in research and remedial actions. Protein glycation is influenced by several factors, like time, temperature, pH, metal ions, and the half-life of the protein. Surprisingly, most proteins associated with metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders are generally long-lived and hence susceptible to glycation. Remarkably, proteins linked with diabetes, AD, and PD share this characteristic. This modulates protein's structure, aggregation tendency, and toxicity, highlighting renovated attention. Gut microbes and microbial metabolites marked their importance in human health and diseases. Though many scientific shreds of evidence are proposed for possible change and dysbiosis in gut flora in these diseases, very little is known about the mechanisms. Screening and unfolding their functionality in metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders is essential in hunting the gut treasure. Therefore, it is imperative to evaluate the role of glycation as a common link in diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases, which helps to clarify if modulation of nonenzymatic glycation may act as a beneficial therapeutic strategy and gut microbes/metabolites may answer some of the crucial questions. This review briefly emphasizes the common functional attributes of glycation and gut microbes, the possible linkages, and discusses current treatment options and therapeutic challenges.",Medicinal research reviews,2024,Rahul Shivaji Patil; Rashmi Santosh Tupe
37496895,<i>Acanthopanax senticosus</i> Harms improves Parkinson's disease by regulating gut microbial structure and metabolic disorders.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, with an increasing prevalence as the population ages, posing a serious threat to human health, but the pathogenesis remains uncertain. <i>Acanthopanax senticosus</i> (Rupr. et Maxim.) Harms (ASH) (aqueous ethanol extract), a Chinese herbal medicine, provides obvious and noticeable therapeutic effects on PD. To further investigate the ASH's mechanism of action in treating PD, the structural and functional gut microbiota, as well as intestinal metabolite before and after ASH intervention in the PD mice model, were examined utilizing metagenomics and fecal metabolomics analysis. Î±-syn transgenic mice were randomly divided into a model and ASH groups, with C57BL/6 mice as a control. The ASH group was gavaged with ASH (45.5Â mg/kg/d for 20d). The time of pole climbing and autonomous activity were used to assess motor ability. The gut microbiota's structure, composition, and function were evaluated using Illumina sequencing. Fecal metabolites were identified using UHPLC-MS/MS to construct intestinal metabolites. The findings of this experiment demonstrate that ASH may reduce the climbing time of PD model mice while increasing the number of autonomous movements. The results of metagenomics analysis revealed that ASH could up-regulated <i>Firmicutes</i> and down-regulated <i>Actinobacteria</i> at the phylum level, while <i>Clostridium</i> was up-regulated and <i>Akkermansia</i> was down-regulated at the genus level; it could also recall 49 species from the phylum <i>Firmicutes</i>, <i>Actinobacteria</i>, and <i>Tenericutes</i>. Simultaneously, metabolomics analysis revealed that alpha-Linolenic acid metabolism might be a key metabolic pathway for ASH to impact in PD. Furthermore, metagenomics function analysis and metabolic pathway enrichment analysis revealed that ASH might influence unsaturated fatty acid synthesis and purine metabolism pathways. These metabolic pathways are connected to ALA, Palmitic acid, Adenine, and 16 species of <i>Firmicutes</i>, <i>Actinobacteria</i>, and <i>Tenericutes</i>. Finally, these results indicate that ASH may alleviate the movement disorder of the PD model, which may be connected to the regulation of gut microbiota structure and function as well as the modulation of metabolic disorders by ASH.",Heliyon,2023,Yi Lu; Xin Gao; Yang Nan; Shadi A D Mohammed; Jiaqi Fu; Tianyu Wang; Chongzhi Wang; Chunsu Yuan; Fang Lu; Shumin Liu
36803806,Disease mechanisms as subtypes: Microbiome.,"Abnormalities in gut microbiota have been suggested to be involved in the pathophysiology and progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). Gastrointestinal nonmotor symptoms often precede the onset of motor features in PD, suggesting a role for gut dysbiosis in neuroinflammation and Î±-synuclein (Î±-syn) aggregation. In the first part of this chapter, we analyze critical features of healthy gut microbiota and factors (environmental and genetic) that modify its composition. In the second part, we focus on the mechanisms underlying the gut dysbiosis and how it alters anatomically and functionally the mucosal barrier, triggering neuroinflammation and subsequently Î±-syn aggregation. In the third part, we describe the most common alterations in the gut microbiota of PD patients, dividing the gastrointestinal system in higher and lower tract to examine the association between microbiota abnormalities and clinical features. In the final section, we report on current and future therapeutic approaches to gut dysbiosis aiming to either reduce the risk for PD, modify the disease course, or improve the pharmacokinetic profile of dopaminergic therapies. We also suggest that further studies will be needed to clarify the role of the microbiome in PD subtyping and of pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions in modifying specific microbiota profiles in individualizing disease-modifying treatments in PD.",Handbook of clinical neurology,2023,Salvatore Bonvegna; Roberto Cilia
36671785,"Parkinson's Disease, It Takes Guts: The Correlation between Intestinal Microbiome and Cytokine Network with Neurodegeneration.","Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with motor, physical and behavioral symptoms that can have a profound impact on the patient's quality of life. Most cases are idiopathic, and the exact mechanism of the disease's cause is unknown. The current hypothesis focuses on the gut-brain axis and states that gut microbiota dysbiosis can trigger inflammation and advances the development of Parkinson's disease. This systematic review presents the current knowledge of gut microbiota analysis and inflammation based on selected studies on Parkinson's patients and experimental animal models. Changes in gut microbiota correlate with Parkinson's disease, but only a few studies have considered inflammatory modulators as important triggers of the disease. Nevertheless, it is evident that proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines are induced in the gut, the circulation, and the brain before the development of the disease's neurological symptoms and exacerbate the disease. Increased levels of tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1Î², interleukin-6, interleukin-17A and interferon-Î³ can correlate with altered gut microbiota. Instead, treatment of gut dysbiosis is accompanied by reduced levels of inflammatory mediators in specific tissues, such as the colon, brain and serum and/or cerebrospinal fluid. Deciphering the role of the immune responses and the mechanisms of the PD-associated gut microbiota will assist the interpretation of the pathogenesis of Parkinson's and will elucidate appropriate therapeutic strategies.",Biology,2023,Georgia Xiromerisiou; Chrysoula Marogianni; Anastasia Androutsopoulou; Panagiotis Ntavaroukas; Dimitrios Mysiris; Stamatia Papoutsopoulou
38146566,Effectiveness of the Combination of Probiotic Supplementation on Motor Symptoms and Constipation in Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) reflects the second most common neurodegenerative disorder and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Besides the motor features, non-motor symptoms, such as constipation, are very common. There is accumulating evidence that neuroinflammation is associated with the PD pathological processes. Alterations of gut microbiota and microbial metabolites have been linked to the pathogenesis of PD. Previous research has shown that probiotic supplementation has beneficial effects on motor and non-motor symptoms and especially on constipation.In this study, we examine the effectiveness of a combination of probiotic supplementation (butyrate triglyceride 302.86 mg, <i>Crocus sativus L.</i> 30 mg, and vitamin D3 100 mcg), on constipation and motor symptoms in PD.The present study is a retrospective study that examined the existing medical records of patients with diagnosed PD, having chronic constipation and used the probiotic supplementation for its management. A total of 41 existing medical records were screened. Medical records were excluded in the case of participation in another study for PD, suffering from irritable bowel syndrome, organic constipation, long-term laxative use changes in the standard dopaminergic treatment, Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) score<24, hospitalization and antibiotic medication, and diarrheal syndrome. Nine medical records were excluded, and a final number of 32 medical records was finally examined. All 32 patients had evaluations carried out at baseline and three months after supplement administration. A stool diary questionnaire, the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III (UPDRS III), and the Schwab and England and the Hoehn and Yahr scales were used for the evaluation.The median defecation frequency was significantly improved. The supplementation administration significantly improved UPDRS IIIÂ by 7.7% (from 35.72Â±15.51 to 32.97Â±15.71, p = 0.005) at month three, as compared to baseline.Â A positive effect was also seen in the Schwab and England scale. There was no effect on the Hoehn and Yahr scale.The enteric microbiome composition is altered in PD, and there is accumulating evidence that probiotic supplementation could alleviate disease symptoms in neuroinflammatory disorders.",Cureus,2023,Athanasia Alexoudi; Lydia Kesidou; Stylianos Gatzonis; Christos Charalampopoulos; Areti Tsoga
37298727,Zooming into Gut Dysbiosis in Parkinson's Disease: New Insights from Functional Mapping.,"Gut dysbiosis has been involved in the pathogenesis and progression of Parkinson's disease (PD), but the mechanisms through which gut microbiota (GM) exerts its influences deserve further study. Recently, we proposed a two-hit mouse model of PD in which ceftriaxone (CFX)-induced dysbiosis amplifies the neurodegenerative phenotype generated by striatal 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) injection in mice. Low GM diversity and the depletion of key gut colonizers and butyrate producers were the main signatures of GM alteration in this model. Here, we used the phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states (PICRUSt2) to unravel candidate pathways of cell-to-cell communication associated with dual-hit mice and potentially involved in PD progression. We focused our analysis on short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) metabolism and quorum sensing (QS) signaling. Based on linear discriminant analysis, combined with the effect size results, we found increased functions linked to pyruvate utilization and a depletion of acetate and butyrate production in 6-OHDA+CFX mice. The specific arrangement of QS signaling as a possible result of the disrupted GM structure was also observed. With this exploratory study, we suggested a scenario in which SCFAs metabolism and QS signaling might represent the effectors of gut dysbiosis potentially involved in the designation of the functional outcomes that contribute to the exacerbation of the neurodegenerative phenotype in the dual-hit animal model of PD.",International journal of molecular sciences,2023,Luigia Turco; Nicola Opallo; Elisabetta Buommino; Carmen De Caro; Claudio Pirozzi; Giuseppina Mattace Raso; Francesca Lembo; Lorena Coretti

37628082,Dietary Polysaccharides Exert Anti-Fatigue Functions via the Gut-Muscle Axis: Advances and Prospectives.,"Due to today's fast-paced lifestyle, most people are in a state of sub-health and face ""unexplained fatigue"", which can seriously affect their health, work efficiency, and quality of life. Fatigue is also a common symptom of several serious diseases such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, cancer, etc. However, the contributing mechanisms are not clear, and there are currently no official recommendations for the treatment of fatigue. Some dietary polysaccharides are often used as health care supplements; these have been reported to have specific anti-fatigue effects, with minor side effects and rich pharmacological activities. Dietary polysaccharides can be activated during food processing or during gastrointestinal transit, exerting unique effects. This review aims to comprehensively summarize and evaluate the latest advances in the biological processes of exercise-induced fatigue, to understand dietary polysaccharides and their possible molecular mechanisms in alleviating exercise-induced fatigue, and to systematically elaborate the roles of gut microbiota and the gut-muscle axis in this process. From the perspective of the gut-muscle axis, investigating the relationship between polysaccharides and fatigue will enhance our understanding of fatigue and may lead to a significant breakthrough regarding the molecular mechanism of fatigue. This paper will provide new perspectives for further research into the use of polysaccharides in food science and food nutrition, which could help develop potential anti-fatigue agents and open up novel therapies for sub-health conditions.","Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,Yaping Zhou; Zhongxing Chu; Yi Luo; Feiyan Yang; Fuliang Cao; Feijun Luo; Qinlu Lin
37747555,Diet-gutÂ microbiome interaction and ferulic acid bioavailability: implications on neurodegenerative disorders.,"Ferulic acid (FA), which occurs naturally as the feruloylated sugar ester in grains, fruits, and vegetables, is critical for combating oxidative stress and alleviating neurodegenerative diseases resulting from free radical-generated protein aggregates in brain cells. However, FA cannot be absorbed in conjugated form. Therefore, strategies to improve the bioavailability of FA are gaining more importance. Ferulic acid esterases (FAE) of the gut microbiota are critical enzymes that facilitate FA release from feruloylated sugar ester conjugates and influence systemic health. This review provides insight into a nutrition-based approach to preventing neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's by altering the diversity of FAE-producing gut microbiota.The human gut is a niche for a highly dense microbial population. Nutrient components and the quality of food shape the gut microbiota. Microbiota-diet-host interaction primarily involves an array of enzymes that hydrolyse complex polysaccharides and release covalently attached moieties, thereby increasing their bio-accessibility. Moreover, genes encoding polysaccharide degrading enzymes are substrate inducible, giving selective microorganisms a competitive advantage in scavenging nutrients. Nutraceutical therapy using specific food components holds promise as a prophylactic agent and as an adjunctive treatment strategy in neurotherapeutics, as it results in upregulation of polysaccharide utilisation loci containing fae genes in the gut microbiota, thereby increasing the release of FA and other antioxidant molecules and combat neurodegenerative processes.",European journal of nutrition,2024,Saarika Pothuvan Kunnummal; Mahejibin Khan
37487923,Metals linked with the most prevalent primary neurodegenerative dementias in the elderly: A narrative review.,"The ageing population has been steadily increasing worldwide, leading to a higher risk of cognitive decline and dementia. Environmental toxicants, particularly metals, have been identified as modifiable risk factors for cognitive impairment. Continuous exposure to metals occurs mainly through dietary sources, with older adults being particularly vulnerable. However, imbalances in the gut microbiota, known as dysbiosis, have also been associated with dementia. A literature review was conducted to explore the potential role of metals in the development of cognitive decline and the most prevalent primary neurodegenerative dementias, as well as their interaction with the gut microbiota. High levels of iron (Fe) and copper (Cu) are associated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), while low selenium (Se) levels are linked to poor cognitive status. Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) is associated with elevated levels of iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and zinc (Zn), but the role of copper (Cu) remains unclear. The relationship between metals and Lewy body dementia (LBD) requires further investigation. High aluminium (Al) exposure is associated with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and elevated selenium (Se) levels may be linked to its onset. Challenges in comparing studies arise from the heterogeneity of metal analysis matrices and analytical techniques, as well as the limitations of small study cohorts. More research is needed to understand the influence of metals on cognition through the gut microbiota (GMB) and its potential relevance in the development of these diseases.",Environmental research,2023,David Mateo; Montse MarquÃ¨s; Margarita Torrente
37851313,Gut-Brain Axis a Key Player to Control Gut Dysbiosis in Neurological Diseases.,"Parkinson's disease is a chronic neuropathy characterised by the formation of Lewy bodies (misfolded alpha-synuclein) in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra and other parts of the brain. Dopaminergic neurons play a vital role in generating both motor and non-motor symptoms. Finding therapeutic targets for Parkinson's disease (PD) is hindered due to an incomplete understanding of the disease's pathophysiology. Existing evidence suggests that the gut microbiota participates in the pathogenesis of PD via immunological, neuroendocrine, and direct neural mechanisms. Gut microbial dysbiosis triggers the loss of dopaminergic neurons via mitochondrial dysfunction. Gut dysbiosis triggers bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine, which increases the permeability barrier and induces systemic inflammation. It results in excessive stimulation of the innate immune system. In addition to that, activation of enteric neurons and enteric glial cells initiates the aggregation of alpha-synuclein. This alpha-synucleinopathy thus affects all levels of the brain-gut axis, including the central, autonomic, and enteric nervous systems. Though the neurobiological signaling cascade between the gut microbiome and the central nervous system is poorly understood, gut microbial metabolites may serve as a promising therapeutic strategy for PD. This article summarises all the known possible ways of bidirectional signal communication, i.e., the ""gut-brain axis,"" where microbes from the middle gut interact with the brain and vice versa, and highlights a unique way to treat neurodegenerative diseases by maintaining homeostasis. The tenth cranial nerve (vagus nerve) plays a significant part in this signal communication. However, the leading regulatory factor for this axis is a diet that helps with microbial colonisation and brain function. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), derived from microbially fermented dietary fibres, link host nutrition to maintain intestinal homeostasis. In addition to that, probiotics modulate cognitive function and the metabolic and behavioural conditions of the body. As technology advances, new techniques will emerge to study the tie-up between gut microbes and neuronal diseases.",Molecular neurobiology,2023,Ieshita Pan; Praveen Kumar Issac; Md Mostafizur Rahman; Ajay Guru; Jesu Arockiaraj
37579835,Unveiling the role of gut-brain axis in regulating neurodegenerative diseases: A comprehensive review.,"Emerging evidence have shown the importance of gut microbiota in regulating brain functions. The diverse molecular mechanisms involved in cross-talk between gut and brain provide insight into importance of this communication in maintenance of brain homeostasis. It has also been observed that disturbed gut microbiota contributes to neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and aging. Recently, gut microbiome-derived exosomes have also been reported to play an essential role in the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases and could thereby act as a therapeutic target. Further, pharmacological interventions including antibiotics, prebiotics and probiotics can influence gut microbiome-mediated management of neurological diseases. However, extensive research is warranted to better comprehend this interconnection in maintenance of brain homeostasis and its implication in neurological diseases. Thus, the present review is aimed to provide a detailed understanding of gut-brain axis followed by possibilities to target the gut microbiome for improving neurological health.",Life sciences,2023,Himanshi Yadav; Jaldhi; Rati Bhardwaj; Anamika; Amrita Bakshi; Suchi Gupta; Shashank Kumar Maurya
36708421,Gut Microbial Alteration in MPTP Mouse Model of Parkinson Disease is Administration Regimen Dependent.,"Parkinson Disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons involved in motor functions. Growing evidence indicates that gut microbiota communicates with the brain known as the gut-brain axis (GBA). Mitochondrial toxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) is commonly used in animal studies to investigate the GBA in PD. Various MPTP administration regimens are performed in PD mouse models involving one to multiple injections in 1 day or one injection per day for several days. The aim of this study is to investigate if the impact of MPTP on gut microbiota differs depending on the administration regimen. C57BL/6 mice were treated with acute or subchronic regimens of MPTP. Motor functions were assessed by open-field, catalepsy, and wire hanging tests. The cecum and the brain samples were obtained for microbiota and gene expression analyses, respectively. MPTP administration regimens differed in their ability to alter the gut microbiota. Firmicutes and Bacteroidota were both increased in subchronic mice while did not change and decreased, respectively, in acute mice. Verrucomicrobiota was elevated in acute MPTP mice but dropped in subchronic MPTP mice. Muribaculaceae was the predominant genus in all groups but acute mice. In acute mice, Akkermansia was increased and Colidextribacter was decreased; however, they showed an opposite trend in subchronic mice. These data suggest that MPTP mouse model cause a gut microbiota dysbiosis in an administration regimen dependent manner, and it is important to take consideration of mouse model to investigate the GBA in neurodegenerative diseases including PD.",Cellular and molecular neurobiology,2023,Busra Aktas
37102320,The protective role of microbiota in the prevention of MPTP/P-induced Parkinson's disease by resveratrol.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a tricky neurodegenerative disease characterized with motor deficits and gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction. Gut microbiota disturbance is reported to be involved in the clinical phenotypes of PD and its pathogenesis through the brain-gut-microbiota axis. Resveratrol is a natural polyphenol that possesses various biological activities in alleviating many diseases, including PD. The present study was aimed to investigate the role of gut microbiota in resveratrol-treated PD mice. A chronic mouse model of PD was generated <i>via</i> the injection of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and probenecid (MPTP/P) for 5 consecutive weeks. Resveratrol was orally administered once a day (30 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>) for a total of 8 weeks. From the 6<sup>th</sup> week to the 8<sup>th</sup> week, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) was performed from resveratrol-treated PD mice to PD mice to evaluate the contribution of resveratrol-shaped microbiota in the alleviation of PD. The results showed that FMT from resveratrol-shaped microbiota remarkably alleviated the mice phenotype from PD progression, including increased latency in the rotarod, shortened beam walking time, increased the number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and enriched TH-positive fiber density in the striatum. Further experiments revealed that FMT could ameliorate the GI dysfunction by increasing the small intestinal transport rate and the colon length, decreasing the relative abundances of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-Î±, IL-6 and IL-1Î²) in colon epithelial tissue. The 16S rDNA sequencing indicated that FMT attenuated the gut microbial dysbiosis in PD mice by increasing the abundances of Prevotellaceae, Rikenellaceae, Erysipelotrichaceae, <i>Blautia</i> and <i>Alistipes</i>, lowering the ratio of Fimicutes/Bacteroidetes, and decreasing the abundances of Lachnospiraceae and <i>Akkermansia</i>. Therefore, results in this study demonstrated that gut microbiota played a vital role in the prevention of PD progression, and the shaping of the gut microbiota was the pharmacological mechanism of resveratrol in alleviating the phenotype of Parkinson's disease in PD mice.",Food & function,2023,Jing Tao; Yunying An; Lingyun Xu; Yuxin Wang; Chaowei Wang; Puze Li; Min Li; Dong Yan; Mingyong Wang; Genshen Zhong; Minna Wu
37968765,Compositional changes in fecal microbiota in a new Parkinson's disease model: C57BL/6-Tg(NSE-haSyn) mice.,"The gut-brain axis (GBA) in Parkinson's disease (PD) has only been investigated in limited mice models despite dysbiosis of the gut microbiota being considered one of the major treatment targets for neurodegenerative disease. Therefore, this study examined the compositional changes of fecal microbiota in novel transgenic (Tg) mice overexpressing human Î±-synuclein (hÎ±Syn) proteins under the neuron-specific enolase (NSE) to analyze the potential as GBA model.The expression level of the Î±Syn proteins was significantly higher in the substantia nigra and striatum of NSE-hÎ±Syn Tg mice than the Non-Tg mice, while those of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) were decreased in the same group. In addition, a decrease of 72.7% in the fall times and a 3.8-fold increase in the fall number was detected in NSE-hÎ±Syn Tg mice. The villus thickness and crypt length on the histological structure of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract decreased in NSE-hÎ±Syn Tg mice. Furthermore, the NSE-hÎ±Syn Tg mice exhibited a significant increase in 11 genera, including Scatolibacter, Clostridium, Feifania, Lachnoclostridium, and Acetatifactor population, and a decrease in only two genera in Ligilactobacillus and Sangeribacter population during enhancement of microbiota richness and diversity.The motor coordination and balance dysfunction of NSE-hÎ±Syn Tg mice may be associated with compositional changes in gut microbiota. In addition, these mice have potential as a GBA model.",Laboratory animal research,2023,Ji Eun Kim; Ki Chun Kwon; You Jeong Jin; Ayun Seol; Hee Jin Song; Yu Jeong Roh; Tae Ryeol Kim; Eun Seo Park; Gi Ho Park; Ji Won Park; Young Suk Jung; Joon Yong Cho; Dae Youn Hwang
37562867,Immunology and microbiome: Implications for motor systems.,"Immune-inflammatory mechanisms seem to play a relevant role in neurodegenerative disorders affecting motor systems, particularly Parkinson's disease, where activity changes in inflammatory cells and evidence of neuroinflammation in experimental models and patients is available. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is also characterized by neuroinflammatory changes that involve primarily glial cells, both microglia and astrocytes, as well as systemic immune dysregulation associated with more rapid progression. Similarly, the exploration of gut dysbiosis in these two prototypical neurodegenerative motor disorders is advancing rapidly. Altered composition of gut microbial constituents and related metabolic and putative functional pathways is supporting a pathophysiological link that is currently explored in preclinical, germ-free animal models. Less compelling, but still intriguing, evidence suggests that motor neurodevelopmental disorders, e.g., Tourette syndrome, are associated with abnormal trajectories of maturation that include also immune system development. Microglia has a key role also in these disorders, and new therapeutic avenues aiming at its modulation are exciting prospects. Preclinical and clinical research on the role of gut dysbiosis in Tourette syndrome and related behavioral disorders is still in its infancy, but early findings support the rationale to delve deeper into its contribution to neural and immune maturation abnormalities in its spectrum.",Handbook of clinical neurology,2023,Yasamin Mahjoub; Davide Martino
37266763,Orally Induced High Serum Level of Trimethylamine N-oxide Worsened Glial Reaction and Neuroinflammation on MPTP-Induced Acute Parkinson's Disease Model Mice.,"Neuroinflammation mediated by brain glial cells is one of the pathological drivers of Parkinson's disease (PD). Recent studies have shown that higher circulating trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO, a gut microbiota-derived metabolite) can induce neuroinflammation and are strongly related to a variety of central nervous system diseases and adverse brain events. Herein, we explored the effect of pre-existing higher circulating TMAO on dopamine system and neuroinflammation in acute PD model mice induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydroxypyridine (MPTP). TMAO pretreatment was given by adding 3% (w/v) TMAO to drinking water of mice for 21Â days to induce higher circulating TMAO status, then mice were administered with MPTP (20Â mg/kg, i.p) for four times in one day to construct an acute PD model mice and treated with TMAO continuously until the end of the experiment. Results demonstrated that TMAO treatment significantly increased serum TMAO levels. Moreover, high serum TMAO significantly increased activation of microglia and astrocytes both in striatum and in substantia nigra. And strikingly, high serum TMAO significantly promoted the metabolism of striatal dopamine (DA) of PD model mice, although it had no significant effect on the number of dopaminergic neurons or the content of DA. Furthermore, immunofluorescence, ELISA, and RT-qPCR results of the hippocampus also showed that high serum TMAO significantly promoted the activation of microglia and astrocytes in the dentate gyrus, increased the levels of TNF-Î± and IL-1Î², and upregulated gene expression of M1 microglia-related markers (including CD16, CD32, and iNOS) and A2 astrocyte-related markers (including S100a10, Ptx3, and Emp1) in mRNA levels. In summary, we found that pre-existing high serum levels of TMAO worsened the PD-related brain pathology by promoting DA metabolism, aggravating neuroinflammation and regulating glial cell polarization.",Molecular neurobiology,2023,Chen-Meng Qiao; Wei Quan; Yu Zhou; Gu-Yu Niu; Hui Hong; Jian Wu; Li-Ping Zhao; Ting Li; Chun Cui; Wei-Jiang Zhao; Yan-Qin Shen
36824263,Effects of levodopa on gut bacterial antibiotic resistance in Parkinson's disease rat.,"The second most prevalent neurodegenerative ailment, Parkinson's disease (PD), is characterized by both motor and non-motor symptoms. Levodopa is the backbone of treatment for PD at the moment. However, levodopa-induced side effects, such as dyskinesia, are commonly seen in PD patients. Recently, several antibiotics were found to present neuroprotective properties against neurodegenerative and neuro-inflammatory processes, which might be developed to effective therapies against PD. In this study, we aimed to identify if levodopa treatment could influence the gut bacterial antibiotic resistance in PD rat. Fecal samples were collected from healthy rats and 6-OHDA induced PD rats treated with different doses of levodopa, metagenomic sequencing data showed that levodopa resulted in gut bacteria composition change, the biomarkers of gut bacteria analyzed by LEfSe changed as well. More interestingly, compared with levodopa (5âmg/kg)-treated or no levodopa-treated PD rats, levodopa (10âmg/kg) caused a significant decrease in the abundance of tetW and vanTG genes in intestinal bacteria, which were related to tetracycline and vancomycin resistance, while the abundance of AAC6-lb-Suzhou gene increased apparently, which was related to aminoglycosides resistance, even though the total quantity of Antibiotic Resistance Gene (ARG) and Antibiotic Resistance Ontology (ARO) among all groups did not significantly differ. Consequently, our results imply that the combination of levodopa and antibiotics, such as tetracycline and vancomycin, in the treatment of PD may decrease the amount of corresponding antibiotic resistance genes in gut bacteria, which would give a theoretical basis for treating PD with levodopa combined with tetracycline and vancomycin in the future.",Frontiers in aging neuroscience,2023,Shuo Sheng; Xianwei Li; Shuo Zhao; Changqing Zheng; Feng Zhang
38075226,Unveiling the neuroprotective potential of dietary polysaccharides: a systematic review.,"Central nervous system (CNS) disorders present a growing and costly global health challenge, accounting for over 11% of the diseases burden in high-income countries. Despite current treatments, patients often experience persistent symptoms that significantly affect their quality of life. Dietary polysaccharides have garnered attention for their potential as interventions for CNS disorders due to their diverse mechanisms of action, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects. Through an analysis of research articles published between January 5, 2013 and August 30, 2023, encompassing the intervention effects of dietary polysaccharides on Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, depression, anxiety disorders, autism spectrum disorder, epilepsy, and stroke, we have conducted a comprehensive review with the aim of elucidating the role and mechanisms of dietary polysaccharides in various CNS diseases, spanning neurodegenerative, psychiatric, neurodevelopmental disorders, and neurological dysfunctions. At least four categories of mechanistic bases are included in the dietary polysaccharides' intervention against CNS disease, which involves oxidative stress reduction, neuronal production, metabolic regulation, and gut barrier integrity. Notably, the ability of dietary polysaccharides to resist oxidation and modulate gut microbiota not only helps to curb the development of these diseases at an early stage, but also holds promise for the development of novel therapeutic agents for CNS diseases. In conclusion, this comprehensive review strives to advance therapeutic strategies for CNS disorders by elucidating the potential of dietary polysaccharides and advocating interdisciplinary collaboration to propel further research in this realm.",Frontiers in nutrition,2023,Rui Guo; Jingxi Pang; Junhe Zhao; Xiao Xiao; Jing Li; Jingmeng Li; Wenxiu Wang; Shuang Zhou; Yu Zhao; Zilong Zhang; Hongwang Chen; Tian Yuan; Shan Wu; Zhigang Liu

Miq. ex Havil, on Parkinson's disease based on metagenomics and metabolomics.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is a rapidly progressing neurological disorder. Currently, Medication for PD has numerous limitations. Baichanting Compound (BCT) is a Chinese herbal prescription, a Combination of Acanthopanax senticosus (Rupr. and Maxim.) Harms, Paeonia lactiflora Pall and Uncaria rhynchophylla (Miq.) Miq. ex Havil, that was developed to treat PD and holds a national patent (ZL, 201110260536.3).To clarify the therapeutic effect of BCT on PD and explore its possible mechanism based on metabolomics and metagenomics.C57BL/6 mice were used as a control group, and Î±-syn transgenic C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to the PD (without treatment) or BCT (with BCT treatment) group. UPLC-MS was performed to detect dopamine levels in brain tissue, while ELISA was used to determine inflammatory factors such as IL-1Î², IL-6, TNF-Î±, IFN-Î³ and NO, and oxidative stress indicators such as malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase enzyme activity. Fecal metabolomics was used to detect fecal metabolic profiles, screen differential metabolic markers, and predict metabolic pathways by KEGG enrichment analysis. Metagenomics was used to determine the intestinal microbial composition, and KO enrichment analysis was performed to predict the potential function of different gut microbiota. Finally, Spearman correlation analysis was used to find the possible relationships among intestinal flora, metabolic markers, inflammatory factors, oxidative stress and dopamine levels.BCT increased the superoxide dismutase activity of Î±-Syn transgenic C57BL/6 mice (PÂ <Â 0.01), decreased the levels of TNF-Î±, IFN-Î³, IL-1Î², IL-6, NO and malondialdehyde (PÂ <Â 0.01, 0.05), and increased the release of dopamine (PÂ <Â 0.01). Metabolomics results show that BCT could regulate Acetatifactor, Marvinbryantia, Faecalitalea, Anaeromassilibacillus, Anaerobium, Pseudobutyrivibrio and Lachnotalea and Acetatifactor_muris, Marvinbryantia_formatexigens, Lachnotalea_sp_AF33_28, Faecalitalea_sp_Marseille_P3755 and Anaerobium_acetethylicum, Gemmiger_sp_An120 abundance to restore intestinal flora function, and reverse fecal metabolism trend, restoring the content of Î±-D-glucose, cytidine, L-glutamate, L-glutamine, N-acetyl-L-glutamate, raffinose and uracil. In addition, it regulates arginine biosynthesis, D-glutamine and D-glutamate, pyrimidine, galactose and alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolic pathways.BCT may regulate the composition of the gut microbiota to reverse fecal metabolism in PD mice to protect the substantia nigra and striatum from oxidative stress and inflammatory factors and ultimately play an anti-PD role.",Journal of ethnopharmacology,2024,Yi Lu; Xin Gao; Shadi A D Mohammed; Tianyu Wang; Jiaqi Fu; Yu Wang; Yang Nan; Fang Lu; Shumin Liu

Over the past decades, the gut microbiota has been explored as an important part of the gastrointestinal tract that plays a crucial role in the regulation of most functions of various human organs. The evidence shows several mediators such as short-chain fatty acids, peptides, and neurotransmitters that are produced by the gut may affect the brain's function directly or indirectly. Thus, dysregulation in this microbiome community can give rise to several diseases such as Parkinson's disease, depression, irritable bowel syndrome, and Alzheimer's disease. So, the interactions between the gut and the brain are significantly considered, and also it provides a prominent subject to investigate the causes of some diseases.

37199590,Healthy Human Fecal Microbiota Transplantation into Mice Attenuates MPTP-Induced Neurotoxicity via AMPK/SOD2 Pathway.,"Increasing evidence has shown that gut dysbacteriosis may play a crucial role in neuroinflammation in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the specific mechanisms that link gut microbiota to PD remain unexplored. Given the critical roles of blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction and mitochondrial dysfunction in the development of PD, we aimed to evaluate the interactions among the gut microbiota, BBB, and mitochondrial resistance to oxidation and inflammation in PD. We investigated the effects of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) on the physiopathology of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated mice. The aim was to explore the role of fecal microbiota from PD patients and healthy human controls in neuroinflammation, BBB components, and mitochondrial antioxidative capacity via the AMPK/SOD2 pathway. Compared to control mice, MPTP-treated mice exhibited elevated levels of Desulfovibrio, whereas mice given FMT from PD patients exhibited enriched levels of Akkermansia and mice given FMT from healthy humans showed no significant alterations in gut microbiota. Strikingly, FMT from PD patients to MPTP-treated mice significantly aggravated motor impairments, dopaminergic neurodegeneration, nigrostriatal glial activation and colonic inflammation, and inhibited the AMPK/SOD2 signaling pathway. However, FMT from healthy human controls greatly improved the aforementioned MPTP-caused effects. Surprisingly, the MPTP-treated mice displayed a significant loss in nigrostriatal pericytes, which was restored by FMT from healthy human controls. Our findings demonstrate that FMT from healthy human controls can correct gut dysbacteriosis and ameliorate neurodegeneration in the MPTP-induced PD mouse model by suppressing microgliosis and astrogliosis, ameliorating mitochondrial impairments via the AMPK/SOD2 pathway, and restoring the loss of nigrostriatal pericytes and BBB integrity. These findings raise the possibility that the alteration in the human gut microbiota may be a risk factor for PD and provide evidence for potential application of FMT in PD preclinical treatment.",Aging and disease,2023,Zhenchao Xie; Mahui Zhang; Yuqi Luo; Dana Jin; Xingfang Guo; Wanlin Yang; Jialing Zheng; Hongfei Zhang; Lu Zhang; Chao Deng; Wenhua Zheng; Eng-King Tan; Kunlin Jin; Shuzhen Zhu; Qing Wang
37750713,Oh my gut! Is the microbial origin of neurodegenerative diseases real?,"There is no cure or effective treatment for neurodegenerative protein conformational diseases (PCDs), such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's diseases, mainly because the etiology of these diseases remains elusive. Recent data suggest that unique changes in the gut microbial composition are associated with these ailments; however, our current understanding of the bacterial role in the pathogenesis of PCDs is hindered by the complexity of the microbial communities associated with specific microbiomes, such as the gut, oral, or vaginal microbiota. The composition of these specific microbiomes is regarded as a unique fingerprint affected by factors such as infections, diet, lifestyle, and antibiotics. All of these factors also affect the severity of neurodegenerative diseases. The majority of studies that reveal microbial contribution are correlational, and various models, including worm, fly, and mouse, are being utilized to decipher the role of individual microbes that may affect disease onset and progression. Recent evidence from across model organisms and humans shows a positive correlation between the presence of gram-negative enteropathogenic bacteria and the pathogenesis of PCDs. While these correlational studies do not provide a mechanistic explanation, they do reveal contributing bacterial species and provide an important basis for further investigation. One of the lurking concerns related to the microbial contribution to PCDs is the increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance and poor antibiotic stewardship, which ultimately select for proteotoxic bacteria, especially the gram-negative species that are known for intrinsic resistance. In this review, we summarize what is known about individual microbial contribution to PCDs and the potential impact of increasing antimicrobial resistance.",Infection and immunity,2023,Alyssa Walker; Daniel M Czyz

However, the exact mechanisms underlying microbiota dysbiosis in PD progression have not yet been elucidated. Our study aimed to investigate the correlation between gut microbiota disturbances and feces metabolic disorders in PD. We used 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to induce PD models and observed mice's motor symptoms, dopaminergic (DA) neuron death, and gastrointestinal dysfunction. To identify alterations in microbiota and metabolome, feces were collected from mice and analyzed using 16Â S ribosomal RNA sequencing feces metabolomics. Pearson analysis was utilized to investigate correlations between the abundances of gut microbiota components and the levels of gut microbiota metabolites, displaying their interaction networks. Our findings revealed a significant increase in Desulfobacterota in the PD mouse model and 151 differentially expressed fecal metabolites between PD and vehicle mice. Moreover, Pearson correlation analysis suggested that the protective factor N-acetyl-L-leucine (NALL) may be associated with neuroinflammation in the striatum and substantia nigra, which also had a negative relationship with the concentration of Desulfobacterota. Additionally, we found that oral administration of NALL alleviated MPTP-induced Motor Impairments and DA neuronal deï¬cits. All in all, we concluded that the decrease of NALL might lead to a significant increase of Desulfobacterota in the MPTP model mouse and subsequently result in the damage of DA neurons via the gut-brain aix pathway.",Brain research bulletin,2023,Zhifeng Xu; Changlin Lian; Lixin Pan; Wenjie Lai; Fen Zhang; Lingmei Peng; Sijie Zhou; Guanghua Zhao; Xuezhu Yang; Guohua Zhang; Zefeng Tan; Yukai Wang
36983960,Infectious Microorganisms Seen as Etiologic Agents in Parkinson's Disease.,"Infections represent a possible risk factor for parkinsonism and Parkinson's disease (PD) based on information from epidemiology and fundamental science. The risk is unclear for the majority of agents. Moreover, the latency between infection and PD seems to be very varied and often lengthy. In this review, the evidence supporting the potential involvement of infectious microorganisms in the development of Parkinson's disease is examined. Consequently, it is crucial to determine the cause and give additional treatment accordingly. Infection is an intriguing suggestion regarding the cause of Parkinson's disease. These findings demonstrate that persistent infection with viral and bacterial microorganisms might be a cause of Parkinson's disease. As an initiating factor, infection may generate a spectrum of gut microbiota dysbiosis, engagement of glial tissues, neuroinflammation, and alpha-synuclein accumulation, all of which may trigger and worsen the onset in Parkinson's disease also contribute to its progression. Still uncertain is the primary etiology of PD with infection. The possible pathophysiology of PD infection remains a matter of debate. Furthermore, additional study is required to determine if PD patients develop the disease due to infectious microorganisms or solely since they are more sensitive to infectious causes.","Life (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,Stuparu Alina Zorina; Sanda Jurja; Mihaela Mehedinti; Ana-Maria Stoica; Dana Simona Chita; Stuparu Alexandru Floris; Any Axelerad
37321369,Casein Reactivates Dopaminergic Nerve Injury and Intestinal Inflammation with Disturbing Intestinal Microflora and Fecal Metabolites in a Convalescent Parkinson's Disease Mouse Model.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the fastest-growing neurodegenerative disease, with pathogenic causes elusive and short of effective treatment options. Investigations have found that dairy products positively correlate with the onset of PD, but the mechanisms remain unexplored. As casein is an antigenic component in dairy products, this study assessed if casein could exacerbate PD-related symptoms by stimulating intestinal inflammation and unbalanced intestinal flora and be a risk factor for PD. Using a convalescent PD mouse model induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), the results showed casein reduced motor coordination, caused gastrointestinal dysfunction, reduced dopamine content, and induced intestinal inflammation. Meanwhile, casein disturbed gut microbiota homeostasis by increasing the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, decreasing Î±-diversity, and caused abnormal alterations in fecal metabolites. However, these adverse effects of casein attenuated much when it had hydrolyzed by acid or when antibiotics inhibited the intestinal microbiota of the mice. Therefore, our results suggested that casein could reactivate dopaminergic nerve injury and intestinal inflammation and exacerbate intestinal flora disorder and its metabolites in convalescent PD mice. These damaging effects might be related to disordered protein digestion and gut microbiota in these mice. These findings will provide new insights into the impact of milk/dairy products on PD progression and supply information on dietary options for PD patients.",Neuroscience,2023,Zhengjia Pu; Shuya Liu; Zeming Guo; Xuemei Zhang; Jie Yan; Yong Tang; Hong Xiao; Jieying Gao; Yingli Li; Qunhua Bai
37932328,A novel pathway of levodopa metabolism by commensal Bifidobacteria.,"The gold-standard treatment for Parkinson's disease is levodopa (L-DOPA), which is taken orally and absorbed intestinally. L-DOPA must reach the brain intact to exert its clinical effect; peripheral metabolism by host and microbial enzymes is a clinical management issue. The gut microbiota is altered in PD, with one consistent and unexplained observation being an increase in Bifidobacterium abundance among patients. Recently, certain Bifidobacterium species were shown to have the ability to metabolize L-tyrosine, an L-DOPA structural analog. Using both clinical cohort data and in vitro experimentation, we investigated the potential for commensal Bifidobacteria to metabolize this drug. In PD patients, Bifidobacterium abundance was positively correlated with L-DOPA dose and negatively with serum tyrosine concentration. In vitro experiments revealed that certain species, including B. bifidum, B. breve, and B. longum, were able to metabolize this drug via deamination followed by reduction to the compound 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl lactic acid (DHPLA) using existing tyrosine-metabolising genes. DHPLA appears to be a waste product generated during regeneration of NADâ+. This metabolism occurs at low levels in rich medium, but is significantly upregulated in nutrient-limited minimal medium. Discovery of this novel metabolism of L-DOPA to DHPLA by a common commensal may help inform medication management in PD.",Scientific reports,2023,M S Cirstea; A Creus-Cuadros; C Lo; A C Yu; A Serapio-Palacios; S Neilson; S Appel-Cresswell; B B Finlay
37537902,Neurodevelopmental toxicity induced by PM2.5 Exposure and its possible role in Neurodegenerative and mental disorders.,"Recent extensive evidence suggests that ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5, with an aerodynamic diameter â¤2.5 Î¼m) may be neurotoxic to the brain and cause central nervous system damage, contributing to neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, and mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder. PM2.5 can enter the brain via various pathways, including the blood-brain barrier, olfactory system, and gut-brain axis, leading to adverse effects on the CNS. Studies in humans and animals have revealed that PM2.5-mediated mechanisms, including neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, and gut flora dysbiosis, play a crucial role in CNS damage. Additionally, PM2.5 exposure can induce epigenetic alterations, such as hypomethylation of DNA, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of some CNS damage. Through literature analysis, we suggest that promising therapeutic targets for alleviating PM2.5-induced neurological damage include inhibiting microglia overactivation, regulating gut microbiota with antibiotics, and targeting signaling pathways, such as PKA/CREB/BDNF and WNT/Î²-catenin. Additionally, several studies have observed an association between PM2.5 exposure and epigenetic changes in neuropsychiatric disorders. This review summarizes and discusses the association between PM2.5 exposure and CNS damage, including the possible mechanisms by which PM2.5 causes neurotoxicity.",Human & experimental toxicology,2023,Xin-Qi Liu; Jia Huang; Chao Song; Tian-Liang Zhang; Yong-Ping Liu; Li Yu
36881113,Mesenchymal stem-cell-derived microvesicles ameliorate MPTP-induced neurotoxicity in mice: a role of the gut-microbiota-brain axis.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Increasing evidence suggests the role of the gut-microbiota-brain axis in the pathogenesis of PD. Mesenchymal stem-cell-derived microvesicles (MSC-MVs) have emerged as a therapeutic potential for neurological disorders over the last years.The objective of this study was to investigate whether MSC-MVs could improve PD-like neurotoxicity in mice after administration of MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine).MPTP-induced reductions in the dopamine transporter and tyrosine hydroxylase expressions in the striatum and substantia nigra (SNr) were attenuated after a subsequent single administration of MSC-MVs. Increases in the phosphorylated Î±-synuclein (p-Î±-Syn)/Î±-Syn ratio in the striatum, SNr, and colon after MPTP injection were also attenuated after MSC-MVs injection. Furthermore, MSC-MVs restored MPTP-induced abnormalities of the gut microbiota composition. Interestingly, positive correlations between the genus Dubosiella and the p-Î±-Syn/Î±-Syn ratio were observed in the brain and colon, suggesting their roles in the gut-microbiota-brain communication. Moreover, MSC-MVs attenuated MPTP-induced reduction of the metabolite, 3,6-dihydroxy-2-[3-methoxy-4-(sulfooxy)phenyl]-7-(sulfinooxy)-3,4-dihydro-2H-1-benzopyran-5-olate, in the blood. Interestingly, a negative correlation between this compound and the p-Î±-Syn/Î±-Syn ratio was observed in the brain and colon.These data suggest that MSC-MVs could ameliorate MPTP-induced neurotoxicity in the brain and colon via the gut-microbiota-brain axis. Therefore, MSC-MVs would have a new therapeutic potential for neurological disorders such as PD.",Psychopharmacology,2023,Yaoyu Pu; Qiuhong Wu; Qiuping Zhang; Tianwen Huang; Ji Wen; Long Wei; Kenji Hashimoto; Yi Liu
36662412,Neuroprotective and Immunomodulatory Effects of Probiotics in a Rat Model of Parkinson's Disease.,"It is now well recognized that a bidirectional relationship between gut microbiota and the brain, referred to as the gut-brain axis, plays a prominent role in maintaining homeostasis and that a disruption in this axis can result in neuroinflammatory response and neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). The protective action of probiotics such as Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis Bb12 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG in various animal models of PD has been reported. Therefore, in this study, we used an inflammatory model of PD to assess the effects of a combination of these two probiotics (Microbiot<sup>Â®</sup>) on motor behavior as well as on the response of microglia, including microglia morphology, to gain a better understanding of their mechanism of action. Microbiot<sup>Â®</sup> (300 ÂµL) was administered orally once daily for 15Â days in a lipopolysaccharide-induced PD model using male Wistar rats. Although LPS-induced motor asymmetry in cylinder test was not affected by Microbiot<sup>Â®</sup>, impairment of motor coordination in the narrow-beam test was significantly reduced by this probiotic. Moreover, Microbiot<sup>Â®</sup> treatment reduced microglial activation suggesting an anti-inflammatory effect. While further mechanistic investigation of Microbiot<sup>Â®</sup> in neurodegenerative diseases is warranted, our results support the potential utility of probiotics in PD.",Neurotoxicity research,2023,Irving Parra; Isabel MartÃ­nez; Lizbeth VÃ¡squez-Celaya; Jose L Gongora-Alfaro; Yousef Tizabi; Liliana Mendieta
36880679,The microbiome-gut-brain axis in epilepsy: pharmacotherapeutic target from bench evidence for potential bedside applications.,"The gut-brain axis augments the bidirectional communication between the gut and brain and modulates gut homeostasis and the central nervous system through the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, enteroendocrine system, neuroendocrine system, inflammatory and immune pathways. Preclinical and clinical reports showed that gut dysbiosis might play a major regulatory role in neurological diseases such as epilepsy, Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease. Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disease that causes recurrent and unprovoked seizures, and numerous risk factors are implicated in developing epilepsy. Advanced consideration of the gut-microbiota-brain axis can reduce ambiguity about epilepsy pathology, antiepileptic drugs, and effective therapeutic targets. Gut microbiota sequencing analysis reported that the level of Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Fusobacteria, and Firmicutes was increased and the level of Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes was decreased in epilepsy patients. Clinical and preclinical studies also indicated that probiotics, ketogenic diet, faecal microbiota transplantation, and antibiotics can improve gut dysbiosis and alleviate seizure by enhancing the abundance of healthy biota. This study aims to give an overview of the connection between gut microbiota, and epilepsy, how gut microbiome changes may cause epilepsy, and whether gut microbiome restoration could be used as a treatment for epilepsy.",European journal of neurology,2023,Snehashis Kundu; Sudipta Nayak; Debarati Rakshit; Tanveer Singh; Rahul Shukla; Dharmendra Kumar Khatri; Awanish Mishra
37703887,An Overview of Gastrointestinal Dysfunction in Parkinsonian Syndromes.,"Gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction is a common nonmotor symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD) as well as other parkinsonian syndromes and may precede the onset of motor symptoms by decades. Involvement of all segments of the GI tract can lead to altered responses to medications and worsened quality of life for patients. While some GI symptoms occur in isolation, others overlap. Therefore, understanding the changes in different segments of the GI tract and how they relate to altered responses to PD treatment can guide both diagnostic and pharmacological interventions. Gut microbiota plays a critical role in immune activity and modulation of the enteric and central nervous systems. Understanding this bidirectional relationship helps to elucidate the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration. This review will describe the current understanding of how GI dysfunction develops in parkinsonian syndromes, common symptoms in PD and related disorders, and available treatments.",Seminars in neurology,2023,Lauren Talman; Delaram Safarpour
38008403,Calprotectin in Parkinsonian disease: Anticipation and dedication.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease due to degeneration of dopaminergic neurons (DNs) in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). PD is characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms. Non-motor symptoms such as constipation and dysfunction of gastrointestinal tract (GIT) motility together with medications used in the management of PD affect gut microbiota. Alterations of gut microbiota with development of gut dyspiosis can induce momentous changes in gut barrier with subsequent systemic inflammation and induction of neuroinflammation. It has been shown that calprotectin which reflect intestinal inflammation and gut barrier injury are augmented in PD. Therefore, this review aims to elucidate the possible role of gut barrier injury and associated dysbiois in PD neuropathology, and how calprotectin reflects gut barrier injury in PD. Benefit of this review was to elucidate that high fecal calprotectin level in PD patients indicated gut dysbiosis and intestinal inflammation. Early increment of fecal calprotectin indicates the development of gut dysbiosis and/or gut-barrier injury which may precede motor symptoms by decades. Thus, fecal calprotectin could be a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in PD. preclinical and clinical studies are warranted in this regard to emphasize the potential role of fecal calprotectin in PD neuropathology.",Ageing research reviews,2024,Hayder M Al-Kuraishy; Ali I Al-Gareeb; Ayah Talal Zaidalkiani; Athanasios Alexiou; Marios Papadakis; Mostafa M Bahaa; Ammar Al-Faraga; Gaber El-Saber Batiha
37206220,Neuroprotective effect of engineered <i>Clostridium</i>butyricum-pMTL007-GLP-1 on Parkinson's disease mice models via promoting mitophagy.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease with limited treatment and no cure, hence, broadening PD drug spectrum is of great significance. At present, engineered microorganisms are attracting increasing attention. In this study, we constructed an engineered strain of <i>Clostridium butyricum</i>-GLP-1, a <i>C. butyricum</i> (a probiotic) that consistently expresses glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1, a peptide-based hormone with neurological advantage) in anticipation of its use in PD treatment. We further investigated the neuroprotective mechanism of <i>C. butyricum</i>-GLP-1 on PD mice models induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. The results indicated that <i>C. butyricum</i>-GLP-1 could improve motor dysfunction and ameliorate neuropathological changes by increasing TH expression and reducing the expression of Î±-syn. Moreover, we confirmed that <i>C. butyricum</i>-GLP-1 improved microbiome imbalance of PD mice by decreasing the relative abundance of <i>Bifidobacterium</i> at the genus level, improved gut integrity, and upregulated the levels of GPR41/43. Surprisingly, we found it could exert its neuroprotective effects via promoting PINK1/Parkin mediated mitophagy and attenuating oxidative stress. Together, our work showed that <i>C. butyricum</i>-GLP-1 improves PD by promoting mitophagy, which provides an alternative therapeutic modality for PD.",Bioengineering & translational medicine,2023,Yun Wang; Wen-Jie Chen; Yi-Yang Han; Xuan Xu; Ai-Xia Yang; Jing Wei; Dao-Jun Hong; Xin Fang; Ting-Tao Chen
39295905,The butyrate-producing and spore-forming bacterial genus <i>Coprococcus</i> as a potential biomarker for neurological disorders.,"The host-intestinal microbiome interaction has gained much scientific attention in the past two decades, boosted by advances in DNA sequencing and cultivation techniques. An accumulating amount of evidence shows that gut microbes play crucial roles in gut homeostasis, immune system education, and are associated with quality-of-life indicators. Beneficial health factors are associated with the digestion of dietary fibres in the colon and the subsequent production of short-chain fatty acids, including acetate, propionate, and butyrate. <i>Coprococcus</i> is a butyrate-producing genus in the phylum Firmicutes, and its abundance is inversely correlated with several neuropsychological and neurodegenerative disorders. Case-control studies provide strong evidence of decreased abundance of <i>Coprococcus</i> spp. in depressed individuals. The species <i>Coprococcus eutactus</i> has the unique capacity to use two separate pathways for butyrate synthesis and has been found to be depleted in children with delayed language development and adults with Parkinson's disease. The combined literature on <i>Coprococcus</i> and the gut microbiota-brain axis points towards enhanced butyrate production and reduced colonisation of pathogenic clades as factors explaining its association with health effects. The genus <i>Coprococcus</i> is a promising candidate for a mental health biomarker and an interesting lead for novel dietary-based preventive therapies for specific neurological disorders.","Gut microbiome (Cambridge, England)",2023,Fleur Notting; Walter Pirovano; Wilbert Sybesma; Remco Kort
37630602,Could the Urease of the Gut Bacterium <i>Proteus mirabilis</i> Play a Role in the Altered Gut-Brain Talk Associated with Parkinson's Disease?,"Intestinal dysbiosis seems to play a role in neurodegenerative pathologies. Parkinson's disease (PD) patients have an altered gut microbiota. Moreover, mice treated orally with the gut microbe <i>Proteus mirabilis</i> developed Parkinson's-like symptoms. Here, the possible involvement of <i>P. mirabilis</i> urease (PMU) and its B subunit (PmUreÎ²) in the pathogenesis of PD was assessed. Purified proteins were given to mice intraperitoneally (20 Î¼g/animal/day) for one week. Behavioral tests were conducted, and brain homogenates of the treated animals were subjected to immunoassays. After treatment with PMU, the levels of TNF-Î± and IL-1Î² were measured in Caco2 cells and cellular permeability was assayed in Hek 293. The proteins were incubated in vitro with Î±-synuclein and examined via transmission electron microscopy. Our results showed that PMU treatment induced depressive-like behavior in mice. No motor deficits were observed. The brain homogenates had an increased content of caspase-9, while the levels of Î±-synuclein and tyrosine hydroxylase decreased. PMU increased the pro-inflammatory cytokines and altered the cellular permeability in cultured cells. The urease, but not the PmUreÎ², altered the morphology of Î±-synuclein aggregates in vitro, forming fragmented aggregates. We concluded that PMU promotes pro-inflammatory effects in cultured cells. In vivo, PMU induces neuroinflammation and a depressive-like phenotype compatible with the first stages of PD development.",Microorganisms,2023,Matheus V C Grahl; Brenda da Silva Andrade; Ana Paula A Perin; Gilda A Neves; Laura de Souza Duarte; Augusto Frantz Uberti; Kelvin Siqueira Hohl; Cristian Follmer; Celia Regina Carlini

Accumulating evidence indicated <i>Akkermansia</i> as a promising therapeutic probiotic against metabolic disorders such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. However, in specific intestinal microenvironments, its excessive enrichment may be not beneficial. Conditions like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i> infection or post-antibiotic reconstitution may not benefit from <i>Akkermansia</i> supplementation. Furthermore, using <i>Akkermansia</i> in patients with endocrine and gynecological disorders-such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or endometriosis-that have a higher risk of developing IBD, should be critically evaluated. In addition, a cautionary note comes from the neurological field, as the gut microbiota of patients suffering from Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis exhibits a characteristic signature of <i>Akkermansia municiphila</i> abundance. Overall, considering these controversial points, the use of <i>Akkermansia</i> should be evaluated on an individual basis, avoiding risking unexpected effects.","Life (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,Vito Chiantera; Antonio Simone LaganÃ ; Sabrina Basciani; Maurizio Nordio; Mariano Bizzarri
37827233,TLR2 deficiency is beneficial at the late phase in MPTP-induced Parkinson' disease mice.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. The etiology of PD is still elusive but neuroinflammation is proved to be an important contributor. Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) involves in the release of several inflammatory cytokines. Whether TLR2 serves as a mediator contributing to the damage of DA system in PD remain unclear.Tlr2 knockout (Tlr2<sup>-/-</sup>) and wild-type (WT) mice were treated with a subacute regimen of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). At 3, 7 and 14Â days after MPTP injection, the behavioral performance, including the Pole test, the Rotarod test, the Rearing test and the Wire hang test was evaluated. Moreover, the PD-like phenotypes, including dopaminergic degeneration, the activation of glial cells and the Î±-Syn expression were systematically analyzed in the nigrostriatal pathway. Finally, the composition of gut microbiota in the MPTP-treated groups were assessed.TLR2 deficiency had no obvious impact on the dopaminergic injury at 3 and 7Â days following MPTP administration. On the contrary, at 14Â days post injection, TLR2 deficiency not only significantly attenuated motor deficits in the Pole test and the Rotarod test, and the nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration, but also mitigated Î±-Syn abnormality, astrocyte activation and neuroinflammation through the suppressed TLR2/MyD88/TRAF6/NF-ÎºB signaling pathways. Additionally, the alteration of gut microbiota was also detected in the mutant mice.These findings highlight the neuroprotective effect of TLR2-pathways at the late phase in the MPTP-induced PD mouse model.",Life sciences,2023,Yongtao He; Jiayin Zhao; Hongtian Dong; Xiaoshuang Zhang; Yufei Duan; Yuanyuan Ma; Mei Yu; Jian Fei; Fang Huang
36694359,Elevated serum anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody accompanied by gut mycobiota dysbiosis as a biomarker of diagnosis in patients with de novo Parkinson disease.,"Intestinal inflammation and gut microbiota dysbiosis contribute to Parkinson disease (PD) pathogenesis, and growing evidence suggests associations between inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and PD. Considered as markers of chronic gastrointestinal inflammation, elevated serum anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody (ASCA) levels, against certain gut fungal components, are related to IBD, but their effect on PD is yet to be investigated.Serum ASCA IgG and IgA levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the gut mycobiota communities were investigated using ITS2 sequencing and analyzed using the Qiime pipeline.The study included 393 subjects (148 healthy controls [HCs], 140 with PD, and 105 with essential tremor [ET]). Both serum ASCA IgG and IgA levels were significantly higher in the PD group than in the ET and HC groups. Combining serum ASCA levels and the occurrence of constipation could discriminate patients with PD from controls (area under the curve [AUC]Â =Â 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] =â0.76-0.86) and from patients with ET (AUCÂ =Â 0.85, 95% CIÂ =Â 0.79-0.89). Furthermore, the composition of the gut fungal community differed between the PD and HC groups. The relative abundances of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Aspergillus, Candida solani, Aspergillus flavus, ASV601_Fungi, ASV866_Fungi, and ASV755_Fungi were significantly higher in the PD group, and enriched Malassezia restricta was found in the HC group.Our study identified elevated serum ASCA levels and enriched gut Saccharomyces cerevisiae in de novo PD.",European journal of neurology,2023,Ying Chen; Li-Ying Zhang; Yi Fang; Chuan Li; Dan-Dan Xia; Gong Zhang; Yi Wen; Song-Zhao Zhang; Liu Hu; Lu-Yan Gu; Yi Liu; Jun Tian; Ya-Ping Yan; Xin-Zhen Yin; Zhi-Hua Tao; Bao-Rong Zhang; Jia-Li Pu
37239262,Trimethylamine N-Oxide Exacerbates Neuroinflammation and Motor Dysfunction in an Acute MPTP Mice Model of Parkinson's Disease.,"Observational studies have shown abnormal changes in trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) levels in the peripheral circulatory system of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. TMAO is a gut microbiota metabolite that can cross the blood-brain barrier and is strongly related to neuroinflammation. Neuroinflammation is one of the pathological drivers of PD. Herein, we investigated the effect of TMAO on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD model mice. TMAO pretreatment was given by adding 1.5% (<i>w</i>/<i>v</i>) TMAO to the drinking water of the mice for 21 days; then, the mice were administered MPTP (20 mg/kg, i.p.) four times a day to construct an acute PD model. Their serum TMAO concentrations, motor function, dopaminergic network integrity, and neuroinflammation were then assayed. The results showed that TMAO partly aggravated the motor dysfunction of the PD mice. Although TMAO had no effect on the dopaminergic neurons, TH protein content, and striatal DA level in the PD mice, it significantly reduced the striatal 5-HT levels and aggravated the metabolism of DA and 5-HT. Meanwhile, TMAO significantly activated glial cells in the striatum and the hippocampi of the PD mice and promoted the release of inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus. In summary, higher-circulating TMAO had adverse effects on the motor capacity, striatum neurotransmitters, and striatal and hippocampal neuroinflammation in PD mice.",Brain sciences,2023,Wei Quan; Chen-Meng Qiao; Gu-Yu Niu; Jian Wu; Li-Ping Zhao; Chun Cui; Wei-Jiang Zhao; Yan-Qin Shen

To improve our understanding of this tripartite interplay, we investigated community and functional dynamics between the murine protist <i>Tritrichomonas musculus</i> ( <i>T. mu</i> ) and intestinal bacteria in healthy and B cell-deficient mice. We identified dramatic, protist-driven remodeling of resident microbiome growth and activities, in parallel with <i>T. mu</i> functional changes, accelerated in the absence of B cells. Metatranscriptomic data revealed nutrient-based competition between bacteria and the protist. Single cell transcriptomics identified distinct <i>T. mu</i> life stages, providing new evidence for trichomonad sexual replication and the formation of pseudocysts.

37224894,Antiparkinsonian effects of polyphenols: A narrative review with a focus on the modulation of the gut-brain axis.,"Polyphenols, which are naturally occurring bioactive compounds in fruits and vegetables, are emerging as potential therapeutics for neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Polyphenols have diverse biological activities, such as anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and Î±-synuclein aggregation inhibitory effects, which could ameliorate PD pathogenesis. Studies have shown that polyphenols are capable of regulating the gut microbiota (GM) and its metabolites; in turn, polyphenols are extensively metabolized by the GM, resulting in the generation of bioactive secondary metabolites. These metabolites may regulate various physiological processes, including inflammatory responses, energy metabolism, intercellular communication, and host immunity. With increasing recognition of the importance of the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) in PD etiology, polyphenols have attracted growing attention as MGBA regulators.

37158925,"The PROB-PD trial: a pilot, randomised, placebo-controlled study protocol to evaluate the feasibility and potential efficacy of probiotics in modulating peripheral immunity in subjects with Parkinson's disease.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease. No disease-modifying treatment is available, and therapy is symptomatic. The histopathologic hallmark is the loss of dopaminergic neurons and accumulation of Î±-synuclein (Î±-syn) in surviving neurons, but the underlying pathophysiology is unclear. Inflammatory mechanisms seem to play a prominent role, with an imbalance of immune functions and neurotoxicity caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Involvement of peripheral adaptive immunity, with an imbalance in T cell subpopulations and in the expression of transcriptional factors in CD4+ T cells, has also been reported. Although clinical presentation is defined by motor symptoms, patients also report non-motor symptoms, often before the onset of a clinically established disease. Etiopathogenesis of PD is unknown, but an initial aggregation of Î±-syn in the gut, with subsequent propagation along the vagus nerve to the brain has been hypothesised. Interestingly, in an Î±-syn overexpressing murine model, the absence of gut microbiota prevented both microglia activation and motor impairment, thus pointing to a fundamental role of microbiota in the development of PD. Magistrelli et al. showed that in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of PD patients, probiotics modulate the in vitro production of cytokines toward an anti-inflammatory profile and reduce the production of ROS.This is a pilot randomised placebo-controlled clinical trial protocol for a 12-week treatment with probiotics. At least 80 patients affected by PD will be recruited and randomly allocated to either the treatment or placebo group in a 1:1 ratio. General inclusion criteria will be the onset of PD 2 to 5 years before the trial and absence of autoimmune comorbidities or immunomodulating therapy. Our primary endpoint is the assessment of changes in extracellular cytokine levels (Interferon (IFN)-Î³, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-Î±, interleukin (IL)-4, and IL-10) and ROS production. Secondary outcomes include changes in lymphocyte subpopulations and transcriptional factors mRNA levels.This study is designed to highlight the potential beneficial role of probiotics administration on peripheral immunity through the modulation of gut microbiota.

38045857,Metabolomic analysis of serum short-chain fatty acid concentrations in a mouse of MPTP-induced Parkinson's disease after dietary supplementation with branched-chain amino acids.,"The gut microbiota and microbial metabolites influence the enteric nervous system and the central nervous system via the microbial-gut-brain axis. Increasing body of evidence suggests that disturbances in the metabolism of peripheral branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) can contribute to the development of neurodegenerative diseases through neuroinflammatory signaling. Preliminary research has shown that longitudinal changes in serum amino acid levels in mouse models of Parkinson's disease (PD) are negatively correlated with disease progression. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine the changes in serum levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in a mouse model of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD after dietary BCAA supplementation. In our research, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to detect serum SCFA concentrations. The data were then analyzed with principal component analysis and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis. Finally, the correlations of serum SCFA levels with gut and motor function in MPTP-induced PD mice were explored. Propionic acid, acetic acid, butyric acid, and isobutyric acid concentrations were elevated in MPTP + H-BCAA mice compared with MPTP mice. Propionic acid concentration was increased the most, while the isovaleric acid concentration was decreased. Propionic acid concentration was positively correlated with fecal weight and water content and negatively correlated with the pole-climbing duration. In conclusion, these results not only suggest that propionic acid may be a potential biomarker for PD, but also indicate the possibility that PD may be treated by altering circulating levels of SCFA.","Open medicine (Warsaw, Poland)",2023,Na Mi; Lili Ma; Xueying Li; Jia Fu; Xinxin Bu; Fei Liu; Fan Yang; Yali Zhang; Lifen Yao
36776226,"A review article on neuroprotective, immunomodulatory, and anti-inflammatory role of vitamin-D3 in elderly COVID-19 patients.","Vitamin D3 is a secosteroid, broad-spectrum immunomodulatory, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory hormone produced either by the internal subcutaneous pathway in the presence of ultraviolet B (UVB) rays or by the external pathway in the form of supplements. Vitamin D3 deficiency is a common and reversible contributor to mortality and morbidity among critically ill patients, including Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and other viral infections. The major functions of vitamin D3 are inhibiting the proinflammatory pathways, including nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB), inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (ILs-6), interleukin-18 (ILs-18), and tumour necrosis factor (TNF), preventing the loss of neural sensation in COVID-19, maintaining respiratory homeostasis, and acting as an antiviral, antimalarial, and antihypertensive agent. Vitamin D3 has an important role in reversing the COVID-19 infection in patients who have previously suffered from a neurological disease, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson disease, motor neuron disease, multiple sclerosis, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, stroke, cardiovascular problems, headache, sleep-associated disorder, and others. Moreover, vitamin D3 plays a key role in regulating the gene expression of different pro-inflammatory cytokines. In addition to the information provided above, the current review article provides the most recent information on Vitamin D against COVID-19 with comorbid neurological disorders. Furthermore, we present the most recent advancement and molecular mechanism of action of vitamin D3. Diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and neurological disorders are comorbid conditions, and vitamin D3 is a critical regulator of COVID-19 infection during these conditions. In the midst of the COVID-19 epidemic, factors such as sex, latitudes, nutrition, demography, pollution, and gut microbiota warrants for additional research on vitamin D supplements.","The Egyptian journal of neurology, psychiatry and neurosurgery",2023,Amit Kumar Tripathi; Sunil Kumar Mishra
37596429,Fecal Microbiota Transplantation from Aged Mice Render Recipient Mice Resistant to MPTP-Induced Nigrostriatal Degeneration Via a Neurogenesis-Dependent but Inflammation-Independent Manner.,"Accumulating data support a crucial role of gut microbiota in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, gut microbiota vary with age and, thus, will affect PD in an age-dependent, but unknown manner. We examined the effects of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) pretreatment, using fecal microbiota from young (7Â weeks) or aged mice (23Â months), on MPTP-induced PD model. Motor function, pathological changes, striatal neurotransmitters, neuroinflammation, gut inflammation and gut permeability were examined. Gut microbiota composition and metabolites, namely short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), were analyzed. Neurogenesis was also evaluated by measuring the number of doublecortin-positive (DCX<sup>+</sup>) neurons and Ki67-positive (Ki67<sup>+</sup>) cells in the hippocampus. Expression of Cd133 mRNA, a cellular stemness marker, in the hippocampus was also examined. Mice who received FMT from young mice showed MPTP-induced motor dysfunction, and reduction of striatal dopamine (DA), dopaminergic neurons and striatal tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) levels. Interestingly and unexpectedly, mice that received FMT from aged mice showed recovery of motor function and rescue of dopaminergic neurons and striatal 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), as well as decreased DA metabolism after MPTP challenge. Further, they showed improved metabolic profiling and a decreased amount of fecal SCFAs. High-throughput sequencing revealed that FMT remarkably reshaped the gut microbiota of recipient mice. For instance, levels of genus Akkermansia and Candidatus Saccharimonas were elevated in fecal samples of recipient mice receiving aged microbiota (AMâ+âMPTP mice) than YMâ+âMPTP mice. Intriguingly, both young microbiota and aged microbiota had no effect on neuroinflammation, gut inflammation or gut permeability. Notably, AMâ+âMPTP mice showed a marked increase in DCX<sup>+</sup> neurons, as well as Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells and Cd133 expression in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) compared to YMâ+âMPTP mice.

Emerging evidence suggests a role for the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative PCDs; however, the influence of specific bacteria on the culprit proteins associated with each of these diseases remains elusive, primarily due to the complexity of the microbiota. In the present study, we employed a single-strain screening approach to identify human bacterial isolates that enhance or suppress the aggregation of culprit proteins and the associated toxicity in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> expressing AÎ²<sub>1-42</sub>, Î±-synuclein, and polyglutamine tracts. Here, we reveal the first comprehensive analysis of the human microbiome for its effect on proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Our results suggest that bacteria affect the aggregation of metastable proteins by modulating host proteostasis rather than selectively targeting specific disease-associated proteins. These results reveal bacteria that potentially influence the pathogenesis of PCDs and open new promising prevention and treatment opportunities by altering the abundance of beneficial and detrimental microbes.",bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,2023,Alyssa C Walker; Rohan Bhargava; Michael Bucher; Amanda S Brust; Daniel M Czy
37895965,Profiling Analysis of Tryptophan Metabolites in the Urine of Patients with Parkinson's Disease Using LC-MS/MS.,"Although Parkinson's disease (PD) is a representative neurodegenerative disorder and shows characteristic motor impediments, the pathophysiological mechanisms and treatment targets for PD have not yet been clearly identified. Since several tryptophan metabolites produced by gut microbiota could pass the blood-brain barrier and, furthermore, might influence the central nervous system, tryptophan metabolites within the indole, kynurenine, and serotonin metabolic pathways might be the most potent targets for PD development. Furthermore, most metabolites are circulated via the blood, play roles in and/or are metabolized via the host organs, and finally are excreted into the urine. Therefore, profiling the overall tryptophan metabolic pathways in urine samples of patients with PD is important to understanding the pathological mechanisms, finding biomarkers, and discovering therapeutic targets for PD. However, the development of profiling analysis based on tryptophan metabolism pathways in human urine samples is still challenging due to the wide physiological ranges, the varied signal response, and the structural diversity of tryptophan metabolites in complicated urine matrices. In this study, an LC-MS/MS method was developed to profile 21 tryptophan metabolites within the indole, kynurenine, and serotonin metabolic pathways in human urine samples using ion-pairing chromatography and multiple reaction monitoring determination. The developed method was successfully applied to urine samples of PD patients (<i>n</i> = 41) and controls (<i>n</i> = 20). Further, we investigated aberrant metabolites to find biomarkers for PD development and therapeutic targets based on the quantitative results. Unfortunately, most tryptophan metabolites in the urine samples did not present significant differences between control and PD patients, except for indole-3-acetic acid. Nonetheless, indole-3-acetic acid was reported for the first time for its aberrant urinary levels in PD patients and tentatively selected as a potential biomarker for PD. This study provides accurate quantitative results for 21 tryptophan metabolites in biological samples and will be helpful in revealing the pathological mechanisms of PD development, discovering biomarkers for PD, and further providing therapeutic targets for various PD symptoms. In the near future, to further investigate the relationship between gut microbial metabolites and PD, we will employ studies on microbial metabolites using plasma and stool samples from control and PD patients.","Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,So Hyeon Chung; Dallah Yoo; Tae-Beom Ahn; Wonwoong Lee; Jongki Hong
37196855,Kanamycin treatment in the pre-symptomatic stage of a Drosophila PD model prevents the onset of non-motor alterations.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor alterations, which is preceded by a prodromal stage where non-motor symptoms are observed. Over recent years, it has become evident that this disorder involves other organs that communicate with the brain like the gut. Importantly, the microbial community that lives in the gut plays a key role in this communication, the so-called microbiota-gut-brain axis. Alterations in this axis have been associated to several disorders including PD. Here we proposed that the gut microbiota is different in the presymptomatic stage of a Drosophila model for PD, the Pink1<sup>B9</sup> mutant fly, as compared to that observed in control animals. Our results show this is the case: there is basal dysbiosis in mutant animals evidenced by substantial difference in the composition of midgut microbiota in 8-9 days old Pink1<sup>B9</sup> mutant flies as compared with control animals. Further, we fed young adult control and mutant flies kanamycin and analyzed motor and non-motor behavioral parameters in these animals. Data show that kanamycin treatment induces the recovery of some of the non-motor parameters altered in the pre-motor stage of the PD fly model, while there is no substantial change in locomotor parameters recorded at this stage. On the other hand, our results show that feeding young animals the antibiotic, results in a long-lasting improvement of locomotion in control flies. Our data support that manipulations of gut microbiota in young animals could have beneficial effects on PD progression and age-dependent motor impairments.

38106542,Sex Differences in the Allele Distribution of <i>PGLYRP2</i> Variant rs892145 in Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex multifactorial disease, involving genetic susceptibility, environmental risk factors, and gene-environmental interactions. The microbiota-gut-brain axis is hypothesized to play a role in the pathophysiology of PD, and peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGLYRPs), which modulate the gut microbiota, are, therefore, relevant candidate genes for PD.Using quantitative real-time PCR, we genotyped three <i>PGLYRP</i> variants (rs892145, rs959117, and rs10888557) and performed an association analysis in 508 PD patients and 585 control individuals. We further conducted a meta-analysis of rs892145 and analyzed <i>PGLYRP2</i> gene expression in lymphocytes from patients with PD and controls.Although initial analysis of the three variants rs892145, rs959117, and rs10888557 and a meta-analysis of rs892145 did not reveal any association between the selected variants and PD, we found an interaction between sex and genotype for rs892145, with a marked difference in the allele distribution of rs892145 between male and female patients. As compared to controls, the T allele was less common in female patients (odds ratioâ=â0.76, <i>P</i>â=â0.04) and more common in male patients (odds ratioâ=â1.29, <i>P</i>â=â0.04). No difference was found in <i>PGLYRP2</i> gene expression between PD patients and controls (<i>P</i>â=â0.38), nor between sexes (<i>P</i>â=â0.07). <i>Discussion</i>. Overall, this genetic screening in Swedish PD patients does not support previous results demonstrating associations of <i>PGLYRP</i> variants with the risk of PD. Meta-analysis of rs892145 revealed pronounced heterogeneity between previously published studies which is likely to have influenced the results. Taken together, the genetic and gene expression analyses suggest a possible link between genetic variants in <i>PGLYRP2</i> and sex differences in PD. Because of the limited sample size in our study, these results need to be verified in independent cohorts before concluding.",Parkinson's disease,2023,Caroline Ran; Karin Wirdefeldt; Olof Sydow; Per Svenningsson; Rochellys Diaz Heijtz
36918961,NEMoE: a nutrition aware regularized mixture of experts model to identify heterogeneous diet-microbiome-host health interactions.,"Unrevealing the interplay between diet, the microbiome, and the health state could enable the design of personalized intervention strategies and improve the health and well-being of individuals. A common approach to this is to divide the study population into smaller cohorts based on dietary preferences in the hope of identifying specific microbial signatures. However, classification of patients based solely on diet is unlikely to reflect the microbiome-host health relationship or the taxonomic microbiome makeup.We present a novel approach, the Nutrition-Ecotype Mixture of Experts (NEMoE) model, for establishing associations between gut microbiota and health state that accounts for diet-specific cohort variability using a regularized mixture of experts model framework with an integrated parameter sharing strategy to ensure data-driven diet-cohort identification consistency across taxonomic levels. The success of our approach was demonstrated through a series of simulation studies, in which NEMoE showed robustness with regard to parameter selection and varying degrees of data heterogeneity. Further application to real-world microbiome data from a Parkinson's disease cohort revealed that NEMoE is capable of not only improving predictive performance for Parkinson's Disease but also for identifying diet-specific microbial signatures of disease.In summary, NEMoE can be used to uncover diet-specific relationships between nutritional-ecotype and patient health and to contextualize precision nutrition for different diseases.

However, the causal effects between gut microbiota and different types of dementia and whether cytokines act as a mediator remain unclear.Gut microbiota, cytokines, and five dementia types, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), dementia with Lewy body (DLB), vascular dementia (VD), and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) were identified from large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary data. We used Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate the causal relationships between gut microbiota, cytokines, and five types of dementia. Inverse variance weighting (IVW) was used as the main statistical method. In addition, we explored whether cytokines act as a mediating factor in the pathway from gut microbiota to dementia.There were 20 positive and 16 negative causal effects between genetic liability in the gut microbiota and dementia. Also, there were five positive and four negative causal effects between cytokines and dementias. Cytokines did not act as mediating factors.Gut microbiota and cytokines were causally associated with five types of dementia, and cytokines seemed not to be the mediating factors in the pathway from gut microbiota to dementia.",Journal of neuroinflammation,2024,Dong Ji; Wen-Zhu Chen; Lei Zhang; Zhi-Hua Zhang; Li-Jian Chen
38958636,Pesticides and the Gut Microbiota: Implications for Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) affects more people worldwide than just aging alone can explain. This is likely due to environmental influences, genetic makeup, and changes in daily habits. The disease develops in a complex way, with movement problems caused by Lewy bodies and the loss of dopamine-producing neurons. Some research suggests Lewy bodies might start in the gut, hinting at a connection between these structures and gut health in PD patients. These patients often have different gut bacteria and metabolites. Pesticides are known to increase the risk of PD, with evidence showing they harm more than just dopamine neurons. Long-term exposure to pesticides in food might affect the gut barrier, gut bacteria, and the blood-brain barrier, but the exact link is still unknown. This review looks at how pesticides and gut bacteria separately influence PD development and progression, highlighting the harmful effects of pesticides and changes in gut bacteria. We have examined the interaction between pesticides and gut bacteria in PD patients, summarizing how pesticides cause imbalances in gut bacteria, the resulting changes, and their overall effects on the PD prognosis.",Chemical research in toxicology,2024,Nabanita Ghosh; Krishnendu Sinha; Parames C Sil

However, evidence for the role of the MedDiet in the relief of motor and non-motor symptoms in patients with PD remains limited and inconclusive. We provide a systematic review of the effects of the MedDiet on the clinical features of PD using data from randomised controlled trials (RCT) and prospective observational studies.We searched MEDLINE, EMCare, EMBASE, Scopus and PubMed from inception until June 2023. Reference lists and the grey literature were also searched. Human studies with no restriction on language or publication date, examining associations between MedDiet adherence and the symptoms of PD, were included. We employed standard methodological procedures for data extraction and evidence synthesis and used the Quality Criteria Checklist for assessing the studies included.Four studies from three unique cohorts, including two observational studies (n = 1213) and one RCT (n = 70), met the inclusion criteria. Despite the short study duration reported in all included reports, high MedDiet adherence was associated with changes in the gut microbiota (e.g., increased abundance of short-chain fatty acids producers). These outcomes correlated with a significant improvement in several non-motor symptoms including cognitive dysfunction, dyspepsia and constipation. However, there were no significant changes in diarrhoea, gastrointestinal reflux, abdominal pain and motor symptoms.High MedDiet adherence may be associated with significant improvement in global cognition and several gastrointestinal symptoms, possibly associated to changes in gut microbiota composition. Further studies are warranted to clarify potential cause-and-effect relationships and to elucidate MedDiet impact on motor symptoms.",Nutrients,2024,Bibi Aliya Seelarbokus; Elisa Menozzi; Anthony H V Schapira; Anastasia Z Kalea; Jane Macnaughtan
38652236,Modulation of Gut Microbiota Through Dietary Intervention in Neuroinflammation and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases.,"The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of neuroinflammation and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. One of the main modulators of the gut microbiota is the diet, which directly influences host homeostasis and biological processes. Some dietary patterns can affect neurodegenerative diseases' progression through gut microbiota composition, gut permeability, and the synthesis and secretion of microbial-derived neurotrophic factors and neurotransmitters. This comprehensive review critically assesses existing studies investigating the impact of dietary interventions on the modulation of the microbiota in relation to neurodegenerative diseases and neuroinflammation.There are limited studies on the effects of specific diets, such as the ketogenic diet, Mediterranean diet, vegetarian diet, and Western diet, on the progression of neuroinflammation and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases through the gut-brain axis. The ketogenic diet displays promising potential in ameliorating the clinical trajectory of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. However, conflicting outcomes were observed among various studies, highlighting the need to consider diverse types of ketogenic diets and their respective effects on clinical outcomes and gut microbiota composition. Vegetarian and Mediterranean diets, known for their anti-inflammatory properties, can be effective against Parkinson's disease, which is related to inflammation in the gut environment. On the other hand, the westernization of dietary patterns was associated with reduced gut microbial diversity and metabolites, which ultimately contributed to the development of neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment. Various studies examining the impact of dietary interventions on the gut-brain axis with regard to neuroinflammation and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases are thoroughly reviewed in this article. A strong mechanistic explanation is required to fully understand the complex interactions between various dietary patterns, gut microbiota, and microbial metabolites and the effects these interactions have on cognitive function and the progression of these diseases.",Current nutrition reports,2024,Åerife Ayten; Saniye Bilici
37843219,Correlation between the gut microbiome and neurodegenerative diseases: a review of metagenomics evidence.,"A growing body of evidence suggests that the gut microbiota contributes to the development of neurodegenerative diseases via the microbiota-gut-brain axis. As a contributing factor, microbiota dysbiosis always occurs in pathological changes of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. High-throughput sequencing technology has helped to reveal that the bidirectional communication between the central nervous system and the enteric nervous system is facilitated by the microbiota's diverse microorganisms, and for both neuroimmune and neuroendocrine systems. Here, we summarize the bioinformatics analysis and wet-biology validation for the gut metagenomics in neurodegenerative diseases, with an emphasis on multi-omics studies and the gut virome. The pathogen-associated signaling biomarkers for identifying brain disorders and potential therapeutic targets are also elucidated.

38867886,The interplay between gut microbiota and the brain-gut axis in Parkinson's disease treatment.,"This study delves into the pivotal role of the gut microbiota and the brain-gut axis in Parkinson's Disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder with significant motor and non-motor implications. It posits that disruptions in gut microbiota-dysbiosis-and alterations in the brain-gut axis contribute to PD's pathogenesis. Our findings highlight the potential of the gastrointestinal system's early involvement in PD, suggested by the precedence of gastrointestinal symptoms before motor symptoms emerge. This observation implies a possible gut-originated disease pathway. The analysis demonstrates that dysbiosis in PD patients leads to increased intestinal permeability and systemic inflammation, which in turn exacerbates neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Such insights into the interaction between gut microbiota and the brain-gut axis not only elucidate PD's underlying mechanisms but also pave the way for novel therapeutic interventions. We propose targeted treatment strategies, including dietary modifications and fecal microbiota transplantation, aimed at modulating the gut microbiota. These approaches hold promise for augmenting current PD treatment modalities by alleviating both motor and non-motor symptoms, thereby potentially improving patient quality of life. This research underscores the significance of the gut microbiota in the progression and treatment of PD, advocating for an integrated, multidisciplinary approach to develop personalized, efficacious management strategies for PD patients, combining insights from neurology, microbiology, and nutritional science.",Frontiers in neurology,2024,Xi Jia; Qin Wang; Meilingzi Liu; Jia-Yuan Ding
38570412,The Gut Microbiota in Parkinson Disease: Interactions with Drugs and Potential for Therapeutic Applications.,"The concept of a 'microbiota-gut-brain axis' has recently emerged as an important player in the pathophysiology of Parkinson disease (PD), not least because of the reciprocal interaction between gut bacteria and medications. The gut microbiota can influence levodopa kinetics, and conversely, drugs administered for PD can influence gut microbiota composition. Through a two-step enzymatic pathway, gut microbes can decarboxylate levodopa to dopamine in the small intestine and then dehydroxylate it to m-tyramine, thus reducing availability. Inhibition of bacterial decarboxylation pathways could therefore represent a strategy to increase levodopa absorption. Other bacterial perturbations common in PD, such as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and Helicobacter pylori infection, can also modulate levodopa metabolism, and eradication therapies may improve levodopa absorption. Interventions targeting the gut microbiota offer a novel opportunity to manage disabling motor complications and dopa-unresponsive symptoms. Mediterranean diet-induced changes in gut microbiota composition might improve a range of non-motor symptoms. Prebiotics can increase levels of short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria and decrease pro-inflammatory species, with positive effects on clinical symptoms and levodopa kinetics. Different formulations of probiotics showed beneficial outcomes on constipation, with some of them improving dopamine levels; however, the most effective dosage and duration and long-term effects of these treatments remain unknown. Data from faecal microbiota transplantation studies are preliminary, but show encouraging trends towards improvement in both motor and non-motor outcomes.This article summarises the most up-to-date knowledge in pharmacomicrobiomics in PD, and discusses how the manipulation of gut microbiota represents a potential new therapeutic avenue for PD.",CNS drugs,2024,Elisa Menozzi; Anthony H V Schapira

Research has demonstrated that inhibiting the aggregation, oligomerization, and fibrillation of Î±-synuclein are key strategies for disease modification. Polyphenols, which are rich in fruits and vegetables, are drawing attention for their potential role in this context. In this paper, we reviewed how polyphenols influence the composition and functional capabilities of the gut microbiota and how the resulting microbial metabolites of polyphenols may potentially enhance the modulation of Î±-synuclein aggregation.

38279293,From the Gut to the Brain: The Role of Enteric Glial Cells and Their Involvement in the Pathogenesis of Parkinson's Disease.,"The brain-gut axis has been identified as an important contributor to the physiopathology of Parkinson's disease. In this pathology, inflammation is thought to be driven by the damage caused by aggregation of Î±-synuclein in the brain. Interestingly, the Braak's theory proposes that Î±-synuclein misfolding may originate in the gut and spread in a ""prion-like"" manner through the vagus nerve into the central nervous system. In the enteric nervous system, enteric glial cells are the most abundant cellular component. Several studies have evaluated their role in Parkinson's disease. Using samples obtained from patients, cell cultures, or animal models, the studies with specific antibodies to label enteric glial cells (GFAP, Sox-10, and S100Î²) seem to indicate that activation and reactive gliosis are associated to the neurodegeneration produced by Parkinson's disease in the enteric nervous system. Of interest, Toll-like receptors, which are expressed on enteric glial cells, participate in the triggering of immune/inflammatory responses, in the maintenance of intestinal barrier integrity and in the configuration of gut microbiota; thus, these receptors might contribute to Parkinson's disease. External factors like stress also seem to be relevant in its pathogenesis. Some authors have studied ways to reverse changes in EGCs with interventions such as administration of Tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase inhibitors, nutraceuticals, or physical exercise. Some researchers point out that beyond being activated during the disease, enteric glial cells may contribute to the development of synucleinopathies. Thus, it is still necessary to further study these cells and their role in Parkinson's disease.",International journal of molecular sciences,2024,Alba MontalbÃ¡n-RodrÃ­guez; Raquel Abalo; Laura LÃ³pez-GÃ³mez

38587699,The Interaction Between Nutraceuticals and Gut Microbiota: a Novel Therapeutic Approach to Prevent and Treatment Parkinson's Disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons, leading to motor and non-motor symptoms. Emerging research has shed light on the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis and progression of PD. Nutraceuticals such as curcumin, berberine, phytoestrogens, polyphenols (e.g., resveratrol, EGCG, and fisetin), dietary fibers have been shown to influence gut microbiota composition and function, restoring microbial balance and enhancing the gut-brain axis. The mechanisms underlying these benefits involve microbial metabolite production, restoration of gut barrier integrity, and modulation of neuroinflammatory pathways. Additionally, probiotics and prebiotics have shown potential in promoting gut health, influencing the gut microbiome, and alleviating PD symptoms. They can enhance the gut's antioxidant capacity of the gut, reduce inflammation, and maintain immune homeostasis, contributing to a neuroprotective environment. This paper provides an overview of the current state of knowledge regarding the potential of nutraceuticals and gut microbiota modulation in the prevention and management of Parkinson's disease, emphasizing the need for further research and clinical trials to validate their effectiveness and safety. The findings suggest that a multifaceted approach involving nutraceuticals and gut microbiota may open new avenues for addressing the challenges of PD and improving the quality of life for affected individuals.",Molecular neurobiology,2024,Liyan Yao; Yong Yang; Xiaowei Yang; Mohammad J Rezaei
38852651,Study on the mechanism of gut microbiota in the pathogenetic interaction between depression and Parkinson 's disease.,"Depression and Parkinson's disease share pathogenetic characteristics, meaning that they can impact each other and exacerbate their respective progression. From a pathogenetic perspective, depression can develop into Parkinson's disease and is a precursor symptom of Parkinson's disease; Parkinson's disease is also often accompanied by depression. From a pharmacological perspective, the use of antidepressants increases the risk of developing Parkinson's disease, and therapeutic medications for Parkinson's disease can exacerbate symptoms of depression. Therefore, identifying how Parkinson's disease and depression impact each other in their development is key to formulating preventive measures and targeted treatment. One commonality in the pathogenesis of depression and Parkinson's disease are alterations in the gut microbiota, with mechanisms interacting in neural, immune inflammatory, and neuroendocrine pathways. This paper reviews the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of depression and Parkinson's disease; conducts a study of the relationship between both conditions and medication; and suggests that dysregulated gut microbiota may be a key factor in explaining the relationship between Parkinson's disease and depression.

38785512,The Effect of Gut Microbiota-Targeted Interventions on Neuroinflammation and Motor Function in Parkinson's Disease Animal Models-A Systematic Review.,"Gut microbiome-targeted interventions such as fecal transplant, prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics, and antibiotic gut depletion are speculated to be of potential use in delaying the onset and progression of Parkinson's disease by rebalancing the gut microbiome in the context of the gut-brain axis. Our study aims to organize recent findings regarding these interventions in Parkinson's disease animal models to identify how they affect neuroinflammation and motor outcomes. A systematic literature search was applied in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and SCOPUS for gut microbiome-targeted non-dietary interventions. Studies that investigated gut-targeted interventions by using in vivo murine PD models to follow dopaminergic cell loss, motor tests, and neuroinflammatory markers as outcomes were considered to be eligible. A total of 1335 studies were identified in the databases, out of which 29 were found to be eligible. A narrative systematization of the resulting data was performed, and the effect direction for the outcomes was represented. Quality assessment using the SYRCLE risk of bias tool was also performed. Out of the 29 eligible studies, we found that a significant majority report that the intervention reduced the dopaminergic cell loss (82.76%, 95% CI [64.23%, 94.15%]) produced by the induction of the disease model. Also, most studies reported a reduction in microglial (87.5%, 95% CI [61.65%, 98.45%]) and astrocytic activation (84,62%, 95% CI [54.55%, 98.08%]) caused by the induction of the disease model. These results were also mirrored in the majority (96.4% 95% CI [81.65%, 99.91%]) of the studies reporting an increase in performance in behavioral motor tests. A significant limitation of the study was that insufficient information was found in the studies to assess specific causes of the risk of bias. These results show that non-dietary gut microbiome-targeted interventions can improve neuroinflammatory and motor outcomes in acute Parkinson's disease animal models. Further studies are needed to clarify if these benefits transfer to the long-term pathogenesis of the disease, which is not yet fully understood.

In addition, we explored whether BCAAs act as a mediating factor in the pathway from gut microbiota to PD.We found evidence of a causality of 15 microbial taxa and PD before and after sensitivity analyses, but not after multiple testing correction. There was significant association between BCAAs levels and the risk of PD, especially isoleucine (ORâ=â0.995, 95% CI 0.992-0.999, pâ=â0.004, pFDRâ=â0.012).

39168575,Coffee and Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disease marked by dopaminergic neuronal loss and misfolded alpha-synuclein (Î±-syn) accumulation, which results in both motor and cognitive symptoms. Its occurrence grows with age, with a larger prevalence among males. Despite substantial study, effective medicines to reduce or stop the progression of diseases remain elusive. Interest has grown in examining dietary components, such as caffeine present in coffee, for potential medicinal effects. Epidemiological studies imply a lower incidence of PD with coffee drinking, attributable to caffeine's neuroprotective abilities. Beyond caffeine, coffee constituent like chlorogenic acid and cafestol have anti-Parkinsonian benefits. Moreover, coffee use has been related with variations in gut microbiota composition, which may reduce intestinal inflammation and prevent protein misfolding in enteric nerves, perhaps through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. This review gives a summary of the neuroprotective effects of coffee, investigating both its motor and non-motor advantages in individuals with PD as well as in experimental models of PD. We reviewed some bioactive constituents of coffee, their respective interactions with misfolded Î±-syn accumulation, and its emerging mechanisms associated to the gut microbiome.",Progress in brain research,2024,Abraham Olufemi Asuku; Maryam Tayo Ayinla; Tobiloba Samuel Olajide; Toheeb O Oyerinde; Joshua Ayodele Yusuf; Adedamola Aminat Bayo-Olugbami; Grace Ayobami Fajemidagba
39106786,Gut microbiota modulates neurotransmitter and gut-brain signaling.,"Neurotransmitters, including 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), dopamine (DA), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and glutamate, are essential transductors in the Gut-Brain Axis (GBA), playing critical roles both peripherally and centrally. Accumulating evidence suggests that the gut microbiota modulates intestinal neurotransmitter metabolism and gut-to-brain signaling, shedding light on the crucial role of the gut microbiota in brain function and the pathogenesis of various neuropsychiatric diseases, such as major depression disorder (MDD), anxiety, addiction and Parkinson's disease (PD). Despite the exciting findings, the mechanisms underlying the modulation of neurotransmitter metabolism and function by the gut microbiota are still being elucidated. In this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the existing knowledge about the role of the gut microbiota in neurotransmitter metabolism and function in animal and clinical experiments. Moreover, we will discuss the potential mechanisms through which gut microbiota-derived neurotransmitters contribute to the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric diseases, thus highlighting a novel therapeutic target for these conditions.",Microbiological research,2024,Shiyan Qu; Zijin Yu; Yaxuan Zhou; Shiyi Wang; Minqi Jia; Ti Chen; Xiaojie Zhang
38974034,Gut-directed therapy in Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common and slow-progressing neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms, including gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunctions. Over the last years, the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis is emerging as a bacterial-neuro-immune ascending pathway that contributes to the progression of PD. Indeed, PD patients are characterized by changes in gut microbiota composition, alterations of intestinal epithelial barrier (IEB) and enteric neurogenic/inflammatory responses that, besides determining intestinal disturbances, contribute to brain pathology. In this context, despite the causal relationship between gut dysbiosis, impaired MGB axis and PD remains to be elucidated, emerging evidence shows that MGB axis modulation can represent a suitable therapeutical strategy for the treatment of PD. This review provides an overview of the available knowledge about the beneficial effects of gut-directed therapies, including dietary interventions, prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), in both PD patients and animal models. In this context, particular attention has been devoted to the mechanisms by which the modulation of MGB axis could halt or slow down PD pathology and, most importantly, how these approaches can be included in the clinical practice.",Frontiers in pharmacology,2024,Laura Benvenuti; Clelia Di Salvo; Gabriele Bellini; Luisa Seguella; Francesco Rettura; Giuseppe Esposito; Luca Antonioli; Roberto Ceravolo; Nunzia Bernardini; Carolina Pellegrini; Matteo Fornai
39036341,The gut microbiota-brain axis in neurological disorders.,"Previous studies have shown a bidirectional communication between human gut microbiota and the brain, known as the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA). The MGBA influences the host's nervous system development, emotional regulation, and cognitive function through neurotransmitters, immune modulation, and metabolic pathways. Factors like diet, lifestyle, genetics, and environment shape the gut microbiota composition together. Most research have explored how gut microbiota regulates host physiology and its potential in preventing and treating neurological disorders. However, the individual heterogeneity of gut microbiota, strains playing a dominant role in neurological diseases, and the interactions of these microbial metabolites with the central/peripheral nervous systems still need exploration. This review summarizes the potential role of gut microbiota in driving neurodevelopmental disorders (autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder), neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease), and mood disorders (anxiety and depression) in recent years and discusses the current clinical and preclinical gut microbe-based interventions, including dietary intervention, probiotics, prebiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation. It also puts forward the current insufficient research on gut microbiota in neurological disorders and provides a framework for further research on neurological disorders.",MedComm,2024,Mingming You; Nan Chen; Yuanyuan Yang; Lingjun Cheng; Hongzhang He; Yanhua Cai; Yating Liu; Haiyue Liu; Guolin Hong
37307829,Relationships Between Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder and Parkinson's Disease: Indication from Gut Microbiota Alterations.,"Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) has a close relationship with Parkinson's disease (PD) and was even regarded as the most reliable hallmark of prodromal PD. RBD might have similar changes in gut dysbiosis to PD, but the relationship between RBD and PD in gut microbial alterations is rarely studied. In this study, we aim to investigate whether there were consistent changes between RBD and PD in gut microbiota, and found some specific biomarkers in RBD that might indicate phenoconversion to PD. Alpha-diversity showed no remarkable difference and beta-diversity showed significant differences based on the unweighted (R = 0.035, P = 0.037) and weighted (R = 0.0045, P = 0.008) UniFrac analysis among idiopathic RBD (iRBD), PD with RBD, PD without RBD and normal controls (NC). Enterotype distribution indicated iRBD, PD with RBD and PD without RBD were Ruminococcus-dominant while NC were Bacteroides-dominant. 7 genera (4 increased: Aerococcus, Eubacterium, Gordonibacter and Stenotrophomonas, 3 decreased: Butyricicoccus, Faecalibacterium and Haemophilus) were consistently changed in iRBD and PD with RBD. Among them, 4 genera (Aerococcus, Eubacterium, Butyricicoccus, Faecalibacterium) remained distinctive in the comparison between PD with RBD and PD without RBD. Through clinical correlation analysis, Butyricicoccus and Faecalibacterium were found negatively correlated with the severity of RBD (RBD-HK). Functional analysis showed iRBD had similarly increased staurosporine biosynthesis to PD with RBD. Our study indicates that RBD had similar gut microbial changes to PD. Decreased Butyricicoccus and Faecalibacterium might be potential hallmarks of phenoconversion of RBD to PD.",Aging and disease,2024,Pingchen Zhang; Pei Huang; Yuanyuan Li; Juanjuan Du; Ningdi Luo; Yixi He; Jin Liu; Guiying He; Shishuang Cui; Weishan Zhang; Gen Li; Xin Shen; Liu Jun; Shengdi Chen
39134825,Gut Microbiota-Induced Modulation of the Central Nervous System Function in Parkinson's Disease Through the Gut-Brain Axis and Short-Chain Fatty Acids.,"Recent insights into Parkinson's disease (PD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, suggest a significant influence of the gut microbiome on its pathogenesis and progression through the gut-brain axis. This study integrates 16S rRNA sequencing, high-throughput transcriptomic sequencing, and animal model experiments to explore the molecular mechanisms underpinning the role of gut-brain axis in PD, with a focus on short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) mediated by the SCFA receptors FFAR2 and FFAR3. Our findings highlighted prominent differences in the gut microbiota composition between PD patients and healthy individuals, particularly in taxa such as Escherichia_Shigella and Bacteroidetes, which potentially impact SCFA levels through secondary metabolite biosynthesis. Notably, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from healthy to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse models significantly improved motor function, enhanced dopamine and serotonin levels in the striatum, and increased the number of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra while reducing glial cell activation. This therapeutic effect was associated with increased levels of SCFAs such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate in the gut of MPTP-lesioned mice. Moreover, transcriptomic analyses revealed upregulated expression of FFAR2 and FFAR3 in MPTP-lesioned mice, indicating their crucial role in mediating the benefits of FMT on the central nervous system. These results provide compelling evidence that gut microbiota and SCFAs play a critical role in modulating the gut-brain axis, offering new insights into PD's etiology and potential targets for therapeutic intervention.",Molecular neurobiology,2024,Yiting Ni; Qiaowen Tong; Mengying Xu; Jiayi Gu; Hua Ye
38989933,Gut microbiota-astrocyte axis: new insights into age-related cognitive decline.,"With the rapidly aging human population, age-related cognitive decline and dementia are becoming increasingly prevalent worldwide. Aging is considered the main risk factor for cognitive decline and acts through alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota, microbial metabolites, and the functions of astrocytes. The microbiota-gut-brain axis has been the focus of multiple studies and is closely associated with cognitive function. This article provides a comprehensive review of the specific changes that occur in the composition of the gut microbiota and microbial metabolites in older individuals and discusses how the aging of astrocytes and reactive astrocytosis are closely related to age-related cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases. This article also summarizes the gut microbiota components that affect astrocyte function, mainly through the vagus nerve, immune responses, circadian rhythms, and microbial metabolites. Finally, this article summarizes the mechanism by which the gut microbiota-astrocyte axis plays a role in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Our findings have revealed the critical role of the microbiota-astrocyte axis in age-related cognitive decline, aiding in a deeper understanding of potential gut microbiome-based adjuvant therapy strategies for this condition.",Neural regeneration research,2025,Lan Zhang; Jingge Wei; Xilei Liu; Dai Li; Xiaoqi Pang; Fanglian Chen; Hailong Cao; Ping Lei
38344171,The interplay between microbiota and brain-gut axis in epilepsy treatment.,"The brain-gut axis plays a vital role in connecting the cognitive and emotional centers of the brain with the intricate workings of the intestines. An imbalance in the microbiota-mediated brain-gut axis extends far beyond conditions like Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and obesity, playing a critical role in the development and progression of various neurological disorders, including epilepsy, depression, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD). Epilepsy, a brain disorder characterized by unprovoked seizures, affects approximately 50 million people worldwide. Accumulating evidence suggests that rebuilding the gut microbiota through interventions such as fecal microbiota transplantation, probiotics, and ketogenic diets (KD) can benefit drug-resistant epilepsy. The disturbances in the gut microbiota could contribute to the toxic side effects of antiepileptic drugs and the development of drug resistance in epilepsy patients. These findings imply the potential impact of the gut microbiota on epilepsy and suggest that interventions targeting the microbiota, such as the KD, hold promise for managing and treating epilepsy. However, the full extent of the importance of microbiota in epilepsy treatment is not yet fully understood, and many aspects of this field remain unclear. Therefore, this article aims to provide an overview of the clinical and animal evidence supporting the regulatory role of gut microbiota in epilepsy, and of potential pathways within the brain-gut axis that may be influenced by the gut microbiota in epilepsy. Furthermore, we will discuss the recent advancements in epilepsy treatment, including the KD, fecal microbiota transplantation, and antiseizure drugs, all from the perspective of the gut microbiota.",Frontiers in pharmacology,2024,Hanxiao Zhu; Wei Wang; Yun Li
38237031,The contribution of age-related changes in the gut-brain axis to neurological disorders.,"Trillions of microbes live symbiotically in the host, specifically in mucosal tissues such as the gut. Recent advances in metagenomics and metabolomics have revealed that the gut microbiota plays a critical role in the regulation of host immunity and metabolism, communicating through bidirectional interactions in the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA). The gut microbiota regulates both gut and systemic immunity and contributes to the neurodevelopment and behaviors of the host. With aging, the composition of the microbiota changes, and emerging studies have linked these shifts in microbial populations to age-related neurological diseases (NDs). Preclinical studies have demonstrated that gut microbiota-targeted therapies can improve behavioral outcomes in the host by modulating microbial, metabolomic, and immunological profiles. In this review, we discuss the pathways of brain-to-gut or gut-to-brain signaling and summarize the role of gut microbiota and microbial metabolites across the lifespan and in disease. We highlight recent studies investigating 1) microbial changes with aging; 2) how aging of the maternal microbiome can affect offspring health; and 3) the contribution of the microbiome to both chronic age-related diseases (e.g., Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and cerebral amyloidosis), and acute brain injury, including ischemic stroke and traumatic brain injury.",Gut microbes,2024,Romeesa Khan; Claudia M Di GesÃ¹; Juneyoung Lee; Louise D McCullough
38848023,The connection between gut microbiota and its metabolites with neurodegenerative diseases in humans.,"The aging of populations is a global phenomenon that follows a possible increase in the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases. Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Multiple Sclerosis, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and Huntington's diseases are some neurodegenerative disorders that aging could initiate or aggravate. Recent research has indicated that intestinal microbiota dysbiosis can trigger metabolism and brain functioning, contributing to the etiopathogenesis of those neurodegenerative diseases. The intestinal microbiota and its metabolites show significant functions in various aspects, such as the immune system modulation (development and maturation), the maintenance of the intestinal barrier integrity, the modulation of neuromuscular functions in the intestine, and the facilitation of essential metabolic processes for both the microbiota and humans. The primary evidence supporting the connection between intestinal microbiota and its metabolites with neurodegenerative diseases are epidemiological observations and animal models experimentation. This paper reviews up-to-date evidence on the correlation between the microbiota-gut-brain axis and neurodegenerative diseases, with a specially focus on gut metabolites. Dysbiosis can increase inflammatory cytokines and bacterial metabolites, altering intestinal and blood-brain barrier permeability and causing neuroinflammation, thus facilitating the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Clinical data supporting this evidence still needs to be improved. Most of the works found are descriptive and associated with the presence of phyla or species of bacteria with neurodegenerative diseases. Despite the limitations of recent research, the potential for elucidating clinical questions that have thus far eluded clarification within prevailing pathophysiological frameworks of health and disease is promising through investigation of the interplay between the host and microbiota.",Metabolic brain disease,2024,JoÃ£o Paulo Fabi
39113894,Exploring Causal Links Between Gut Microbiota and Geriatric Syndromes: A Two-Sample Mendelian Randomization Analysis.,"<b>Background:</b> Both observational studies and clinical trials have demonstrated a link between the gut microbiota and the geriatric syndrome. Nevertheless, the exact nature of this relationship, particularly concerning causality, remains elusive. Mendelian randomization (MR) is a method of inference based on genetic variation to assess the causal relationship between an exposure and an outcome. In this study, we conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (TSMR) study to fully reveal the potential genetic causal effects of gut microbiota on geriatric syndromes. <b>Methods:</b> This study used data from genome wide association studies (GWAS) to investigate causal relationships between the gut microbiota and geriatric syndromes, including frailty, Parkinson's disease (PD), delirium, insomnia, and depression. The primary causal relationships were evaluated using the inverse-variance weighted method, MR Egger, simple mode, weighted mode and weighted median. To assess the robustness of the results, horizontal pleiotropy was examined through MR-Egger intercept and MR-presso methods. Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran's Q test, and sensitivity was evaluated via the leave-one-out method. <b>Results:</b> We identified 41 probable causal relationships between gut microbiota and five geriatric syndrome-associated illnesses using the inverse-variance weighted method. Frailty showed five positive and two negative causal relationships, while PD revealed three positive and four negative causal connections. Delirium showed three positive and two negative causal relationships. Similarly, insomnia demonstrated nine positive and two negative causal connections, while depression presented nine positive and two negative causal relationships. <b>Conclusions:</b> Using the TSMR method and data from the public GWAS database and, we observed associations between specific microbiota groups and geriatric syndromes. These findings suggest a potential role of gut microbiota in the development of geriatric syndromes, providing valuable insights for further research into the causal relationship between gut microbiota and these syndromes.",International journal of medical sciences,2024,Qiuru Yao; Ling Chen; Yuxin Cai; Changxi Li; Shuyang Wen; Chun Yang; Qi Zhang; Yuting Zeng; Shuqi Zheng; Jihua Zou; Guozhi Huang; Qing Zeng
38409641,Neuroprotective Effects of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis NJ241 in a Mouse Model of Parkinson's Disease: Implications for Gut Microbiota and PGC-1Î±.,"Intestinal dysbiosis plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), and probiotics have emerged as potential modulators of central nervous system function through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. This study aimed to elucidate the anti-inflammatory effects and underlying mechanisms of the probiotic strain Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis NJ241 (NJ241) in a mouse model of PD induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). The impact of NJ241 was comprehensively assessed in PD mice through behavioral tests, immunofluorescence, Western blotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), 16S rRNA sequencing, and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) detection. NJ241 exhibited notable efficacy in mitigating MPTP-induced weight loss, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and behavioral deficits in mice. Furthermore, it demonstrated protected against MPTP-induced dopaminergic neuron death and inhibited the activation of glial cells in the substantia nigra (SN). NJ241 demonstrated the ability to normalized dysbiosis in the intestinal microbiota and elevate SCFA levels in PD mice. Additionally, NJ241 reversed MPTP-induced reductions in colonic GLP-1 levels and the expression of GLP-1R and PGC-1Î± in the SN. Notably, GLP-1R antagonists partially reversed the inhibitory effects of NJ241 on the activation of glial cells in the SN. In summary, NJ241 exerts a neuroprotective effect against MPTP-induced neuroinflammation by enhancing intestinal GLP-1 levels and activating nigral PGC-1Î± signaling. These findings provide a rationale for the exploration and development of probiotic-based therapeutic strategies for PD.",Molecular neurobiology,2024,Yuxuan Dong; Yueyan Qi; Jinhu Chen; Siyuan Han; Wenjing Su; Xin Ma; Yang Yu; Yanqin Wang
38385354,<i>Gastrodia elata</i> polysaccharide alleviates Parkinson's disease <i>via</i> inhibiting apoptotic and inflammatory signaling pathways and modulating the gut microbiota.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common, chronic, and progressive degenerative disease of the central nervous system for which there is no effective treatment. <i>Gastrodia elata</i> is a well-known food and medicine homologous resource with neuroprotective potential. <i>Gastrodia elata</i> polysaccharide (GEP), which is a highly active and safe component in <i>Gastrodia elata</i>, is an important ingredient in the development of functional products. In this study, GEP was administered to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced mice over 3 weeks to investigate its neuroprotective effects. The results showed that GEP significantly alleviated the motor dysfunction of PD mice, inhibited the accumulation of Î±-synuclein, and reduced the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the brain. Moreover, GEP increased the Bcl-2/Bax ratio and decreased the cleaved-caspase-3 level, suggesting that GEP may ameliorate PD by preventing MPTP-induced mitochondrial apoptosis. GEP also significantly inhibited the increase of GFAP and decreased the levels of TNF-Î±, IL-1Î², and IL-6 in the brain of PD mice, which may be the result of the inhibition of neuroinflammation by the inactivation of the TLR4/NF-ÎºB pathway. Furthermore, the neuroprotective effects of GEP involve the gut-brain axis, as it has been shown that GEP regulated the dysbiosis of PD-related gut microbiota such as <i>Akkermansia</i>, <i>Lactobacillus</i>, <i>Bacteroides</i>, <i>Prevotella</i>, and <i>Faecalibacterium</i>, increased the content of microbial metabolites SCFAs in the colon and increased the level of occludin that repairs the intestinal barrier of PD mice. In conclusion, this study is expected to provide a theoretical basis for the development and application of functional products with GEP from the perspective of neuroprotective effects.",Food & function,2024,Qing-Xia Gan; Mao-Yao Peng; Hao-Bo Wei; Lin-Lin Chen; Xiao-Yan Chen; Zi-Han Li; Guang-Qin An; Yun-Tong Ma

Our study identified a deficiency in the microbiota genus Blautia and a reduction in fecal short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) butyrate level in PD patients compared to healthy controls. The abundance of Blautia correlated with the clinical severity of PD. Supplementation with butyrate-producing bacterium B. producta demonstrated neuroprotective effects, attenuating neuroinflammation and dopaminergic neuronal death in mice, consequently ameliorating motor dysfunction. A pivotal inflammatory signaling pathway, the RAS-related pathway, modulated by butyrate, emerged as a key mechanism inhibiting microglial activation in PD. The change of RAS-NF-ÎºB pathway in PD patients was observed. Furthermore, B. producta-derived butyrate demonstrated the inhibition of microglial activation in PD through regulation of the RAS-NF-ÎºB pathway. These findings elucidate the causal relationship between specific gut microbiota and PD, presenting a novel microbiota-based treatment perspective for PD.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2024,Jiaming Liu; Xinhuang Lv; Tao Ye; Ming Zhao; Zhibo Chen; Yang Zhang; Wenwen Yang; Huijia Xie; Lu Zhan; Liuzhu Chen; Wen-Chun Liu; Kuan-Pin Su; Jing Sun
38755164,Gut microbiota produces biofilm-associated amyloids with potential for neurodegeneration.,"Age-related neurodegenerative diseases involving amyloid aggregation remain one of the biggest challenges of modern medicine. Alterations in the gastrointestinal microbiome play an active role in the aetiology of neurological disorders. Here, we dissect the amyloidogenic properties of biofilm-associated proteins (BAPs) of the gut microbiota and their implications for synucleinopathies. We demonstrate that BAPs are naturally assembled as amyloid-like fibrils in insoluble fractions isolated from the human gut microbiota. We show that BAP genes are part of the accessory genomes, revealing microbiome variability. Remarkably, the abundance of certain BAP genes in the gut microbiome is correlated with Parkinson's disease (PD) incidence. Using cultured dopaminergic neurons and Caenorhabditis elegans models, we report that BAP-derived amyloids induce Î±-synuclein aggregation. Our results show that the chaperone-mediated autophagy is compromised by BAP amyloids. Indeed, inoculation of BAP fibrils into the brains of wild-type mice promote key pathological features of PD. Therefore, our findings establish the use of BAP amyloids as potential targets and biomarkers of Î±-synucleinopathies.",Nature communications,2024,Ariadna FernÃ¡ndez-Calvet; Leticia Matilla-Cuenca; MarÃ­a Izco; Susanna Navarro; Miriam Serrano; Salvador Ventura; Javier Blesa; Maite HerrÃ¡iz; Gorka Alkorta-Aranburu; Sergio Galera; Igor Ruiz de Los Mozos; MarÃ­a Luisa Mansego; Alejandro Toledo-Arana; Lydia Alvarez-Erviti; Jaione Valle
38518598,Gut microbiota in neurological diseases: Melatonin plays an important regulatory role.,"Melatonin is a highly conserved molecule produced in the human pineal gland as a hormone. It is known for its essential biological effects, such as antioxidant activity, circadian rhythm regulator, and immunomodulatory effects. The gut is one of the primary known sources of melatonin. The gut microbiota helps produce melatonin from tryptophan, and melatonin has been shown to have a beneficial effect on gut barrier function and microbial population. Dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota is associated with bacterial imbalance and decreased beneficial microbial metabolites, including melatonin. In this way, low melatonin levels may be related to several human diseases. Melatonin has shown both preventive and therapeutic effects against various conditions, including neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. This review was aimed to discuss the role of melatonin in the body, and to describe the possible relationship between gut microbiota and melatonin production, as well as the potential therapeutic effects of melatonin on neurological diseases.",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2024,Somayeh Ahmadi; Mohammad Taghizadieh; Elham Mehdizadehfar; Alka Hasani; Javad Khalili Fard; Hadi Feizi; Hammed Hamishehkar; Masood Ansarin; Mina Yekani; Mohammad Yousef Memar
38244807,Potential effects of the most prescribed drugs on the microbiota-gut-brain-axis: A review.,"The link between drug-induced dysbiosis and its influence on brain diseases through gut-residing bacteria and their metabolites, named the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA), remains largely unexplored. This review investigates the effects of commonly prescribed drugs (metformin, statins, proton-pump-inhibitors, NSAIDs, and anti-depressants) on the gut microbiota, comparing the findings with altered bacterial populations in major brain diseases (depression, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's). The report aims to explore whether drugs can influence the development and progression of brain diseases via the MGBA. Central findings indicate that all explored drugs induce dysbiosis. These dysbiosis patterns were associated with brain disorders. The influence on brain diseases varied across different bacterial taxa, possibly mediated by direct effects or through bacterial metabolites. Each drug induced both positive and negative changes in the abundance of bacteria, indicating a counterbalancing effect. Moreover, the above-mentioned drugs exhibited similar effects, suggesting that they may counteract or enhance each other's effects on brain diseases when taken together by comorbid patients. In conclusion, the interplay of bacterial species and their abundances may have a greater impact on brain diseases than individual drugs or bacterial strains. Future research is needed to better understand drug-induced dysbiosis and the implications for brain disease pathogenesis, with the potential to develop more effective therapeutic options for patients with brain-related diseases.",Brain research bulletin,2024,Kirti Garg; M Hasan Mohajeri
38435303,Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota and its effect on Î±-synuclein and prion protein misfolding: consequences for neurodegeneration.,"Abnormal behavior of Î±-synuclein and prion proteins is the hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD) and prion illnesses, respectively, being complex neurological disorders. A primary cause of protein aggregation, brain injury, and cognitive loss in prion illnesses is the misfolding of normal cellular prion proteins (PrP<sup>C</sup>) into an infectious form (PrP<sup>Sc</sup>). Aggregation of Î±-synuclein causes disruptions in cellular processes in Parkinson's disease (PD), leading to loss of dopamine-producing neurons and motor symptoms. Alteration in the composition or activity of gut microbes may weaken the intestinal barrier and make it possible for prions to go from the gut to the brain. The gut-brain axis is linked to neuroinflammation; the metabolites produced by the gut microbiota affect the aggregation of Î±-synuclein, regulate inflammation and immunological responses, and may influence the course of the disease and neurotoxicity of proteins, even if their primary targets are distinct proteins. This thorough analysis explores the complex interactions that exist between the gut microbiota and neurodegenerative illnesses, particularly Parkinson's disease (PD) and prion disorders. The involvement of the gut microbiota, a complex collection of bacteria, archaea, fungi, viruses etc., in various neurological illnesses is becoming increasingly recognized. The gut microbiome influences neuroinflammation, neurotransmitter synthesis, mitochondrial function, and intestinal barrier integrity through the gut-brain axis, which contributes to the development and progression of disease. The review delves into the molecular mechanisms that underlie these relationships, emphasizing the effects of microbial metabolites such as bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in regulating brain functioning. Additionally, it looks at how environmental influences and dietary decisions affect the gut microbiome and whether they could be risk factors for neurodegenerative illnesses. This study concludes by highlighting the critical role that the gut microbiota plays in the development of Parkinson's disease (PD) and prion disease. It also provides a promising direction for future research and possible treatment approaches. People afflicted by these difficult ailments may find hope in new preventive and therapeutic approaches if the role of the gut microbiota in these diseases is better understood.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2024,Nasir Uddin Mahbub; Md Minarul Islam; Seong-Tshool Hong; Hea-Jong Chung
39019779,Exercise perspective: Benefits and mechanisms of gut microbiota on the body.,"Gut microbiota refers to the vast and diverse community of microorganisms residing in the intestines. Factors such as genetics, environmental influences (e.g., exercise, diet), and early life experiences (e.g., infant feeding methods) can all affect the ecological balance of gut microbiota within the body. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota is associated with extra-intestinal diseases such as Parkinson's syndrome, osteoporosis, and autoimmune diseases, suggesting that disturbances in gut microbiota may be one of the causes of these diseases. Exercise benefits various diseases, with gut microbiota playing a role in regulating the nervous, musculoskeletal, and immune systems. Gut microbiota can impact the body's health status through the gut-brain axis, gut-muscle axis, and immune pathways. Moderate-intensity aerobic exercise can increase the quantity of gut microbiota and change microbial abundance, although short-term exercise does not significantly affect the alpha diversity of the microbiota. Resistance exercise also does not have a significant regulatory effect on gut microbiota.",Zhong nan da xue xue bao. Yi xue ban = Journal of Central South University.

Despite the numerous connections it remains unclear how the gut and the brain communicate and whether gut dysbiosis is the cause or consequence of these pathologies. Importantly, several reports highlight the importance of mitochondria in the gut-brain axis, as well as in mechanisms like gut epithelium self-renewal, differentiation, and homeostasis. Herein we comprehensively address the important role of mitochondria as a cellular hub in infection and inflammation and as a link between inflammation and neurodegeneration in the gut-brain axis. The role of mitochondria in gut homeostasis and as well the crosstalk between mitochondria and gut microbiota is discussed. Significantly, we also review studies highlighting how gut microbiota can ultimately affect the central nervous system.

Understanding and intervening in this axis opens a pathway for therapeutic advancements for neurological and gastrointestinal diseases where the GBA has been proposed to play a role in the pathophysiology. In light of this, the current review assesses the effectiveness of neuromodulation techniques in treating neurological and gastrointestinal disorders by modulating the GBA, involving key elements such as gut microbiota, neurotrophic factors, and proinflammatory cytokines. Through a comprehensive literature review encompassing PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library, this research highlights the role played by the GBA in neurological and gastrointestinal diseases, in addition to the impact of neuromodulation on the management of these conditions which include both gastrointestinal (irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)) and neurological disorders (Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and neuropsychiatric disorders).

39459534,The Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis and Neurological Disorders: A Comprehensive Review.,"Microbes have inhabited the earth for hundreds of millions of years longer than humans. The microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) represents a bidirectional communication pathway. These communications occur between the central nervous system (CNS), the enteric nervous system (ENS), and the emotional and cognitive centres of the brain. The field of research on the gut-brain axis has grown significantly during the past two decades. Signalling occurs between the gut microbiota and the brain through the neural, endocrine, immune, and humoral pathways. A substantial body of evidence indicates that the MGBA plays a pivotal role in various neurological diseases. These include Alzheimer's disease (AD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Rett syndrome, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), non-Alzheimer's neurodegeneration and dementias, fronto-temporal lobe dementia (FTLD), Wilson-Konovalov disease (WD), multisystem atrophy (MSA), Huntington's chorea (HC), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), depression, and schizophrenia (SCZ).

39300699,Microbiota-gut-brain axis in health and neurological disease: Interactions between gut microbiota and the nervous system.,"Along with mounting evidence that gut microbiota and their metabolites migrate endogenously to distal organs, the 'gut-lung axis,' 'gut-brain axis,' 'gut-liver axis' and 'gut-renal axis' have been established. Multiple animal recent studies have demonstrated gut microbiota may also be a key susceptibility factor for neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and autism. The gastrointestinal tract is innervated by the extrinsic sympathetic and vagal nerves and the intrinsic enteric nervous system, and the gut microbiota interacts with the nervous system to maintain homeostatic balance in the host gut. A total of 1507 publications on the interactions between the gut microbiota, the gut-brain axis and neurological disorders are retrieved from the Web of Science to investigate the interactions between the gut microbiota and the nervous system and the underlying mechanisms involved in normal and disease states. We provide a comprehensive overview of the effects of the gut microbiota and its metabolites on nervous system function and neurotransmitter secretion, as well as alterations in the gut microbiota in neurological disorders, to provide a basis for the possibility of targeting the gut microbiota as a therapeutic agent for neurological disorders.",Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,2024,Yuhong He; Ke Wang; Niri Su; Chongshan Yuan; Naisheng Zhang; Xiaoyu Hu; Yunhe Fu; Feng Zhao
39161161,Fecal microbiota from patients with Parkinson's disease intensifies inflammation and neurodegeneration in A53T mice.,"We evaluated the potential of Parkinson's disease (PD) fecal microbiota transplantation to initiate or exacerbate PD pathologies and investigated the underlying mechanisms.We transplanted the fecal microbiota from PD patients into mice by oral gavage and assessed the motor and intestinal functions, as well as the inflammatory and pathological changes in the colon and brain. Furthermore, 16S rRNA gene sequencing combined with metabolomics analysis was conducted to assess the impacts of fecal delivery on the fecal microbiota and metabolism in recipient mice.The fecal microbiota from PD patients increased intestinal inflammation, deteriorated intestinal barrier function, intensified microglia and astrocyte activation, abnormal deposition of Î±-Synuclein, and dopaminergic neuronal loss in the brains of A53T mice. A mechanistic study revealed that the fecal microbiota of PD patients stimulated the TLR4/NF-ÎºB/NLRP3 pathway in both the brain and colon. Additionally, multiomics analysis found that transplantation of fecal microbiota from PD patients not only altered the composition of the gut microbiota but also influenced the fecal metabolic profile of the recipient mice.The fecal microbiota from PD patients intensifies inflammation and neurodegeneration in A53T mice.

38314132,"Relationship among Parkinson's disease, constipation, microbes, and microbiological therapy.","This comprehensive review elucidates the complex interplay between gut microbiota and constipation in Parkinson's disease (PD), a prevalent non-motor symptom contributing significantly to patients' morbidity. A marked alteration in the gut microbiota, predominantly an increase in the abundance of <i>Proteobacteria</i> and <i>Bacteroidetes</i>, is observed in PD-related constipation. Conventional treatments, although safe, have failed to effectively alleviate symptoms, thereby necessitating the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Microbiological interventions such as prebiotics, probiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) hold therapeutic potential. While prebiotics improve bowel movements, probiotics are effective in enhancing stool consistency and alleviating abdominal discomfort. FMT shows potential for significantly alleviating constipation symptoms by restoring gut microbiota balance in patients with PD. Despite promising developments, the causal relationship between changes in gut microbiota and PD-related constipation remains elusive, highlighting the need for further research in this expanding field.",World journal of gastroenterology,2024,Xin-Yang Yuan; Yu-Sen Chen; Zhou Liu
39317918,"Dysbiosis and fecal microbiota transplant: Contemplating progress in health, neurodegeneration and longevity.","The gut-brain axis plays an important role in mental health. The intestinal epithelial surface is colonized by billions of commensal and transitory bacteria, known as the Gut Microbiota (GM). However, potential pathogens continuously stimulate intestinal immunity when they find the place. The last two decades have witnessed several studies revealing intestinal bacteria as a key factor in the health-disease balance of the gut, as well as disease-emergent in other parts of the body. Various neurological processes, such as cognition, learning, and memory, could be affected by dysbiosis in GM. Additionally, the aging process and longevity are related to systemic inflammation caused by dysbiosis. Commensal GM affects brain development, behavior, and healthy aging suggesting that building changes in GM might be a potential therapeutic method. The innovation in GM dysbiosis is intervention by Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT), which has been confirmed as a therapy for recurrent Clostridium difficile infections and is promising for other clinical disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's disease, andÂ depression.

39064171,"The Brain-Gut Axis, an Important Player in Alzheimer and Parkinson Disease: A Narrative Review.","Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), are severe age-related disorders with complex and multifactorial causes. Recent research suggests a critical link between neurodegeneration and the gut microbiome, via the gut-brain communication pathway. This review examines the role of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a gut microbiota-derived metabolite, in the development of AD and PD, and investigates its interaction with microRNAs (miRNAs) along this bidirectional pathway. TMAO, which is produced from dietary metabolites like choline and carnitine, has been linked to increased neuroinflammation, protein misfolding, and cognitive decline. In AD, elevated TMAO levels are associated with amyloid-beta and tau pathologies, blood-brain barrier disruption, and neuronal death. TMAO can cross the blood-brain barrier and promote the aggregation of amyloid and tau proteins. Similarly, TMAO affects alpha-synuclein conformation and aggregation, a hallmark of PD. TMAO also activates pro-inflammatory pathways such as NF-kB signaling, exacerbating neuroinflammation further. Moreover, TMAO modulates the expression of various miRNAs that are involved in neurodegenerative processes. Thus, the gut microbiome-miRNA-brain axis represents a newly discovered mechanistic link between gut dysbiosis and neurodegeneration. MiRNAs regulate the key pathways involved in neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and neuronal death, contributing to disease progression. As a direct consequence, specific miRNA signatures may serve as potential biomarkers for the early detection and monitoring of AD and PD progression. This review aims to elucidate the complex interrelationships between the gut microbiota, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), microRNAs (miRNAs), and the central nervous system, and the implications of these connections in neurodegenerative diseases. In this context, an overview of the current neuroradiology techniques available for studying neuroinflammation and of the animal models used to investigate these intricate pathologies will also be provided. In summary, a bulk of evidence supports the concept that modulating the gut-brain communication pathway through dietary changes, the manipulation of the microbiome, and/or miRNA-based therapies may offer novel approaches for implementing the treatment of debilitating neurological disorders.",Journal of clinical medicine,2024,Eugenio Caradonna; Raffaello Nemni; Angelo Bifone; Patrizia Gandolfo; Lucy Costantino; Luca Giordano; Elisabetta Mormone; Anna Macula; Mariarosa Cuomo; Rossana Difruscolo; Camilla Vanoli; Emilio Vanoli; Fulvio Ferrara
38727306,From the Gut to the Brain: Is Microbiota a New Paradigm in Parkinson's Disease Treatment?,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is recognized as the second most prevalent primary chronic neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system. Clinically, PD is characterized as a movement disorder, exhibiting an incidence and mortality rate that is increasing faster than any other neurological condition. In recent years, there has been a growing interest concerning the role of the gut microbiota in the etiology and pathophysiology of PD. The establishment of a brain-gut microbiota axis is now real, with evidence denoting a bidirectional communication between the brain and the gut microbiota through metabolic, immune, neuronal, and endocrine mechanisms and pathways. Among these, the vagus nerve represents the most direct form of communication between the brain and the gut. Given the potential interactions between bacteria and drugs, it has been observed that the therapies for PD can have an impact on the composition of the microbiota. Therefore, in the scope of the present review, we will discuss the current understanding of gut microbiota on PD and whether this may be a new paradigm for treating this devastating disease.",Cells,2024,Cristiana Vilela; Bruna AraÃºjo; Carla Soares-Guedes; Rita Caridade-Silva; Joana Martins-Macedo; Catarina Teixeira; Eduardo D Gomes; Cristina PrudÃªncio; MÃ³nica Vieira; FÃ¡bio G Teixeira
38817603,The microbiota-gut-brain-immune interface in the pathogenesis of neuroinflammatory diseases: a narrative review of the emerging literature.,"Research is beginning to elucidate the sophisticated mechanisms underlying the microbiota-gut-brain-immune interface, moving from primarily animal models to human studies. Findings support the dynamic relationships between the gut microbiota as an ecosystem (microbiome) within an ecosystem (host) and its intersection with the host immune and nervous systems. Adding this to the effects on epigenetic regulation of gene expression further complicates and strengthens the response. At the heart is inflammation, which manifests in a variety of pathologies including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Multiple Sclerosis (MS).Generally, the research to date is limited and has focused on bacteria, likely due to the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of 16s rRNA sequencing, despite its lower resolution and inability to determine functional ability/alterations. However, this omits all other microbiota including fungi, viruses, and phages, which are emerging as key members of the human microbiome. Much of the research has been done in pre-clinical models and/or in small human studies in more developed parts of the world. The relationships observed are promising but cannot be considered reliable or generalizable at this time. Specifically, causal relationships cannot be determined currently. More research has been done in Alzheimer's disease, followed by Parkinson's disease, and then little in MS. The data for MS is encouraging despite this.While the research is still nascent, the microbiota-gut-brain-immune interface may be a missing link, which has hampered our progress on understanding, let alone preventing, managing, or putting into remission neurodegenerative diseases. Relationships must first be established in humans, as animal models have been shown to poorly translate to complex human physiology and environments, especially when investigating the human gut microbiome and its relationships where animal models are often overly simplistic. Only then can robust research be conducted in humans and using mechanistic model systems.",Frontiers in immunology,2024,Alison Warren; Yvonne Nyavor; Nikkia Zarabian; Aidan Mahoney; Leigh A Frame
38873926,Associations between gut microbiota characteristics and non-motor symptoms following pharmacological and surgical treatments in Parkinson's disease patients.,"The gut microbiota has been implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD), with alterations observed in microbial composition and reduced microbial species richness, which may influence gastrointestinal symptoms in PD patients. It remains to be determined whether the severity of gastrointestinal symptoms correlates with microbiota variations in PD patients treated pharmacologically or with subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) therapy. This study aims to explore how these treatments affect gut microbiota and gastrointestinal symptoms in PD, identifying specific microbial differences associated with each treatment modality.A total of 42 individuals diagnosed with PD, along with 38 age-matched household control participants, contributed stool samples for microbiota characterization. Differences in the gut microbiota across various groups of PD patients and their households were identified through comprehensive sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing.Differences in microbial communities were observed between PD patients and controls, as well as between PD patients receiving pharmacological treatment and those with STN-DBS. Pharmacologically treated advanced PD patients have higher gastrointestinal dysfunctions. Gut microbiota profile linked to STN-DBS and reduced levodopa consumption, characterized by its anti-inflammatory properties, might play a role in diminishing gastrointestinal dysfunction relative to only pharmacological treatments.Advanced PD patients on medication exhibit more gastrointestinal issues, despite relatively stable microbial diversity, indicating a complex interaction between gut microbiota, PD progression, and treatment effects. An imbalanced gut-brain axis, particularly due to reduced butyrate production, may lead to constipation by affecting the enteric nervous system, which emphasizes the need to incorporate gut microbiome insights into treatment strategies.",Neurogastroenterology and motility,2024,Agnieszka Gorecka-Mazur; Anna Krygowska-Wajs; Agata Furgala; Jiaqi Li; Benjamin Misselwitz; Wojciech Pietraszko; Borys Kwinta; Bahtiyar Yilmaz
38694925,Buty and the beast: the complex role of butyrate in Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease which is often associated with gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction. The GI tract is home to a wide range of microorganisms, among which bacteria, that can influence the host through various mechanisms. Products produced by these bacteria can act in the gut but can also exert effects in the brain via what is now well established to be the microbiota-gut-brain axis. In those with PD the gut-bacteria composition is often found to be different to that of non-PD individuals. In addition to compositional changes, the metabolic activity of the gut-microbiota is also changed in PD. Specifically, it is often reported that key producers of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) as well as the concentration of SCFAs themselves are altered in the stool and blood of those with PD. These SCFAs, among which butyrate, are essential nutrients for the host and are a major energy source for epithelial cells of the GI tract. Additionally, butyrate plays a key role in regulating various host responses particularly in relation to inflammation. Studies have demonstrated that a reduction in butyrate levels can have a critical role in the onset and progression of PD. Furthermore, it has been shown that restoring butyrate levels in those with PD through methods such as probiotics, prebiotics, sodium butyrate supplementation, and fecal transplantation can have a beneficial effect on both motor and non-motor outcomes of the disease. This review presents an overview of evidence for the altered gut-bacteria composition and corresponding metabolite production in those with PD, with a particular focus on the SCFA butyrate. In addition to presenting current studies regarding SCFA in clinical and preclinical reports, evidence for the possibility to target butyrate production using microbiome based approaches in a therapeutic context is discussed.",Frontiers in pharmacology,2024,Joshua D Elford; Nanette Becht; Johan Garssen; Aletta D Kraneveld; Paula Perez-Pardo
38449863,Protective effects of fecal microbiota transplantation against ischemic stroke and other neurological disorders: an update.,"The bidirectional communication between the gut and brain or gut-brain axis is regulated by several gut microbes and microbial derived metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids, trimethylamine N-oxide, and lipopolysaccharides. The Gut microbiota (GM) produce neuroactives, specifically neurotransmitters that modulates local and central neuronal brain functions. An imbalance between intestinal commensals and pathobionts leads to a disruption in the gut microbiota or dysbiosis, which affects intestinal barrier integrity and gut-immune and neuroimmune systems. Currently, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is recommended for the treatment of recurrent <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> infection. FMT elicits its action by ameliorating inflammatory responses through the restoration of microbial composition and functionality. Thus, FMT may be a potential therapeutic option in suppressing neuroinflammation in post-stroke conditions and other neurological disorders involving the neuroimmune axis. Specifically, FMT protects against ischemic injury by decreasing IL-17, IFN-Î³, Bax, and increasing Bcl-2 expression. Interestingly, FMT improves cognitive function by lowering amyloid-Î² accumulation and upregulating synaptic marker (PSD-95, synapsin-1) expression in Alzheimer's disease. In Parkinson's disease, FMT was shown to inhibit the expression of TLR4 and NF-ÎºB. In this review article, we have summarized the potential sources and methods of administration of FMT and its impact on neuroimmune and cognitive functions. We also provide a comprehensive update on the beneficial effects of FMT in various neurological disorders by undertaking a detailed interrogation of the preclinical and clinical published literature.",Frontiers in immunology,2024,Tousif Ahmed Hediyal; C Vichitra; Nikhilesh Anand; Mahendran Bhaskaran; Saeefh M Essa; Pravir Kumar; M Walid Qoronfleh; Mohammed Akbar; Ruchika Kaul-Ghanekar; Arehally M Mahalakshmi; Jian Yang; Byoung-Joon Song; Tanya M Monaghan; Meena Kishore Sakharkar; Saravana Babu Chidambaram
39334720,"Redox Homeostasis, Gut Microbiota, and Epigenetics in Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Systematic Review.","Neurodegenerative diseases encompass a spectrum of disorders marked by the progressive degeneration of the structure and function of the nervous system. These conditions, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Multiple sclerosis (MS), often lead to severe cognitive and motor deficits. A critical component of neurodegenerative disease pathologies is the imbalance between pro-oxidant and antioxidant mechanisms, culminating in oxidative stress. The brain's high oxygen consumption and lipid-rich environment make it particularly vulnerable to oxidative damage. Pro-oxidants such as reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are continuously generated during normal metabolism, counteracted by enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant defenses. In neurodegenerative diseases, this balance is disrupted, leading to neuronal damage. This systematic review explores the roles of oxidative stress, gut microbiota, and epigenetic modifications in neurodegenerative diseases, aiming to elucidate the interplay between these factors and identify potential therapeutic strategies. We conducted a comprehensive search of articles published in 2024 across major databases, focusing on studies examining the relationships between redox homeostasis, gut microbiota, and epigenetic changes in neurodegeneration. A total of 161 studies were included, comprising clinical trials, observational studies, and experimental research. Our findings reveal that oxidative stress plays a central role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, with gut microbiota composition and epigenetic modifications significantly influencing redox balance. Specific bacterial taxa and epigenetic markers were identified as potential modulators of oxidative stress, suggesting novel avenues for therapeutic intervention. Moreover, recent evidence from human and animal studies supports the emerging concept of targeting redox homeostasis through microbiota and epigenetic therapies. Future research should focus on validating these targets in clinical settings and exploring the potential for personalized medicine strategies based on individual microbiota and epigenetic profiles.","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2024,Constantin Munteanu; Anca Irina Galaction; Marius Turnea; Corneliu Dan Blendea; Mariana Rotariu; MÄdÄlina PoÈtaru
38227539,Gut microbiota dysbiosis contributes to Î±-synuclein-related pathology associated with C/EBPÎ²/AEP signaling activation in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease.,"JOURNAL/nrgr/04.03/01300535-202409000-00042/figure1/v/2024-01-16T170235Z/r/image-tiff Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor and gastrointestinal dysfunction. Gastrointestinal dysfunction can precede the onset of motor symptoms by several years. Gut microbiota dysbiosis is involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease, whether it plays a causal role in motor dysfunction, and the mechanism underlying this potential effect, remain unknown. CCAAT/enhancer binding protein Î²/asparagine endopeptidase (C/EBPÎ²/AEP) signaling, activated by bacterial endotoxin, can promote Î±-synuclein transcription, thereby contributing to Parkinson's disease pathology. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of the gut microbiota in C/EBPÎ²/AEP signaling, Î±-synuclein-related pathology, and motor symptoms using a rotenone-induced mouse model of Parkinson's disease combined with antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion and fecal microbiota transplantation. We found that rotenone administration resulted in gut microbiota dysbiosis and perturbation of the intestinal barrier, as well as activation of the C/EBP/AEP pathway, Î±-synuclein aggregation, and tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neuron loss in the substantia nigra in mice with motor deficits. However, treatment with rotenone did not have any of these adverse effects in mice whose gut microbiota was depleted by pretreatment with antibiotics. Importantly, we found that transplanting gut microbiota derived from mice treated with rotenone induced motor deficits, intestinal inflammation, and endotoxemia. Transplantation of fecal microbiota from healthy control mice alleviated rotenone-induced motor deficits, intestinal inflammation, endotoxemia, and intestinal barrier impairment. These results highlight the vital role that gut microbiota dysbiosis plays in inducing motor deficits, C/EBPÎ²/AEP signaling activation, and Î±-synuclein-related pathology in a rotenone-induced mouse model of Parkinson's disease. Additionally, our findings suggest that supplementing with healthy microbiota may be a safe and effective treatment that could help ameliorate the progression of motor deficits in patients with Parkinson's disease.",Neural regeneration research,2024,Xiaoli Fang; Sha Liu; Bilal Muhammad; Mingxuan Zheng; Xing Ge; Yan Xu; Shu Kan; Yang Zhang; Yinghua Yu; Kuiyang Zheng; Deqin Geng; Chun-Feng Liu
38840699,Correlation between dietary factors and Parkinson's disease revealed by the analysis of Mendelian randomization.,"The intricate interplay between dietary habits and the development of Parkinson's Disease (PD) has long been a subject of scientific inquiry. Mendelian Randomization (MR) emerges as a potent tool, harnessing genetic variants to infer causality in observational data. While evidence links diet to Parkinson's Disease (PD) etiology, a thorough MR exploration of dietary impacts on PD, particularly involving gut microbiota, is still emerging.This research leverages the IEU Open GWAS project's vast GWAS database to address the knowledge gap in understanding diet's influence on PD, employing a diverse range of dietary variables. Our holistic dataset includes various foods like processed fava beans, bap, red wine, to cheese, reflecting a commitment to untangling dietary complexities in PD etiology. Advancing from initial dietary-PD associations, we innovatively explore the gut microbiota, focusing on <i>Parabacteroides goldsteinii,</i> in relation to bap intake and PD, employing MR. Utilizing weighted median, MR-Egger, and inverse variance weighting methods, we ensure rigorous causality assessments, meticulously mitigating pleiotropy and heterogeneity biases to uphold finding validity.Our findings indicate red wine (OR: 1.031; 95% CI 1.001-1.062; <i>p</i>â=â0.044) and dried fruit consumption (OR: 2.019; 95% CI 1.052-3.875; <i>p</i>â=â0.035) correlate with increased PD risk, whereas broad beans (OR: 0.967; 95% CI 0.939-0.996; <i>p</i>â=â0.024) and bap intake (OR: 0.922; 95% CI 0.860-0.989; <i>p</i>â=â0.023) show protective effects against PD. Employing MR, specifically the IVW method, revealed a significant inverse association between bap intake and gut microbiota, marked by an 8.010-fold decrease in <i>Parabacteroides goldsteinii</i> per standard deviation increase in bap intake (95% CI 1.005-63.818, <i>p</i>â=â0.049). Furthermore, a connection between PD and <i>Parabacteroides goldsteinii</i> was observed (OR: 0.810; 95% CI 0.768-0.999; <i>p</i>â=â0.049), suggesting a potential microbiota-mediated pathway in PD etiology.Our study links dietary habits to PD risk, showing higher PD risk with red wine and dried fruit consumption, and a protective effect from broad beans and bap. Using MR, we found bap intake inversely correlates with <i>Parabacteroides goldsteinii</i> in the gut, suggesting bap influences microbiota. Further, higher <i>Parabacteroides goldsteinii</i> levels correlate with lower PD risk, highlighting a complex interplay of diet, gut microbiome, and neurological health. These insights shed light on potential dietary interventions for PD.",Frontiers in nutrition,2024,Shan Zeng; Aishanjiang Yusufujiang; Chunli Zhang; Chen Yang; Hongyan Li
38957302,Mild cognitive impairment and microbiota: what is known and future perspectives.,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a heterogeneous condition definable as the intermediate clinical state between normal aging and dementia. As a pre-dementia condition, there is a recent growing interest in the identification of non-invasive markers able to predict the progression from MCI to a more advanced stage of the disease. Previous evidence showed the close link between gut microbiota and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Conversely, the actual relationship between gut microbiota and MCI is yet to be clarified. In this work, we provide an overview about the current knowledge regarding the role of gut microbiota in the context of MCI, also assessing the potential for microbiota-targeted therapies. Through the review of the most recent studies focusing on this topic, we found evidence of an increase of Bacteroidetes at phylum level and Bacteroides at genus level in MCI subjects with respect to healthy controls and patients with AD. Despite such initial evidence, the definitive identification of a typical microbiota profile associated with MCI is still far from being achieved. These preliminary results, however, are growingly encouraging research on the role of gut microbiota modulation in improving the cognitive status of pre-dementia subjects. To date, few studies evaluated the role of probiotics in MCI subjects, and they showed favorable results, although still biased by small sample size, heterogeneity of study design and short follow-up.",Frontiers in medicine,2024,Antonella Gallo; Anna Maria Martone; Rosa Liperoti; Maria Camilla Cipriani; Francesca Ibba; Sara Camilli; Fiammetta Maria Rognoni; Francesco Landi; Massimo Montalto
38773112,Meta-analysis of shotgun sequencing of gut microbiota in Parkinson's disease.,"We aimed to identify gut microbial features in Parkinson's disease (PD) across countries by meta-analyzing our fecal shotgun sequencing dataset of 94 PD patients and 73 controls in Japan with five previously reported datasets from USA, Germany, China1, China2, and Taiwan. GC-MS and LC-MS/MS assays were established to quantify fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and fecal polyamines, respectively. Î±-Diversity was increased in PD across six datasets. Taxonomic analysis showed that species Akkermansia muciniphila was increased in PD, while species Roseburia intestinalis and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were decreased in PD. Pathway analysis showed that genes in the biosyntheses of riboflavin and biotin were markedly decreased in PD after adjusting for confounding factors. Five out of six categories in carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) were decreased in PD. Metabolomic analysis of our fecal samples revealed that fecal SCFAs and polyamines were significantly decreased in PD. Genes in the riboflavin and biotin biosyntheses were positively correlated with the fecal concentrations of SCFAs and polyamines. Bacteria that accounted for the decreased riboflavin biosynthesis in Japan, the USA, and Germany were different from those in China1, China2, and Taiwan. Similarly, different bacteria accounted for decreased biotin biosynthesis in the two country groups. We postulate that decreased SCFAs and polyamines reduce the intestinal mucus layer, which subsequently facilitates the formation of abnormal Î±-synuclein fibrils in the intestinal neural plexus in PD, and also cause neuroinflammation in PD.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2024,Hiroshi Nishiwaki; Jun Ueyama; Mikako Ito; Tomonari Hamaguchi; Keiichi Takimoto; Tetsuya Maeda; Kenichi Kashihara; Yoshio Tsuboi; Hiroshi Mori; Ken Kurokawa; Masahisa Katsuno; Masaaki Hirayama; Kinji Ohno
39377830,Gut-Brain Axis and Neuroinflammation: The Role of Gut Permeability and the Kynurenine Pathway in Neurological Disorders.,"The increasing prevalence of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and multiple sclerosis presents a significant global health challenge. Despite extensive research, the precise mechanisms underlying these conditions remain elusive, with current treatments primarily addressing symptoms rather than root causes. Emerging evidence suggests that gut permeability and the kynurenine pathway are involved in the pathogenesis of these neurological conditions, offering promising targets for novel therapeutic and preventive strategies. Gut permeability refers to the intestinal lining's ability to selectively allow essential nutrients into the bloodstream while blocking harmful substances. Various factors, including poor diet, stress, infections, and genetic predispositions, can compromise gut integrity, leading to increased permeability. This condition facilitates the translocation of toxins and bacteria into systemic circulation, triggering widespread inflammation that impacts neurological health via the gut-brain axis. The gut-brain axis (GBA) is a complex communication network between the gut and the central nervous system. Dysbiosis, an imbalance in the gut microbiota, can increase gut permeability and systemic inflammation, exacerbating neuroinflammation-a key factor in neurological disorders. The kynurenine pathway, the primary route for tryptophan metabolism, is significantly implicated in this process. Dysregulation of the kynurenine pathway in the context of inflammation leads to the production of neurotoxic metabolites, such as quinolinic acid, which contribute to neuronal damage and the progression of neurological disorders. This narrative review highlights the potential and progress in understanding these mechanisms. Interventions targeting the kynurenine pathway and maintaining a balanced gut microbiota through diet, probiotics, and lifestyle modifications show promise in reducing neuroinflammation and supporting brain health. In addition, pharmacological approaches aimed at modulating the kynurenine pathway directly, such as inhibitors of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, offer potential avenues for new treatments. Understanding and targeting these interconnected pathways are crucial for developing effective strategies to prevent and manage neurological disorders.",Cellular and molecular neurobiology,2024,Rowan Kearns
39071627,Gut-brain axis: A cutting-edge approach to target neurological disorders and potential synbiotic application.,"The microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) represents a sophisticated communication network between the brain and the gut, involving immunological, endocrinological, and neural mediators. This bidirectional interaction is facilitated through the vagus nerve, sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers, and is regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Evidence shows that alterations in gut microbiota composition, or dysbiosis, significantly impact neurological disorders (NDs) like anxiety, depression, autism, Parkinson's disease (PD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Dysbiosis can affect the central nervous system (CNS) via neuroinflammation and microglial activation, highlighting the importance of the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) in disease pathogenesis. The microbiota influences the immune system by modulating chemokines and cytokines, impacting neuronal health. Synbiotics have shown promise in treating NDs by enhancing cognitive function and reducing inflammation. The gut microbiota's role in producing neurotransmitters and neuroactive compounds, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), is critical for CNS homeostasis. Therapeutic interventions targeting the MGBA, including dietary modulation and synbiotic supplementation, offer potential benefits for managing neurodegenerative disorders.

39449004,Gut-first Parkinson's disease is encoded by gut dysbiome.,"In Parkinson's patients, intestinal dysbiosis can occur years before clinical diagnosis, implicating the gut and its microbiota in the disease. Recent evidence suggests the gut microbiota may trigger body-first Parkinson Disease (PD), yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aims to elucidate how a dysbiotic microbiome through intestinal immune alterations triggers PD-related neurodegeneration.To determine the impact of gut dysbiosis on the development and progression of PD pathology, wild-type male C57BL/6 mice were transplanted with fecal material from PD patients and age-matched healthy donors to challenge the gut-immune-brain axis.This study demonstrates that patient-derived intestinal microbiota caused midbrain tyrosine hydroxylase positive (THâ+) cell loss and motor dysfunction. Ileum-associated microbiota remodeling correlates with a decrease in Th17 homeostatic cells. This event led to an increase in gut inflammation and intestinal barrier disruption. In this regard, we found a decrease in CD4â+âcells and an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines in the blood of PD transplanted mice that could contribute to an increase in the permeabilization of the blood-brain-barrier, observed by an increase in mesencephalic Ig-G-positive microvascular leaks and by an increase of mesencephalic IL-17 levels, compatible with systemic inflammation. Furthermore, alpha-synuclein aggregates can spread caudo-rostrally, causing fragmentation of neuronal mitochondria. This mitochondrial damage subsequently activates innate immune responses in neurons and triggers microglial activation.We propose that the dysbiotic gut microbiome (dysbiome) in PD can disrupt a healthy microbiome and Th17 homeostatic immunity in the ileum mucosa, leading to a cascade effect that propagates to the brain, ultimately contributing to PD pathophysiology. Our landmark study has successfully identified new peripheral biomarkers that could be used to develop highly effective strategies to prevent the progression of PD into the brain.",Molecular neurodegeneration,2024,MÃ¡rio F Munoz-Pinto; Emanuel Candeias; InÃªs Melo-Marques; A Raquel Esteves; Ana Maranha; JoÃ£o D MagalhÃ£es; Diogo Reis Carneiro; Mariana Sant'Anna; A Raquel Pereira-Santos; AntÃ³nio E Abreu; Daniela Nunes-Costa; Susana Alarico; Igor Tiago; Ana Morgadinho; JoÃ£o Lemos; Pedro N Figueiredo; Cristina JanuÃ¡rio; Nuno Empadinhas; Sandra Morais Cardoso
36200211,Targeting Gut Dysbiosis and Microbiome Metabolites for the Development of Therapeutic Modalities for Neurological Disorders.,"The gut microbiota, composed of numerous species of microbes, works in synergy with the various organ systems in the body to bolster our overall health and well-being. The most well-known function of the gut microbiome is to facilitate the metabolism and absorption of crucial nutrients, such as complex carbohydrates, while also generating vitamins. In addition, the gut microbiome plays a crucial role in regulating the functioning of the central nervous system (CNS). Host genetics, including specific genes and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), have been implicated in the pathophysiology of neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The gut microbiome dysbiosis also plays a role in the pathogenesis of these neurodegenerative disorders, thus perturbing the gut-brain axis. Overproduction of certain metabolites synthesized by the gut microbiome, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and p-cresyl sulfate, are known to interfere with microglial function and trigger misfolding of alpha-synuclein protein, which can build up inside neurons and cause damage. By determining the association of the gut microbiome and its metabolites with various diseases, such as neurological disorders, future research will pave the way for the development of effective preventive and treatment modalities.",Current neuropharmacology,2024,Matthew D Wiefels; Emily Furar; Rebecca S Eshraghi; Jeenu Mittal; Idil Memis; Moeed Moosa; Rahul Mittal; Adrien A Eshraghi
38265387,"Bridging the Mind and Gut: Uncovering the Intricacies of Neurotransmitters, Neuropeptides, and their Influence on Neuropsychiatric Disorders.","The gut-brain axis (GBA) is a bidirectional signaling channel that facilitates communication between the gastrointestinal tract and the brain. Recent research on the gut-brain axis demonstrates that this connection enables the brain to influence gut function, which in turn influences the brain and its cognitive functioning. It is well established that malfunctioning of this axis adversely affects both systems' ability to operate effectively.Dysfunctions in the GBA have been associated with disorders of gut motility and permeability, intestinal inflammation, indigestion, constipation, diarrhea, IBS, and IBD, as well as neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders like depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, autism, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease. Multiple research initiatives have shown that the gut microbiota, in particular, plays a crucial role in the GBA by participating in the regulation of a number of key neurochemicals that are known to have significant effects on the mental and physical well-being of an individual.Several studies have investigated the relationship between neuropsychiatric disorders and imbalances or disturbances in the metabolism of neurochemicals, often leading to concomitant gastrointestinal issues and modifications in gut flora composition. The interaction between neurological diseases and gut microbiota has been a focal point within this research. The novel therapeutic interventions in neuropsychiatric conditions involving interventions such as probiotics, prebiotics, and dietary modifications are outlined in this review.The findings of multiple studies carried out on mice show that modulating and monitoring gut microbiota can help treat symptoms of such diseases, which raises the possibility of the use of probiotics, prebiotics, and even dietary changes as part of a new treatment strategy for neuropsychiatric disorders and their symptoms.The bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain through the gut-brain axis has revealed profound implications for both gastrointestinal and neurological health. Malfunctions in this axis have been connected to a range of disorders affecting gut function as well as cognitive and neuropsychiatric well-being. The emerging understanding of the role of gut microbiota in regulating key neurochemicals opens up possibilities for novel treatment approaches for conditions like depression, anxiety, and neurodegenerative diseases.",Central nervous system agents in medicinal chemistry,2024,Saumya Gupta; Susha Dinesh; Sameer Sharma
38965287,A neurotherapeutic approach with Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus E9 on gut microbiota and intestinal barrier in MPTP-induced mouse model of Parkinson's disease.,"The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in neural development and progression of neural disorders like Parkinson's disease (PD). Probiotics have been suggested to impact neurodegenerative diseases via gut-brain axis. This study aims to investigate the therapeutic potential of Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus E9, a high exopolysaccharide producer, on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine(MPTP)-induced mouse model of PD. C57BL/6 mice subjected to MPTP were fed L. rhamnosus E9 for fifteen days and sacrificed after the last administration. Motor functions were determined by open-field, catalepsy, and wire-hanging tests. The ileum and the brain tissues were collected for ELISA, qPCR, and immunohistochemistry analyses. The cecum content was obtained for microbiota analysis. E9 supplementation alleviated MPTP-induced motor dysfunctions accompanied by decreased levels of striatal TH and dopamine. E9 also reduced the level of ROS in the striatum and decreased the DAT expression while increasing the DR1. Furthermore, E9 improved intestinal integrity by enhancing ZO-1 and Occludin levels and reversed the dysbiosis of the gut microbiota induced by MPTP. In conclusion, E9 supplementation improved the MPTP-induced motor deficits and neural damage as well as intestinal barrier by modulating the gut microbiota in PD mice. These findings suggest that E9 supplementation holds therapeutic potential in managing PD through the gut-brain axis.",Scientific reports,2024,Busra Aktas; Belma Aslim; Deniz Ates Ozdemir
39042202,Semaglutide Attenuates Anxious and Depressive-Like Behaviors and Reverses the Cognitive Impairment in a Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Mouse Model Via the Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis.,"Newly conducted research suggests that metabolic disorders, like diabetes and obesity, play a significant role as risk factors for psychiatric disorders. This connection presents a potential avenue for creating novel antidepressant medications by repurposing drugs originally developed to address antidiabetic conditions. Earlier investigations have shown that GLP-1 (Glucagon-like Peptide-1) analogs exhibit neuroprotective qualities in various models of neurological diseases, encompassing conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and stroke. Moreover, GLP-1 analogs have demonstrated the capability to enhance neurogenesis, a process recognized for its significance in memory formation and the cognitive and emotional aspects of information processing. Nonetheless, whether semaglutide holds efficacy as both an antidepressant and anxiolytic agent remains uncertain. To address this, our study focused on a mouse model of depression linked to type 2 diabetes induced by a High Fat Diet (HFD). In this model, we administered semaglutide (0.05Â mg/Kg intraperitoneally) on a weekly basis to evaluate its potential as a therapeutic option for depression and anxiety. Diabetic mice had higher blood glucose, lipidic profile, and insulin resistance. Moreover, mice fed HFD showed higher serum interleukin (IL)-1Î² and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) associated with impaired humor and cognition. The analysis of behavioral responses revealed that the administration of semaglutide effectively mitigated depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors, concurrently demonstrating an enhancement in cognitive function. Additionally, semaglutide treatment protected synaptic plasticity and reversed the hippocampal neuroinflammation induced by HFD fed, improving activation of the insulin pathway, demonstrating the protective effects of semaglutide. We also found that semaglutide treatment decreased astrogliosis and microgliosis in the dentate gyrus region of the hippocampus. In addition, semaglutide prevented the DM2-induced impairments of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), and G-protein-coupled receptor 43 (GPR43) and simultaneously increased the NeuNâ+âand Glucagon-like Peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R+) neurons in the hippocampus. Our data also showed that semaglutide increased the serotonin (5-HT) and serotonin transporter (5-HTT) and glutamatergic receptors in the hippocampus. At last, semaglutide changed the gut microbiota profile (increasing Bacterioidetes, Bacteroides acidifaciens, and Blautia coccoides) and decreased leaky gut, improving the gut-brain axis. Taken together, semaglutide has the potential to act as a therapeutic tool for depression and anxiety.",Journal of neuroimmune pharmacology : the official journal of the Society on NeuroImmune Pharmacology,2024,Igor Henrique Rodrigues de Paiva; Rodrigo Soares da Silva; Ingrid Prata MendonÃ§a; JosÃ© Roberto Botelho de Souza; Christina Alves Peixoto
39189380,"Allantoin ameliorates dopaminergic neuronal damage in MPTP-induced Parkinson's disease mice <i>via</i> regulating oxidative damage, inflammation, and gut microbiota disorder.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic progressive neurodegenerative disease that often occurs in older people. Neuroinflammation and oxidative stress are important factors in the development of PD. Gastrointestinal dysfunction is the most common non-motor symptom, and inflammation of the gut, which activates the gut-brain axis, maybe a pathogenic factor. Previous studies have attributed anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects to Allantoin, but its function and mechanism of action in PD are unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effect and mechanism of Allantoin on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD in mice. Our results showed that Allantoin administration ameliorated motor dysfunction and neuronal damage in mice injected with MPTP by inhibiting neuroinflammation and oxidative damage. Mechanistic studies showed that Allantoin suppresses inflammatory responses by inhibiting the overactivation of the NF-ÎºB and MAPK signaling pathways, as well as oxidative stress by regulating the AKT/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. Notably, Allantoin also restored intestinal barrier function by modulating the gut microbiota and improving antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacities to alleviate MPTP-induced motor deficits. In conclusion, the present study shows that the administration of Allantoin attenuated neurodegeneration in mice injected with MPTP by inhibiting neuroinflammation and oxidative stress and modulating the composition of the gut microbiome.",Food & function,2024,Shuo Yang; Xiaojia Sun; Dianfeng Liu; Yiming Zhang; Xiyu Gao; Jiangmei He; Mingchi Cui; Shoupeng Fu; Dewei He

PD and IBD show similarities in epidemiology, genetics, immune response, and gut microbiota. Here, we review the pathophysiology of these two diseases, including genetic factors, immune system imbalance, changes in gut microbial composition, and the effects of microbial metabolites (especially short-chain fatty acids). We elaborate on the gut-brain axis, focusing on role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of PD and IBD. In addition, we discuss several therapeutic strategies, including drug therapy, fecal microbiota transplantation, and probiotic supplementation, and their potential benefits in regulating intestinal microecology and relieving disease symptoms. Our analysis will provide a new understanding and scientific basis for the development of more effective therapeutic strategies for these diseases.",Frontiers in neurology,2024,Zhang Wanyi; Yan Jiao; Huang Wen; Xu Bin; Wang Xuefei; Jiang Lan; Zhou Liuyin
39070266,Gut microbiota from patients with Parkinson's disease causes motor deficits in honeybees.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is possibly caused by genetic factors, environmental factors, and gut microbiota dysbiosis. This study aims to explore whether the microbiota contributes to the behavior abnormalities of PD.We transplanted gut microbiota from patients with PD or healthy controls (HC) into microbiota-free honeybees. We also established two more groups, namely the rotenone (ROT) group, in which PD-like symptoms of honeybees were induced by rotenone, and the conventional (CV) group, in which honeybees were colonized with conventional gut microbiota. The climbing assay was performed to assess the motor capabilities of honeybees. Histopathological examination was conducted to evaluate the integrity of gut mucosa. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene expression levels and dopamine (DA) concentrations in the brain were also examined. Additionally, metagenomics and full-length 16S rRNA analyses were performed to identify alterations in gut microbiota profiles, both in PD patients and honeybees.Honeybees in the PD and ROT groups exhibited slower climbing speeds, downregulated TH gene expression, and impaired gut barriers. Both the HC and PD groups of honeybees successfully harbored a portion of gut microbiota from corresponding human donors, and differences in microbial composition were identified. <i>Morganella morganii</i> and <i>Erysipelatoclostridium ramosum</i> exhibited significantly increased relative abundance in the HC group, while <i>Dorea longicatena</i>, <i>Collinsella aerofaciens</i>, <i>Lactococcus garvieae</i>, <i>Holdemanella biformis</i>, <i>Gemmiger formicilis</i>, and <i>Blautia obeum</i> showed significantly increased relative abundance in the PD group. Functional predictions of microbial communities in the PD group indicated an increased synthesis of hydrogen sulfide and methane.A novel PD model was induced in honeybees with rotenone and gut microbiota from PD patients. This study linked PD-related behaviors to altered gut microbiota, highlighting a potential gut microbiota-brain axis involvement in PD pathogenesis. We identify previously unrecognized associations of <i>Dorea longicatena</i>, <i>Collinsella aerofaciens</i>, <i>Lactococcus garvieae</i>, <i>Holdemanella biformis</i>, <i>Gemmiger formicilis</i>, and <i>Blautia obeum</i> with PD. Additionally, pathways related to hydrogen sulfide and methane synthesis have been previously suggested as potential contributors to the development of PD, and our research further supports this hypothesis.",Frontiers in microbiology,2024,Jiaqi Zeng; Yiyuan Li; Jingshuang Yan; Ruqi Chang; Mengqi Xu; Guanzhou Zhou; Jie Meng; Di Liu; Zhiqi Mao; Yunsheng Yang
39065820,Sika Deer Velvet Antler Peptide Exerts Neuroprotective Effect in a Parkinson's Disease Model via Regulating Oxidative Damage and Gut Microbiota.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder globally. Recognizing the potential of velvet antler in the nervous system, as shown in numerous studies, this research was aimed at evaluating the neuroprotective effects of Sika Deer velvet antler peptide (VAP), along with the underlying mechanisms in neurotoxin-induced PD models. Initially, a peptidomic analysis of the VAP, which comprised 189 varieties of peptides, was conducted using LC-MS. Nine sequences were identified as significant using Proteome Discoverer 2.5 software. In a cellular model of PD, where PC12 cells are treated with the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP<sup>+</sup>), the administration of the VAP reduced the cell damage and apoptosis induced by MPP<sup>+</sup>. This protective effect was associated with a decrease in oxidative stress. This protective mechanism was found to be mediated through the activation of the SIRT1-dependent Akt/Nrf2/HO-1-signaling pathway. In animal models, specifically in mice with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD, the administration of the VAP effectively reduced the dopaminergic neuron damage and reversed the neurobehavioral deficits. They also diminished microglia activation and apoptosis, all without any noticeable adverse effects. Additionally, the VAP was observed to beneficially alter the gut microbiota, as marked by an increase in the abundances of <i>Prevotellaceae</i>, <i>Helicobacteraceae</i>, and <i>Prevotella</i>. These findings suggest that VAP exerts its neuroprotective effect against neurodegeneration by inhibiting oxidative stress and modulating gut microbiota.","Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)",2024,Ying Liu; Hongyuan Li; Min Yang; Jia Guo; Zepeng Sun; Shuyue Wang; Ru Li; Xin Pang; Yumi Kim; Xiaohui Wang; Yinghua Peng

39078158,Meta-analysis of the human gut microbiome uncovers shared and distinct microbial signatures between diseases.,"Microbiome studies have revealed gut microbiota's potential impact on complex diseases. However, many studies often focus on one disease per cohort. We developed a meta-analysis workflow for gut microbiome profiles and analyzed shotgun metagenomic data covering 11 diseases. Using interpretable machine learning and differential abundance analysis, our findings reinforce the generalization of binary classifiers for Crohn's disease (CD) and colorectal cancer (CRC) to hold-out cohorts and highlight the key microbes driving these classifications. We identified high microbial similarity in disease pairs like CD vs ulcerative colitis (UC), CD vs CRC, Parkinson's disease vs type 2 diabetes (T2D), and schizophrenia vs T2D. We also found strong inverse correlations in Alzheimer's disease vs CD and UC. These findings, detected by our pipeline, provide valuable insights into these diseases.Assessing disease similarity is an essential initial step preceding a disease-based approach for drug repositioning. Our study provides a modest first step in underscoring the potential of integrating microbiome insights into the disease similarity assessment. Recent microbiome research has predominantly focused on analyzing individual diseases to understand their unique characteristics, which by design excludes comorbidities in individuals. We analyzed shotgun metagenomic data from existing studies and identified previously unknown similarities between diseases. Our research represents a pioneering effort that utilizes both interpretable machine learning and differential abundance analysis to assess microbial similarity between diseases.",mSystems,2024,Dong-Min Jin; James T Morton; Richard Bonneau
38450172,Electroacupuncture at ST25 corrected gut microbial dysbiosis and SNpc lipid peroxidation in Parkinson's disease rats.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) remains one kind of a complex, progressive neurodegenerative disease. Levodopa and dopamine agonists as widely utilized PD therapeutics have not shown significant positive long-term outcomes. Emerging evidences indicate that electroacupuncture (EA) have potential effects on the therapy of nervous system disorders, particularly PD, but its specific underlying mechanism(s) remains poorly understood, leading to the great challenge of clinical application and management. Previous study has shown that acupuncture ameliorates PD motor symptoms and dopaminergic neuron damage by modulating intestinal dysbiosis, but its intermediate pathway has not been sufficiently investigated.A rat model of PD was induced using rotenone. The therapeutic effect of EA on PD was assessed using the pole and rotarod tests and immunohistostaining for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the substantia nigra (SN) of brain. The role of gut microbiota was explored using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metabonomic analysis. PICRUSt2 analysis, lipidomic analysis, LPS and inflammatory factor assays were used for subsequent exploration and validation. Correlation analysis was used to identify the key bacteria that EA regulates lipid metabolism to improve PD.The present study firstly reappeared the effects of EA on protecting motor function and dopaminergic neurons and modulation of gut microbial dysbiosis in rotenone-induced PD rat model. EA improved motor dysfunction (via the pole and rotarod tests) and protected TH+ neurons in PD rats. EA increased the abundance of beneficial bacteria such as Lactobacillus, Dubosiella and Bifidobacterium and decreased the abundance of Escherichia-Shigella and Morganella belonging to Pseudomonadota, suggesting that the modulation of gut microbiota by EA improving the symptoms of PD motility via alleviating LPS-induced inflammatory response and oxidative stress, which was also validated by various aspects such as microbial gene functional analysis, fecal metabolomics analysis, LPS and inflammatory factor assays and SNpc lipidomics analysis. Moreover, correlation analyses also verified strong correlations of Escherichia-Shigella and Morganella with motor symptoms and SNpc lipid peroxidation, explicating targets and intermediate pathways through which EA improve PD exercise symptom.Our results indicate that the improvement of motor function in PD model by EA may be mediated in part by restoring the gut microbiota, which intermediate processes involve circulating endotoxins and inflammatory mediators, SNpc oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. The gut-microbiome - brain axis may be a potential mechanism of EA treatment for the PD.",Frontiers in microbiology,2024,Xuan-Ming Hu; Li-Zhe-Xiong Song; Zhi-Zi Zhang; Xi Ruan; Hai-Chang Li; Zhi Yu; Lin Huang
39417117,Toxic Metals Impact Gut Microbiota and Metabolic Risk in Five African-Origin Populations.,"Exposure to toxic metals impacts obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) risk. Yet, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Gut microbiota has been strongly associated with progression of cardiometabolic risk. To determine whether high metal exposures and gut dysbiosis interact to promote metabolic dysregulation and cardiometabolic risk, we assessed relationships between these factors. We analyzed cross-sectional associations between arsenic, lead, mercury, cadmium, and cardiometabolic health markers in 178 randomly selected African-origin adults (52% female, 51% obese, mean age=43.0Â±6.4 years) from Ghana, South Africa, Seychelles, Jamaica, and USA. Metal levels were dichotomized to high or low at the median level of each metal. We analyzed associations between gut microbiome taxa, metal levels, clinical measures (BMI, fasting blood glucose, and blood pressure) and diagnoses (hypertension, obesity, and diabetes status). High vs. low lead and arsenic exposures had a significant effect on beta diversity (p <0.05). 71 taxa were associated with high lead levels: 30 with elevated BMI, 22 with T2DM, and 23 with elevated fasting blood glucose (p<0.05). 115 taxa were associated with high arsenic levels: 32 with elevated BMI, 33 with T2DM, and 26 with elevated blood glucose (p<0.05). Of the taxa associated with high lead and arsenic exposure and either elevated BMI or fasting blood glucose, porphyrin metabolism was the most enriched metabolic pathway. These data collectively provide the first findings in a human study that the gut microbiome may drive the association between lead and arsenic exposure and obesity and T2DM risk.",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,2024,Julianne A Jorgensen; Candice Choo-Kang; Luyu Wang; Lina Issa; Jack A Gilbert; Gertrude Ecklu-Mensah; Amy Luke; Kweku Bedu-Addo; Terrence Forrester; Pascal Bovet; Estelle V Lambert; Dale Rae; Maria Argos; Tanika N Kelly; Robert M Sargis; Lara R Dugas; Yang Dai; Brian T Layden

EA has shown anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. Here, we aim to explore whether EA can treat Parkinson's disease by restoring the intestinal barrier and modulating NLRP3 inflammasome. We applied 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to establish a PD mouse model and EA at the GV16, LR3, and ST36 for 12 consecutive days. The open-field test results indicated that EA alleviated depression and behavioral defects, upregulated the expressions of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and blocked the accumulation of Î±-synuclein (Î±-syn) in the midbrain. Moreover, EA blocked the damage to intestinal tissues of PD mice, indicative of suppressed NLRP3 inflammasome activation and increased gut barrier integrity. Notably, the antibiotic-treated mouse experiment validated that the gut microbiota was critical in alleviating PD dyskinesia and intestinal inflammation by EA. In conclusion, this study suggested that EA exhibited a protective effect against MPTP-induced PD by alleviating behavioral defects, reversing the block of motor dysfunction, and improving the gut barrier by modulating intestinal NLRP3 inflammasome.

38447734,Melatonin mitigates manganese-induced neural damage via modulation of gut microbiota-metabolism in mice.,"Manganese (Mn), a common environmental and occupational risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD), can cause central nervous system damage and gastrointestinal dysfunction. The melatonin has been shown to effectively improve neural damage and intestinal microbiota disturbances in animal models. This research investigated the mechanism by which exogenous melatonin prevented Mn-induced neurogenesis impairment and neural damage. Here, we established subchronic Mn-exposed mice model and melatonin supplement tests to evaluate the role of melatonin in alleviating Mn-induced neurogenesis impairment. Mn induced neurogenesis impairment and microglia overactivation, behavioral dysfunction, gut microbiota dysbiosis and serum metabolic disorder in mice. All these events were reversed with the melatonin supplement. The behavioral tests revealed that melatonin group showed approximately 30Â % restoration of motor activity. According to quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) results, melatonin group showed remarkable restoration of the expression of dopamine neurons and neurogenesis markers, approximately 46.4Â % (TH), 68.4Â % (DCX in hippocampus) and 48Â % (DCX in striatum), respectively. Interestingly, melatonin increased neurogenesis probably via the gut microbiota and metabolism modulation. The correlation analysis of differentially expressed genes associated with hippocampal neurogenesis indicated that Firmicutes-lipid metabolism might mediate the critical repair role of melatonin in neurogenesis in Mn-exposed mice. In conclusion, exogenous melatonin supplementation can promote neurogenesis, and restore neuron loss and neural function in Mn-exposed mice, and the multi-omics results provide new research ideas for future mechanistic studies.",The Science of the total environment,2024,Weifeng He; Xueting Wang; Xin Yang; Gaoman Zhang; Junrou Zhang; Li Chen; Piye Niu; Tian Chen

Additionally, by employing a two-step MR approach, we assessed the impact of gut microbiota on PD development via immune characteristics and quantified HLA-DR mediation effect on plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs).We discovered significant associations between PD and microbiota, comprising one class, one order, two families, and two genera. Furthermore, we explored the extent to which HLA-DR on pDCs mediates the effect of Butyrivibrio gut microbiota on PD.Our study emphasizes the complex interactions between the gut microbiota, immune characteristics, and PD.

39173756,Fecal microbiome transplantation alleviates manganese-induced neurotoxicity by altering the composition and function of the gut microbiota via the cGAS-STING/NLRP3 pathway.,"Manganese (Mn) is an environmental pollutant, and overexposure can cause neurodegenerative disorders similar to Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease that are characterized by Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) overexpression, Tau hyperphosphorylation and neuroinflammation. However, the mechanisms of Mn neurotoxicity are not clearly defined. In our study, a knockout mouse model of Mn exposure combined with gut flora-induced neurotoxicity was constructed to investigate the effect of gut flora on Mn neurotoxicity. The results showed that the levels of Tau, p-Tau and AÎ² in the hippocampus of C57BL/6 mice were greater than those in the hippocampus of control mice after 5Â weeks of continuous exposure to manganese chloride (Mn content of 200Â mg/L). Transplanted normal and healthy fecal microbiota from mice significantly downregulated Tau, p-Tau and AÎ² expression and ameliorated brain pathology. Moreover, Mn exposure activated the cGAS-STING pathway and altered the cecal microbiota profile, characterized by an increase in Clostridiales, Pseudoflavonifractor, Ligilactobacillus and Desulfovibrio, and a decrease in Anaerotruncus, Eubacterium_ruminantium_group, Fusimonas and Firmicutes, While fecal microbiome transplantation (FMT) treatment inhibited this pathway and restored the microbiota profile. FMT alleviated Mn exposure-induced neurotoxicity by inhibiting activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome triggered by overactivation of the cGAS-STING pathway. Deletion of the cGAS and STING genes and FMT altered the gut microbiota composition and its predictive function. Phenotypic prediction revealed that FMT markedly decreased the abundances of anaerobic and stress-tolerant bacteria and significantly increased the abundances of facultative anaerobic bacteria and biofilm-forming bacteria after blocking the cGAS-STING pathway compared to the Mn-exposed group. FMT from normal and healthy mice ameliorated the neurotoxicity of Mn exposure, possibly through alterations in the composition and function of the microbiome associated with the cGAS-STING/NLRP3 pathway. This study provides a prospective direction for future research on the mechanism of Mn neurotoxicity.",The Science of the total environment,2024,Jingjing Liu; Zhimin Zhang; Shiyin Zhong; Xin Zhang; Jirui Yang; Qiongli Zhou; Diya Wang; Xuhong Chang; Hui Wang
39043489,Evolving insights into erythrocytes in synucleinopathies.,"Synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple system atrophy (MSA), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), are characterized by neuronal loss accompanied by Î±-synuclein (Î±-syn) accumulation in the brain. While research conventionally focused on brain pathology, there is growing interest in peripheral alterations. Erythrocytes, which are rich in Î±-syn, have emerged as a compelling site for synucleinopathies-related alterations. Erythrocyte-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs), containing pathological Î±-syn species, can traverse the blood-brain barrier (BBB) under certain conditions and the gastrointestinal tract, where Î±-syn and gut microbiota interact extensively. This review explores the accumulating evidence of erythrocyte involvement in synucleinopathies, as well as their potential in disease pathogenesis and diagnosis. Given their unique properties, erythrocytes and erythrocyte-derived EVs may also serve as an ideal therapeutic platform for treating synucleinopathies and beyond.",Trends in neurosciences,2024,Ying Yang; Xiaoqian Nie; Yajie Wang; Jie Sun; Xiaofei Gao; Jing Zhang
38399728,Changes in Bacterial Gut Composition in Parkinson's Disease and Their Metabolic Contribution to Disease Development: A Gut Community Reconstruction Approach.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disease with the major symptoms comprising loss of movement coordination (motor dysfunction) and non-motor dysfunction, including gastrointestinal symptoms. Alterations in the gut microbiota composition have been reported in PD patients vs. controls. However, it is still unclear how these compositional changes contribute to disease etiology and progression. Furthermore, most of the available studies have focused on European, Asian, and North American cohorts, but the microbiomes of PD patients in Latin America have not been characterized. To address this problem, we obtained fecal samples from Colombian participants (<i>n</i> = 25 controls, <i>n</i> = 25 PD idiopathic cases) to characterize the taxonomical community changes during disease via 16S rRNA gene sequencing. An analysis of differential composition, diversity, and personalized computational modeling was carried out, given the fecal bacterial composition and diet of each participant. We found three metabolites that differed in dietary habits between PD patients and controls: carbohydrates, trans fatty acids, and potassium. We identified six genera that changed significantly in their relative abundance between PD patients and controls, belonging to the families <i>Lachnospiraceae</i>, <i>Lactobacillaceae</i>, <i>Verrucomicrobioaceae</i>, <i>Peptostreptococcaceae</i>, and <i>Streptococcaceae</i>. Furthermore, personalized metabolic modeling of the gut microbiome revealed changes in the predicted production of seven metabolites (Indole, tryptophan, fructose, phenylacetic acid, myristic acid, 3-Methyl-2-oxovaleric acid, and N-Acetylneuraminic acid). These metabolites are associated with the metabolism of aromatic amino acids and their consumption in the diet. Therefore, this research suggests that each individual's diet and intestinal composition could affect host metabolism. Furthermore, these findings open the door to the study of microbiome-host interactions and allow us to contribute to personalized medicine.",Microorganisms,2024,Johanna Forero-RodrÃ­guez; Johannes Zimmermann; Jan Taubenheim; Natalia Arias-RodrÃ­guez; Juan David Caicedo-Narvaez; Lena Best; Cindy V Mendieta; Julieth LÃ³pez-Castiblanco; Laura Alejandra GÃ³mez-MuÃ±oz; Janneth Gonzalez-Santos; Humberto Arboleda; William Fernandez; Christoph Kaleta; AndrÃ©s PinzÃ³n
39155987,HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder: key implications of the microbiota-gut-brain axis.,"HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) is now recognized to be relatively common in people living with HIV (PLWH), and remains a common cause of cognitive impairment. Unfortunately, the fundamental pathogenic processes underlying this specific outcome of HIV infection have not as yet been fully elucidated. With increased interest in research related to the microbiota-gut-brain axis, the gut-brain axis has been shown to play critical roles in regulating central nervous system disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. PLWH are characterized by a particular affliction, referred to as gut-associated dysbiosis syndrome, which provokes an alteration in microbial composition and diversity, and of their associated metabolite composition within the gut. Interestingly, the gut microbiota has also been recognized as a key element, which both positively and negatively influences human brain health, including the functioning and development of the central nervous system (CNS). In this review, based on published evidence, we critically discuss the relevant interactions between the microbiota-gut-brain axis and the pathogenesis of HAND in the context of HIV infection. It is likely that HAND manifestation in PLWH mainly results from (i) gut-associated dysbiosis syndrome and a leaky gut on the one hand and (ii) inflammation on the other hand. In other words, the preceding features of HIV infection negatively alter the composition of the gut microbiota (microbes and their associated metabolites) and promote proinflammatory immune responses which singularly or in tandem damage neurons and/or induce inadequate neuronal signaling. Thus, HAND is fairly prevalent in PLWH. This work aims to demonstrate that in the quest to prevent and possibly treat HAND, the gut microbiota may ultimately represent a therapeutically targetable ""host factor.""",Frontiers in microbiology,2024,Aizhen Hu; Silvere D Zaongo; Vijay Harypursat; Xin Wang; Jing Ouyang; Yaokai Chen
39266892,The role of gut-derived short-chain fatty acids in Parkinson's disease.,"The emerging function of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in Parkinson's disease (PD) has been investigated in this article. SCFAs, which are generated via the fermentation of dietary fiber by gut microbiota, have been associated with dysfunction of the gut-brain axis and, neuroinflammation. These processes are integral to the development of PD. This article examines the potential therapeutic implications of SCFAs in the management of PD, encompassing their capacity to modulate gastrointestinal permeability, neuroinflammation, and neuronal survival, by conducting an extensive literature review. As a whole, this article emphasizes the potential therapeutic utility of SCFAs as targets for the management and treatment of PD.",Neurogenetics,2024,Mohamed J Saadh; Anfal Nabeel Mustafa; Mohammed Ahmed Mustafa; Renuka Jyothi S; Hasan Khalid Dabis; G V Siva Prasad; Imad Jassim Mohammad; Ahmed Adnan; Ameer Hassan Idan
38287859,The Neuroprotective Effects of Electroacupuncture on Parkinson's Disease and the Underlying Molecular Mechanisms.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease whose main pathological features are the degeneration of dopamine neurons and deposition of Î±-synuclein in neurons. At present, the most important treatment strategy for PD is drugs, and one of the most used drugs is levodopa. However, this therapy shows many problems, such as tolerance and long-term effects, so other treatment strategies need to be explored. As a traditional Chinese medicine treatment method with effective and few side effects, electroacupuncture is considered a non-drug therapy. It serves as a novel, promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of PD. In this review, the application and the effects of electroacupuncture on PD have been described. Besides, the underlying molecular mechanisms of electroacupuncture on PD that contribute to protecting dopaminergic neurons and reducing Î±-synuclein levels have been illustrated, including â  anti-oxidant stress response, â¡ anti-neuroinflammatory response, â¢ up-regulation of neurotrophic factors and reduction of nerve cell apoptosis, â£ down-regulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress and improvement of mitochondrial function, â¤ improvement of the function of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, â¥ anti-excitatory toxicity response, â¦ activation of autophagy, and â§ modulation of gut microbiota. Achieving a better understanding of the neuroprotective effects of electroacupuncture on PD will provide a theoretical basis and facilitate the application of electroacupuncture on PD.",Journal of integrative neuroscience,2024,Qiuqin Han; Peiqing Chen; Xiaorong Chen; Lijuan Wang; Renyan Huang; Wenhui Li; Guobin Liu
38914414,Exploring the gut-brain Axis: Potential therapeutic impact of Psychobiotics on mental health.,"One of the most challenging and controversial issues in microbiome research is related to gut microbial metabolism and neuropsychological disorders. Psychobiotics affect human behavior and central nervous system processes via the gut-brain axis, involving neuronal, immune, and metabolic pathways. They have therapeutic potential in the treatment of several neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders such as depression, anxiety, autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, Huntington's disease, anorexia nervosa, and multiple sclerosis. However, the mechanisms underlying the interaction between psychobiotics and the abovementioned diseases need further exploration. This review focuses on the relationship between gut microbiota and its impact on neurological and neurodegenerative disorders, examining the potential of psychobiotics as a preventive and therapeutic approach, summarising recent research on the gut-brain axis and the potential beneficial effects of psychobiotics, highlighting the need for further research and investigation in this area.",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,2024,Ana-Maria Cocean; Dan Cristian Vodnar

This review summarizes information on the basic mechanisms of gut-brain communication. We then discuss the roles of the gut microbiome as a neuroprotective factor in neurodegeneration. The gut microbiota is extremely important in maintaining the body's homeostasis, shaping the human immune system and the proper functioning of the brain. The intestinal microflora affects the processes of neuroplasticity, synaptogenesis, and neuronal regeneration. This review aims to explain changes in the composition of the bacterial population of the intestinal microflora among patients with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Abnormalities in gut microflora composition are also noted in stress, depression, or autism spectrum development. New observations on psychobiotic supplementation in alleviating the symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases are also presented.",AIMS neuroscience,2024,Mgr Natalia BiaÅoÅ; Dr Hab N O Zdr Dariusz GÃ³rka; Mgr MikoÅaj GÃ³rka
39408276,Oral Trehalose Intake Modulates the Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis and Is Neuroprotective in a Synucleinopathy Mouse Model.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal and gastrointestinal tracts, causing both motor and non-motor symptoms. This study examined the neuroprotective effects of trehalose. This sugar is confined in the gut due to the absence of transporters, so we hypothesized that trehalose might exert neuroprotective effects on PD through its action on the gut microbiota. We used a transgenic mouse model of PD (PrP-A53T G2-3) overexpressing human Î±-synuclein and developing GI dysfunctions. Mice were given water with trehalose, maltose, or sucrose (2% <i>w</i>/<i>v</i>) for 6.5 m. Trehalose administration prevented a reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the substantia nigra (-25%), striatum (-38%), and gut (-18%) in PrP-A53T mice. It also modulated the gut microbiota, reducing the loss of diversity seen in PrP-A53T mice and promoting bacteria negatively correlated with PD in patients. Additionally, trehalose treatment increased the intestinal secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) by 29%. Maltose and sucrose, which break down into glucose, did not show neuroprotective effects, suggesting glucose is not involved in trehalose-mediated neuroprotection. Since trehalose is unlikely to cross the intestinal barrier at the given dose, the results suggest its effects are mediated indirectly through the gut microbiota and GLP-1.",Nutrients,2024,SolÃ¨ne Pradeloux; Katherine Coulombe; Alexandre Jules Kennang Ouamba; Amandine Isenbrandt; FrÃ©dÃ©ric Calon; Denis Roy; Denis Soulet
38770370,"Iron toxicity, ferroptosis and microbiota in Parkinson's disease: Implications for novel targets.","Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Iron (Fe)-dependent programmed cell death known as ferroptosis, plays a crucial role in the etiology and progression of PD. Since SNpc is particularly vulnerable to Fe toxicity, a central role for ferroptosis in the etiology and progression of PD is envisioned. Ferroptosis, characterized by reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent accumulation of lipid peroxides, is tightly regulated by a variety of intracellular metabolic processes. Moreover, the recently characterized bi-directional interactions between ferroptosis and the gut microbiota, not only provides another window into the mechanistic underpinnings of PD but could also suggest novel interventions in this devastating disease. Here, following a brief discussion of PD, we focus on how our expanding knowledge of Fe-induced ferroptosis and its interaction with the gut microbiota may contribute to the pathophysiology of PD and how this knowledge may be exploited to provide novel interventions in PD.",Advances in neurotoxicology,2024,Fernanda Vidal Carvalho; Harold E Landis; Bruk Getachew; Victor Diogenes Amaral Silva; Paulo R Ribeiro; Michael Aschner; Yousef Tizabi
38311217,"Supplementation of probiotic Bifidobacterium breve Bif11 reverses neurobehavioural deficits, inflammatory changes and oxidative stress in Parkinson's disease model.","Human gut microbiota are thought to affect different physiological processes in the body, including brain functions. Gut dysbiosis has been linked to the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD) and thus, restoring the healthy gut microbiota with supplementation of putative probiotic strains can confer some benefits in PD. In the current study, we explored the neuroprotective potential of Bifidobacterium breve Bif11 supplementation in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine hydrochloride (MPTP) treated female Sprague Dawley rats. This study investigated the behavioural, molecular and biochemical parameters in the MPTP rat model. A pharmacological intervention of Bif11 at doses of 1Â ÃÂ 10<sup>10</sup>Â CFU and 2Â ÃÂ 10<sup>10</sup>Â CFU for 21 days was found to attenuate the cognitive and motor changes in the MPTP rat model. Furthermore, it also increased the tyrosine hydroxylase levels, reduced pro-inflammatory markers and decreased oxidative and nitrosative stress in the mid brain of MPTP-lesioned rats. Bif11 supplementation even restored the levels of short-chain fatty acids and decreased intestinal epithelial permeability in MPTP-induced PD model rats. In summary, these findings demonstrate that B. breve Bif11 has the potential to ameliorate symptoms of PD. However, this therapy needs to be further investigated with in-depth mechanistic insights in the future for the treatment of PD.",Neurochemistry international,2024,Sonali Valvaikar; Bhupesh Vaidya; Shikha Sharma; Mahendra Bishnoi; Kanthi Kiran Kondepudi; Shyam S Sharma
38754721,Exploring Therapeutic Potential of Phytoconstituents as a Gut Microbiota Modulator in the Management of Neurological and Psychological Disorders.,"The functioning of the brain and its impact on behavior, emotions, and cognition can be affected by both neurological and psychiatric disorders that impose a significant burden on global health. Phytochemicals are helpful in the treatment of several neurological and psychological disorders, including anxiety, depression, Huntington's disease (HD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), because they have symptomatic benefits with few adverse reactions. Changes in gut microbiota have been associated with many neurological and psychiatric conditions. This review focuses on the potential efficacy of phytochemicals such as flavonoids, terpenoids, and polyphenols in regulating gut flora and providing symptomatic relief for a range of neurological and psychological conditions. Evidence-based research has shown the medicinal potentials of these phytochemicals, but additional study is required to determine whether altering gut microbiota might slow the advancement of neurological and psychological problems.",Neuroscience,2024,Prarit Chandel; Komal Thapa; Neha Kanojia; Lata Rani; Thakur Gurjeet Singh; Pulkit Rohilla
38554664,Association of intestinal inflammation and permeability markers with clinical manifestations of Parkinson's disease.,"Intestinal inflammation and gut microbiota dysbiosis can stimulate degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and development of Parkinson's disease (PD) via the gut-brain axis in certain patients.In a case-control study, fecal markers of intestinal inflammation and permeability were measured using the ELISA method in PD patients and healthy controls. Motor and nonmotor symptoms were assessed using the Movement Disorder Society (MDS) Unified PD Rating Scale, Hoehn & Yahr scale, MDS Non-Motor Symptom Scale, Scales for Outcomes in PD - Autonomic Dysfunction, PD Sleep Scale - 2, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Beck Depression Inventory-II. A correlation was established between the intestinal inflammation and permeability markers and PD symptoms.Higher levels of beta-defensin 2, zonulin and lactoferrin were recorded in PD patients compared to controls. Calprotectin and secretory immunoglobulin A showed no significant differences. Regression analysis indicated the roles of beta-defensin 2 and lactoferrin in predicting PD likelihood. Calprotectin yielded positive correlations with disease duration, depression, motor fluctuations, and gastrointestinal symptoms; beta defensin 2 with thermoregulation; and secretory immunoglobulin A with depression. Secretory immunoglobulin A showed negative correlation with age and age at disease onset, while zonulin showed negative correlation with the MDS Unified PD Rating Scale total score.Fecal markers differed in PD patients compared to controls and correlated with age, disease duration, and some nonmotor symptoms.

Fecal short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) changes in iRBD and the relationships with synucleinopathies have never been investigated.To investigate fecal SCFA changes among iRBD, multiple system atrophy (MSA), and Parkinson's disease (PD), and evaluate their relationships.Fecal SCFAs and gut microbiota were measured in 29 iRBD, 42 MSA, 40 PD, and 35 normal controls (NC) using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and 16S rRNA gene sequencing.Compared with NC, fecal SCFA levels (propionic, acetic, and butyric acid) were lower in iRBD, MSA, and PD. Combinations of these SCFAs could differentiate NC from iRBD (AUC 0.809), MSA (AUC 0.794), and PD (AUC 0.701). Decreased fecal SCFAs were associated with the common reducing SCFA-producing gut microbiota in iRBD, MSA, and PD.iRBD shares similar fecal SCFA alterations with MSA and PD, and the combination of these SCFAs might be a potential synucleinopathies-related biomarker.

39062985,Exploring Fecal Microbiota Transplantation for Modulating Inflammation in Parkinson's Disease: A Review of Inflammatory Markers and Potential Effects.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by numerous motor and non-motor symptoms. Recent data highlight a potential interplay between the gut microbiota and the pathophysiology of PD. The degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in PD leads to motor symptoms (tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia), with antecedent gastrointestinal manifestations, most notably constipation. Consequently, the gut emerges as a plausible modulator in the neurodegenerative progression of PD. Key molecular changes in PD are discussed in the context of the gut-brain axis. Evidence suggests that the alterations in the gut microbiota composition may contribute to gastroenteric inflammation and influence PD symptoms. Disturbances in the levels of inflammatory markers, including tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF Î±), interleukin -1Î² (IL-1Î²), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), have been observed in PD patients. These implicate the involvement of systemic inflammation in disease pathology. Fecal microbiota transplantation emerges as a potential therapeutic strategy for PD. It may mitigate inflammation by restoring gut homeostasis. Preclinical studies in animal models and initial clinical trials have shown promising results. Overall, understanding the interplay between inflammation, the gut microbiota, and PD pathology provides valuable insights into potential therapeutic interventions. This review presents recent data about the bidirectional communication between the gut microbiome and the brain in PD, specifically focusing on the involvement of inflammatory biomarkers.",International journal of molecular sciences,2024,Karol Sadowski; Weronika ZajÄc; Åukasz Milanowski; Dariusz Koziorowski; Monika Figura
38490348,Dietary polyphenols represent a phytotherapeutic alternative for gut dysbiosis associated neurodegeneration: A systematic review.,"Globally, neurodegeneration and cerebrovascular disease are common and growing causes of morbidity and mortality. Pathophysiology of this group of diseases encompasses various factors from oxidative stress to gut microbial dysbiosis. The study of the etiology and mechanisms of oxidative stress as well as gut dysbiosis-induced neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, autism spectrum disorder, and Huntington's disease has recently received a lot of attention. Numerous studies lend credence to the notion that changes in the intestinal microbiota and enteric neuroimmune system have an impact on the initiation and severity of these diseases. The prebiotic role of polyphenols can influence the makeup of the gut microbiota in neurodegenerative disorders by modulating intracellular signalling pathways. Metabolites of polyphenols function directly as neurotransmitters by crossing the blood-brain barrier or indirectly via influencing the cerebrovascular system. This assessment aims to bring forth an interlink between the consumption of polyphenols biotransformed by gut microbiota which in turn modulate the gut microbial diversity and biochemical changes in the brain. This systematic review will further augment research towards the association of dietary polyphenols in the management of gut dysbiosis-associated neurodegenerative diseases.",The Journal of nutritional biochemistry,2024,Amrita Chatterjee; Satish Kumar; Suparna Roy Sarkar; Ritabrata Halder; Rashmi Kumari; Sugato Banerjee; Biswatrish Sarkar
39191336,Metformin: From diabetes to cancer to prolongation of life.,"The metformin molecule dates back to over a century, but its clinical use started in the '50s. Since then, its use in diabetics has grown constantly, with over 150 million users today. The therapeutic profile also expanded, with improved understanding of novel mechanisms. Metformin has a major activity on insulin resistance, by acting on the insulin receptors and mitochondria, most likely by activation of the adenosine monophosphate-activated kinase. These and associated mechanisms lead to significant lipid lowering and body weight loss. An anti-cancer action has come up in recent years, with mechanisms partly dependent on the mitochondrial activity and also on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase resistance occurring in some malignant tumors. The potential of metformin to raise life-length is the object of large ongoing studies and of several basic and clinical investigations. The present review article will attempt to investigate the basic mechanisms behind these diverse activities and the potential clinical benefits. Metformin may act on transcriptional activity by histone modification, DNA methylation and miRNAs. An activity on age-associated inflammation (inflammaging) may occur via activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor and changes in gut microbiota. A senolytic activity, leading to reduction of cells with the senescent associated secretory phenotype, may be crucial in lifespan prolongation as well as in ancillary properties in age-associated diseases, such as Parkinson's disease. Telomere prolongation may be related to the activity on mitochondrial respiratory factor 1 and on peroxisome gamma proliferator coactivator 1-alpha. Very recent observations on the potential to act on the most severe neurological disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia, have raised considerable hope.",Pharmacological research,2024,Cesare R Sirtori; Sofia Castiglione; Chiara Pavanello

Phytochemicals, which are compounds derived from plants, have been shown to interact with the gut microbiota, immune system, and neurotransmitter systems, thereby influencing brain function. Phytochemicals such as polyphenols, carotenoids, flavonoids, and terpenoids have been identified as having potential therapeutic implications for various neurological disorders. The GBA plays a critical role in the development and progression of various neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, depression, anxiety, and autism spectrum disorders. Dysbiosis, or an imbalance in gut microbiota composition, has been associated with a range of neurological disorders, suggesting that modulating the gut microbiota may have potential therapeutic implications for these conditions. Although these findings are promising, further research is needed to elucidate the optimal use of phytochemicals in neurological disorder treatment, as well as their potential interactions with other medications.

38008941,Intestinal Barrier Function and Neurodegenerative Disease.,"Neurodegenerative diseases are caused by the loss of neurons and/or their myelin sheaths, which deteriorate over time and become dysfunctional. Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis are among the most prominent neurodegenerative diseases that affect millions of older adults worldwide. Despite extensive research over several decades, controversies still surround the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases, and many of them remain incurable. Meanwhile, an increasing number of new mechanistic studies related to the microbiota-gut-brain axis have emerged, among which the relationship between the function of the intestinal barrier and neurodegenerative diseases has received widespread attention. As one of the first lines of defense between the body and the external environment, the impaired function of the intestinal barrier is closely related to the development of neurodegenerative pathologies. Among them, the microbiota-gut-brain axis disorder characterized by intestinal barrier disruption mainly includes impaired function of the intestinal microbial barrier, chemical barrier, mechanical barrier, and immune barrier. This review focuses on the structure and molecular mechanisms of the various layers of the intestinal barrier as well as their relationship with neurodegenerative lesions. In recent years, intestinal barrier repair therapies have provided new ideas for the studied disease treatment modalities. We believe that a better understanding of the role of the intestinal barrier in neurodegenerative diseases would provide new insights for the development of viable therapeutic strategies for patients.",CNS & neurological disorders drug targets,2024,Shijing Wu; Liangfang Yang; Yiwei Fu; Zhimin Liao; De Cai; Zhou Liu
38261717,Gastrointestinal dysmotility in rodent models of Parkinson's disease.,"Multiple studies describe prodromal, nonmotor dysfunctions that affect the quality of life of patients who subsequently develop Parkinson's disease (PD). These prodromal dysfunctions comprise a wide array of autonomic issues, including severe gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders such as dysphagia, delayed gastric emptying, and chronic constipation. Indeed, strong evidence from studies in humans and animal models suggests that the GI tract and its neural, mainly vagal, connection to the central nervous system (CNS) could have a major role in the etiology of PD. In fact, misfolded Î±-synuclein aggregates that form Lewy bodies and neurites, i.e., the histological hallmarks of PD, are detected in the enteric nervous system (ENS) before clinical diagnosis of PD. The aim of the present review is to provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of GI dysmotility in PD, focusing our attention on functional, neurochemical, and molecular alterations in animal models.",American journal of physiology.

39175504,The aryl hydrocarbon receptor pathway: a linking bridge between the gut microbiome and neurodegenerative diseases.,"The Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a cytosolic receptor and ligand-activated transcription factor widely expressed across various cell types in the body. Its signaling is vital for host responses at barrier sites, regulating epithelial renewal, barrier integrity, and the activities of several types of immune cells. This makes AHR essential for various cellular responses during aging, especially those governing inflammation and immunity. In this review, we provided an overview of the mechanisms by which the AHR mediates inflammatory response at gut and brain level through signals from intestinal microbes. The age-related reduction of gut microbiota functions is perceived as a trigger of aberrant immune responses linking gut and brain inflammation to neurodegeneration. Thus, we explored gut microbiome impact on the nature and availability of AHR ligands and outcomes for several signaling pathways involved in neurodegenerative diseases and age-associated decline of brain functions, with an insight on Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, the most common neurodegenerative diseases in the elderly. Specifically, we focused on microbial tryptophan catabolism responsible for the production of several AHR ligands. Perspectives for the development of microbiota-based interventions targeting AHR activity are presented for a healthy aging.",Frontiers in cellular neuroscience,2024,Lorena Coretti; Elisabetta Buommino; Francesca Lembo
38227477,Integrated multi-omics profiling highlights the benefits of resveratrol hydroxypropyl-Î²-cyclodextrin inclusion complex for A53T transgenic mice through the microbiota-gut-brain axis.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological disorder characterized by motor and gastrointestinal dysfunctions. Resveratrol is a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory phytoalexin known for its health-promoting benefits. However, little is known about its potential in treating PD by modulating the microbial gut-brain axis, and its clinical application has been limited due to poor water solubility, rapid metabolism, and limited systemic bioavailability. Our study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of RHSD, a resveratrol-cyclodextrin inclusion complex, in treating PD through the gut-brain axis in human SNCA-transgenic (A53T) mice PD models. Building on our previous study, we prepared RHSD and compared its efficacy with uncoated resveratrol for PD treatment. The study results demonstrated that RHSD exhibited several advantages in improving motor function, alleviating cognitive impairment, restoring intestinal barrier function, and inhibiting neuropathy. Subsequently, a series of analyses, including fecal microbiota metagenomic sequencing, non-target metabolic assays, host transcriptome sequencing, and integrative analysis were performed to reveal the potential therapeutic pathways of RHSD in A53T mice. The metagenomic sequencing results indicated a significant increase in the levels of <i>Lactobacillus murinus</i>, <i>Lactobacillus reuteri</i>, <i>Enterorhabduscaecimuris</i>, <i>Lactobacillus taiwanensis</i>, and <i>Lactobacillus animals</i> following RHSD administration. Furthermore, metabolomics profiling showed that the levels of gut microbiome metabolites were reversed after RHSD treatment, and differential metabolites were significantly correlated with motor function and intestinal function in PD mice. The integrated analysis of microbial metabolites and host transcriptomics suggested that abnormal amino acid metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation in the PD model were associated with the diffusion of abnormal metabolites. This study illustrates the profound impact of RHSD administration on rectifying gut microbiota dysbiosis and improving the A53T mouse model. Notably, we observed significant alterations in the proliferation and metabolism of multiple probiotic strains of Lactobacillus. Furthermore, our research supports the hypothesis that microbiota-related metabolites may regulate the transcription of host genes, including dopamine receptors and calcium stabilization. Consequently, our findings underscore the potential of RHSD as a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of PD through the modulation of several signaling pathways within the microbiota-gut-brain axis.",Food & function,2024,Xiaodong Sun; Shenglan Feng; Bingqing Qin; Junjie Ye; Lixia Xie; Jianjun Gui; Ming Sang
38610012,Peripheral extracellular vesicles in neurodegeneration: pathogenic influencers and therapeutic vehicles.,"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis epitomize a class of insidious and relentless neurological conditions that are difficult to cure. Conventional therapeutic regimens often fail due to the late onset of symptoms, which occurs well after irreversible neurodegeneration has begun. The integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) further impedes efficacious drug delivery to the central nervous system, presenting a formidable challenge in the pharmacological treatment of NDDs. Recent scientific inquiries have shifted focus toward the peripheral biological systems, investigating their influence on central neuropathology through the lens of extracellular vesicles (EVs). These vesicles, distinguished by their ability to breach the BBB, are emerging as dual operatives in the context of NDDs, both as conveyors of pathogenic entities and as prospective vectors for therapeutic agents. This review critically summarizes the burgeoning evidence on the role of extracerebral EVs, particularly those originating from bone, adipose tissue, and gut microbiota, in modulating brain pathophysiology. It underscores the duplicity potential of peripheral EVs as modulators of disease progression and suggests their potential as novel vehicles for targeted therapeutic delivery, positing a transformative impact on the future landscape of NDD treatment strategies.

38786584,Optimization of the Preparation Process of Glucuronomannan Oligosaccharides and Their Effects on the Gut Microbiota in MPTP-Induced PD Model Mice.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, and accumulating evidence suggests a link between dysbiosis of the gut microbiota and the onset and progression of PD. In our previous investigations, we discovered that intraperitoneal administration of glucuronomannan oligosaccharides (GMn) derived from <i>Saccharina japonica</i> exhibited neuroprotective effects in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse model. However, the complicated preparation process, difficulties in isolation, and remarkably low yield have constrained further exploration of GMn. In this study, we optimized the degradation conditions in the preparation process of GMn through orthogonal experiments. Subsequently, an MPTP-induced PD model was established, followed by oral administration of GMn. Through a stepwise optimization, we successfully increased the yield of GMn, separated from crude fucoidan, from 1~2/10,000 to 4~8/1000 and indicated the effects on the amelioration of MPTP-induced motor deficits, preservation of dopamine neurons, and elevation in striatal neurotransmitter levels. Importantly, GMn mitigated gut microbiota dysbiosis induced by MPTP in mice. In particular, GM2 significantly reduced the levels of <i>Akkermansia</i>, Verrucomicrobiota, and <i>Lactobacillus</i>, while promoting the abundance of <i>Roseburia</i> and <i>Prevotella</i> compared to the model group. These findings suggest that GM2 can potentially suppress PD by modulating the gut microbiota, providing a foundation for the development of a novel and effective anti-PD marine drug.",Marine drugs,2024,Baoxiang Wang; Lihua Geng; Jing Wang; Yuxi Wei; Changhui Yan; Ning Wu; Yang Yue; Quanbin Zhang
38316462,Stability of gut microbiome after COVID-19 vaccination in healthy and immuno-compromised individuals.,"Bidirectional interactions between the immune system and the gut microbiota are key contributors to various physiological functions. Immune-associated diseases such as cancer and autoimmunity, and efficacy of immunomodulatory therapies, have been linked to microbiome variation. Although COVID-19 infection has been shown to cause microbial dysbiosis, it remains understudied whether the inflammatory response associated with vaccination also impacts the microbiota. Here, we investigate the temporal impact of COVID-19 vaccination on the gut microbiome in healthy and immuno-compromised individuals; the latter included patients with primary immunodeficiency and cancer patients on immunomodulating therapies. We find that the gut microbiome remained remarkably stable post-vaccination irrespective of diverse immune status, vaccine response, and microbial composition spanned by the cohort. The stability is evident at all evaluated levels including diversity, phylum, species, and functional capacity. Our results indicate the resilience of the gut microbiome to host immune changes triggered by COVID-19 vaccination and suggest minimal, if any, impact on microbiome-mediated processes. These findings encourage vaccine acceptance, particularly when contrasted with the significant microbiome shifts observed during COVID-19 infection.",Life science alliance,2024,Rebecca H Boston; Rui Guan; Lajos Kalmar; Sina Beier; Emily C Horner; Nonantzin Beristain-Covarrubias; Juan Carlos Yam-Puc; PehuÃ©n Pereyra Gerber; Luisa Faria; Anna Kuroshchenkova; Anna E Lindell; Sonja Blasche; Andrea Correa-Noguera; Anne Elmer; Caroline Saunders; Areti Bermperi; Sherly Jose; Nathalie Kingston; ; Sofia Grigoriadou; Emily Staples; Matthew S Buckland; Sara Lear; Nicholas J Matheson; Vladimir Benes; Christine Parkinson; James Ed Thaventhiran; Kiran R Patil
38565567,Gamma-aminobutyric acid as a potential postbiotic mediator in the gut-brain axis.,"Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) plays a crucial role in the central nervous system as an inhibitory neurotransmitter. Imbalances of this neurotransmitter are associated with neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, and psychological disorders, including anxiety, depression, and stress. Since GABA has long been believed to not cross the blood-brain barrier, the effects of circulating GABA on the brain are neglected. However, emerging evidence has demonstrated that changes in both circulating and brain levels of GABA are associated with changes in gut microbiota composition and that changes in GABA levels and microbiota composition play a role in modulating mental health. This recent research has raised the possibility that GABA may be a potent mediator of the gut-brain axis. This review article will cover up-to-date information about GABA-producing microorganisms isolated from human gut and food sources, explanation why those microorganisms produce GABA, food factors inducing gut-GABA production, evidence suggesting GABA as a mediator linking between gut microbiota and mental health, including anxiety, depression, stress, epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and novel information regarding homocarnosine-a predominant brain peptide that is a putative downstream mediator of GABA in regulating brain functions. This review will help us to understand how the gut microbiota and GABA-homocarnosine metabolism play a significant role in brain functions. Nonetheless, it could support further research on the use of GABA production-inducing microorganisms and food factors as agents to treat neurological and psychological disorders.",NPJ science of food,2024,Jason D Braga; Masubon Thongngam; Thanutchaporn Kumrungsee

The therapeutic potential of probiotics, due to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and gut microbiota modulatory properties, is explored herein as a means to improve gut health and influence the gut-brain-microbiota axis in the context of PD. In this study, we investigated the role and possible mechanism of <i>Bifidobacterium animalis</i> subsp. <i>lactis</i> MH-022 (<i>B. lactis</i> MH-022) supplementation in a 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced rat model of PD. Findings demonstrated that <i>B. lactis</i> MH-022 supplementation markedly ameliorated motor deficits, preserved dopaminergic neurons, enhanced the antioxidant capacity, and mitigated inflammation through restoring mitochondrial function. Furthermore, <i>B. lactis</i> MH-022 supplementation significantly altered the gut microbiota composition, augmenting the production of short-chain fatty acids and promoting the proliferation of beneficial bacterial taxa, thereby reinforcing their anti-inflammatory properties. Correlation analyses established strong associations between specific bacterial taxa and improvements in motor function, antioxidant levels, and reductions in inflammation markers. These insights emphasize the therapeutic potential of <i>B. lactis</i> MH-022 in modulating diverse aspects of PD, particularly highlighting its role in reducing inflammation, restoring mitochondrial function, enhancing antioxidant capacity, and reshaping the gut microbiota. This multifaceted approach underscores the probiotic's potential in reducing neuroinflammation and protecting dopaminergic neurons, thus offering a promising avenue for PD treatment.",Food & function,2024,Shu-Ping Tsao; Tu-Hsueh Yeh; Ya-Tin Lin; Chun-Hsu Pan; Yuan-Kun Lee; Chieh-Hsi Wu; Hui-Yu Huang
39273435,Psychobiotic Properties of <i>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</i> in Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Neurodegenerative disorders are the main cause of cognitive and physical disabilities, affect millions of people worldwide, and their incidence is on the rise. Emerging evidence pinpoints a disturbance of the communication of the gut-brain axis, and in particular to gut microbial dysbiosis, as one of the contributors to the pathogenesis of these diseases. In fact, dysbiosis has been associated with neuro-inflammatory processes, hyperactivation of the neuronal immune system, impaired cognitive functions, aging, depression, sleeping disorders, and anxiety. With the rapid advance in metagenomics, metabolomics, and big data analysis, together with a multidisciplinary approach, a new horizon has just emerged in the fields of translational neurodegenerative disease. In fact, recent studies focusing on taxonomic profiling and leaky gut in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders are not only shedding light on an overlooked field but are also creating opportunities for biomarker discovery and development of new therapeutic and adjuvant strategies to treat these disorders. <i>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</i> (LBP) strains are emerging as promising psychobiotics for the treatment of these diseases. In fact, LBP strains are able to promote eubiosis, increase the enrichment of bacteria producing beneficial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids, boost the production of neurotransmitters, and support the homeostasis of the gut-brain axis. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the role of the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders with a particular focus on the benefits of LBP strains in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, autism, anxiety, and depression.",International journal of molecular sciences,2024,Mariagiovanna Di Chiano; Fabio Sallustio; Daniela Fiocco; Maria Teresa Rocchetti; Giuseppe Spano; Paola Pontrelli; Antonio Moschetta; Loreto Gesualdo; Raffaella Maria Gadaleta; Anna Gallone
38569219,Artificial Intelligence-Guided Gut-Microenvironment-Triggered Imaging Sensor Reveals Potential Indicators of Parkinson's Disease.,"The gut-brain axis has recently emerged as a crucial link in the development and progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). Dysregulation of the gut microbiota has been implicated in the pathogenesis of this disease, sparking growing interest in the quest for non-invasive biomarkers derived from the gut for early PD diagnosis. Herein, an artificial intelligence-guided gut-microenvironment-triggered imaging sensor (Eu-MOF@Au-Aptmer) to achieve non-invasive, accurate screening for various stages of PD is presented. The sensor works by analyzing Î±-Syn in the gut using deep learning algorithms. By monitoring changes in Î±-Syn, the sensor can predict the onset of PD with high accuracy. This work has the potential to revolutionize the diagnosis and treatment of PD by allowing for early intervention and personalized treatment plans. Moreover, it exemplifies the promising prospects of integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced sensors in the monitoring and prediction of a broad spectrum of diseases and health conditions.","Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",2024,Yiwei Li; Hong-Xia Ren; Chong-Yung Chi; Yang-Bao Miao
39331469,Orally Administered Ginkgolide C Alleviates MPTP-Induced Neurodegeneration by Suppressing Neuroinflammation and Oxidative Stress through Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis in Mice.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, the etiology of which remains unclear. Studies have shown that neuroinflammation and oxidative stress (OS) play an important role in neuronal damage in patients with PD. Disturbances in the gut microbiota influence neuroinflammation and OS through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Ginkgolide C (GC), a traditional Chinese medicine extracted from the leaves of <i>Ginkgo biloba</i>, has been reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory effects and the ability to modulate intestinal microbial composition. However, the potential of GC to positively impact PD by modulating the gut microbiota remains unexplored. This study aimed to explore the effects of GC on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD in mice and elucidate its underlying mechanisms. Our findings elucidated that GC treatment significantly ameliorates behavioral deficits as well as pathological damage via restoring gut microbial homeostasis to downgrade OS and neuroinflammation in MPTP-induced PD mice. Mechanistically, GC treatment exerts antioxidant effects via activating the AKT/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway in MPP<sup>+</sup>-exposed SN4741 neuronal cells and significantly downregulates the expression of inflammatory mediators via regulating NF-ÎºB and MAPK signaling in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV2 microglial cells. Overall, our study demonstrates that GC administration alleviates MPTP-induced neurodegeneration via rebuilding gut microbial homeostasis to inhibit OS and neuroinflammation in mice, indicating that GC might serve as a promising candidate medicine for PD.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2024,Xiyu Gao; Shoupeng Fu; Jingru Wen; Aohan Yan; Shuo Yang; Yiming Zhang; Dianfeng Liu; Dewei He
39344226,Research Progress on the Relationship between Parkinson's Disease and REM Sleep Behavior Disorder.,"An individual's quality of life is greatly affected by Parkinson's disease (PD), a prevalent neurological degenerative condition. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a prominent non-motor symptom commonly associated with PD. Previous studies have shown a close relationship between PD and RBD. In addition to being a prodromal symptom of PD, RBD has a major negative impact on the prognosis of PD patients. This intrinsic connection indicates that there is a bidirectional relationship between PD and RBD. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the pathological mechanism related to PD and RBD, including the Î±-synuclein pathological deposition, abnormal iron metabolism, neuroinflammation, glymphatic system dysfunction and dysbiosis of the gut microbiota. Increasing evidence has shown that RBD patients have the same pathogenic mechanisms that underlie PD, but relatively little research has been done on how RBD contributes to PD progression. Therefore, a more thorough investigation is warranted to characterise how RBD affects the course of PD, in order to prepare for future therapeutic trials.",Journal of integrative neuroscience,2024,Yu Zhou; Xiaoli Liu; Bin Xu
39201684,Implications of Butyrate Signaling Pathways on the Motor Symptomatology of Parkinson's Disease and Neuroprotective Effects-Therapeutic Approaches: A Systematic Review.,"Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms. Emerging evidence suggests that gut microbiota alterations, specifically involving short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) like butyrate, may influence PD pathogenesis and symptomatology. This Systematic Review aims to synthesize current research on the role of butyrate in modulating motor symptoms and its neuroprotective effects in PD, providing insights into potential therapeutic approaches. A systematic literature search was conducted in April 2024 across databases, including ScienceDirect, Scopus, Wiley, and Web of Science, for studies published between 2000 and 2024. Keywords used were ""neuroprotective effects AND butyrate AND (Parkinson disease OR motor symptoms)"". Four authors independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts, applying inclusion criteria focused on studies investigating butyrate regulation and PD motor symptoms. A total of 1377 articles were identified, with 40 selected for full-text review and 14 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Data extraction was performed on the study population, PD models, methodology, intervention details, and outcomes. Quality assessment using the SYRCLE RoB tool highlighted variability in study quality, with some biases noted in allocation concealment and blinding. Findings indicate that butyrate regulation has a significant impact on improving motor symptoms and offers neuroprotective benefits in PD models. The therapeutic modulation of gut microbiota to enhance butyrate levels presents a promising strategy for PD symptom management.",International journal of molecular sciences,2024,Jorge Missiego-BeltrÃ¡n; Eva MarÃ­a Olalla-Ãlvarez; Ana GonzÃ¡lez-Brugera; Ana Isabel BeltrÃ¡n-Velasco
38267447,Unravelling the mechanisms of underweight in Parkinson's disease by investigating into the role of gut microbiome.,"Approximately half of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) suffer from unintentional weight loss and are underweight, complicating the clinical course of PD patients. Gut microbiota alteration has been proven to be associated with PD, and recent studies have shown that gut microbiota could lead to muscle wasting, implying a possible role of gut microbiota in underweight PD. In this study, we aimed to (1) investigate the mechanism underlying underweight in PD patients with respect to gut microbiota and (2) estimate the extent to which gut microbiota may mediate PD-related underweight through mediation analysis. The data were adapted from Hill-Burns et al., in which 330 participants (199 PD, 131 controls) were enrolled in the study. Fecal samples were collected from participants for microbiome analysis. 16S rRNA gene sequence data were processed using DADA2. Mediation analysis was performed to quantify the effect of intestinal microbial alteration on the causal effect of PD on underweight and to identify the key bacteria that significantly mediated PD-related underweight. The results showed that the PD group had significantly more underweight patients (body mass index (BMI)â<â18.5) after controlling for age and sex. Ten genera and four species were significantly different in relative abundance between the underweight and non-underweight individuals in the PD group. Mediation analysis showed that 42.29% and 37.91% of the effect of PD on underweight was mediated through intestinal microbial alterations at the genus and species levels, respectively. Five genera (Agathobacter, Eisenbergiella, Fusicatenibacter, Roseburia, Ruminococcaceae_UCG_013) showed significant mediation effects. In conclusion, we found that up to 42.29% of underweight PD cases are mediated by gut microbiota, with increased pro-inflammatory bacteria and decreased SCFA-producing bacteria, which indicates that the pro-inflammatory state, disturbance of metabolism, and interference of appetite regulation may be involved in the mechanism of underweight PD.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2024,Ling-Chieh Shih; Ru-Jen Lin; Yan-Lin Chen; Shih-Chen Fu
38891863,From Gut to Brain: Uncovering Potential Serum Biomarkers Connecting Inflammatory Bowel Diseases to Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are characterized by chronic gastrointestinal inflammation due to abnormal immune responses to gut microflora. The gut-brain axis is disrupted in IBDs, leading to neurobiological imbalances and affective symptoms. Systemic inflammation in IBDs affects the brain's inflammatory response system, hormonal axis, and blood-brain barrier integrity, influencing the gut microbiota. This review aims to explore the association between dysregulations in the gut-brain axis, serum biomarkers, and the development of cognitive disorders. Studies suggest a potential association between IBDs and the development of neurodegeneration. The mechanisms include systemic inflammation, nutritional deficiency, GBA dysfunction, and the effect of genetics and comorbidities. The objective is to identify potential correlations and propose future research directions to understand the impact of altered microbiomes and intestinal barrier functions on neurodegeneration. Serum levels of vitamins, inflammatory and neuronal damage biomarkers, and neuronal growth factors have been investigated for their potential to predict the development of neurodegenerative diseases, but current results are inconclusive and require more studies.",International journal of molecular sciences,2024,Oliviu-Florentiu Sarb; Adriana-Daniela Sarb; Maria Iacobescu; Irina-Maria Vlad; Mircea-Vasile Milaciu; Lorena Ciurmarnean; Vitalie Vacaras; Alina-Ioana Tantau
38741945,Utility of zebrafish-based models in understanding molecular mechanisms of neurotoxicity mediated by the gut-brain axis.,"The gut microbes perform several beneficial functions which impact the periphery and central nervous systems of the host. Gut microbiota dysbiosis is acknowledged as a major contributor to the development of several neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders including bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and autism spectrum disorder. Thus, elucidation of how the gut microbiota-brain axis plays a role in health and disease conditions is a potential novel approach to prevent and treat brain disorders. The zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) is an invaluable vertebrate model that possesses conserved brain and intestinal features with those of humans, thus making zebrafish a valued model to investigate the interplay between the gut microbiota and host health. This chapter describes current findings on the utility of zebrafish in understanding molecular mechanisms of neurotoxicity mediated via the gut microbiota-brain axis. Specifically, it highlights the utility of zebrafish as a model organism for understanding how anthropogenic chemicals, pharmaceuticals and bacteria exposure affect animals and human health via the gut-brain axis.",Advances in neurotoxicology,2024,Isaac A Adedara; Khadija A Mohammed; Julia Canzian; Babajide O Ajayi; Ebenezer O Farombi; Tatiana Emanuelli; Denis B Rosemberg; Michael Aschner

39002442,Pharmacological mechanisms of puerarin in the treatment of Parkinson's disease: An overview.,"Puerarin, a monomer of traditional Chinese medicine, is a key component of Pueraria radix. Both clinical and experimental researches demonstrated that puerarin has therapeutic effects on Parkinson's disease (PD). Puerarin's pharmacological mechanisms include: 1) Anti-apoptosis. Puerarin inhibits cell apoptosis through the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathways. Puerarin also exerts a hormone-like effect against cell apoptosis; 2) Anti-oxidative stress injury. Puerarin inhibits the Nrf2 nuclear exclusion through the GSK-3Î²/Fyn pathway to promote the Nrf2 accumulation in the nucleus, and then promotes the antioxidant synthesis through the Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway to protect against oxidative stress; 3) Neuroprotective effects by intervening in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP). Puerarin significantly enhances the activity of chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), which downregulates the expression of Î±-synuclein, reduces its accumulation, and thus improves the function of damaged neurons. Additionally, puerarin increases proteasome activity and decreases ubiquitin-binding proteins, thereby preventing toxic accumulation of intracellular proteins; 4) Alleviating inflammatory response. Puerarin inhibits the conversion of microglia to the M1 phenotype while inducing the transition of microglia to the M2 phenotype. Furthermore, puerarin promotes the secretion of anti-inflammatory factor and inhibits the expression of pro-inflammatory factors; 5) Increasing the levels of dopamine and its metabolites. Puerarin could increase the levels of dopamine, homovanillic acid (HVA) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) in the striatum; 6) Promoting neurotrophic factor expression and neuronal repair. Puerarin increases the expression of glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF), thereby exerting a neuroprotective effect. Moreover, the regulation of the gut microbiota by puerarin may be a potential mechanism for the treatment of PD. The current review discusses the molecular mechanisms of puerarin, which may provide insight into the active components of traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of PD.",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2024,Nianping Zhang; Peng Guo; Yan Zhao; Xiao Qiu; Shuai Shao; Zhenzhong Liu; Zong Gao
37855342,The Role of the Vagus Nerve in the Microbiome and Digestive System in Relation to Epilepsy.,"The Enteric Nervous System (ENS) is described as a division of the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS), located within the gut wall and it is formed by two main plexuses: the myenteric plexus (Auerbach's) and the submucosal plexus (Meissner's). The contribution of the ENS to the pathophysiology of various neurological diseases such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease has been described in the literature, while some other studies have found a connection between epilepsy and the gastrointestinal tract. The above could be explained by cholinergic neurons and neurotransmission systems in the myenteric and submucosal plexuses, regulating the vagal excitability effect. It is also understandable, as the discharges arising in the amygdala are transmitted to the intestine through projections the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, giving rise to efferent fibers that stimulate the gastrointestinal tract and consequently the symptoms at this level. Therefore, this review's main objective is to argue in favor of the existing relationship of the ENS with the Central Nervous System (CNS) as a facilitator of epileptogenic or ictogenic mechanisms. The gut microbiota also participates in this interaction; however, it depends on many individual factors of each human being. The link between the ENS and the CNS is a poorly studied epileptogenic site with a big impact on one of the most prevalent neurological conditions such as epilepsy.",Current medicinal chemistry,2024,Carmen Rubio; Ernesto Ochoa; Fernando Gatica; Alonso Portilla; David VÃ¡zquez; MoisÃ©s Rubio-Osornio

39060267,Multiomics of parkinsonism cynomolgus monkeys highlights significance of metabolites in interaction between host and microbiota.,"The gut microbiota has been demonstrated to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, conflicting findings regarding specific microbial species have been reported, possibly due to confounding factors within human populations. Herein, our current study investigated the interaction between the gut microbiota and host in a non-human primate (NHP) PD model induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) using a multi-omic approach and a self-controlled design. Our transcriptomic sequencing of peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) identified key genes involved in pro-inflammatory cytokine dysregulation, mitochondrial function regulation, neuroprotection activation, and neurogenesis associated with PD, such as IL1B, ATP1A3, and SLC5A3. The metabolomic profiles in serum and feces consistently exhibited significant alterations, particularly those closely associated with inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunctions and neurodegeneration in PD, such as TUDCA, ethylmalonic acid, and L-homophenylalanine. Furthermore, fecal metagenome analysis revealed gut dysbiosis associated with PD, characterized by a significant decrease in alpha diversity and altered commensals, particularly species such as Streptococcus, Butyrivibrio, and Clostridium. Additionally, significant correlations were observed between PD-associated microbes and metabolites, such as sphingomyelin and phospholipids. Importantly, PDPC significantly reduced in both PD monkey feces and serum, exhibiting strong correlation with PD-associated genes and microbes, such as SLC5A3 and Butyrivibrio species. Moreover, such multi-omic differential biomarkers were linked to the clinical rating scales of PD monkeys. Our findings provided novel insights into understanding the potential role of key metabolites in the host-microbiota interaction involved in PD pathogenesis.",NPJ biofilms and microbiomes,2024,Jiang-Mei Gao; Shou-Yue Xia; Geoff Hide; Bi-Hai Li; Yi-Yan Liu; Zhi-Yuan Wei; Xiao-Ji Zhuang; Qing Yan; Yun Wang; Wei Yang; Jian-Huan Chen; Jun-Hua Rao
39064687,"Postbiotics as Molecules Targeting Cellular Events of Aging Brain-The Role in Pathogenesis, Prophylaxis and Treatment of Neurodegenerative Diseases.","Aging is the most prominent risk factor for neurodegeneration occurrence. The most common neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's (PD) diseases, are characterized by the incidence of proteinopathy, abnormal activation of glial cells, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, impaired autophagy and cellular senescence excessive for the patient's age. Moreover, mitochondrial disfunction, epigenetic alterations and neurogenesis inhibition, together with increased blood-brain barrier permeability and gut dysbiosis, have been linked to ND pathogenesis. Since NDs still lack curative treatment, recent research has sought therapeutic options in restoring gut microbiota and supplementing probiotic bacteria-derived metabolites with beneficial action to the host-so called postbiotics. The current review focuses on literature explaining cellular mechanisms involved in ND pathogenesis and research addressing the impact that postbiotics as a whole mixture and particular metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), lactate, polyamines, polyphenols, tryptophan metabolites, exopolysaccharides and bacterial extracellular vesicles, have on the ageing-associated processes underlying ND occurrence. The review also discusses the issue of implementing postbiotics into ND prophylaxis and therapy, depicting them as compounds addressing senescence-triggered dysfunctions that are worth translating from bench to pharmaceutical market in response to ""silver consumers"" demands.",Nutrients,2024,Pola GÅowacka; Katarzyna Oszajca; Agnieszka Pudlarz; Janusz Szemraj; Monika Witusik-Perkowska
39145619,Oral aged garlic (<i>Allium sativum</i>) alleviates ulcerative colitis in mice by improving gut homeostasis.,"Aged garlic, obtained by heating raw garlic (<i>Allium sativum</i>) under high temperature and controlled humidity for a period, possesses a wide range of bioactivities, but its role in ulcerative colitis and its mechanism are not fully elucidated. We investigated the bioactive constituents in aged garlic (AG) and explored the effect of oral AG delivery on DSS-induced murine colitis. The results revealed that the aging process up-regulated anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial compounds such as dihydrocaffeic acid, 5-acetylsalicylic acid, verticine, <i>S</i>-allyl-L-cysteine and D-fucose. Oral AG obviously alleviated colitis, reducing colon damage and enhancing anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Streptococcus equinus</i> dramatically were enriched in the colon of mice with colitis that were strongly associated with Parkinson's disease, bacterial invasion of epithelial cells, aerobactin biosynthesis, and heme biosynthesis, but a distinct AG-mediated alteration in the colon due to increasing abundance of <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i>, <i>Lactobacillus</i> sp. <i>L-YJ</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium breve</i>, <i>Blautia wexlerae</i>, <i>Desulfomicrobium</i> sp. <i>P100A</i>, and <i>Lentilactobacillus hilgardii</i> was observed. Next, we demonstrated that colonic microbiome reconstruction by oral AG significantly increased the production of short-chain fatty acids such as acetic acid, propionic acid, isobutyric acid, and isovaleric acid. This study provides the first data indicating that oral AG ameliorates colonic inflammation in a gut microbiota-dependent manner. Our findings provide novel insights into the AG-mediated remission of colitis and AG as a functional food for modulating the gut microbiota to prevent and treat colitis.",Food & function,2024,Deping Han; Xuke Guan; Fengxia Zhu; Qing Yang; Dingding Su

Additionally, the role played by the gut in these diseases can be seen as a paradigm for how the gut and the brain interact.We mentioned significant GI symptoms and discussed how the GI tract affects central nervous system illnesses, including depression, anxiety, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease in this study. We also explored potential pathophysiological underpinnings and novel targets for the creation of future therapies targeted at gut-brain connections.In this situation, modulating the gut microbiota through the administration of fecal microbiota transplants or probiotics may represent a new therapeutic option for this population, not only to treat GI problems but also behavioral problems, given the role that dysbiosis and leaky gut play in many neurological disorders.Accurate diagnosis and treatment of co-existing illnesses also require coordination between psychiatrists, neurologists, gastroenterologists, and other specialties, as well as a thorough history and thorough physical examination.",CNS & neurological disorders drug targets,2024,Ian Richard Lucena Andriolo; Bruna Longo; Dayse Machado de Melo; MÃ¡rcia Maria de Souza; Rui Daniel Prediger; Luisa Mota da Silva

In recent years, stress have emerged as hot keywords, particularly depression, human immunodeficiency virus-associated neurocognitive disorders, blood-brain barrier, gut microbiota related directions, indicating a potential shift in research focus.Research on the virus and neuroinflammation has attracted increasing attention in the past decade. European and American countries have been pivotal in conducting research on virus and neuroinflammation, while China has produced a significant number of publications, its impact is still limited. Stress is likely to emerge as the next area of focus in this field. The association and regulation between viral infection and psychiatric disorders are not fully understood, and further research is needed to explore the role of neuroinflammation caused by different types of viral infection and psychiatric disorders.",Frontiers in immunology,2024,Danyang Li; Minghua Wu
39461950,Microbial biomarker discovery in Parkinson's disease through a network-based approach.,"Associations between the gut microbiota and Parkinson's disease (PD) have been widely investigated. However, the replicable biomarkers for PD diagnosis across multiple populations remain elusive. Herein, we performed a meta-analysis to investigate the pivotal role of the gut microbiome in PD and its potential diagnostic implications. Six 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequence datasets from five independent studies were integrated, encompassing 550 PD and 456 healthy control samples. The analysis revealed significant alterations in microbial composition and alpha and beta diversity, emphasizing altered gut microbiota in PD. Specific microbial taxa, including Faecalibacterium, Roseburia, and Coprococcus_2, known as butyrate producers, were notably diminished in PD, potentially contributing to intestinal inflammation. Conversely, genera such as Akkermansia and Bilophila exhibited increased relative abundances. A network-based algorithm called NetMoss was utilized to identify potential biomarkers of PD. Afterwards, a classification model incorporating 11 optimized genera demonstrated high performance. Further functional analyses indicated enrichment in pathways related to neurodegeneration and metabolic pathways. These findings illuminate the intricate relationship between the gut microbiota and PD, offering insights into potential therapeutic interventions and personalized diagnostic strategies.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2024,Zhe Zhao; Jing Chen; Danhua Zhao; Baoyu Chen; Qi Wang; Yuan Li; Junyi Chen; Chaobo Bai; Xintong Guo; Nan Hu; Bingwei Zhang; Rongsheng Zhao; Junliang Yuan
39309265,Effect of <i>BF</i>839â+âearthworm protein supplement on motor and some non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease: a randomized clinical trial.,"Some studies have found that probiotics have the potential to treat PD, and earthworm protein is a traditional Chinese medicine used for the treatment of PD. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of <i>Bacteroides fragilis</i> 839 (<i>BF</i>839)â+âearthworm protein supplement as an adjunctive therapy for PD and to observe changes in the gut microbiota.Forty-six patients with PD were recruited for a 12-week 1:1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate changes in motor and some non-motor symptom scores and detect metagenomic changes in the gut microbiota.From baseline to 12âweeks, compared with placebo, the trial group showed significant reductions in the United Parkinson's Disease Rate Scale (UPDRS) total score (-7.74âÂ±â5.92 vs. -1.83âÂ±â4.14, <i>p</i>â<â0.001), UPDRS part I (-0.72âÂ±â0.81 vs. -0.20âÂ±â0.72, <i>p</i>â=â0.026), UPDRS part II (-2.50âÂ±â2.24 vs. -0.22âÂ±â1.98, <i>p</i>â=â0.001), UPDRS part III (-3.43âÂ±â3.42 vs. -1.33âÂ±â2.65, <i>p</i>â=â0.024), and UPDRS part IV (-1.13âÂ±â1.19 vs. -0.15âÂ±â0.57, <i>p</i>â=â0.001). Significant reductions in the Hamilton Depression Scale-24 score (-3.91âÂ±â3.99 vs. +1.15âÂ±â3.42, <i>p</i>â<â0.001), Self-Rating Anxiety Scale scores (-7.04âÂ±â5.71 vs. -1.23âÂ±â2.34, <i>p</i>â<â0.001), and Constipation scoring system scores (-8.59âÂ±â4.75 vs. 0.27âÂ±â1.24, <i>p</i>â<â0.001), were also noted. In the trial group, one patient experienced mild eczema and one suffered low blood pressure, which could not be conclusively attributed to supplementation. Compared to the placebo group, the trial group showed a marked increase in <i>Enterococcus faecium</i> and a decrease in <i>Klebsiella.</i>This study is the first to report that probiotics plus earthworm protein can remarkably improve the motor and some non-motor symptoms of PD without serious adverse effects. However, further clinical trials and exploration of the underlying mechanisms are required.Clinical trial registry http://www.chictr.org.cn/, Identification No: ChiCTR2000035122.",Frontiers in neurology,2024,Ting Zeng; Chuhui Lin; Yuhong Deng; Weiwen Zhu
38366179,Commensal protist Tritrichomonas musculus exhibits a dynamic life cycle that induces extensive remodeling of the gut microbiota.,"Commensal protists and gut bacterial communities exhibit complex relationships, mediated at least in part through host immunity. To improve our understanding of this tripartite interplay, we investigated community and functional dynamics between the murine protist Tritrichomonas musculus and intestinal bacteria in healthy and B-cell-deficient mice. We identified dramatic, protist-driven remodeling of resident microbiome growth and activities, in parallel with Tritrichomonas musculus functional changes, which were accelerated in the absence of B cells. Metatranscriptomic data revealed nutrient-based competition between bacteria and the protist. Single-cell transcriptomics identified distinct Tritrichomonas musculus life stages, providing new evidence for trichomonad sexual replication and the formation of pseudocysts. Unique cell states were validated in situ through microscopy and flow cytometry. Our results reveal complex microbial dynamics during the establishment of a commensal protist in the gut, and provide valuable data sets to drive future mechanistic studies.",The ISME journal,2024,Ana Popovic; Eric Y Cao; Joanna Han; Nirvana Nursimulu; Eliza V C Alves-Ferreira; Kyle Burrows; Andrea Kennard; Noor Alsmadi; Michael E Grigg; Arthur Mortha; John Parkinson
39143178,Metagenome-assembled microbial genomes from Parkinson's disease fecal samples.,"The human gut microbiome composition has been linked to Parkinson's disease (PD). However, knowledge of the gut microbiota on the genome level is still limited. Here we performed deep metagenomic sequencing and binning to build metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from 136 human fecal microbiomes (68 PD samples and 68 control samples). We constructed 952 non-redundant high-quality MAGs and compared them between PD and control groups. Among these MAGs, there were 22 different genomes of Collinsella and Prevotella, indicating high variability of those genera in the human gut environment. Microdiversity analysis indicated that Ruminococcus bromii was statistically significantly (pâ<â0.002) more diverse on the strain level in the control samples compared to the PD samples. In addition, by clustering all genes and performing presence-absence analysis between groups, we identified several control-specific (pâ<â0.05) related genes, such as speF and Fe-S oxidoreductase. We also report detailed annotation of MAGs, including Clusters of Orthologous Genes (COG), Cas operon type, antiviral gene, prophage, and secondary metabolites biosynthetic gene clusters, which can be useful for providing a reference for future studies.",Scientific reports,2024,Ilhan Cem Duru; Alexandre Lecomte; TÃ¢nia Keiko Shishido; Pia Laine; Joni Suppula; Lars Paulin; Filip Scheperjans; Pedro A B Pereira; Petri Auvinen
38375842,"Molecular Targets of Valeric Acid: A Bioactive Natural Product for Endocrine, Metabolic, and Immunological Disorders.","Postbiotics produced by gut microbiota have exhibited diverse pharmacological activities. Valeric acid, a postbiotic material produced by gut microbiota and some plant species like valerian, has been explored to have diverse pharmacological activities.This narrative review aims to summarise the beneficial role of valeric acid for different health conditions along with its underlying mechanism. In order to get ample scientific evidence, various databases like Science Direct, PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar and Google were exhaustively explored to collect relevant information. Collected data were arranged and analyzed to reach a meaningful conclusion regarding the bioactivity profiling of valeric acid, its mechanism, and future prospects.Valeric acid belongs to short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) compounds like acetate, propionate, butyrate, pentanoic (valeric) acid, and hexanoic (caproic) acid. Valeric acid has been identified as one of the potent histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. In different preclinical in -vitro and in-vivo studies, valeric acid has been found to have anti-cancer, anti-diabetic, antihypertensive, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory activity and affects molecular pathways of different diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and epilepsy.These findings highlight the role of valeric acid as a potential novel therapeutic agent for endocrine, metabolic and immunity-related health conditions, and it must be tested under clinical conditions to develop as a promising drug.","Endocrine, metabolic & immune disorders drug targets",2024,Bindu Kumari; Usha Kumari; Dhananjay Kumar Singh; Gulam Mohammed Husain; Dinesh Kumar Patel; Anshul Shakya; Ravi Bhushan Singh; Gyan Prakash Modi; Gireesh Kumar Singh
39406307,Lactiplantibacillus plantarum SG5 inhibits neuroinflammation in MPTP-induced PD mice through GLP-1/PGC-1Î± pathway.,"Mounting evidence suggests that alterations in gut microbial composition play an active role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Probiotics are believed to modulate gut microbiota, potentially influencing PD development through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. However, the potential beneficial effects of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum SG5 (formerly known as Lactobacillus plantarum, abbreviated as L. plantarum) on PD and its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we employed immunofluorescence, Western blotting, ELISA, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to investigate the neuroprotective effects of L. plantarum SG5 against neuroinflammation in an MPTP-induced PD model and to explore the underlying mechanisms. Our results demonstrated that L. plantarum SG5 ameliorated MPTP-induced motor deficits, dopaminergic neuron loss, and elevated Î±-synuclein protein levels. Furthermore, SG5 inhibited MPTP-triggered overactivation of microglia and astrocytes in the substantia nigra (SN), attenuated disruption of both blood-brain and intestinal barriers, and suppressed the release of inflammatory factors in the colon and SN. Notably, SG5 modulated the composition and structure of the gut microbiota in mice. The MPTP-induced decrease in colonic GLP-1 secretion was reversed by SG5 treatment, accompanied by increased expression of GLP-1R and PGC-1Î± in the SN. Importantly, the GLP-1R antagonist Exendin 9-39 and PGC-1Î± inhibitor SR18292 attenuated the protective effects of SG5 in PD mice. In conclusion, we demonstrate a neuroprotective role of L. plantarum SG5 in the MPTP-induced PD mouse model, which likely involves modulation of the gut microbiota and, significantly, the GLP-1/PGC-1Î± signaling pathway.",Experimental neurology,2024,Yueyan Qi; Yuxuan Dong; Jinhu Chen; Siyou Xie; Xin Ma; Xueping Yu; Yang Yu; Yanqin Wang
38539626,"<i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> Is Beneficial to a Mouse Model of Parkinson's Disease, via Alleviated Neuroinflammation and Promoted Neurogenesis, with Involvement of SCFAs.","Increasing evidence suggests that the gut microbiota may represent potential strategies for Parkinson's disease (PD) treatment. Our previous research revealed a decreased abundance of <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> (Akk) in PD mice; however, whether Akk is beneficial to PD is unknown. To answer this question, the mice received MPTP intraperitoneally to construct a subacute model of PD and were then supplemented with Akk orally for 21 consecutive days. Motor function, dopaminergic neurons, neuroinflammation, and neurogenesis were examined. In addition, intestinal inflammation, and serum and fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) analyses, were assessed. We found that Akk treatment effectively inhibited the reduction of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and partially improved the motor function in PD mice. Additionally, Akk markedly alleviated neuroinflammation in the striatum and hippocampus and promoted hippocampal neurogenesis. It also decreased the level of colon inflammation. Furthermore, these aforementioned changes are mainly accompanied by alterations in serum and fecal isovaleric acid levels, and lower intestinal permeability. Our research strongly suggests that Akk is a potential neuroprotective agent for PD therapy.",Brain sciences,2024,Chen-Meng Qiao; Wen-Yan Huang; Yu Zhou; Wei Quan; Gu-Yu Niu; Ting Li; Mei-Xuan Zhang; Jian Wu; Li-Ping Zhao; Wei-Jiang Zhao; Chun Cui; Yan-Qin Shen
39367119,Synbiotic supplementation may globally improve non-motor symptoms in patients with stable Parkinson's disease: results from an open label single-arm study.,"Gut microbiota changes and brain-gut-axis (BGA) dysregulation are common in people with Parkinson's Disease (PD). Probiotics and prebiotics are emerging as a potential therapeutic approach for PD patients. The aim of this paper was to assess the neurological and gastroenterological effects in PD patients with constipation after the administration of a synbiotic product, with a focus on behavioral and cognitive symptoms. We enrolled patients with stable PD who met diagnostic criteria for functional constipation and/or irritable bowel syndrome with constipation according to Rome IV Criteria. Patients received a synbiotic treatment (Enterolactis Duo, containing the probiotic strain Lacticaseibacillus paracasei DG and the prebiotic fiber inulin) for 12Â weeks. A neurological and a gastroenterological evaluation were collected before and after the treatment. In addition, 16S rRNA gene profiling and short chain fatty acid quantification were performed to characterize the microbial ecosystem of fecal samples collected before (nâ=â22) and after (nâ=â9) the synbiotic administration. 30 patients were consecutively enrolled. After treatment, patients performed better in MDS-UPDRS part 1 (pâ=â0.000), SCOPA-AUT (pâ=â0.001), TAS-20 (pâ=â0.014), HAM-D (pâ=â0.026), DIFt (pâ=â0.003), PAS-A (pâ=â0.048). Gastroenterological evaluations showed improvements in PAC-SYM score (pâ<â0.001), number of complete bowel movement (pâ<â0.001) and BSFS (pâ<â0.001). After the synbiotic administration, we observed a significant increase in the abundance of the order Oscillospirales, as well as the Oscillospiraceae family and the species Faecalibacterium prausnitzii within this order in fecal samples. Synbiotic treatment demonstrates potential efficacy in ameliorating non-motor features in PD patients.",Scientific reports,2024,V Andreozzi; S Cuoco; M Balestrieri; F Fierro; N Ferrara; R Erro; M Di Filippo; G Barbella; M C Memoli; A Silvestri; M Squillante; S Guglielmetti; P Barone; P Iovino; M T Pellecchia
38796044,Rosmarinic acid mitigates intestinal inflammation and oxidative stress in bullfrogs (Lithobates catesbeiana) fed high soybean meal diets.,"High proportions of soybean meal in aquafeed have been confirmed to induce various intestinal pathologies. This study aims to investigate the regulatory effects of rosmarinic acid (RA), an antioxidant with anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, when added to high soybean meal feeds in different doses, (0, 0.5, 1, and 4Â g/kg). During the 56-day feeding trial, results indicated that, compared to the control group without RA (0Â g/kg), the 1Â g/kg and 4Â g/kg RA groups increased bullfrog survival rates and total weight gain while reducing feed coefficient. Additionally, these doses markedly suppressed the expression of key intestinal inflammatory markers (tlr5, myd88, tnfÎ±, il1Î², cxcl8, cxcl12) and the activity and content of intestinal antioxidants (CAT, MDA, GSH, GPX). Concurrently, RA significantly downregulated the transcription levels of antioxidant-related genes (cat, gpx5, cyba, cybb, mgst, gclc, gsta, gstp), suggesting RA's potential to alleviate intestinal inflammation and oxidative stress induced by high soybean meal and to help downregulate and restore normal expression of antioxidant enzyme genes. However, the 0.5Â g/kg RA group did not show a significant improvement in survival rates; instead, it upregulated the transcription of some antioxidant genes (cat, gpx5, cyba, cybb), revealing the complexity and dose-dependency of RA's antioxidant action. Furthermore, RA supplementation significantly reshaped the intestinal microbial community structure and relative abundance in bullfrogs, particularly affecting the genera Hafnia, Phascolarctobacterium, and Lactococcus. Notably, high doses of RA (1Â g/kg, 4Â g/kg) were able to downregulate pathways associated with the enrichment of gut microbiota in diseases such as Parkinson's, Staphylococcus aureus infection, and Systemic lupus erythematosus, suggesting its potential in anti-inflammatory action and health maintenance to prevent potential diseases.",Fish & shellfish immunology,2024,Bo Zhu; Shude Xu; Junzhi Zhang; Shuhui Xiang; Yi Hu
39302939,Water extract of ginseng alleviates parkinsonism in MPTP-induced Parkinson's disease mice.,"In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effect of a water extract of ginseng (WEG) obtained via low-temperature extraction of the brain of mice with Parkinson's disease (PD) and the ameliorative effect on the damaged intestinal system for the treatment of dyskinesia in PD mice. MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) was injected intraperitoneally into male C57BL/6 mice to establish a PD model, and WEG was given via oral gavage. The results indicated that WEG could protect the damaged neuronal cells of the mice brain, inhibit the aggregation of Î±-synuclein (Î±-Syn) in the brain, and increase the positive expression rate of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). WEG significantly improved intestinal damage and regulated intestinal disorders (P<0.05). WEG intervention increased the levels of beneficial bacteria, such as Lactobacillus, and normalized the abundance and diversity of colonies in the intestine of mice. Our results suggested that WEG protected neurons in the brain of PD mice via inhibiting the aggregation of Î±-Syn in the brain and increasing the positive expression level of TH in the brain. WEG regulated the gut microbiota of mice, improved the behavioral disorders of PD mice, and offered some therapeutic effects on PD mice.",PloS one,2024,Ning Xu; Shuyang Xing; Jie Li; Bo Pang; Meichen Liu; Meiling Fan; Yu Zhao
38997651,Identification of volatile metabolites produced from levodopa metabolism by different bacteria strains of the gut microbiome.,"Interspecies pathways in the gut microbiome have been shown to metabolize levodopa, the primary treatment for Parkinson's disease, and reduce its bioavailability. While the enzymatic reactions have been identified, the ability to establish the resulting macromolecules as biomarkers of microbial metabolism remains technically challenging. In this study, we leveraged an untargeted mass spectrometry-based approach to investigate volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced during levodopa metabolism by Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium sporogenes, and Eggerthella lenta. We cultured these organisms with and without their respective bioactive metabolites and detected levodopa-induced shifts in VOC profiles. We then utilized bioinformatics to identify significant differences in 2,6-dimethylpyrazine, 4,6-dimethylpyrimidine, and 4,5-dimethylpyrimidine associated with its biotransformation. Supplementing cultures with inhibitors of levodopa-metabolizing enzymes revealed specific modulation of levodopa-associated diazines, verifying their relationship to its metabolism. Furthermore, functional group analysis depicts strain-specific VOC profiles that reflect interspecies differences in metabolic activity that can be leveraged to assess microbiome functionality in individual patients. Collectively, this work identifies previously uncharacterized metabolites of microbe-mediated levodopa metabolism to determine potential indicators of this activity and further elucidate the metabolic capabilities of different gut bacteria.",BMC microbiology,2024,Taylor Pennington; Jarrett Eshima; Barbara S Smith
39310761,Identification of proteotoxic and proteoprotective bacteria that non-specifically affect proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases.,"There are no cures for neurodegenerative protein conformational diseases (PCDs), such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD). Emerging evidence suggests the gut microbiota plays a role in their pathogenesis, though the influences of specific bacteria on disease-associated proteins remain elusive. Here, we reveal the effects of 229 human bacterial isolates on the aggregation and toxicity of AÎ²<sub>1-42</sub>, Î±-synuclein, and polyglutamine tracts in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> expressing these culprit proteins. Our findings demonstrate that bacterial effects on host protein aggregation are consistent across different culprit proteins, suggesting that microbes affect protein stability by modulating host proteostasis rather than selectively targeting disease-associated proteins. Furthermore, we found that feeding <i>C.Â elegans</i> proteoprotective <i>Prevotella corporis</i> activates the heat shock response, revealing an unexpected discovery of a microbial influence on host proteostasis. Insight into how individual bacteria affect PCD proteins could open new strategies for prevention and treatment by altering the abundance of microbes.",iScience,2024,Alyssa C Walker; Rohan Bhargava; Michael J Bucher; Yoan M Argote; Amanda S Brust; Daniel M CzyÅ¼
