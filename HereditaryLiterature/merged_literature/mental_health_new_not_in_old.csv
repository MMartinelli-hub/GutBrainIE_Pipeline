35151796,Brain-gut-microbiota axis in depression: A historical overview and future directions.,"Depression is the most common mental disorder and a leading cause of disability worldwide. Despite abundant research, the precise mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of depression remain elusive. Accumulating evidence from preclinical and clinical studies suggests that alterations in the gut microbiota, microbe-derived short-chain fatty acids, D-amino acids and metabolites play a key role in the pathophysiology of depression via the brain-gut-microbiota axis, including the neural and immune systems. Notably, the brain-gut-microbiota axis might play a crucial role in susceptibility versus resilience in rodents exposed to stress. Vagotomy is reported to block depression-like phenotypes in rodents after fecal microbiota transplantation of ""depression-related"" microbiome, suggesting that the vagus nerve influences depression through the brain-gut-microbiota axis. In this article, we review recent findings regarding the brain-gut-microbiota axis in depression and discuss its potential as a therapeutic target for depression.",Brain research bulletin,2022,Lijia Chang; Yan Wei; Kenji Hashimoto
35044528,"The microbiota-gut-brain axis: pathways to better brain health. Perspectives on what we know, what we need to investigate and how to put knowledge into practice.","The gut and brain link via various metabolic and signalling pathways, each with the potential to influence mental, brain and cognitive health. Over the past decade, the involvement of the gut microbiota in gut-brain communication has become the focus of increased scientific interest, establishing the microbiota-gut-brain axis as a field of research. There is a growing number of association studies exploring the gut microbiota's possible role in memory, learning, anxiety, stress, neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Consequently, attention is now turning to how the microbiota can become the target of nutritional and therapeutic strategies for improved brain health and well-being. However, while such strategies that target the gut microbiota to influence brain health and function are currently under development with varying levels of success, still very little is yet known about the triggers and mechanisms underlying the gut microbiota's apparent influence on cognitive or brain function and most evidence comes from pre-clinical studies rather than well controlled clinical trials/investigations. Filling the knowledge gaps requires establishing a standardised methodology for human studies, including strong guidance for specific focus areas of the microbiota-gut-brain axis, the need for more extensive biological sample analyses, and identification of relevant biomarkers. Other urgent requirements are new advanced models for in vitro and in vivo studies of relevant mechanisms, and a greater focus on omics technologies with supporting bioinformatics resources (training, tools) to efficiently translate study findings, as well as the identification of relevant targets in study populations. The key to building a validated evidence base rely on increasing knowledge sharing and multi-disciplinary collaborations, along with continued public-private funding support. This will allow microbiota-gut-brain axis research to move to its next phase so we can identify realistic opportunities to modulate the microbiota for better brain health.",Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,2022,Anirikh Chakrabarti; Lucie Geurts; Lesley Hoyles; Patricia Iozzo; Aletta D Kraneveld; Giorgio La Fata; Michela Miani; Elaine Patterson; Bruno Pot; Colette Shortt; David Vauzour
36099873,The microbiota-gut-brain axis in sleep disorders.,"Sleep is a complex physiological process and is a critical determinant of physical and mental health. In the past decades, significant progress has been made in understanding the neural mechanisms of sleep and awakening. However, the initiation and maintenance of the sleep-wake cycle is regulated not only by the central system but is also affected by signals from peripheral tissues. Growing evidence shows that the microbiota-gut-brain axis contributes to the regulation of sleep behavior both directly and indirectly and may play a critical role in the etiology and pathogenesis of sleep disorders. Sleep deprivation leads to dysfunction of gut microbiota and sleep disorders are accompanied by altered gut microbiota composition. In this review, we describe the bidirectional relationships between sleep and gut microbiota and summarize the abnormal characteristics of gut bacteria in distinct conditions including sleep disturbances, sleep disorders and sleep disorders comorbid with neuropsychiatric disorders. We also examine the potential routes of microbiota-gut-brain axis in sleep and gut microbiome interactions, including metabolic, immune, and neural pathways, and propose microbiota-targeted interventions for improving sleep. Manipulating gut microbiota may be a promising avenue for the development of novel interventions for sleep disorders.",Sleep medicine reviews,2022,Zhe Wang; Zhong Wang; Tangsheng Lu; Wenhao Chen; Wei Yan; Kai Yuan; Le Shi; Xiaoxing Liu; Xinyu Zhou; Jie Shi; Michael V Vitiello; Ying Han; Lin Lu
35194166,"A systematic review of gut microbiota composition in observational studies of major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.","The emerging understanding of gut microbiota as 'metabolic machinery' influencing many aspects of physiology has gained substantial attention in the field of psychiatry. This is largely due to the many overlapping pathophysiological mechanisms associated with both the potential functionality of the gut microbiota and the biological mechanisms thought to be underpinning mental disorders. In this systematic review, we synthesised the current literature investigating differences in gut microbiota composition in people with the major psychiatric disorders, major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SZ), compared to 'healthy' controls. We also explored gut microbiota composition across disorders in an attempt to elucidate potential commonalities in the microbial signatures associated with these mental disorders. Following the PRISMA guidelines, databases were searched from inception through to December 2021. We identified 44 studies (including a total of 2510 psychiatric cases and 2407 controls) that met inclusion criteria, of which 24 investigated gut microbiota composition in MDD, seven investigated gut microbiota composition in BD, and 15 investigated gut microbiota composition in SZ. Our syntheses provide no strong evidence for a difference in the number or distribution (α-diversity) of bacteria in those with a mental disorder compared to controls. However, studies were relatively consistent in reporting differences in overall community composition (β-diversity) in people with and without mental disorders. Our syntheses also identified specific bacterial taxa commonly associated with mental disorders, including lower levels of bacterial genera that produce short-chain fatty acids (e.g. butyrate), higher levels of lactic acid-producing bacteria, and higher levels of bacteria associated with glutamate and GABA metabolism. We also observed substantial heterogeneity across studies with regards to methodologies and reporting. Further prospective and experimental research using new tools and robust guidelines hold promise for improving our understanding of the role of the gut microbiota in mental and brain health and the development of interventions based on modification of gut microbiota.",Molecular psychiatry,2022,A J McGuinness; J A Davis; S L Dawson; A Loughman; F Collier; M O'Hely; C A Simpson; J Green; W Marx; C Hair; G Guest; M Mohebbi; M Berk; D Stupart; D Watters; F N Jacka
36093196,Gut microbiota: Linking nutrition and perinatal depression.,"Perinatal depression is a mood disorder that is reported in women during pregnancy (prenatal) and after childbirth (postnatal). The onset of perinatal depression is associated with changes in reproductive hormones, stress hormones and neurosteroids. These chemical compounds can be modulated by the gut microbiota, which may affect maternal mental health during the perinatal period <i>via</i> the gut-brain-axis. Recent studies suggest that nutritional and dietary interventions (vitamin D, ω-3 fatty acids, iron, and fiber) effectively prevent or mitigate maternal depression and anxiety, but their efficacy is confounded by various factors, including the gut microbiota. Probiotics are efficacious in maintaining microbiota homeostasis, and thus, have the potential to modulate the development of perinatal mood disorders, despite no evidence in human. Therefore, clinical trials are warranted to investigate the role of probiotic supplementation in perinatal depression and behavioral changes. This article reviews the interplay between nutrition, gut microbiota and mood and cognition, and the evidence suggesting that probiotics affect the onset and development of perinatal depression.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2022,Jia Song; Bi Zhou; Juntao Kan; Guangya Liu; Sheng Zhang; Liang Si; Xianping Zhang; Xue Yang; Junhua Ma; Junrui Cheng; Yongde Yang; Xiaobo Liu
35631252,Medicinal Plants and Their Impact on the Gut Microbiome in Mental Health: A Systematic Review.,"Various neurocognitive and mental health-related conditions have been associated with the gut microbiome, implicating a microbiome-gut-brain axis (MGBA). The aim of this systematic review was to identify, categorize, and review clinical evidence supporting medicinal plants for the treatment of mental disorders and studies on their interactions with the gut microbiota.This review included medicinal plants for which clinical studies on depression, sleeping disorders, anxiety, or cognitive dysfunction as well as scientific evidence of interaction with the gut microbiome were available. The studies were reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement.Eighty-five studies met the inclusion criteria and covered thirty mental health-related medicinal plants with data on interaction with the gut microbiome.Only a few studies have been specifically designed to assess how herbal preparations affect MGBA-related targets or pathways. However, many studies provide hints of a possible interaction with the MGBA, such as an increased abundance of health-beneficial microorganisms, anti-inflammatory effects, or MGBA-related pathway effects by gut microbial metabolites. Data for <i>Panax ginseng</i>, <i>Schisandra chinensis</i>, and <i>Salvia rosmarinus</i> indicate that the interaction of their constituents with the gut microbiota could mediate mental health benefits. Studies specifically assessing the effects on MGBA-related pathways are still required for most medicinal plants.",Nutrients,2022,Eva-Maria Pferschy-Wenzig; Manuela R Pausan; Karin Ardjomand-Woelkart; Stefanie Röck; Ramy M Ammar; Olaf Kelber; Christine Moissl-Eichinger; Rudolf Bauer
35444255,"Multi-omics analyses of serum metabolome, gut microbiome and brain function reveal dysregulated microbiota-gut-brain axis in bipolar depression.","The intricate processes of microbiota-gut-brain communication in modulating human cognition and emotion, especially in the context of mood disorders, have remained elusive. Here we performed faecal metagenomic, serum metabolomics and neuroimaging studies on a cohort of 109 unmedicated patients with depressed bipolar disorder (BD) patients and 40 healthy controls (HCs) to characterise the microbial-gut-brain axis in BD. Across over 12,000 measured metabolic features, we observed a large discrepancy (73.54%) in the serum metabolome between BD patients and HCs, spotting differentially abundant microbial-derived neuroactive metabolites including multiple B-vitamins, kynurenic acid, gamma-aminobutyric acid and short-chain fatty acids. These metabolites could be linked to the abundance of gut microbiota presented with corresponding biosynthetic potentials, including Akkermansia muciniphila, Citrobacter spp. (Citrobacter freundii and Citrobacter werkmanii), Phascolarctobacterium spp., Yersinia spp. (Yersinia frederiksenii and Yersinia aleksiciae), Enterobacter spp. (Enterobacter cloacae and Enterobacter kobei) and Flavobacterium spp. Based on functional neuroimaging, BD-related neuroactive microbes and metabolites were discovered as potential markers associated with BD-typical features of functional connectivity of brain networks, hinting at aberrant cognitive function, emotion regulation, and interoception. Our study combines gut microbiota and neuroactive metabolites with brain functional connectivity, thereby revealing potential signalling pathways from the microbiota to the gut and the brain, which may have a role in the pathophysiology of BD.",Molecular psychiatry,2022,Zhiming Li; Jianbo Lai; Peifen Zhang; Jiahong Ding; Jiajun Jiang; Chuanfa Liu; Huimin Huang; Hefu Zhen; Caixi Xi; Yuzhe Sun; Lingling Wu; Lifang Wang; Xingle Gao; Yan Li; Yaoyang Fu; Zhuye Jie; Shenghui Li; Danhua Zhang; Yiqing Chen; Yiyi Zhu; Shaojia Lu; Jing Lu; Dandan Wang; Hetong Zhou; Xiuxia Yuan; Xue Li; Lijuan Pang; Manli Huang; Huanming Yang; Wenwei Zhang; Susanne Brix; Karsten Kristiansen; Xueqin Song; Chao Nie; Shaohua Hu
35819136,"Antibiotics and mental health: The good, the bad and the ugly.","Antibiotics are recognised as, on occasion, producing psychiatric side effects, most notably depression and anxiety. Apart from antimicrobial activity, antibiotics have multiple off-target effects. The brain-gut-microbiota axis has multiple sites for off-target activity, which may produce either positive or negative antibiotic effects. Here we review how antibiotics impact mental health by acting through the brain-gut-microbiota axis. Microbes in the gut influence brain function by acting through the vagus nerve or by altering the production of short-chain fatty acids or the amino acid tryptophan, the building block of serotonin. Not all antimicrobial actions of antibiotics have a negative impact. The first antidepressant discovered was actually an antibiotic: isoniazid is an antibacterial drug developed for treating tuberculosis. Minocycline, which enters the brain and mediates its effects through microglia, shows antidepressant activity. Some antibiotics bring about a significant decrease in gut microbial diversity, and this is viewed as a risk factor for depression. Other risk factors induced by antibiotics include altered gut barrier function, activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, reducing levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor or oxytocin and alteration of vagal tone. Although most patients taking antibiotics do not suffer from an iatrogenic psychiatric disorder, some do. As clinicians, we need to keep this in mind. The development of new antibiotics is primarily focused on antibiotic resistance, but efforts should be made to reduce off-target brain-gut-microbiota effects resulting in mental health problems.",Journal of internal medicine,2022,Katherine Dinan; Timothy Dinan
36145184,The Burden of Carbohydrates in Health and Disease.,"Foods high in carbohydrates are an important part of a healthy diet, since they provide the body with glucose to support bodily functions and physical activity. However, the abusive consumption of refined, simple, and low-quality carbohydrates has a direct implication on the physical and mental pathophysiology. Then, carbohydrate consumption is postulated as a crucial factor in the development of the main Western diseases of the 21st century. We conducted this narrative critical review using MedLine (Pubmed), Cochrane (Wiley), Embase, and CinAhl databases with the MeSH-compliant keywords: carbohydrates and evolution, development, phylogenetic, GUT, microbiota, stress, metabolic health, consumption behaviors, metabolic disease, cardiovascular disease, mental disease, anxiety, depression, cancer, chronic kidney failure, allergies, and asthma in order to analyze the impact of carbohydrates on health. Evidence suggests that carbohydrates, especially fiber, are beneficial for the well-being and growth of gut microorganisms and consequently for the host in this symbiotic relationship, producing microbial alterations a negative effect on mental health and different organic systems. In addition, evidence suggests a negative impact of simple carbohydrates and refined carbohydrates on mood categories, including alertness and tiredness, reinforcing a vicious circle. Regarding physical health, sugar intake can affect the development and prognosis of metabolic disease, as an uncontrolled intake of refined carbohydrates puts individuals at risk of developing metabolic syndrome and subsequently developing metabolic disease.",Nutrients,2022,Vicente Javier Clemente-Suárez; Juan Mielgo-Ayuso; Alexandra Martín-Rodríguez; Domingo Jesús Ramos-Campo; Laura Redondo-Flórez; Jose Francisco Tornero-Aguilera

We conducted a systematic review of 24 observational studies (n = 2817), and 19 interventional trials (n = 1119). We assessed alpha diversity, beta diversity, and taxa abundance changes in patients with MDD relative to HC, as well as the effect of prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics on depressive symptoms in individuals with clinical or subclinical depression. We observed no significant differences in alpha diversity but a significant difference in beta diversity between patients with MDD and HC. There were fluctuations in the abundance of specific taxa in patients with MDD relative to HC. Probiotic and synbiotic, but not prebiotic, treatment showed a modest benefit in reducing depressive symptoms in patients with MDD over four to nine weeks. The GMB profiles of patients with MDD differ significantly from HC, but further studies are needed to elucidate the benefits of prebiotic, probiotic and synbiotic treatments relative to antidepressants and over longer follow-up before these therapies are implemented into clinical practice.",International journal of molecular sciences,2022,Sauliha R Alli; Ilona Gorbovskaya; Jonathan C W Liu; Nathan J Kolla; Lisa Brown; Daniel J Müller
35743087,"Drugs, Guts, Brains, but Not Rock and Roll: The Need to Consider the Role of Gut Microbiota in Contemporary Mental Health and Wellness of Emerging Adults.","Emerging adulthood (ages 18-25) is a critical period for neurobiological development and the maturation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Recent findings also suggest that a natural perturbation of the gut microbiota (GM), combined with other factors, may create a unique vulnerability during this period of life. The GM of emerging adults is thought to be simpler, less diverse, and more unstable than either younger or older people. We postulate that this plasticity in the GM suggests a role in the rising mental health issues seen in westernized societies today via the gut-brain-microbiota axis. Studies have paid particular attention to the diversity of the microbiota, the specific function and abundance of bacteria, and the production of metabolites. In this narrative review, we focus specifically on diet, physical activity/exercise, substance use, and sleep in the context of the emerging adult. We propose that this is a crucial period for establishing a stable and more resilient microbiome for optimal health into adulthood. Recommendations will be made about future research into possible behavioral adjustments that may be beneficial to endorse during this critical period to reduce the probability of a ""dysbiotic"" GM and the emergence and severity of mental health concerns.",International journal of molecular sciences,2022,Ju Eun Lee; David Walton; Colleen P O'Connor; Michael Wammes; Jeremy P Burton; Elizabeth A Osuch
35831877,The gut-liver axis in sepsis: interaction mechanisms and therapeutic potential.,"Sepsis is a potentially fatal condition caused by dysregulation of the body's immune response to an infection. Sepsis-induced liver injury is considered a strong independent prognosticator of death in the critical care unit, and there is anatomic and accumulating epidemiologic evidence that demonstrates intimate cross talk between the gut and the liver. Intestinal barrier disruption and gut microbiota dysbiosis during sepsis result in translocation of intestinal pathogen-associated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular patterns into the liver and systemic circulation. The liver is essential for regulating immune defense during systemic infections via mechanisms such as bacterial clearance, lipopolysaccharide detoxification, cytokine and acute-phase protein release, and inflammation metabolic regulation. When an inappropriate immune response or overwhelming inflammation occurs in the liver, the impaired capacity for pathogen clearance and hepatic metabolic disturbance can result in further impairment of the intestinal barrier and increased disruption of the composition and diversity of the gut microbiota. Therefore, interaction between the gut and liver is a potential therapeutic target. This review outlines the intimate gut-liver cross talk (gut-liver axis) in sepsis.","Critical care (London, England)",2022,Xue Zhang; Hong Liu; Kenji Hashimoto; Shiying Yuan; Jiancheng Zhang
36458229,"Gut-Brain Axis, Neurodegeneration and Mental Health: A Personalized Medicine Perspective.","Neurological conditions such as neurodegenerative diseases and mental health disorders are a result of multifactorial underpinnings, leading to individual-based complex phenotypes. Demystification of these multifactorial connections will promote disease diagnosis and treatment. Personalized treatment rather than a one-size-fits-all approach would enable us to cater to the unmet healthcare needs based on protein-protein and gene-environment interactions. Gut-brain axis, as the name suggests, is a two-way biochemical communication pathway between the central nervous system (CNS) and enteric nervous system (ENS), enabling a mutual influence between brain and peripheral intestinal functions. The gut microbiota is a major component of this bidirectional communication, the composition of which is varied depending on the age, and disease conditions, among other factors. Gut microbiota profile is typically unique and personalized therapeutic intervention can aid in treating or delaying neurodegeneration and mental health conditions. Besides, research on the gut microbial influence on these conditions is gaining attention, and a better understanding of this concept can lead to identification of novel targeted therapies.",Indian journal of microbiology,2022,Alisha Chunduri; S Deepak Mohan Reddy; M Jahanavi; C Nagendranatha Reddy
35508109,Microbiota alterations in proline metabolism impact depression.,"The microbiota-gut-brain axis has emerged as a novel target in depression, a disorder with low treatment efficacy. However, the field is dominated by underpowered studies focusing on major depression not addressing microbiome functionality, compositional nature, or confounding factors. We applied a multi-omics approach combining pre-clinical models with three human cohorts including patients with mild depression. Microbial functions and metabolites converging onto glutamate/GABA metabolism, particularly proline, were linked to depression. High proline consumption was the dietary factor with the strongest impact on depression. Whole-brain dynamics revealed rich club network disruptions associated with depression and circulating proline. Proline supplementation in mice exacerbated depression along with microbial translocation. Human microbiota transplantation induced an emotionally impaired phenotype in mice and alterations in GABA-, proline-, and extracellular matrix-related prefrontal cortex genes. RNAi-mediated knockdown of proline and GABA transporters in Drosophila and mono-association with L. plantarum, a high GABA producer, conferred protection against depression-like states.

35157987,Brain-spleen axis in health and diseases: A review and future perspective.,"The spleen, an important tissue for the immune system, acts as a filter for blood within the immune system. Accumulating evidence suggests that the spleen affects a number of brain functions in health and diseases via immune modulation. Systemic inflammation or chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) can cause splenomegaly in rodents. Interestingly, the new antidepressant arketamine could normalize splenomegaly and depression-like behaviors in CSDS-susceptible mice. A recent study strongly supports the direct connection pathway between the brain and spleen, whereby the spleen can regulate the humoral immune defense by the two brain regions, such as corticotropin-related neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA). Furthermore, afferent and efferent vagus nerve signaling may contribute to brain and spleen communication.

36479494,Dietary supplements in neurological diseases and brain aging.,"A healthy diet shapes a healthy mind. Diet quality has a strong association with brain health. Diet influences the onset and consequences of neurological diseases, and dietary factors may influence mental health at individual and population level. The link between unhealthy diet, impaired cognitive function and neurodegenerative diseases indicates that adopting a healthy diet would ultimately afford prevention and management of neurological diseases and brain aging. Neurodegenerative diseases are of multifactorial origin and result in progressive loss of neuronal function in the brain, leading to cognitive impairment and motoneuron disorders. The so-called Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) with its healthy ingredients rich in antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immune, neuroprotective, antidepressant, antistress and senolytic activity plays an essential role in the prevention and management of neurological diseases and inhibits cognitive decline in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. The MedDiet also modulates the gut-brain axis by promoting a diversity of gut microbiota. In view of the importance of diet in neurological diseases management, this review focuses on the dietary components, natural compounds and medicinal plants that have proven beneficial in neurological diseases and for brain health. Among them, polyphenols, omega-3 fatty acids, B vitamins and several ayurvedic herbs have promising beneficial effects.",Journal of preventive medicine and hygiene,2022,Zakira Naureen; Kristjana Dhuli; Maria Chiara Medori; Paola Caruso; Paolo Manganotti; Pietro Chiurazzi; Matteo Bertelli

Psychobiotics are microbiota-targeted interventions that can result in mental health benefits and protect the aging brain. This study investigated the gut microbiome composition and predicted microbial functional pathways of middle-aged and older adults that met criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI), compared to neurologically healthy individuals, and investigated the impact of probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial. A total of 169 community-dwelling middle-aged (52-59 years) and older adults (60-75 years) received a three-month intervention and were randomized to probiotic and placebo groups. Participants were further subdivided based on cognitive status into groups with intact or impaired cognition and samples were collected at baseline and post supplementation.Microbiome analysis identified Prevotella ruminicola, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, and Bacteroides xylanisolvens as taxa correlated with MCI. Differential abundance analysis at baseline identified Prevotella as significantly more prevalent in MCI subjects compared to cognitively intact subjects (ALDEx2 P = 0.0017, ANCOM-BC P = 0.0004). A decrease in the relative abundance of the genus Prevotella and Dehalobacterium in response to LGG supplementation in the MCI group was correlated with an improved cognitive score.Our study points to specific members of the gut microbiota correlated with cognitive performance in middle-aged and older adults. Should findings be replicated, these taxa could be used as key early indicators of MCI and manipulated by probiotics, prebiotics, and symbiotics to promote successful cognitive aging.

35565888,The Role of the Microbiome-Brain-Gut Axis in the Pathogenesis of Depressive Disorder.,"The role of gut microbiota and its association with the central nervous system via the microbiome-brain-gut axis has been widely discussed in the literature. The aim of this review is to investigate the impact of gut microbiota on the development of depression and underlying molecular mechanisms. There are two possible pathways in which this interaction might occur. The first one suggests that depressive disorder could lead to dysbiosis and one of the causes may be the influence on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The second one considers if changes in the composition of gut microbiota might cause depressive disorder. The mechanisms that could be responsible for this interaction include the secretion of neurotransmitters, gut peptides and the activation of the immune system. However, current knowledge on this topic does not allow for us to state an unambiguous conclusion, and future studies that take into consideration more precise stress-measurement methods are needed to further explore direct mechanisms of the interaction between gut microbiota and mental health.",Nutrients,2022,Ewelina Młynarska; Joanna Gadzinowska; Julita Tokarek; Joanna Forycka; Aleksandra Szuman; Beata Franczyk; Jacek Rysz

Among these approaches, probiotic supplementation has been investigated most prominently, providing promising evidence for its use in improving mood and anxiety. There is also growing interest in the use of multistrain probiotics, whole dietary interventions or combined approaches, with encouraging results emerging from recent studies.Although the current literature preliminarily supports targeting the microbiota to manage mental health and use as adjuvant therapies for certain brain disorders, large gaps remain and especially data including clinical cohorts remains scarce.

36039924,The anti-inflammatory effects of a Mediterranean diet: a review.,"Chronic noncommunicable diseases remain the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and the majority are preventable with a healthy diet and lifestyle, but controversy remains as to the best approach. Greater adherence to a traditional Mediterranean diet has consistently been associated with lower morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease, diabetes and many cancers, and lower all-cause mortality. Despite the well known benefits on chronic disease risk there remains some scepticism as to the effects of this dietary pattern across populations outside the Mediterranean and the mechanisms of action of this traditional plant-based dietary pattern.This narrative review aims to summarize the latest evidence on the health protective effects of a traditional Mediterranean diet on chronic noncommunicable diseases, specifically focussing on the anti-inflammatory effects of this highly published dietary pattern.Recent high-quality evidence now supports a Mediterranean diet in secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease with impacts on atherosclerosis progression, likely through reduction of systemic inflammation and irrespective of changes in cholesterol or weight. The Mediterranean diet has a low Dietary Inflammatory Index illustrating its anti-inflammatory potential. This dietary pattern beneficially modulates the gut microbiota and immune system, including emerging evidence for efficacy against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (coronavirus disease 2019). Emerging evidence shows clinicians are not routinely recommending a Mediterranean diet despite well known evidence due to barriers such as lack of training, patient materials and concerns about potential patient adherence.The physiological mechanisms of action of this healthy diet pattern are becoming better understood to be multisystem and involving the gut. Larger controlled trials investigating mechanistic effects in broader non-Mediterranean populations are warranted.

A three-day food diary, rating scales for mental health, and multiple questionnaires will be completed. Biosamples (fecal-, urine-, saliva-, blood samples, and buccal swab) will be collected and used for 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of the oral and gut microbiome, measurements of serum factors, quantification of urine metabolites and host genotype, respectively. For longitudinal follow-up, data collection will be repeated after three years in the same groups. Integrative analysis of diet, gut microbiota, intestinal permeability, serum metabolites, and mental health will be conducted applying bioinformatics and systems biology approaches. Extensive population-based data of this quality has not been collected before, with collection repeated in three years' time, contributing to the high scientific value. The MMM-study follows the ""Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology"" (STROBE) guidelines. Approval has been obtained from the Icelandic National Bioethics Committee, and the study is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov. The study will contribute to an improved understanding of the links between diet, gut microbiota and mental health in children through good quality study design by collecting information on multiple components, and a longitudinal approach. Furthermore, the study creates knowledge on possibilities for targeted and more personalized dietary and lifestyle interventions in subgroups.

35276981,Effect of Probiotics on Psychiatric Symptoms and Central Nervous System Functions in Human Health and Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"The gut microbiota impacts on central nervous system (CNS) function via the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Thus, therapeutics targeting the gut microbiota such as probiotics have the potential for improving mental health. This meta-analysis synthesizes the evidence regarding the impacts of probiotics on psychological well-being, psychiatric symptoms and CNS functioning.The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were applied for executing this review using the databases PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane Library. The data were summarized at qualitative and quantitative level.Fifty-four randomized placebo-controlled studies were included, of which 30 were eligible for meta-analysis. If investigated, the probiotics mostly exerted effects on CNS function. Most probiotics did not affect mood, stress, anxiety, depression and psychiatric distress when compared to placebo at the qualitative level. At quantitative level, depression and psychiatric distress improved slightly in the probiotic condition (depression: mean difference -0.37 (95% CI: -0.55, -0.20); <i>p</i> ≤ 0.0001; psychiatric distress: mean difference -0.33 (95% CI: -0.53, -0.13); <i>p</i> = 0.001).To date it is unclear to which extent and in which specific areas next generation probiotics selected and developed for their ability to improve psychiatric condition and potentially other CNS functions are promising.",Nutrients,2022,Charlotte Le Morvan de Sequeira; Charlotte Hengstberger; Paul Enck; Isabelle Mack
36466655,"Gut microbiota, pathogenic proteins and neurodegenerative diseases.","As the world's population ages, neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) have brought a great burden to the world. However, effective treatment measures have not been found to alleviate the occurrence and development of NDs. Abnormal accumulation of pathogenic proteins is an important cause of NDs. Therefore, effective inhibition of the accumulation of pathogenic proteins has become a priority. As the second brain of human, the gut plays an important role in regulate emotion and cognition functions. Recent studies have reported that the disturbance of gut microbiota (GM) is closely related to accumulation of pathogenic proteins in NDs. On the one hand, pathogenic proteins directly produced by GM are transmitted from the gut to the central center <i>via</i> vagus nerve. On the other hand, The harmful substances produced by GM enter the peripheral circulation through intestinal barrier and cause inflammation, or cross the blood-brain barrier into the central center to cause inflammation, and cytokines produced by the central center cause the production of pathogenic proteins. These pathogenic proteins can produced by the above two aspects can cause the activation of central microglia and further lead to NDs development. In addition, certain GM and metabolites have been shown to have neuroprotective effects. Therefore, modulating GM may be a potential clinical therapeutic approach for NDs. In this review, we summarized the possible mechanism of NDs caused by abnormal accumulation of pathogenic proteins mediated by GM to induce the activation of central microglia, cause central inflammation and explore the therapeutic potential of dietary therapy and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in NDs.",Frontiers in microbiology,2022,Wei Wei; Shixu Wang; Chongchong Xu; Xuemei Zhou; Xinqing Lian; Lin He; Kuan Li
35889175,Impact of Environmental Pollutants on Gut Microbiome and Mental Health via the Gut-Brain Axis.,"Over the last few years, the microbiome has emerged as a high-priority research area to discover missing links between brain health and gut dysbiosis. Emerging evidence suggests that the commensal gut microbiome is an important regulator of the gut-brain axis and plays a critical role in brain physiology. Engaging microbiome-generated metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids, the immune system, the enteric nervous system, the endocrine system (including the HPA axis), tryptophan metabolism or the vagus nerve plays a crucial role in communication between the gut microbes and the brain. Humans are exposed to a wide range of pollutants in everyday life that impact our intestinal microbiota and manipulate the bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain, resulting in predisposition to psychiatric or neurological disorders. However, the interaction between xenobiotics, microbiota and neurotoxicity has yet to be completely investigated. Although research into the precise processes of the microbiota-gut-brain axis is growing rapidly, comprehending the implications of environmental contaminants remains challenging. In these milieus, we herein discuss how various environmental pollutants such as phthalates, heavy metals, Bisphenol A and particulate matter may alter the intricate microbiota-gut-brain axis thereby impacting our neurological and overall mental health.",Microorganisms,2022,Samradhi Singh; Poonam Sharma; Namrata Pal; Manoj Kumawat; Swasti Shubham; Devojit Kumar Sarma; Rajnarayan R Tiwari; Manoj Kumar; Ravinder Nagpal
36432461,"The Effects of Walnuts and Academic Stress on Mental Health, General Well-Being and the Gut Microbiota in a Sample of University Students: A Randomised Clinical Trial.","Poorer mental health is common in undergraduate students due to academic stress. An interplay between stress and diet exists, with stress influencing food choices. Nutritional interventions may be effective in preventing mental health decline due to complex bidirectional interactions between the brain, the gut and the gut microbiota. Previous studies have shown walnut consumption has a positive effect on mental health. Here, using a randomized clinical trial (Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, #ACTRN12619000972123), we aimed to investigate the effects of academic stress and daily walnut consumption in university students on mental health, biochemical markers of general health, and the gut microbiota. We found academic stress had a negative impact on self-reported mood and mental health status, while daily walnut consumption improved mental health indicators and protected against some of the negative effects of academic stress on metabolic and stress biomarkers. Academic stress was associated with lower gut microbial diversity in females, which was improved by walnut consumption. The effects of academic stress or walnut consumption in male participants could not be established due to small numbers of participants. Thus, walnut consumption may have a protective effect against some of the negative impacts of academic stress, however sex-dependent mechanisms require further study.",Nutrients,2022,Mauritz F Herselman; Sheree Bailey; Permal Deo; Xin-Fu Zhou; Kate M Gunn; Larisa Bobrovskaya
35849305,Psychobiotics: the Influence of Gut Microbiota on the Gut-Brain Axis in Neurological Disorders.,"Nervous system disorders are one of the common problems that affect many people around the world every year. Regarding the beneficial effects of the probiotics on the gut and the gut-brain axis, their application along with current medications has been the subject of intense interest. Psychobiotics are a probiotic strain capable to affect the gut-brain axis. The effective role of Psychobiotics in several neurological disorders is documented. Consumption of the Psychobiotics containing nutrients has positive effects on the improvement of microbiota as well as alleviation of some symptoms of central nervous system (CNS) disorders. In the present study, the effects of probiotic strains on some CNS disorders in terms of controlling the disease symptoms were reviewed. Finding suggests that Psychobiotics can efficiently alleviate the symptoms of several CNS disorders such as autism spectrum disorders, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, insomnia, depression, diabetic neuropathy, and anorexia nervosa.

35892042,Marked shifts in gut microbial structure and neurotransmitter metabolism in fresh inmates revealed a close link between gut microbiota and mental health: A case-controlled study.,"The gut microbiota plays a pivotal role in psychological health, but the mechanistic perspective between gut microbiome and mental health remains poorly understood.The present case-controlled study recruited 30 unimprisoned subjects and 31 inmates that had been detained in jail for no more than a month. The mental health status, gut microbiota and blood NH3, H2S, 5-hydroxy trptamine and dopamine levels were measured.Compared with unimprisoned controls, the fresh inmates exhibited significantly higher scores on anxiety and depression. Both phylogenetic structure and functional genes of the gut microbiota markedly shifted in inmates. Inmates was more <i>Bacteroides</i>-dominated, while unimprisoned subjects were more <i>Prevotella</i>-dominated. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producing genera were largely decreased in inmates and were negatively related to mental disorder scores, while Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria were positive to anxiety and depression scores. Simultaneously, the inmates possessed reduced genes that participate in amino acids, carbohydrates and vitamin cofactors metabolism, but enriched genes that involved in the neurotransmitter-producing Shikimate pathway. Correlation analysis revealed that <i>Anaerotruncus</i> and <i>Prevotella</i> were negative to depression score, and <i>Enterococcus</i> was negative to anxiety score.Our results revealed potential link between gut microbiota and mental health, leading further support to the microbiota-gut-brain axis theory.",International journal of clinical and health psychology : IJCHP,2022,Yunfeng Duan; Xiaoli Wu; Yanan Yang; Liuqi Gu; Li Liu; Yunfeng Yang; Jizhong Zhou; Chongming Wu; Feng Jin
35345829,Curcumin Alleviates DSS-Induced Anxiety-Like Behaviors via the Microbial-Brain-Gut Axis.,"The anxiety and depression caused by inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are known to greatly affect the mental health of patients. The mechanism of psychiatric disorders caused by IBD is not fully understood. Previous research has suggested that the gut microbiome plays a key role in IBD. Curcumin is a yellow polyphenol extracted from the rhizome of the ginger plant, which has been shown to have effects against both depression and anxiety. Research has indicated that curcumin affects the gut microbiome and exerts antianxiety and neuroprotective effects through the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGB). However, whether curcumin can alleviate the psychiatric disorders caused by IBD and how curcumin affects the MGB axis through the gut microbiota have not been fully understood. Therefore, this study was aimed at determining the metabolic parameters and microbiological environment in the peripheral and central nervous system to determine the effects of curcumin against anxiety induced by dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS) in mice. To elaborate on the link between the gut microbiota and how curcumin alleviates anxiety-like behaviors, we performed a fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiment. The results suggested that curcumin can effectively relieve anxiety-like behaviors caused by DSS in mice. Further, curcumin treatment can alleviate disturbances in the gut microbiota and systemic disorders of lipid metabolism caused by DSS. Finally, through FMT, we verified that curcumin increased phosphatidylcholine in the prefrontal cortex of the mice and alleviated DSS-induced anxiety-like behaviors by modulating specific gut microbiota. We also revealed that <i>Muribaculaceae</i> may be a key part of the gut microbiota for curcumin to alleviate DSS-induced anxiety-like behaviors through the MGB axis.",Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,2022,Fan Zhang; Yanlin Zhou; Haitao Chen; Hao Jiang; Feini Zhou; Bin Lv; Maosheng Xu

These studies highlight the role of gut microbiota on regulating brain function and behavior through immune, metabolic, and neuronal pathways. In this review we provide an overview of the gut microbiota axis pathways to lay the groundwork for upcoming sessions on the links between the gut microbiota and neurogenerative disorders. We also discuss how the gut microbiota may act as an intermediate factor between the host and the environment to mediate disease onset and neuropathology.

36231182,Biodiversity Effects on Human Mental Health via Microbiota Alterations.,"The biodiversity hypothesis postulates that the natural environment positively affects human physical and mental health. We evaluate the latest evidence and propose new tools to examine the halobiont environment. We chose to target our review at neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety, autism, dementia, multiple sclerosis, etc. because a green prescription (exposure to green spaces) was shown to benefit patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. Specifically, our review consists of three mini reviews on the associations exploring: (1) ecological biodiversity and human microbiota; (2) human microbiota and neuropsychiatric disorders; (3) ecological biodiversity and neuropsychiatric disorders. We conclude that the environment could directly transfer microbes to humans and that human studies support the gut microbiota as part of the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. Overall, the results from the three mini reviews consistently support the biodiversity hypothesis. These findings demonstrated the plausibility of biodiversity exerting mental health effects through biophysiological mechanisms instead of psychological mechanisms alone. The idea can be further tested with novel biodiversity measurements and research on the effects of a green prescription.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2022,Yee Sang Wong; Nicholas John Osborne

35966709,Gut microbiota dysbiosis: The potential mechanisms by which alcohol disrupts gut and brain functions.,"Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a high-risk psychiatric disorder and a key cause of death and disability in individuals. In the development of AUD, there is a connection known as the microbiota-gut-brain axis, where alcohol use disrupts the gut barrier, resulting in changes in intestinal permeability as well as the gut microbiota composition, which in turn impairs brain function and worsens the patient's mental status and gut activity. Potential mechanisms are explored by which alcohol alters gut and brain function through the effects of the gut microbiota and their metabolites on immune and inflammatory pathways. Alcohol and microbiota dysregulation regulating neurotransmitter release, including DA, 5-HT, and GABA, are also discussed. Thus, based on the above discussion, it is possible to speculate on the gut microbiota as an underlying target for the treatment of diseases associated with alcohol addiction. This review will focus more on how alcohol and gut microbiota affect the structure and function of the gut and brain, specific changes in the composition of the gut microbiota, and some measures to mitigate the changes caused by alcohol exposure. This leads to a potential intervention for alcohol addiction through fecal microbiota transplantation, which could normalize the disruption of gut microbiota after AUD.",Frontiers in microbiology,2022,Ganggang Chen; Fenglei Shi; Wei Yin; Yao Guo; Anru Liu; Jiacheng Shuai; Jinhao Sun
34654024,Associations Between the Gut Microbiota and Internalizing Behaviors in Preschool Children.,"Emerging evidence points toward a connection between mental health and the gut microbiota and its metabolites (e.g., short-chain fatty acids). It is unknown whether the gut microbiota is associated with the development of mental health problems (e.g., internalizing or externalizing behaviors) in preschool children. The objective of this study was to evaluate associations between the gut microbiota and internalizing and externalizing behaviors in preschool-aged children.A community sample of 248 typically developing children (3-5 years of age) provided a stool sample for gut microbiota and SCFA analysis. Parents reported child internalizing and externalizing behaviors using the Child Behavior Checklist. Associations between child behaviors and gut microbiota measures were analyzed using Spearman correlations followed by an adjustment for multiple testing, with subanalysis conducted in children clinically ""at risk"" for behavioral problems compared with those who were not.There was a correlation between Shannon alpha diversity with internalizing behaviors (rs = -0.134, p = .035) and its subscale somatic complaints (rs = -0.144, p = .023). In addition, children clinically ""at risk"" for internalizing problems had decreased alpha diversity (U = 551, p = .017). Internalizing behaviors correlated with valerate and isobutyrate (rs = -0.147, p = .021; rs = -0.140, p = .028, respectively). Furthermore the somatic complaints subscale additionally correlated with acetate and butyrate (rs = -0.219, p = .001; rs = -0.241, p < .001, respectively). These findings were also present in children ""at risk"" for internalizing problems (U = 569, p = .026; U = 571, p = .028) and somatic complaints (U = 164, p = .004; U = 145, p = .001).These analyses reveal novel associations between internalizing behaviors and the gut microbiota in preschool children. Furthermore, a relationship between somatic complaints and acetate and butyrate was identified, indicating that interventions that increase SCFA production warrant future investigation.",Psychosomatic medicine,2022,Marcel van de Wouw; Yanan Wang; Matthew L Workentine; Elnaz Vaghef-Mehrabani; Deborah Dewey; Raylene A Reimer; Lianne Tomfohr-Madsen; Gerald F Giesbrecht
36211431,Maternal gut microbiota during pregnancy and the composition of immune cells in infancy.,"Preclinical studies have shown that maternal gut microbiota during pregnancy play a key role in prenatal immune development but the relevance of these findings to humans is unknown. The aim of this prebirth cohort study was to investigate the association between the maternal gut microbiota in pregnancy and the composition of the infant's cord and peripheral blood immune cells over the first year of life.The Barwon Infant Study cohort (<i>n</i>=1074 infants) was recruited using an unselected sampling frame. Maternal fecal samples were collected at 36 weeks of pregnancy and flow cytometry was conducted on cord/peripheral blood collected at birth, 6 and 12 months of age. Among a randomly selected sub-cohort with available samples (<i>n</i>=293), maternal gut microbiota was characterized by sequencing the 16S rRNA V4 region. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were clustered based on their abundance. Associations between maternal fecal microbiota clusters and infant granulocyte, monocyte and lymphocyte subsets were explored using compositional data analysis. Partial least squares (PLS) and regression models were used to investigate the relationships/associations between environmental, maternal and infant factors, and OTU clusters.We identified six clusters of co-occurring OTUs. The first two components in the PLS regression explained 39% and 33% of the covariance between the maternal prenatal OTU clusters and immune cell populations in offspring at birth. A cluster in which <i>Dialister, Escherichia</i>, and <i>Ruminococcus</i> were predominant was associated with a lower proportion of granulocytes (<i>p</i>=0.002), and higher proportions of both central naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD45RA<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>-</sup>) (<i>p</i><0.001) and naïve regulatory T cells (Treg) (CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD45RA<sup>+</sup>/FoxP3<sup>low</sup>) (<i>p</i>=0.02) in cord blood. The association with central naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells persisted to 12 months of age.This birth cohort study provides evidence consistent with past preclinical models that the maternal gut microbiota during pregnancy plays a role in shaping the composition of innate and adaptive elements of the infant's immune system following birth.",Frontiers in immunology,2022,Yuan Gao; Martin O'Hely; Thomas P Quinn; Anne-Louise Ponsonby; Leonard C Harrison; Hanne Frøkiær; Mimi L K Tang; Susanne Brix; Karsten Kristiansen; Dave Burgner; Richard Saffery; Sarath Ranganathan; Fiona Collier; Peter Vuillermin

36139496,Multi-Strain Probiotic Mixture Affects Brain Morphology and Resting State Brain Function in Healthy Subjects: An RCT.,"Probiotics can alter brain function via the gut-brain axis. We investigated the effect of a probiotic mixture containing <i>Bifidobacterium longum</i>, <i>Lactobacillus helveticus</i> and <i>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</i>. In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded crossover design, 22 healthy subjects (6 m/16 f; 24.2 ± 3.4 years) underwent four-week intervention periods with probiotics and placebo, separated by a four-week washout period. Voxel-based morphometry indicated that the probiotic intervention affected the gray matter volume of a cluster covering the left supramarginal gyrus and superior parietal lobule (<i>p</i> < 0.0001), two regions that were also among those with an altered resting state functional connectivity. Probiotic intervention resulted in significant (FDR < 0.05) functional connectivity changes between regions within the default mode, salience, frontoparietal as well as the language network and several regions located outside these networks. Psychological symptoms trended towards improvement after probiotic intervention, i.e., the total score of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (<i>p</i> = 0.056) and its depression sub-score (<i>p</i> = 0.093), as well as sleep patterns (<i>p</i> = 0.058). The probiotic intervention evoked distinct changes in brain morphology and resting state brain function alongside slight improvements of psycho(bio)logical markers of the gut-brain axis. The combination of those parameters may provide new insights into the modes of action by which gut microbiota can affect gut-brain communication and hence brain function.",Cells,2022,Julia Rode; Hanna M T Edebol Carlman; Julia König; Ashley N Hutchinson; Per Thunberg; Jonas Persson; Robert J Brummer
35050172,Gut Microbiota Metabolites in Major Depressive Disorder-Deep Insights into Their Pathophysiological Role and Potential Translational Applications.,"The gut microbiota is a complex and dynamic ecosystem essential for the proper functioning of the organism, affecting the health and disease status of the individuals. There is continuous and bidirectional communication between gut microbiota and the host, conforming to a unique entity known as ""holobiont"". Among these crosstalk mechanisms, the gut microbiota synthesizes a broad spectrum of bioactive compounds or metabolites which exert pleiotropic effects on the human organism. Many of these microbial metabolites can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) or have significant effects on the brain, playing a key role in the so-called microbiota-gut-brain axis. An altered microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis is a major characteristic of many neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD). Significative differences between gut eubiosis and dysbiosis in mental disorders like MDD with their different metabolite composition and concentrations are being discussed. In the present review, the main microbial metabolites (short-chain fatty acids -SCFAs-, bile acids, amino acids, tryptophan -trp- derivatives, and more), their signaling pathways and functions will be summarized to explain part of MDD pathophysiology. Conclusions from promising translational approaches related to microbial metabolome will be addressed in more depth to discuss their possible clinical value in the management of MDD patients.",Metabolites,2022,Miguel A Ortega; Miguel Angel Alvarez-Mon; Cielo García-Montero; Oscar Fraile-Martinez; Luis G Guijarro; Guillermo Lahera; Jorge Monserrat; Paula Valls; Fernando Mora; Roberto Rodríguez-Jiménez; Javier Quintero; Melchor Álvarez-Mon
36570854,Reviewing the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of depression and exploring new therapeutic options.,"The relationship between gut microbiota (GM) and mental health is one of the focuses of psychobiology research. In recent years, the microbial-gut-brain axis (MGBA) concept has gradually formed about this bidirectional communication between gut and brain. But how the GM is involved in regulating brain function and how they affect emotional disorders these mechanisms are tenuous and limited to animal research, and often controversial. Therefore, in this review, we attempt to summarize and categorize the latest advances in current research on the mechanisms of GM and depression to provide valid information for future diagnoses and therapy of mental disorders. Finally, we introduced some antidepressant regimens that can help restore gut dysbiosis, including classic antidepressants, Chinese materia medica (CMM), diet, and exogenous strains. These studies provide further insight into GM's role and potential pathways in emotion-related diseases, which holds essential possible clinical outcomes for people with depression or related psychiatric disorders. Future research should focus on clarifying the causal role of GM in disease and developing microbial targets, applying these findings to the prevention and treatment of depression.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2022,Wenjie Han; Na Wang; Mengzhen Han; Meng Ban; Tao Sun; Junnan Xu
37118092,Intermittent fasting protects against Alzheimer's disease in mice by altering metabolism through remodeling of the gut microbiota.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia without effective clinical treatment. Here, we show that intermittent fasting (IF) improves cognitive functions and AD-like pathology in a transgenic AD mouse model (5XFAD). IF alters gut microbial composition with a significant enrichment in probiotics such as Lactobacillus. The changes in the composition of the gut microbiota affect metabolic activities and metabolite production. Metabolomic profiling analysis of cecal contents revealed IF leads to a decreased carbohydrate metabolism (for example, glucose) and an increased abundance in amino acids (for example, sarcosine and dimethylglycine). Interestingly, we found that the administration of IF-elevated sarcosine or dimethylglycine mimics the protective effects of IF in 5XFAD mice, including the amelioration of cognitive decline, amyloid-β (Aβ) burden and glial overactivation. Our findings thus demonstrate an IF regimen is a potential approach to prevent AD progression, at least through the gut-microbiota-metabolites-brain axis, and constitutes an innovative AD therapeutic avenue.",Nature aging,2022,Rui-Yuan Pan; Jing Zhang; Jinlei Wang; Yingyi Wang; Zhihui Li; Yang Liao; Yajin Liao; Chenggang Zhang; Zhiqiang Liu; Lijuan Song; Jiezhong Yu; Zengqiang Yuan

35299696,The Role of MicroRNA and Microbiota in Depression and Anxiety.,"Depression and anxiety are devastating disorders. Understanding the mechanisms that underlie the development of depression and anxiety can provide new hints on novel treatments and preventive strategies. Here, we summarize the latest findings reporting the novel roles of gut microbiota and microRNAs (miRNAs) in the pathophysiology of depression and anxiety. The crosstalk between gut microbiota and the brain has been reported to contribute to these pathologies. It is currently known that some miRNAs can regulate bacterial growth and gene transcription while also modulate the gut microbiota composition, suggesting the importance of miRNAs in gut and brain health. Treatment and prevention strategies for neuropsychiatric diseases, such as physical exercise, diet, and probiotics, can modulate the gut microbiota composition and miRNAs expressions. Nonetheless, there are critical questions to be addressed to understand further the mechanisms involved in the interaction between the gut microbiota and miRNAs in the brain. This review summarizes the recent findings of the potential roles of microbiota and miRNA on the neuropathology of depression and anxiety, and its potential as treatment strategies.",Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience,2022,Julia M Rosa; Douglas A Formolo; Jiasui Yu; Thomas H Lee; Suk-Yu Yau
36440396,A genetic association study reveals the relationship between the oral microbiome and anxiety and depression symptoms.,"Growing evidence supports that alterations in the gut microbiota play an essential role in the etiology of anxiety, depression, and other psychiatric disorders. However, the potential effect of oral microbiota on mental health has received little attention.Using the latest genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data of the oral microbiome, polygenic risk scores (PRSs) of 285 salivary microbiomes and 309 tongue dorsum microbiomes were conducted. Logistic and linear regression models were applied to evaluate the relationship between salivary-tongue dorsum microbiome interactions with anxiety and depression. Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was utilized to compute the causal effects between the oral microbiome, anxiety, and depression.We observed significant salivary-tongue dorsum microbiome interactions related to anxiety and depression traits. Significantly, one common interaction was observed to be associated with both anxiety score and depression score, <i>Centipeda periodontii SGB 224</i> × <i>Granulicatella uSGB 3289</i> (P <sub>depressionscore</sub> = 1.41 × 10<sup>-8</sup>, P <sub>anxietyscore</sub> = 5.10 × 10<sup>-8</sup>). Furthermore, we detected causal effects between the oral microbiome and anxiety and depression. Importantly, we identified one salivary microbiome associated with both anxiety and depression in both the UKB database and the Finngen public database, <i>Eggerthia</i> (P <sub>IVW - majordepression - UKB</sub> = 2.99 × 10<sup>-6</sup>, P <sub>IVW - Self - reportedanxiety/panicattacks - UKB</sub> = 3.06 × 10<sup>-59</sup>, P <sub>IVW - depression - Finngen</sub> = 3.16 × 10 <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><msubsup><mrow></mrow> <mrow><mo>,</mo></mrow> <mrow><mo>-</mo> <mn>16</mn></mrow> </msubsup> </math> P <sub>IVW - anxiety - Finngen</sub> = 1.14 × 10<sup>-115</sup>).This study systematically explored the relationship between the oral microbiome and anxiety and depression, which could help improve our understanding of disease pathogenesis and propose new diagnostic targets and early intervention strategies.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2022,Chun'e Li; Yujing Chen; Yan Wen; Yumeng Jia; Shiqiang Cheng; Li Liu; Huijie Zhang; Chuyu Pan; Jingxi Zhang; Zhen Zhang; Xuena Yang; Peilin Meng; Yao Yao; Feng Zhang
35445772,Abnormal gut microbiota and bile acids in patients with first-episode major depressive disorder and correlation analysis.,"Gut microbiota and its metabolite bile acids may play a significant role in the occurrence and development of major depressive disorder (MDD). Therefore, this study analyzes gut microbiota and bile acids, as well as their correlation in patients.Thirty-one patients with MDD and 29 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled in this study. We collected their both blood and feces. Plasma bile acid content was determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and gut microbiota was detected by 16SrRNA gene sequencing and subsequently analyzed. We also analyzed the correlation between different gut microbiota, bile acids, and Hamilton Depression (HAMD) score.The α-diversity analysis found that Simpson and Pielou evenness index was much higher in HCs than in the patients with MDD. The β-diversity of the two groups were differences by nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis. Linear discriminant analysis effect size analysis identified 16 different strains. Bile acids detection showed that 23-nordeoxycholic acid in patients with MDD was significantly higher than in HCs, whereas taurolithocholic acid (TLCA), glycolithocholic acid (GLCA), and lithocholic acid 3-sulfate were significantly lower.

36014798,The Effects of Physical Activity on the Gut Microbiota and the Gut-Brain Axis in Preclinical and Human Models: A Narrative Review.,"Increasing evidence supports the importance of the gut microbiota (GM) in regulating multiple functions related to host physical health and, more recently, through the gut-brain axis (GBA), mental health. Similarly, the literature on the impact of physical activity (PA), including exercise, on GM and GBA is growing. Therefore, this narrative review summarizes and critically appraises the existing literature that delves into the benefits or adverse effects produced by PA on physical and mental health status through modifications of the GM, highlighting differences and similarities between preclinical and human studies. The same exercise in animal models, whether performed voluntarily or forced, has different effects on the GM, just as, in humans, intense endurance exercise can have a negative influence. In humans and animals, only aerobic PA seems able to modify the composition of the GM, whereas cardiovascular fitness appears related to specific microbial taxa or metabolites that promote a state of physical health. The PA favors bacterial strains that can promote physical performance and that can induce beneficial changes in the brain. Currently, it seems useful to prioritize aerobic activities at a moderate and not prolonged intensity. There may be greater benefits if PA is undertaken from a young age and the effects on the GM seem to gradually disappear when the activity is stopped. The PA produces modifications in the GM that can mediate and induce mental health benefits.",Nutrients,2022,Stefania Cataldi; Luca Poli; Fatma Neşe Şahin; Antonino Patti; Luigi Santacroce; Antonino Bianco; Gianpiero Greco; Barbara Ghinassi; Angela Di Baldassarre; Francesco Fischetti
35370947,Composition of the Gut Microbiota in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"The latest research accumulates information to explore the correlation between gut microbiota and neurodevelopmental disorders, which may lead to new approaches to treat diseases such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, the conclusions of previous studies are not completely consistent. The objective of the systematic review and meta-analysis was to identify evidence on the dysbiosis of gut microbiota in ADHD and find potential distinctive traits compared to healthy controls.Electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO, were searched up to August 24, 2021, using predetermined terms. Meta-analysis was performed to estimate the comparison of microbiota profiles (alpha and beta diversity) and the relative abundance of gut microbiota in ADHD patients and healthy controls.A total of eight studies were included in the meta-analysis, containing 316 ADHD patients and 359 healthy controls. There was a higher Shannon index in ADHD patients than in healthy controls (SMD = 0.97; 95% CI, 0.13 to 1.82; <i>P</i> = 0.02; <i>I<sup>2</sup></i>  = 96%), but the significance vanished after sensitivity analysis because of high heterogeneity. No significant differences in other alpha diversity indexes were found. Regarding the relative abundance of gut microbiota, the genus <i>Blautia</i> was significantly elevated in ADHD patients compared with controls (SMD = 0.34; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.63; <i>P</i> = 0.02; <i>I<sup>2</sup></i>  = 0%).Patients with ADHD had gut microbiome alterations compared to healthy controls. Though more studies with strict methodology are warranted due to the high heterogeneity, further studies to translate the findings of gut microbiota dysbiosis to clinical application in ADHD patients are needed and may guide targeted therapies.[https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.php?RecordID=273993], identifier PROSPERO (CRD42021273993).",Frontiers in endocrinology,2022,Ning Wang; Xuping Gao; Zifeng Zhang; Li Yang
35115853,Alterations of the Gut Microbiota in Response to Total Sleep Deprivation and Recovery Sleep in Rats.,"Accumulating evidence suggests that both sleep loss and gut dysbiosis can lead to metabolic disorders. However, less is known about the impact of total sleep deprivation (SD) and sleep recovery on the composition, function, and metabolic dynamics of the gut microbiota.Specific-pathogen free Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 48 h of SD with gentle handling and then allowed to recover for 1 week. Taxonomic profiles of fecal microbiota were obtained at baseline, 24 h of SD, 48 h of SD, and 1 week of recovery. We used 16<i>S</i> rRNA gene sequencing to analyze the gut microbial composition and function and further characterize microbiota-derived metabolites in rats.The microbiota composition analysis revealed that gut microbial composition and metabolites did not change in the rats after 24 h of SD but were significantly altered after 48 h of SD. These changes were reversible after 1 week of sleep recovery. A functional analysis was performed based on Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) annotations, indicating that 19 KEGG pathways were significantly altered in the gut microbiota in SD rats. These functional changes occurred within 24 h of SD, were more apparent after 48 h of SD, and did not fully recover after 1 week of sleep recovery.These results indicate that acute total SD leads to significant compositional and functional changes in the gut microbiota, and these changes are reversible.",Nature and science of sleep,2022,Zhong Wang; Kai Yuan; Yan-Bin Ji; Su-Xia Li; Le Shi; Zhe Wang; Xin-Yu Zhou; Yan-Ping Bao; Wen Xie; Ying Han; Jie Shi; Lin Lu; Wei Yan; Wen-Hao Chen
35433746,Guts Imbalance Imbalances the Brain: A Review of Gut Microbiota Association With Neurological and Psychiatric Disorders.,"Over the last 10 years, there has been a growing interest in the relationship between gut microbiota, the brain, and neurologic-associated affections. As multiple preclinical and clinical research studies highlight gut microbiota's potential to modulate the general state of health state, it goes without saying that gut microbiota plays a significant role in neurogenesis, mental and cognitive development, emotions, and behaviors, and in the progression of neuropsychiatric illnesses. Gut microbiota produces important biologic products that, through the gut-brain axis, are directly connected with the appearance and evolution of neurological and psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, autism, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy. This study reviews recent research on the link between gut microbiota and the brain, and microbiome's role in shaping the development of the most common neurological and psychiatric illnesses. Moreover, special attention is paid to the use of probiotic formulations as a potential non-invasive therapeutic opportunity for prevention and management of neuropsychiatric-associated affections.",Frontiers in medicine,2022,Laura Mitrea; Silvia-Amalia Nemeş; Katalin Szabo; Bernadette-Emőke Teleky; Dan-Cristian Vodnar

This review concentrates relevant literature from Scopus, PubMed, and Google Scholar analyzed with the aim of rescuing knowledge that promotes mental health. In this context, it is important to highlight those flowers, seeds, herbaceous plants, fungi, leaves, and tree barks, among other ancestral matrices, that have been historically part of the eating habits of human beings and have also been a consequence of the adaptation of collectors, consuming the ethnoflora present in different ecosystems. Likewise, it is important to note that this knowledge has been progressively lost in the new generations. Therefore, this review concentrates an important number of matrices used particularly for food and medicinal purposes, recognized for their anxiolytic and antidepressant effects, establishing the importance of metabolism and biotransformation mainly of bioactive compounds such as polyphenols by the action of the gut microbiota.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2022,Saúl Alberto Álvarez; Nuria Elizabeth Rocha-Guzmán; Rubén Francisco González-Laredo; José Alberto Gallegos-Infante; Martha Rocío Moreno-Jiménez; Marely Bravo-Muñoz
35634468,The Microbiome and Gut Endocannabinoid System in the Regulation of Stress Responses and Metabolism.,"The endocannabinoid system, with its receptors and ligands, is present in the gut epithelium and enteroendocrine cells, and is able to modulate brain functions, both indirectly through circulating gut-derived factors and directly through the vagus nerve, finally acting on the brain's mechanisms regarding metabolism and behavior. The gut endocannabinoid system also regulates gut motility, permeability, and inflammatory responses. Furthermore, microbiota composition has been shown to influence the activity of the endocannabinoid system. This review examines the interaction between microbiota, intestinal endocannabinoid system, metabolism, and stress responses. We hypothesize that the crosstalk between microbiota and intestinal endocannabinoid system has a prominent role in stress-induced changes in the gut-brain axis affecting metabolic and mental health. Inter-individual differences are commonly observed in stress responses, but mechanisms underlying resilience and vulnerability to stress are far from understood. Both gut microbiota and the endocannabinoid system have been implicated in stress resilience. We also discuss interventions targeting the microbiota and the endocannabinoid system to mitigate metabolic and stress-related disorders.",Frontiers in cellular neuroscience,2022,Raj Kamal Srivastava; Beat Lutz; Inigo Ruiz de Azua
36160716,A Minireview Exploring the Interplay of the Muscle-Gut-Brain (MGB) Axis to Improve Knowledge on Mental Disorders: Implications for Clinical Neuroscience Research and Therapeutics.,"What benefit might emerge from connecting clinical neuroscience with microbiology and exercise science? What about the influence of the muscle-gut-brain (MGB) axis on mental health? The gut microbiota colonizes the intestinal tract and plays a pivotal role in digestion, production of vitamins and immune system development, but it is also able to exert a particular effect on psychological well-being and appears to play a critical role in regulating several muscle metabolic pathways. Endogenous and exogenous factors may cause dysbiosis, with relevant consequences on the composition and function of the gut microbiota that may also modulate muscle responses to exercise. The capacity of specific psychobiotics in ameliorating mental health as complementary strategies has been recently suggested as a novel treatment for some neuropsychiatric diseases. Moreover, physical exercise can modify qualitative and quantitative composition of the gut microbiota and alleviate certain psychopathological symptoms. In this minireview, we documented evidence about the impact of the MGB axis on mental health, which currently appears to be a possible target in the context of a multidimensional intervention mainly including pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments, especially for depressive mood.",Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,2022,Davide Maria Cammisuli; Jonathan Fusi; Giorgia Scarfò; Simona Daniele; Gianluca Castelnuovo; Ferdinando Franzoni
35157946,Stressful events induce long-term gut microbiota dysbiosis and associated post-traumatic stress symptoms in healthcare workers fighting against COVID-19.,"The microbiota-gut-brain axis is a key pathway perturbed by prolonged stressors to produce brain and behavioral disorders. Frontline healthcare workers (FHWs) fighting against COVID-19 typically experience stressful event sequences and manifest some mental symptoms; however, the role of gut microbiota in such stress-induced mental problems remains unclear. We investigated the association between the psychological stress of FHW and gut microbiota.We used full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize the longitudinal changes in gut microbiota and investigated the impact of microbial changes on FHWs' mental status.Stressful events induced significant depression, anxiety, and stress in FHWs and disrupted the gut microbiome; gut dysbiosis persisted for at least half a year. Different microbes followed discrete trajectories during the half-year of follow-up. Microbes associated with mental health were mainly Faecalibacterium spp. and [Eubacterium] eligens group spp. with anti-inflammatory effects. Of note, the prediction model indicated that low abundance of [Eubacterium] hallii group uncultured bacterium and high abundance of Bacteroides eggerthii at Day 0 (immediately after the two-month frontline work) were significant determinants of the reappearance of post-traumatic stress symptoms in FHWs.The lack of metabolomic evidence and animal experiments result in the unclear mechanism of gut dysbiosis-related stress symptoms.The stressful event sequences of fighting against COVID-19 induce characteristic longitudinal changes in gut microbiota, which underlies dynamic mental state changes.",Journal of affective disorders,2022,Fengjie Gao; Ruijin Guo; Qingyan Ma; Yening Li; Wei Wang; Yajuan Fan; Yanmei Ju; Binbin Zhao; Yuan Gao; Li Qian; Zai Yang; Xiaoyan He; Xiaoying Jin; Yixin Liu; Yuan Peng; Ce Chen; Yunchun Chen; Chengge Gao; Feng Zhu; Xiancang Ma
35276927,One Giant Leap from Mouse to Man: The Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis in Mood Disorders and Translational Challenges Moving towards Human Clinical Trials.,"The microbiota-gut-brain axis is a bidirectional communication pathway that enables the gut microbiota to communicate with the brain through direct and indirect signaling pathways to influence brain physiology, function, and even behavior. Research has shown that probiotics can improve several aspects of health by changing the environment within the gut, and several lines of evidence now indicate a beneficial effect of probiotics on mental and brain health. Such evidence has prompted the arrival of a new term to the world of biotics research: psychobiotics, defined as any exogenous influence whose effect on mental health is bacterially mediated. Several taxonomic changes in the gut microbiota have been reported in neurodevelopmental disorders, mood disorders such as anxiety and depression, and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. While clinical evidence supporting the role of the gut microbiota in mental and brain health, and indeed demonstrating the beneficial effects of probiotics is rapidly accumulating, most of the evidence to date has emerged from preclinical studies employing different animal models. The purpose of this review is to focus on the role of probiotics and the microbiota-gut-brain axis in relation to mood disorders and to review the current translational challenges from preclinical to clinical research.",Nutrients,2022,Sofia D Forssten; Arthur C Ouwehand; Síle M Griffin; Elaine Patterson
35303781,Anorexia nervosa and gut microbiome: implications for weight change and novel treatments.,"Host-microbiota interactions may be involved in many physical and psychological functions ranging from the digestion of food, maintenance of immune homeostasis, to the regulation of mood and cognition. Microbiome dysbiosis has been consistently described in many diseases. The pathogenesis and weight regulation mechanism in anorexia nervosa (AN) also seem to be implicated in the dynamic bidirectional adjustment of the microbiota-gut-brain axis. This review aims at elucidating this relationship.This review starts with a description of pathogenic gut-brain pathways. Next, we focus on the latest research on the associations between gut microbiota and weight change in the condition of AN. The strategies to alter the intestinal microbiome for the treatment of this disorder are discussed, including dietary, probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation.Gut microbiome is inextricably linked to AN. It may regulate weight gain in the process of refeeding via the microbiota-gut-brain axis, while the specific mechanism has yet to be clearly established. In the future, a better understanding of gut microbiome could have implications for developing microbiome-based prevention, diagnostics and therapies.",Expert review of gastroenterology & hepatology,2022,Yaohui Wei; Sufang Peng; Cheng Lian; Qing Kang; Jue Chen
35085752,(R)-ketamine ameliorates demyelination and facilitates remyelination in cuprizone-treated mice: A role of gut-microbiota-brain axis.,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common demyelinating disease that attacks the central nervous system. We recently reported that the new antidepressant (R)-ketamine could ameliorate the disease progression in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model of MS. Cuprizone (CPZ) has been used to produce demyelination which resembles demyelination in MS patients. This study was undertaken to investigate whether (R)-ketamine could affect demyelination in CPZ-treated mice and remyelination after CPZ withdrawal. Repeated treatment with (R)-ketamine (10 mg/kg/day, twice weekly, for 6 weeks) significantly ameliorated demyelination and activated microglia in the brain compared with saline-treated mice. Furthermore, pretreatment with ANA-12 (TrkB antagonist) significantly blocked the beneficial effects of (R)-ketamine on the demyelination and activated microglia in the brain of CPZ-treated mice. The 16S rRNA analysis showed that (R)-ketamine significantly improved abnormal composition of gut-microbiota and decreased levels of lactic acid of CPZ-treated mice. In addition, there were significant correlations between demyelination (or microglial activation) in the brain and the relative abundance of several microbiome, suggesting a link between gut microbiota and brain. Interestingly, (R)-ketamine could facilitate remyelination in the brain after CPZ withdrawal. In conclusion, the study suggests that (R)-ketamine could ameliorate demyelination in the brain of CPZ-treated mice through TrkB activation, and that gut-microbiota-microglia crosstalk may play a role in the demyelination of CPZ-treated mice. Therefore, it is likely that (R)-ketamine could be a new therapeutic drug for MS.",Neurobiology of disease,2022,Xingming Wang; Lijia Chang; Xiayun Wan; Yunfei Tan; Youge Qu; Jiajing Shan; Yong Yang; Li Ma; Kenji Hashimoto
35279596,"Targeting NLRP3 inflammasome modulates gut microbiota, attenuates corticospinal tract injury and ameliorates neurobehavioral deficits after intracerebral hemorrhage in mice.","Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) has a high mortality and disability rate. Fewer studies focus on white matter injury (WMI) after ICH, especially the corticospinal tract (CST) injury located in the spinal cord, which correlates with motor impairments. Recent studies have shown that gut microbiota dysbiosis occurs after ICH. Furthermore, NLRP3 inflammasome can be activated after ICH, resulting in inflammatory cascade reactions and aggravating brain injury. However, no direct and causal correlation among NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition, altered gut microbiota, and CST injury following ICH has been reported. This study aimed to investigate the effect of MCC950, a selective NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor, on the gut microbiota and CST injury after ICH. We observed that compared with the sham group, the members of Firmicutes, such as Faecalibaculum and Dubosiella, were depleted in the ICH + Vehicle group, whereas the members of Proteobacteria and Campilobacterota were enriched, such as Enterobacter and Helicobacter. After treatment with MCC950, the Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium and Paenibacillus were relatively abundant in the gut flora of mice. Moreover, we observed CST injury located in cervical enlargement of the spinal cord, and MCC950 alleviated it. Furthermore, treatment with MCC950 decreased the mNSS score and brain water content in ICH. Taken together, the present study showed that MCC950 modulated gut microbiota, effectively attenuated CST injury located in cervical enlargement of the spinal cord, and ameliorated neurological deficits after ICH. This study provided a novel report that links NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition, gut microbiota alteration and CST injury following ICH and profound implications for ICH treatment.",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2022,Linglong Xiao; Huaping Zheng; Jing Li; Meiqin Zeng; Dian He; Jianhao Liang; Kaijian Sun; Yunhao Luo; Feng Li; Baohong Ping; Wen Yuan; Hongwei Zhou; Qinghua Wang; Haitao Sun
36140263,Alterations of the Composition and Neurometabolic Profile of Human Gut Microbiota in Major Depressive Disorder.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is among the most prevalent mental disorders worldwide. Factors causing the pathogenesis of MDD include gut microbiota (GM), which interacts with the host through the gut-brain axis. In previous studies of GM in MDD patients, 16S rRNA sequencing was used, which provided information about composition but not about function. In our study, we analyzed whole metagenome sequencing data to assess changes in both the composition and functional profile of GM. We looked at the GM of 36 MDD patients, compared with that of 38 healthy volunteers. Comparative taxonomic analysis showed decreased abundances of <i>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</i>, <i>Roseburia hominis</i>, and <i>Roseburia intestinalis</i>, and elevated abundances of <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Ruthenibacterium lactatiformans</i> in the GM of MDD patients. We observed decreased levels of bacterial genes encoding key enzymes involved in the production of arginine, asparagine, glutamate, glutamine, melatonin, acetic, butyric and conjugated linoleic acids, and spermidine in MDD patients. These genes produced signature pairs with <i>Faecalibacterium prausntizii</i> and correlated with decreased levels of this species in the GM of MDD patients. These results show the potential impact of the identified biomarker bacteria and their metabolites on the pathogenesis of MDD, and should be confirmed in future metabolomic studies.",Biomedicines,2022,Alexey S Kovtun; Olga V Averina; Irina Y Angelova; Roman A Yunes; Yana A Zorkina; Anna Y Morozova; Alexey V Pavlichenko; Timur S Syunyakov; Olga A Karpenko; George P Kostyuk; Valery N Danilenko
35631301,Anthocyanins in Chronic Diseases: The Power of Purple.,"Anthocyanins are mainly purple-coloured phenolic compounds of plant origin that as secondary metabolites are important in plant survival. Understanding their health benefits in humans requires sourcing these unstable compounds in sufficient quantities at a reasonable cost, which has led to improved methods of extraction. Dark-coloured fruits, cereals and vegetables are current sources of these compounds. The range of potential sustainable sources is much larger and includes non-commercialised native plants from around the world and agri-waste containing anthocyanins. In the last 5 years, there have been significant advances in developing the therapeutic potential of anthocyanins in chronic human diseases. Anthocyanins exert their beneficial effects through improvements in gut microbiota, oxidative stress and inflammation, and modulation of neuropeptides such as insulin-like growth factor-1. Their health benefits in humans include reduced cognitive decline; protection of organs such as the liver, as well as the cardiovascular system, gastrointestinal tract and kidneys; improvements in bone health and obesity; and regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism.

36648872,Obesity and Its Multiple Clinical Implications between Inflammatory States and Gut Microbiotic Alterations.,"Obesity is a chronic multifactorial disease that has become a serious health problem and is currently widespread over the world. It is, in fact, strongly associated with many other conditions, including insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, the onset of different types of malignant tumors and alterations in reproductive function. According to the literature, obesity is characterized by a state of low-grade chronic inflammation, with a substantial increase in immune cells, specifically macrophage infiltrates in the adipose tissue which, in turn, secrete a succession of pro-inflammatory mediators. Furthermore, recent studies on microbiota have postulated new possible mechanisms of interaction between obesity and unbalanced nutrition with inflammation. This intestinal ""superorganism"" complex seems to influence not only the metabolic balance of the host but also the immune response, favoring a state of systemic inflammation and insulin resistance. This review summarizes the major evidence on the interactions between the gut microbiota, energetic metabolism and host immune system, all leading to a convergence of the fields of immunology, nutrients physiology and microbiota in the context of obesity and its possible clinical complications. Finally, possible therapeutic approaches aiming to rebalance the intestinal microbial ecosystem are evaluated to improve the alteration of inflammatory and metabolic states in obesity and related diseases.","Diseases (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,Walter Milano; Francesca Carizzone; Mariagabriella Foia; Magda Marchese; Mariafrancesca Milano; Biancamaria Saetta; Anna Capasso
35600753,Gut microbiome in schizophrenia and antipsychotic-induced metabolic alterations: a scoping review.,"Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a severe mental disorder with high morbidity and lifetime disability rates. Patients with SCZ have a higher risk of developing metabolic comorbidities such as obesity and diabetes mellitus, leading to increased mortality. Antipsychotics (APs), which are the mainstay in the treatment of SCZ, increase the risk of these metabolic perturbations. Despite extensive research, the mechanism underlying SCZ pathophysiology and associated metabolic comorbidities remains unclear. In recent years, gut microbiota (GMB) has been regarded as a 'chamber of secrets', particularly in the context of severe mental illnesses such as SCZ, depression, and bipolar disorder. In this scoping review, we aimed to investigate the underlying role of GMB in the pathophysiology of SCZ and metabolic alterations associated with APs. Furthermore, we also explored the therapeutic benefits of prebiotic and probiotic formulations in managing SCZ and AP-induced metabolic alterations. A systematic literature search yielded 46 studies from both preclinical and clinical settings that met inclusion criteria for qualitative synthesis. Preliminary evidence from preclinical and clinical studies indicates that GMB composition changes are associated with SCZ pathogenesis and AP-induced metabolic perturbations. Fecal microbiota transplantation from SCZ patients to mice has been shown to induce SCZ-like behavioral phenotypes, further supporting the plausible role of GMB in SCZ pathogenesis. This scoping review recapitulates the preclinical and clinical evidence suggesting the role of GMB in SCZ symptomatology and metabolic adverse effects associated with APs. Moreover, this scoping review also discusses the therapeutic potentials of prebiotic/probiotic formulations in improving SCZ symptoms and attenuating metabolic alterations related to APs.",Therapeutic advances in psychopharmacology,2022,Raghunath Singh; Nicolette Stogios; Emily Smith; Jiwon Lee; Kateryna Maksyutynsk; Emily Au; David C Wright; Giada De Palma; Ariel Graff-Guerrero; Philip Gerretsen; Daniel J Müller; Gary Remington; Margaret Hahn; Sri Mahavir Agarwal
35526743,The gut microbiome and adult hippocampal neurogenesis: A new focal point for epilepsy?,"Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a neurological disorder affecting millions of people worldwide and currently represents the most common form of focal epilepsy. Thus, the search for aetiological and pathophysiological parameters of TLE is ongoing. Preclinical work and post-mortem human studies suggest adult hippocampal neurogenesis as a potentially relevant factor in TLE pathogenesis. Although progress has been made in elucidating the molecular links between TLE and hippocampal neurogenesis, recent evidence suggests that additional peripheral mediators may be involved. The microbiota-gut-brain axis mediates bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain and could comprise a link between neurogenesis and TLE. In this review, we discuss emerging evidence highlighting a potential role for the gut microbiome in connecting TLE pathogenesis and hippocampal neurogenesis. We focus in particular on mechanisms associated with neuronal excitability, neuroinflammation and gut microbial metabolites. As the evidence does not yet support a direct link between gut microbiota-regulated hippocampal neurogenesis and TLE aetiology or pathophysiology, future studies are needed to establish whether current findings comprise circumstantial links or a potentially novel avenue for clinically relevant research.",Neurobiology of disease,2022,Sebastian Dohm-Hansen; Francisco Donoso; Paul J Lucassen; Gerard Clarke; Yvonne M Nolan
35207483,Novel Pharmacological Approaches to the Treatment of Depression.,"Major depressive disorder is one of the most prevalent mental health disorders. Monoamine-based antidepressants were the first drugs developed to treat major depressive disorder. More recently, ketamine and other analogues were introduced as fast-acting antidepressants. Unfortunately, currently available therapeutics are inadequate; lack of efficacy, adverse effects, and risks leave patients with limited treatment options. Efforts are now focused on understanding the etiology of depression and identifying novel targets for pharmacological treatment. In this review, we discuss promising novel pharmacological targets for the treatment of major depressive disorder. Targeting receptors including N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, G-protein-coupled receptor 39, metabotropic glutamate receptors, galanin and opioid receptors has potential antidepressant effects. Compounds targeting biological processes: inflammation, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, and gut microbiota have also shown therapeutic potential. Additionally, natural products including plants, herbs, and fatty acids improved depressive symptoms and behaviors. In this review, a brief history of clinically available antidepressants will be provided, with a primary focus on novel pharmaceutical approaches with promising antidepressant effects in preclinical and clinical studies.","Life (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,Elias Elias; Ariel Y Zhang; Melissa T Manners
35453597,Gut Microbiota-Brain Axis as a Potential Modulator of Psychological Stress after Spinal Cord Injury.,"A growing body of evidence from preclinical and clinical studies has associated alterations of the gut microbiota-brain axis with the progression and development of a number of pathological conditions that also affect cognitive functions. Spinal cord injuries (SCIs) can be produced from traumatic and non-traumatic causes. It has been reported that SCIs are commonly associated with anxiety and depression-like symptoms, showing an incidence range between 11 and 30% after the injury. These psychological stress-related symptoms are associated with worse prognoses in SCIs and have been attributed to psychosocial stressors and losses of independence. Nevertheless, emotional and mental modifications after SCI could be related to changes in the volume of specific brain areas associated with information processing and emotions. Additionally, physiological modifications have been recognized as a predisposing factor for mental health depletion, including the development of gut dysbiosis. This condition of imbalance in microbiota composition has been shown to be associated with depression in clinical and pre-clinical models. Therefore, the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the relationship between SCIs, gut dysbiosis and psychological stress could contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies to improve SCI patients' quality of life.",Biomedicines,2022,Samir Musleh-Vega; Jorge Ojeda; Pia M Vidal
35135531,Enhanced intestinal protein fermentation in schizophrenia.,"Emerging findings highlighted the associations of mental illness to nutrition and dysbiosis in the intestinal microbiota, but the underlying mechanisms, especially in schizophrenia (SZ), remain unclarified.We conducted a case-control study of SZ patients (case to control=100:52) by performing sequencing of the gut metagenome; measurement of fecal and plasma non-targeted metabolome; including short-, medium-, and long-chain fatty acids; and targeted metabolites, along with recorded details of daily intakes of food.The metagenome analysis uncovered enrichment of asaccharolytic species and reduced abundance of carbohydrate catabolism pathways and enzymes in the gut of SZ patients, but increased abundance of peptidases in contrast to their significantly reduced protein intake. Fecal metabolome analysis identified increased concentrations of many protein catabolism products, including amino acids (AAs), urea, branched short-chain fatty acids, and various nitrogenous derivates of aromatic AAs in SZ patients. Protein synthesis, represented by the abundance of AA-biosynthesis pathways and aminoacyl-tRNA transferases in metagenome, was significantly decreased. The AUCs (area under the curve) of the diagnostic random forest models based on their abundance achieved 85% and 91%, respectively. The fecal levels of AA-fermentative enzymes and products uniformly showed positive correlations with the severity of psychiatric symptoms.Our findings revealed apparent dysbiosis in the intestinal microbiome of SZ patients, where microbial metabolism is dominated by protein fermentation and shift from carbohydrate fermentation and protein synthesis in healthy conditions. The aberrant macronutrient metabolism by gut microbes highlights the importance of nutrition care and the potential for developing microbiota-targeted therapeutics in SZ.",BMC medicine,2022,Ying Liang; Xing Shi; Yang Shen; Zhuoran Huang; Jian Wang; Changjun Shao; Yanan Chu; Jing Chen; Jun Yu; Yu Kang
36363733,"Psycho-Microbiology, a New Frontier for Probiotics: An Exploratory Overview.","Probiotics are gradually gaining importance in the field of psychiatry in the form of psychobiotics. Psychobiotics' studies examine the existing relationship between gut microbiota and mental phenomena; the intake of certain strains of probiotics, such as <i>Bifidobacterium</i> and <i>Lactobacillus</i>, for example, allow the gut microbial system to be modified in order to provide benefits at the psychic, immune, hormonal, and mental levels. Those who suffer from forms of depression, anxiety disorders, chronic stress, low mood, but also people who do not suffer from such disorders, can therefore benefit from the use of psychobiotics. Thanks to probiotics, neurochemicals can in fact be produced within the gut microbiota and interact with receptors of the enteric nervous system that innervate the entire gastrointestinal tract. Once they enter the portal circulation, these substances go on to influence components of the nervous system and ultimately the brain, through what is called the gut-brain axis. This article proposes an exploratory overview of the proven effects of probiotics on brain activity and psycho-related diseases, focusing on clinical studies and measurable outcomes.

As it becomes apparent that overweight and obesity have ripple effects through generations, understanding of the processes involved is required, in both maternal and paternal epigenetic inheritance. We focused on the patrilineal effects of a Western-style high-fat (21%) and high-sugar (34%) diet (WD) compared to control diet (CD) during adolescence and investigated F0 and F1 mice for physiological and behavioral changes. F0 males (fathers) showed increased body weight, impaired glycemic control, and decreased attractiveness to females. Paternal WD caused significant phenotypic changes in F1 offspring, including higher body weights of pups, increased Actinobacteria abundance in the gut microbiota (ascertained using 16S microbiome profiling), a food preference for WD pellets, increased male dominance and attractiveness to females, as well as decreased behavioral despair. These results collectively demonstrate the long-term intergenerational effects of a Western-style diet during paternal adolescence. The behavioral and physiological alterations in F1 offspring provide evidence of adaptive paternal programming via epigenetic inheritance. These findings have important implications for understanding paternally mediated intergenerational inheritance, and its relevance to offspring health and disease susceptibility.",FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,2022,Carina Bodden; Terence Y Pang; Yingshi Feng; Faria Mridha; Geraldine Kong; Shanshan Li; Matthew J Watt; Amy C Reichelt; Anthony J Hannan
36478577,Meals and movies: making our microbiota merry.,"To investigate the impact of festive cinematic diets on the gut microbiota.Observational (watching films) and creative review. Sadly, we couldn't incorporate any snowball sampling.In front of a television, by a blazing log fire.Everyone: you don't need to be on the nice list!Microbiota INdex of Comparative Evaluation for Pictorial Infographic Evidence (MINCE PIE) scores (difference between the numbers of microbiota-enhancing and microbiota-detrimental food groups) for foods depicted in twelve festive films.Most festive films featured meals or foods from a typical Western diet, with high sugar and fat content, with overall negative effects on the microbiota. However, some films promoted options containing fibre, beneficial proteins, or polyphenols. These are gifts under the Christmas tree for our microbiota.Good balance is needed for our microbiota, and consequently our mental health. Many festive films portray a Western diet that can lead to dysbiosis. Through their action on the gut-brain axis and the influence of media on dietary choices, the festive foods consumed in these films (maybe an extra chocolate biscuit during Love Actually) can be stressful for our microbiota.",The Medical journal of Australia,2022,Olivia Yousef; Stephen De Souza
36037991,"Effects of spleen nerve denervation on depression-like phenotype, systemic inflammation, and abnormal composition of gut microbiota in mice after administration of lipopolysaccharide: A role of brain-spleen axis.","Accumulating evidence suggests the role of brain-spleen axis as well as brain-gut-microbiota axis in inflammation-related depression. The spleen mediates anti-inflammatory effects of the vagus nerve which plays a role in depression. However, the role of spleen nerve in inflammation-related depression remains unclear.The effects of the splenic nerve denervation (SND) in the depression-like phenotype, systemic inflammation, and abnormal composition of gut microbiota in adult mice after administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were examined.LPS (0.5 mg/kg) caused depression-like phenotype, systemic inflammation, splenomegaly, increased expression of Iba1 (ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1) and decreased expression of postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95) in the hippocampus in the sham-operated mice. In contrast, LPS did not produce depression-like phenotype, and abnormal expressions of Iba1 and PSD-95 in the hippocampus in the SND-operated mice. Furthermore, SND significantly blocked LPS-induced increased plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 although SND did not affect LPS-induced splenomegaly and increased plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor-α in mice. There were significant changes in several microbiota among the four groups. Interestingly, there were correlations between the relative abundance of several microbiota and Iba1 (or PSD-95) expression in the hippocampus. In addition, expression of Iba1 in the hippocampus was correlated with the relative abundance of several microbiota.Detailed mechanisms are unclear.These results suggest that the splenic nerve plays a role in inflammation-related depression, microglial activation in the hippocampus, and that gut microbiota may regulate microglial function in the brain via gut-microbiota-brain axis.",Journal of affective disorders,2022,Li Ma; Jiancheng Zhang; Yuko Fujita; Hiroyo Shinno-Hashimoto; Jiajing Shan; Xiayun Wan; Youge Qu; Lijia Chang; Xingming Wang; Kenji Hashimoto
35715396,Experiencing social exclusion changes gut microbiota composition.,"Gut microbiota is suggested to regulate the host's mental health via the gut-brain axis. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the microbiome and psychological pain due to social exclusion. Adult individuals with (n = 14) and without (n = 25) social exclusion experience were assessed for the psychological status using self-reported questionnaires: Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Beck Depression Inventory, and the UCLA Loneliness Scale. The gut microbiota was analyzed by 16 S rRNA gene sequencing and bioinformatics. The exclusion group had a 1.70-fold higher total BAI score and 2.16-fold higher levels of anxiety-related physical symptoms (p < 0.05). The gut microbial profiles also differed between the two groups. The exclusion group showed higher probability of having Prevotella-enriched microbiome (odds ratio, 2.29; 95% confidence interval, 1.65-2.75; p < 0.05), a significantly reduced Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, and decreased abundance of Faecalibacterium spp. (p < 0.05) which was associated with the duration and intensity of social exclusion (p < 0.05). Our results indicate that the psychological pain due to social exclusion is correlated with the gut microbiota composition, suggesting that targeting social exclusion-related microorganisms can be a new approach to solving psychological problems and related social issues.",Translational psychiatry,2022,Chong-Su Kim; Go-Eun Shin; Yunju Cheong; Ji-Hee Shin; Dong-Mi Shin; Woo Young Chun
36421473,New Insights into the Gut Microbiota in Neurodegenerative Diseases from the Perspective of Redox Homeostasis.,"An imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants in the body can lead to oxidative stress, which is one of the major causes of neurodegenerative diseases. The gut microbiota contains trillions of beneficial bacteria that play an important role in maintaining redox homeostasis. In the last decade, the microbiota-gut-brain axis has emerged as a new field that has revolutionized the study of the pathology, diagnosis, and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Indeed, a growing number of studies have found that communication between the brain and the gut microbiota can be accomplished through the endocrine, immune, and nervous systems. Importantly, dysregulation of the gut microbiota has been strongly associated with the development of oxidative stress-mediated neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, a deeper understanding of the relationship between the gut microbiota and redox homeostasis will help explain the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases from a new perspective and provide a theoretical basis for proposing new therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we will describe the role of oxidative stress and the gut microbiota in neurodegenerative diseases and the underlying mechanisms by which the gut microbiota affects redox homeostasis in the brain, leading to neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, we will discuss the potential applications of maintaining redox homeostasis by modulating the gut microbiota to treat neurodegenerative diseases, which could open the door for new therapeutic approaches to combat neurodegenerative diseases.","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,Yu Wang; Zhe Zhang; Bowen Li; Bo He; Lei Li; Edouard C Nice; Wei Zhang; Jia Xu
36437014,Assessment and Treatment of Eating Disorders.,"Eating disorders are serious psychiatric conditions in terms of chronicity and have the highest mortality rate among psychiatric disorders. The assessment and treatment of eating disorders are also challenging, due to patients' denial of their illness and reluctance for change. Despite a large number of previous assessment and treatment studies, new strategies to overcome these difficulties are still needed. This study casts light on four aspects; involvement of the brain's reward system, stages of change in relationship with motivation, refeeding syndrome during renourishment, and gut microbiota changes relating to chronicity. Further studies relating to these aspects are encouraged.",Journal of nutritional science and vitaminology,2022,Kazuhiro Yoshiuchi; Hisashi Yamada; Shu Takakura; Masanori Isobe; Koutatsu Maruyama; Toshihiko Nagata
35432038,The Oral-Microbiome-Brain Axis and Neuropsychiatric Disorders: An Anthropological Perspective.,"In the 21st century, neuropsychiatric disorders (NPDs) are on the rise, yet the causal mechanisms behind this global epidemic remain poorly understood. A key to these unknowns may lie within the vast communities of bacteria, fungi, and viruses in the body (microbiota), which are intimately linked with health and disease. NPDs were recently shown to be connected to gut microbiota, which can communicate with and influence the brain through the Gut-Brain-Axis (GBA). Parallel studies examining oral microbiota and their connections to the brain also suggest that microbes in the mouth can similarly influence NPD outcomes. However, the mechanisms and pathways that illuminate how oral microbiota and brain communicate in NPDs remain unknown. Here, we review identified mechanisms and pathways that oral microbiota use to engage the brain, and we lay the theoretical foundation for an oral-microbiota-brain axis (OMBA). Specifically, we examine established neuroinflammatory and immune system activation responses that underpin interactions between the oral microbiota and the central nervous system (CNS), detailing four specific mechanisms: (1) microbial and metabolite escape, (2) neuroinflammation, (3) CNS signaling, and (4) response to neurohormones. We then scrutinize why including the OMBA, in addition to the GBA, is critically needed to elucidate specific causal relationships between microbial dysbiosis and observed NPD development and progression. Furthermore, we argue for comprehensive, interdisciplinary approaches that integrate lab-based microbiome research and population-level studies that examine the OMBA to improve NPDs. We specifically identify key anthropological perspectives that integrate sociocultural, epidemiological, genetic, and environmental factors that shape the oral microbiome and its interactions with NPDs. Together, future studies of the OMBA in conjunction with interdisciplinary approaches can be used to identify NPD risks and improve outcomes, as well as develop novel intervention and treatment strategies.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2022,Grace B Bowland; Laura S Weyrich
36120376,Neferine alleviates chronic stress-induced depression by regulating monoamine neurotransmitter secretion and gut microbiota structure.,"Neferine (Nef) might possess anti-depressive properties; however, its therapeutic effects are yet to be elucidated. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to explore the anti-depressant property of Nef using a mouse model of chronic stress-induced depression. Fifteen depression-prone mice were randomly selected and divided into three groups, namely, the model, Nef, and fluoxetine (Flu) groups. We observed that in tail suspension and forced swimming tests, the Nef and Flu treatments significantly decreased the immobility time of the depressed mice, and increased their sucrose preference indices. Moreover, both Nef and Flu treatments induced significant increases in the levels of anti-depressant neurotransmitters, including dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT), and norepinephrine (NE), and also reduced pathological damage to the hippocampus of the depressed mice. Incidentally, Illumina MiSeq sequencing analysis demonstrated that the relative abundance of <i>Lactobacillus</i> in the intestinal microbiota of depressed mice was restored after Nef/Flu treatment. Moreover, colonic <i>Lactobacillus</i> abundance was positively correlated with the levels of DA, 5-HT, and NE in the hippocampus of the mice. In conclusion, Nef improved monoamine neurotransmitter secretion and modulated the intestinal flora structure, particularly the abundance of <i>Lactobacillus</i>. Hence, it showed considerable anti-depressant potential, and might be a prospective anti-depressant therapeutic agent.",Frontiers in pharmacology,2022,Zaiquan Dong; Qinglian Xie; Feiyu Xu; Xiaoling Shen; Yanni Hao; Jin Li; Haizhen Xu; Qiang Peng; Weihong Kuang
35286767,Potential of Probiotics as an Adjunct for Patients with Major Depressive Disorder.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is an enfeebling disease with a lifetime incidence of 20%. While accumulating studies implicate a correlation between the disease and gut microbiota, data show that not every patient responded to probiotic treatments. To comprehensively assess the potential role of probiotics in MDD, this study first summarizes the current pathological hypothesis of the disease from a life-stage perspective, focuses on the potential role of ""depression gut microbiota."" Currently available managements are then briefly summarized and novel bio-materials having potential therapeutic effects on MDD are also evaluated. To harness the positive effect of probiotics, prebiotics, and postbiotics, clinical evidence and their applications on MDD patients are listed. Factors that may counteract the pre/probiotic applications, such as diet, physiology, gender difference, and use of antibiotics and antidepressants are also discussed. The endocannabinoid (eCBs) system may be promising targets for probiotic therapy. More evidence is needed to demonstrate the hierarchical factors in the complex network driving the disease, and probiotic can be one promising adjunct for patients with MDD.",Molecular nutrition & food research,2022,Weihe Cang; Junrui Wu; Ruixue Ding; Weiming Wang; Na Li; Haisu Shi; Lin Shi; Yuankun Lee; Rina Wu
36078738,The Role of Psychobiotics to Ensure Mental Health during the COVID-19 Pandemic-A Current State of Knowledge.,"Psychobiotics are defined as probiotics, mainly of the genus <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, that confer mental health benefits to the host when consumed in a particular quantity through the interaction with commensal gut microbiota. The gut microbiota, which means a diverse and dynamic population of microorganisms harboring the gastrointestinal tract, communicates with the brain and vice versa through the brain-gut axis. The mechanisms of action of psychobiotics may be divided into four groups: synthesis of neurotransmitters and neurochemicals, regulation of the HPA axis, influence on the immune system, and synthesis of metabolites. Recent years showed that the COVID-19 pandemic affected not only physical, but also mental health. Social isolation, fear of infection, the lack of adequate vaccine, disinformation, increased number of deaths, financial loss, quarantine, and lockdown are all factors can cause psychiatric problems. The aim of this review was to discuss the potential role of psychobiotic in light of the current problems, based on <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies, meta-analyses, clinical trials evidence, and registered studies assessing probiotics' therapeutic administration in the prevention or treatment of symptoms or side effects of COVID-19.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2022,Dorota Zielińska; Marcelina Karbowiak; Aneta Brzezicka
35840611,The effects of probiotics on risk and time preferences.,"Animal models, human neuroimaging and lesion studies revealed that the gut microbiota can influence the interaction between the central and the enteric nervous systems via the gut-brain axis (GBA) and can affect brain regions linked to basic emotional and cognitive processes. The role of the gut microbiota in decision-making in healthy humans thus far remains largely unknown. Our study establishes a functional relationship between the gut microbiota and healthy humans' decisions that involve risk and time. We conducted a between subjects' placebo-controlled double-blinded design, with two groups and two sessions separated by 28 days, during which participants received daily doses of probiotics or a placebo. We investigated whether the prolonged and controlled intake of probiotics affects risk-taking behavior and intertemporal choices using incentivized economic tasks. We found a significant decrease in risk-taking behavior and an increase in future-oriented choices in the probiotics group as compared to the placebo group. These findings provide the first direct experimental evidence suggesting a potential functional role on the part of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in decision-making, creating a path for potential clinical applications and allowing for a better understanding of the underlying neural mechanisms of risk-taking behavior and intertemporal choices.",Scientific reports,2022,Aline M Dantas; Alexander T Sack; Elisabeth Bruggen; Peiran Jiao; Teresa Schuhmann
36329546,A critical analysis of eating disorders and the gut microbiome.,"The gut microbiota, also known as our ""second brain"" is an exciting frontier of research across a multitude of health domains. Gut microbes have been implicated in feeding behaviour and obesity, as well as mental health disorders including anxiety and depression, however their role in the development and maintenance of eating disorders (EDs) has only recently been considered. EDs are complex mental health conditions, shaped by a complicated interplay of factors. Perhaps due to an incomplete understanding of the etiology of EDs, treatment remains inadequate with affected individuals likely to face many relapses. The gut microbiota may be a missing piece in understanding the etiology of eating disorders, however more robust scientific inquiry is needed in the field before concrete conclusions can be made. In this spotlight paper, we critically evaluate what is known about the bi-directional relationship between gut microbes and biological processes that are implicated in the development and maintenance of EDs, including physiological functioning, hormones, neurotransmitters, the central nervous system, and the immune system. We outline limitations of current research, propose concrete steps to move the field forward and, hypothesize potential clinical implications of this research. Our gut is inhabited by millions of bacteria which have more recently been referred to as ""our second brain"". In fact, these microbes are thought to play a role in ED behaviour, associated anxiety and depression, and even affect our weight. Recent research has dove into this field with promising findings that have the potential to be applied clinically to improve ED recovery. The present paper discusses what is known about the gut microbiome in relation to EDs and the promising implications that leveraging this knowledge, through fecal microbiome transplants, probiotics, and microbiome-directed supplemental foods, could have on ED treatment.",Journal of eating disorders,2022,Sydney M Terry; Jacqueline A Barnett; Deanna L Gibson
36959989,Emerging Role and Place of Probiotics in the Management of Pediatric Neurodevelopmental Disorders.,"The current decade has witnessed significant developments with the latest therapeutic agents for managing various infectious diseases to complex hemato-oncological conditions, leading to a decrease in morbidity and mortality, while improving the quality of life (QoL), and increasing the life span. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), which are on the rise across all age-groups, are being driven by unhealthy lifestyles and improved mental health issues. The current therapeutic agents were found to offer only symptomatic relief of varying efficacy and significant adverse effects, leading clinicians to evaluate other options for the management of both neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. The role of gut microbiota has emerged as a potential target for the treatment of both neurodegenerative diseases and neurodevelopmental disorders like attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)/autism spectrum disorders (ASD) as a result of the decoding of the human genome and advances in our understanding of the human gut microbiome, including its interactions with the human brain. This review has been undertaken to understand on date level of understanding of human microbiota and towards identifying probiotic strains with proven efficacy and safety. According to recent investigations, several <i>lactobacillus</i> strains, including <i>L.</i> <i>Paracasei 37</i>, <i>L. Planetarium 128, L. reuteri DSM 17938</i>, and <i>Bifidobacterium longum</i>, have been effective in treating children's neurodevelopmental disorders such as ASD and ADHD.

The shared and specific BA profiles were explored and potential markers associated with disease development and progression were summarized. The mechanistic roles of BAs were reviewed with focuses on inflammation, gut-brain-microbiota axis, cellular apoptosis. We also discussed future perspectives for the prevention and treatment of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders by targeting BAs and related molecules and gut microbiota.

35779628,(R)-ketamine as prophylactic and therapeutic drug for neurological disorders: Beyond depression.,"Neurological disorders are the leading cause of disability and the second leading cause of death worldwide. The increasing social and economic burdens of neurological disorders are driven by global population growth and aging. Depression is a common psychiatric symptom in numerous neurological disorders. It is also a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias, Parkinson's disease (PD), and stroke. The rapid-acting and sustained antidepressant actions of (R,S)-ketamine for severe depression was accidentally discovered. Interestingly, (R)-ketamine has greater potency and longer-lasting antidepressant-like effects than (S)-ketamine in rodents. Importantly, its side effects in rodents and humans are lower than those of (R,S)-ketamine and (S)-ketamine. Furthermore, (R)-ketamine could elicit beneficial actions in various rodent models of neurological disorders, including PD, multiple sclerosis (MS), and stroke. In this article, we review the potential of (R)-ketamine as a prophylactic or therapeutic drug for neurological disorders including AD and other dementias, PD, MS, and stroke.",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,2022,Xingming Wang; Jianjun Yang; Kenji Hashimoto
36104346,"Maternal immune activation induces autism-like changes in behavior, neuroinflammatory profile and gut microbiota in mouse offspring of both sexes.","Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a sex-biased neurodevelopmental disorder with a male to female prevalence of 4:1, characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and interaction and restricted-repetitive patterns of behavior, interests or activities. Microbiota alterations as well as signs of neuroinflammation have been also reported in ASD. The involvement of immune dysregulation in ASD is further supported by evidence suggesting that maternal immune activation (MIA), especially during early pregnancy, may be a risk factor for ASD. The present study was aimed at characterizing the effects of MIA on behavior, gut microbiota and neuroinflammation in the mouse offspring also considering the impact of MIA in the two sexes. MIA offspring exhibited significant ASD-like behavioral alterations (i.e., deficits in sociability and sensorimotor gating, perseverative behaviors). The analysis of microbiota revealed changes in specific microbial taxa that recapitulated those seen in ASD children. In addition, molecular analyses indicated sex-related differences in the neuroinflammatory responses triggered by MIA, with a more prominent effect in the cerebellum. Our data suggest that both sexes should be included in the experimental designs of preclinical studies in order to identify those mechanisms that confer different vulnerability to ASD to males and females.",Translational psychiatry,2022,Anna Maria Tartaglione; Annacandida Villani; Maria Antonietta Ajmone-Cat; Luisa Minghetti; Laura Ricceri; Valerio Pazienza; Roberta De Simone; Gemma Calamandrei
36191590,Features of gut microbiota in patients with anorexia nervosa.,"Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a psychological disorder, which is characterized by the misunderstanding of body image, food restriction, and low body weight. An increasing number of studies have reported that the pathophysiological mechanism of AN might be associated with the dysbiosis of gut microbiota. The purpose of our study was to explore the features of gut microbiota in patients with AN, hoping to provide valuable information on its pathogenesis and treatment.In this cross-sectional study, from August 2020 to June 2021, patients with AN who were admitted into Peking University Third Hospital and Peking University Sixth Hospital ( n   =  30) were recruited as the AN group, and healthy controls (HC) were recruited from a middle school and a university in Beijing ( n   =  30). Demographic data, Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) scores of the two groups, and length of stay of the AN group were recorded. Microbial diversity analysis of gut microbiota in stool samples from the two groups was analyzed by 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing.The weight (AN vs. HC, [39.31 ± 7.90] kg vs. [56.47 ± 8.88] kg, P  < 0.001) and body mass index (BMI, AN vs. HC, [14.92 ± 2.54] kg/m 2vs. [20.89 ± 2.14] kg/m 2 , P  < 0.001) of patients with AN were statistically significantly lower than those of HC, and HAMD scores in AN group were statistically significantly higher than those of HC. For alpha diversity, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups; for beta diversity, the two groups differed obviously regarding community composition. Compared to HC, the proportion of Lachnospiraceae in patients with AN was statistically significantly higher (AN vs. HC, 40.50% vs. 31.21%, Z  = -1.981, P  = 0.048), while that of Ruminococcaceae was lower (AN vs. HC, 12.17% vs. 19.15%, Z  = -2.728, P  = 0.007); the proportion of Faecalibacterium (AN vs. HC, 3.97% vs. 9.40%, Z  = -3.638, P  < 0.001) and Subdoligranulum (AN vs. HC, 4.60% vs. 7.02%, Z  = -2.369, P  = 0.018) were statistically significantly lower, while that of Eubacterium_hallii_group was significantly higher (AN vs. HC, 7.63% vs. 3.43%, Z  = -2.115, P  = 0.035). Linear discriminant effect (LEfSe) analysis (LDA score >3.5) showed that o_Lachnospirales, f_Lachnospiraceae, and g_Eubacterium_hallii_group (o, f and g represents order, family and genus respectively) were enriched in patients with AN. Microbial function of nutrient transport and metabolism in AN group were more abundant ( P  > 0.05). In AN group, weight and BMI were significantly negatively correlated with the abundance of Bacteroidota and Bacteroides , while positively correlated with Subdoligranulum . BMI was significantly positively correlated with Firmicutes; HAMD scores were significantly negatively correlated with Faecalibacterium.The composition of gut microbiota in patients with AN was different from that of healthy people.

35711580,Schizophrenia Patients With Prevotella-Enterotype Have a Higher Risk of Obesity.,"Recent studies have indicated the critical influence of gut microbiota on the occurrence of obesity. There is a significant risk of obesity in people with schizophrenia. This work proposed that the disorder of gut microbiota in patients with schizophrenia was based on microbial enterotypes. Ninety-seven patients with schizophrenia and 69 matched health controls were eligible. The fresh feces of all the subjects were collected and used to complete 16S rRNA sequence. Statistical analysis was performed to identify the intestinal type of gut microbiota and analyze their potential effects on metabolic function. The patients with enterotype-P had a higher BMI than that of the others. Several differences in the gut microbes of enterotype-P were found between the patients and the controls. Proteobacteria and Firmicutes had significantly higher abundance in the patients' group with enterotype-P. The Bacteroidetes had higher abundance in health controls with enterotype-P. Different metabolic pathways of the microbiota with the enterotype-P were identified in the subjects categorized in different BMI intervals. The schizophrenia patients had a significantly higher BMI than that of health controls. The patients with enterotype-P had a higher BMI. Therefore, the enterotype-P might have a critical influence on a variety of metabolic pathways to disturb the metabolism of glucose and lipid in human body.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2022,Ying Liang; Yang Shen; Gaofei Li; Ye Yuan; Meng Zhang; Jiayu Gao
35956395,Positive Effects of α-Lactalbumin in the Management of Symptoms of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.,"To date, the involvement of α-Lactalbumin (α-LA) in the management of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) refers to its ability to improve intestinal absorption of natural molecules like inositols, overcoming the inositol resistance. However, due to its own aminoacidic building blocks, α-LA is involved in various biological processes that can open new additional applications. A great portion of women with PCOS exhibit gastrointestinal dysbiosis, which is in turn one of the triggering mechanisms of the syndrome. Due to its prebiotic effect, α-LA can recover dysbiosis, also improving the insulin resistance, obesity and intestinal inflammation frequently associated with PCOS. Further observations suggest that altered gut microbiota negatively influence mental wellbeing. Depressive mood and low serotonin levels are indeed common features of women with PCOS. Thanks to its content of tryptophan, which is the precursor of serotonin, and considering the strict link between gut and brain, using α-LA contributes to preserving mental well-being by maintaining high levels of serotonin. In addition, considering women with PCOS seeking pregnancy, both altered microbiota and serotonin levels can induce later consequences in the offspring. Therefore, a deeper knowledge of potential applications of α-LA is required to transition to preclinical and clinical studies extending its therapeutic advantages in PCOS.",Nutrients,2022,Vincenzo Cardinale; Elisa Lepore; Sabrina Basciani; Salvatore Artale; Maurizio Nordio; Mariano Bizzarri; Vittorio Unfer
36558556,The Effect of Breast Milk Microbiota on the Composition of Infant Gut Microbiota: A Cohort Study.,"Evidence shows that breast milk microbiota and an infant’s gut microbiota are related. This study aimed to compare the effects of breast milk microbiota on the construction and colonization of gut microbiota in newborns. In this study, 23 healthy infants were selected and divided into a breastfeeding group (13) and a mixed feeding group (10) based on the feeding method within one month of age. Infant fecal and breast milk samples were collected on the day of birth (0 day) and 30 days after birth (30 days) for 16S rRNA second-generation sequencing and SCFA detection. The results showed that Firmicutes and Actinobacteriota on day 0 and Firmicutes and Proteobacteria on 30 d dominated breast milk gut microbiota. There were correlations between the breast milk microbiota and the infant gut microbiota in each group (p < 0.05). Additionally, breast milk microbiota correlated more significantly with infants’ SCFAs in the breastfeeding group than in the mixed feeding group. This study showed that breast milk microbiota partially influences the construction of infant gut microbiota, with some key strains having a crucial influence, such as Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Enterobacter. However, the effect of breast milk microbiota on infant gut microbiota is not through direct strain transmission but has been indirectly influenced, which may be related to the cross-feeding effect mediated by SCFAs.",Nutrients,2022,Yapeng Li; Lei Ren; Yunyi Wang; Jinxing Li; Qingqing Zhou; Chenrui Peng; Yuchen Li; Ruyue Cheng; Fang He; Xi Shen
35312049,Can gut microbiota throughout the first 10 years of life predict executive functioning in childhood?,"Animal models suggest that the gut microbiota can influence cognitive development and functioning via various pathways. In line with that, a first human study found associations between infant fecal microbiota composition and cognition at 2 years of age. This longitudinal study investigated whether fecal microbiota composition in infancy and childhood is associated with executive functioning in childhood. We followed healthy individuals from birth to their 10th year of life. Executive functioning was assessed using the Digit Span working memory test at 10 years of age and the ecologically valid Behavior Rating Inventory for executive functioning at 8 and 10 years. Stool samples were collected at month 1, 3 and 4 as well as at 6 and 10 years. The V4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA was analyzed to determine microbial composition at the genus level. Using established statistical techniques for microbiota analysis, we did not find associations between fecal microbiota composition and executive functioning after accounting for breastfeeding, maternal education, child sex and age. Our study results are most compatible with the absence or only a weak relationship between infant and childhood fecal microbiota composition and executive functioning in childhood in healthy community children.",Developmental psychobiology,2022,Henrik Andreas Eckermann; Yangwenshan Ou; Leo Lahti; Carolina de Weerth
35666299,Gut-microbiota-brain axis in the vulnerability to psychosis in adulthood after repeated cannabis exposure during adolescence.,"Increasing epidemiological evidence shows that the use of cannabis during adolescence could increase the risk for psychosis in adulthood. However, the precise mechanisms underlying long-lasting cannabis-induced risk for psychosis remain unclear. Accumulating evidence suggests the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders. Here, we examined whether gut microbiota plays a role in the risk for psychosis of adult after exposure of cannabinoid (CB) receptor agonist WIN55,212-2 during adolescence. Repeated administration of WIN55,212-2 (2 mg/kg/day) during adolescence (P35-P45) significantly increased the expression of Iba1 (ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) of adult mice after administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS: 0.5 mg/kg). In contrast, there were no changes in blood levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines between the two groups. Although alpha-diversity and beta-diversity of gut microbiota were no differences between the two groups, there were several microbes altered between the two groups. Interestingly, there were significant correlations between the relative abundance of microbiota and Iba1 expression in the mPFC and NAc. Furthermore, there were also significant correlations between the relative abundance of microbiota and several metabolites in the blood. These findings suggest that gut microbiota may play a role in the microglial activation in the mPFC and NAc of adult mice after repeated WIN55,212-2 exposure during adolescence. Therefore, it is likely that gut-microbiota-microglia crosstalk might play a role in increased risk for psychosis in adults with cannabis use during adolescence.",European archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience,2022,Xiayun Wan; Akifumi Eguchi; Youge Qu; Yong Yang; Lijia Chang; Jiajing Shan; Chisato Mori; Kenji Hashimoto
35799798,Association Between Non-Suicidal Self-Injury and Gut Microbial Characteristics in Chinese Adolescent.,"By exploring the gut-related microbiota differences of adolescents with non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and depression (without NSSI) and healthy volunteers, we provide a theoretical basis for the prevention and control of NSSI in adolescents through intestinal microecological regulation.A total of 99 subjects were recruited in Guangdong Province, China, including 51 adolescents with NSSI (KD), 24 healthy adolescents (NOR1), and 24 depression adolescents without NSSI (NOR2). General clinical data and fecal samples were collected from all subjects, who were assessed using the NSSI Behavioral Questionnaire and the 24-item Hamilton Depression Scale. The taxonomic composition of the gut microbiota was determined using the 16S rDNA gene sequencing method.There were significant differences in diversity between the KD and NOR1, and the species uniformity index of the KD according to the Shannon and Simpson indices was significantly reduced compared with that of the NOR1 (4.81 vs 5.21, p<0.01; 0.02 vs 0.01, p<0.05). The relative abundances were different among the KD, NOR1 and NOR2, as reflected at the taxonomic levels of class, order, family, genus, and species. Bacteroides were the dominant flora of the KD and NOR2, while Mitsuokella was the dominant flora that distinguished the KD from the NOR2.We found that gut microbiota diversity was decreased in adolescents with NSSI, and the relative abundance was altered at different taxonomic levels. These results enrich the understanding of the relationship between NSSI and depression and the gut microbiota, Supporting that NSSI and depression are not homologous disorders. What is more, it establishes the basis for exploring the mechanisms of flora action in NSSI, providing a possible direction for NSSI to achieve a better prognosis and prevent relapse.",Neuropsychiatric disease and treatment,2022,Li-Fei Cai; Shi-Bin Wang; Cai-Lan Hou; Ze-Bin Li; Yi-Jun Liao; Fu-Jun Jia
36370535,"Gut mycobiota dysbiosis in drug-naïve, first-episode schizophrenia.","Bacterial dysbiosis has been demonstrated in patients with schizophrenia (SCH). The aim of the present study was to investigate alterations in mycobiota composition and fungi-bacteria correlation network in drug-naïve, first episode SCH. We recruited 205 SCH patients and 125 healthy controls (HCs), whose gut bacterial and fungal compositions were characterized by 16S and 18S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing, respectively. Fungal-bacterial relative correlation network analysis was performed using the Spearman's test and distance correlation. We also computed relative networks connectedness, which represents the ratio of significant interactions (edges) and taxa (nodes) in the network. SCH patients showed lower fungal α-diversity compared with that of HCs. Furthermore, we identified 29 differential fungal markers at multiple taxonomies between SCH patients and HCs. SCH patients also showed a significantly lower fungi-to-bacteria α-diversity ratio compared with that of HCs (p = 1.81 × 10<sup>-8</sup>). In risk prediction models, we observed that combining bacterial and fungal markers achieved higher accuracy than that of bacterial markers alone (AUC = 0.847 vs AUC = 0.739; p = 0.043). Fungal-bacterial correlation network was denser in HCs than in SCH patients and was characterized by a high number of neighbors (p < 0.05). In addition, an increased abundance of Purpureocillium was associated with more severe psychiatric symptoms and poorer cognitive function in SCH patients (p < 0.05). Our study demonstrated a disrupted and weakened fungi-bacteria network in SCH patients, which might be associated with their clinical manifestations. Future research on fungal-bacterial correlation network is warranted to advance our understanding about the role of mycobiota in the etiology of SCH and to explore novel intervention approaches.",Schizophrenia research,2022,Xiuxia Yuan; Xue Li; Yulin Kang; Lijuan Pang; Gangrui Hei; Xiaoyun Zhang; Shuying Wang; Xinyi Zhao; Siwei Zhang; Qi Tao; Liyuan Zhang; Qiyue Zhu; Luxian Lv; Xiaoduo Fan; Shaohua Hu; Xueqin Song

35399732,Gut-Thyroid axis: How gut microbial dysbiosis associated with euthyroid thyroid cancer.,"Thyroid cancer in humans has a fast-growing prevalence, with the most common lethal endocrine malignancy for unknown reasons<b>.</b> The current study was aimed to perform qualitative and quantitative investigation and characterization of the gut bacterial composition of euthyroid thyroid cancer patients. The fecal samples were collected from sixteen euthyroid thyroid cancer patients and ten from healthy subjects. The PCR-DGGE was conducted by targetting the V3 region of 16S rRNA gene, as well as real-time PCR for <i>Bacteroides vulgatus, E.coli Bifidobacterium, Clostridium leptum</i> and <i>Lactobacillus</i> were carried. High-throughput sequencing of V3+V4 region of 16S rRNA gene was performed on Hiseq 2500 platform on 20 (10 healthy & 10 diseased subjects) randomly selected fecal samples. The richness indices and comparative diversity analysis showed significant gut microbial modification in euthyroid thyroid cancer than control. At phylum level, there was significant enrichment of Firmicutes, Verrucomicrobia, while a significant decrease in Bacteroidetes was detected in the experimental group. At family statistics, significant high levels of Ruminococcaceae and Verrucomicrobiaceae, while the significant lower abundance of Bacteroidaceae, Prevotellaceae, Porphyromonadaceae, and Alcaligenaceae was after observed. It also found that the significantly raised level of <i>Escherichia-Shigella, Akkermansia</i> [Eubacterium]_coprostanoligenes<i>, Dorea, Subdoligranulum,</i> and <i>Ruminococcus_2 genera,</i> while significantly lowered genera of the patient group were <i>Prevotella_9</i>, <i>Bacteroides</i> and <i>Klebsiella</i>. The species-level gut microbial composition showed a significantly raised level of <i>Escherichia coli in</i> euthyroid thyroid cancer. Thus, this study reveals that euthyroid thyroid cancer patients have significant gut microbial dysbiosis. Moreover, Statistics (P<0.05) of each gut microbial taxa were significantly changed in euthyroid thyroid cancer patients. Therefore, the current study may propose new approaches to understanding thyroid cancer patients' disease pathways, mechanisms, and treatment.",Journal of Cancer,2022,Hafiz Muhammad Ishaq; Imran Shair Mohammad; Riaz Hussain; Rashida Parveen; Jafir Hussain Shirazi; Yang Fan; Muhammad Shahzad; Khezar Hayat; Huan Li; Ayesha Ihsan; Kiran Sher Muhammad; Muhammad Usman; Siruo Zhang; Lu Yuan; Shakir Ullah; Ana Cláudia Paiva-Santos; Jiru Xu
35967810,The Potential of Honey as a Prebiotic Food to Re-engineer the Gut Microbiome Toward a Healthy State.,"Honey has a long history of use for the treatment of digestive ailments. Certain honey types have well-established bioactive properties including antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities. In addition, honey contains non-digestible carbohydrates in the form of oligosaccharides, and there is increasing evidence from <i>in vitro</i>, animal, and pilot human studies that some kinds of honey have prebiotic activity. Prebiotics are foods or compounds, such as non-digestible carbohydrates, that are used to promote specific, favorable changes in the composition and function of the gut microbiota. The gut microbiota plays a critical role in human health and well-being, with disturbances to the balance of these organisms linked to gut inflammation and the development and progression of numerous conditions, such as colon cancer, irritable bowel syndrome, obesity, and mental health issues. Consequently, there is increasing interest in manipulating the gut microbiota to a more favorable balance as a way of improving health by dietary means. Current research suggests that certain kinds of honey can reduce the presence of infection-causing bacteria in the gut including <i>Salmonella</i>, <i>Escherichia coli</i>, and <i>Clostridiodes difficile</i>, while simultaneously stimulating the growth of potentially beneficial species, such as <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Bifidobacteria.</i> In this paper, we review the current and growing evidence that shows the prebiotic potential of honey to promote healthy gut function, regulate the microbial communities in the gut, and reduce infection and inflammation. We outline gaps in knowledge and explore the potential of honey as a viable option to promote or re-engineer a healthy gut microbiome.",Frontiers in nutrition,2022,Kathleen R Schell; Kenya E Fernandes; Erin Shanahan; Isabella Wilson; Shona E Blair; Dee A Carter; Nural N Cokcetin
36058421,Altered gut microbiota correlates with behavioral problems but not gastrointestinal symptoms in individuals with autism.,"Despite inconsistent results across studies, emerging evidence suggests that the microbial micro-environment may be associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Geographical and cultural factors highly impact microbial profiles, and there is a shortage of data from East Asian populations. This study aimed to comprehensively characterize microbial profiles in an East Asian sample and explore whether gut microbiota contributes to clinical symptoms, emotional/behavioral problems, and GI symptoms in ASD.We assessed 82 boys and young men with ASD and 31 typically developing controls (TDC), aged 6-25 years. We analyzed the stool sample of all participants with 16S V3-V4 rRNA sequencing and correlated its profile with GI symptoms, autistic symptoms, and emotional/behavioral problems.Autistic individuals, compared to TDC, had worse GI symptoms. There were no group differences in alpha diversity of species richness estimates (Shannon-wiener and Simpson diversity indices). Participants with ASD had an increased relative abundance of Fusobacterium, Ruminococcus torques group (at the genus level), and Bacteroides plebeius DSM 17135 (at the species level), while a decreased relative abundance of Ruminococcaceae UCG 013, Ervsipelotrichaceae UCG 003, Parasutterella, Clostridium sensu stricto 1, Turicibacter (at the genus level), and Clostridium spiroforme DSM 1552 and Intestinimonas butyriciproducens (at the species level). Altered taxonomic diversity in ASD significantly correlated with autistic symptoms, thought problems, delinquent behaviors, self dysregulation, and somatic complaints. We did not find an association between gut symptoms and gut microbial dysbiosis.Our findings suggest that altered microbiota are associated with behavioral phenotypes but not GI symptoms in ASD. The function of the identified microbial profiles mainly involves the immune pathway, supporting the hypothesis of a complex relationship between altered microbiome, immune dysregulation, and ASD that may advance the discovery of molecular biomarkers for ASD.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2022,Yu-Chieh Chen; Hsiang-Yuan Lin; Yiling Chien; Yu-Hung Tung; Yen-Hsuan Ni; Susan Shur-Fen Gau
35981685,Depression-like behaviors in mouse model of Sjögren's syndrome: A role of gut-microbiota-brain axis.,"Depression is a common psychiatric symptom in patients with Sjögren's syndrome (SS). Prevalence of depression in SS patients is significantly higher than that in the general population. Increasing evidence suggests a crucial role of gut-microbiota-brain axis in depression. In this study, we investigated whether non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, a widely used animal model of SS, exhibit depression-like phenotypes and abnormal composition of gut microbiota. Eleven-week-old NOD mice spontaneously exhibited SS-related symptoms without pancreatic destruction. NOD mice displayed depression-like behaviors, decreased expression of synaptic proteins in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and abnormal composition of gut microbiota. Interestingly, SS-related proinflammatory factors in the submandibular gland (SMG) and autoantibodies (anti-SSA and anti-SSB) in the plasma were correlated with the expression of synaptic proteins in the PFC or depression-like behaviors. In addition, there were correlations between the relative abundance of microbiota and SS-related symptoms (or depression-related phenotypes). These data suggest that SS-related symptoms and abnormal composition of gut microbiota may play a role in depression-like phenotypes in NOD mice through gut-microbiota-brain axis.","Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior",2022,Yaoyu Pu; Yangyang He; Xueting Zhao; Qiuping Zhang; Ji Wen; Kenji Hashimoto; Yi Liu
35309241,Consensus on potential biomarkers developed for use in clinical tests for schizophrenia.,"Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness affecting approximately 20 million individuals globally. Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the illness. If left undiagnosed and untreated, schizophrenia results in impaired social function, repeated hospital admissions, reduced quality of life and decreased life expectancy. Clinical diagnosis largely relies on subjective evidence, including self-reported experiences, and reported behavioural abnormalities followed by psychiatric evaluation. In addition, psychoses may occur along with other conditions, and the symptoms are often episodic and transient, posing a significant challenge to the precision of diagnosis. Therefore, objective, specific tests using biomarkers are urgently needed for differential diagnosis of schizophrenia in clinical practice.We aimed to provide evidence-based and consensus-based recommendations, with a summary of laboratory measurements that could potentially be used as biomarkers for schizophrenia, and to discuss directions for future research.We searched publications within the last 10 years with the following keywords: 'schizophrenia', 'gene', 'inflammation', 'neurotransmitter', 'protein marker', 'gut microbiota', 'pharmacogenomics' and 'biomarker'. A draft of the consensus was discussed and agreed on by all authors at a round table session.We summarised the characteristics of candidate diagnostic markers for schizophrenia, including genetic, inflammatory, neurotransmitter, peripheral protein, pharmacogenomic and gut microbiota markers. We also proposed a novel laboratory process for diagnosing schizophrenia in clinical practice based on the evidence summarised in this paper.Further efforts are needed to identify schizophrenia-specific genetic and epigenetic markers for precise diagnosis, differential diagnosis and ethnicity-specific markers for the Chinese population. The development of novel laboratory techniques is making it possible to use these biomarkers clinically to diagnose disease.",General psychiatry,2022,Ping Lin; Junyu Sun; Xiaoyan Lou; Dan Li; Yun Shi; Zhenhua Li; Peijun Ma; Ping Li; Shuzi Chen; Weifeng Jin; Shuai Liu; Qing Chen; Qiong Gao; Lili Zhu; Jie Xu; Mengyuan Zhu; Mengxia Wang; Kangyi Liang; Ling Zhao; Huabin Xu; Ke Dong; Qingtian Li; Xunjia Cheng; Jinghong Chen; Xiaokui Guo
36365032,The Role of the Microbiome in the Metabolic Health of People with Schizophrenia and Related Psychoses: Cross-Sectional and Pre-Post Lifestyle Intervention Analyses.,"The microbiome has been implicated in the development of metabolic conditions which occur at high rates in people with schizophrenia and related psychoses. This exploratory proof-of-concept study aimed to: (i) characterize the gut microbiota in antipsychotic naïve or quasi-naïve people with first-episode psychosis, and people with established schizophrenia receiving clozapine therapy; (ii) test for microbiome changes following a lifestyle intervention which included diet and exercise education and physical activity. Participants were recruited from the Eastern Suburbs Mental Health Service, Sydney, Australia. Anthropometric, lifestyle and gut microbiota data were collected at baseline and following a 12-week lifestyle intervention. Stool samples underwent 16S rRNA sequencing to analyse microbiota diversity and composition. Seventeen people with established schizophrenia and five people with first-episode psychosis were recruited and matched with 22 age-sex, BMI and ethnicity matched controls from a concurrent study for baseline comparisons. There was no difference in α-diversity between groups at baseline, but microbial composition differed by 21 taxa between the established schizophrenia group and controls. In people with established illness pre-post comparison of α-diversity showed significant increases after the 12-week lifestyle intervention. This pilot study adds to the current literature that detail compositional differences in the gut microbiota of people with schizophrenia compared to those without mental illness and suggests that lifestyle interventions may increase gut microbial diversity in patients with established illness. These results show that microbiome studies are feasible in patients with established schizophrenia and larger studies are warranted to validate microbial signatures and understand the relevance of lifestyle change in the development of metabolic conditions in this population.","Pathogens (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,Maryanne O'Donnell; Scott B Teasdale; Xin-Yi Chua; Jamie Hardman; Nan Wu; Jackie Curtis; Katherine Samaras; Patrick Bolton; Margaret J Morris; Cyndi Shannon Weickert; Tertia Purves-Tyson; Fatima El-Assaad; Xiao-Tao Jiang; Georgina L Hold; Emad El-Omar
35937875,Gut microbiome: A potential indicator for predicting treatment outcomes in major depressive disorder.,"The therapeutic outcomes in major depressive disorder (MDD), one of the most common and heterogeneous mental illnesses, are affected by factors that remain unclear and often yield unsatisfactory results. Herein, we characterized the composition and metabolic function of the gut microbiota of patients with MDD during antidepressant treatment, based on 16S rRNA sequencing and metabolomics. The microbial signatures at baseline differed significantly between responder and non-responder groups. The gut microbiota of the non-responder group was mainly characterized by increased relative abundances of the phylum Actinobacteria, families Christensenellaceae and Eggerthellaceae, and genera <i>Adlercreutzia</i> and <i>Christensenellaceae R7 group</i> compared to that of the responder group. Additionally, the gut microbiota composition of the responder and non-responder groups differed significantly before and after treatment, especially at the genus level. Moreover, 20 differential metabolites between the responder and non-responder groups were identified that were mainly involved in lipid metabolism (cholestane steroids and steroid esters). Eggerthellaceae and <i>Adlercreutzia</i> displayed strong co-occurrence relationships with certain metabolites, suggesting alternations in the gut microbiome, and associated metabolites may be potential mediators of successful antidepressant treatment. Overall, our study demonstrates that alterations in gut microbiota composition and metabolic function might be relevant to the response to antidepressants, thereby providing insight into mechanisms responsible for their efficacy.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2022,Zaiquan Dong; Xiaoling Shen; Yanni Hao; Jin Li; Haizhen Xu; Li Yin; Weihong Kuang
36088985,A role of microRNA-149 in the prefrontal cortex for prophylactic actions of (R)-ketamine in inflammation model.,"MicroRNAs (or miRNAs) are short, regulatory RNAs that act as post-transcriptional repressors of gene expression. Recently, we reported that the nuclear factor of activated T cells 4 (NFATc4) signaling might contribute to sustained prophylactic effects of new antidepressant (R)-ketamine in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated inflammation model of depression. In this study, we examined the role of miRNAs (miR-149 and miR-7688-5p) which can regulate NFATc4 in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of male mice after administration of LPS (1.0 mg/kg). There was a positive correlation between the expression of Nfatc4 and the expression of miR-149 in the PFC. There was also a negative correlation between gene expression of Nfatc4 and gene expression of miR-7688-5p in the PFC. Gut microbiota analysis showed that pretreatment with (R)-ketamine (10 mg/kg) could restore altered composition of gut microbiota in LPS-treated mice. A network analysis showed that gut microbiota may regulate gene expression of Nfatc4 and miR-149 (or miR-7688-5p) in the PFC. Finally, inhibition of miR-149 by antagomiR-149 blocked LPS-induced depression-like behavior by attenuating LPS-induced expression of NFATc4 in the PFC. These findings suggest that the regulation of NFATc4 signaling by miR-149 might play a role in persistent prophylactic effects of (R)-ketamine, and that gut microbiota may regulate the gene expression of miRNAs in the PFC through gut-microbiota-brain axis.",Neuropharmacology,2022,Li Ma; Long Wang; Lijia Chang; Jiajing Shan; Youge Qu; Xingming Wang; Yuko Fujita; Kenji Hashimoto
36358286,The Effect of Long-Term Moderate Static Magnetic Field Exposure on Adult Female Mice.,"Because of the high cost and safety of ultra-high magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), its application has certain limitations. Whereas 0.5−3 T MRI has been widely applied in hospitals, static magnetic fields (SMFs) have been shown to improve mice mental health and have anti-tumor potentials. Here, we compared the effects of the upward and downward 150 mT SMF groups with the sham group on C57BL/6J adult female mice. Locomotor and exploratory activity were also measured by behavioral tests, including the open field and elevated plus test. Additionally, physiology, pathology indicators and gut microbiota were examined. We found that 150 mT SMFs long-term exposure enhanced locomotive and exploratory activity of mice, especially the downward 150 mT SMF. Compared with the downward 150 mT SMF group, the movement speed and distance in the center area of the sham group were increased by 65.99% (p < 0.0001) and 68.58% (p = 0.0038), respectively. Moreover, compared to the sham group, downward 150 mT SMF increased the number of entrances to the center area by 67.0% (p = 0.0082) and time in the center area by 77.12% (p = 0.0054). Additionally, we observed that upward 150 mT SMF improved the number of follicles (~2.5 times, p = 0.0325) and uterine glands through increasing the total antioxidant capacity and reducing lipid peroxidation level in mice. Gut microbiome analysis showed that 150 mT SMFs long-term exposure improved the microbiota abundance (Clostridium, Bifidobacterium, Ralstonia and Yaniella) in the genus level, which may affect metabolism, anxiety and behavior in adult female mice. Our results demonstrated that 150 mT SMFs long-term exposure not only had good biosafety, but also improved athletic performance, emotion and the function of ovarian, uterine and gut microbiota abundance in adult female mice, which unraveled the potential of moderate long-term SMF exposure in clinical applications.",Biology,2022,Xingxing Yang; Biao Yu; Chao Song; Chuanlin Feng; Jing Zhang; Xinyu Wang; Guofeng Cheng; Rui Yang; Wei Wang; Yong Zhu
35352107,Psychobiotics in diet: significance and applications of neuroactive and psychoactive microbial metabolites.,"The brain governs psychiatric behavior of an individual by regulating certain neuroactive compounds produced within the body. These might also be produced by the microbes present in the gut, along with certain probiotic strains: the psychobiotics. A healthy diet including psychobiotics plays an important role in neurological functioning by producing a number of psychoactive compounds. Health benefits of probiotic microorganisms to the host and their psychoactive metabolites involved in the alternation of brain functioning are summarized in this article. The effect of diet on gut microbiota is highlighted, along with the possibility of probiotic bacteria as psychobiotics in the treatment or prevention of mental health-related disorders.

36158270,Associations of gut microbiota with dyslipidemia based on sex differences in subjects from Northwestern China.,"The gut microbiota (GM) has been proven to play a role in the regulation of host lipid metabolism, which provides a new theory about the pathogenesis of dyslipidemia. However, the associations of GM with dyslipidemia based on sex differences remain unclear and warrant elucidation.To investigate the associations of GM features with serum lipid profiles based on sex differences in a Chinese population.This study ultimately recruited 142 participants (73 females and 69 males) at Honghui Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University. The anthropometric and blood metabolic parameters of all participants were measured. According to their serum lipid levels, female and male participants were classified into a high triglyceride (H_TG) group, a high total cholesterol (H_CHO) group, a low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (L_HDL-C) group, and a control (CON) group with normal serum lipid levels. Fresh fecal samples were collected for 16S rRNA gene sequencing. UPARSE software, QIIME software, the RDP classifier and the FAPROTAX database were used for sequencing analyses.The GM composition at the phylum level included Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes as the core GM. Different GM features were identified between females and males, and the associations between GM and serum lipid profiles were different in females and males. The GM features in different dyslipidemia subgroups changed in both female patients and male patients. Proteobacteria, Lactobacillaceae, <i>Lactobacillus</i> and <i>Lactobacillus_salivarius</i> were enriched in H_CHO females compared with CON females, while Coriobacteriia were enriched in L_HDL-C females. In the comparison among the three dyslipidemia subgroups in females, <i>Lactobacillus_salivarius</i> were enriched in H_CHO females, and Prevotellaceae were enriched in L_HDL-C females. Compared with CON or H_TG males, Prevotellaceae, <i>unidentified_Ruminococcaceae</i>, <i>Roseburia</i> and <i>Roseburia_inulinivorans</i> were decreased in L_HDL-C males (<i>P</i> value < 0.05), and linear discriminant analysis effect size analysis indicated an enrichment of the above GM taxa in H_TG males compared with other male subgroups. Additionally, <i>Roseburia_inulinivorans</i> abundance was positively correlated with serum TG and total cholesterol levels, and <i>Roseburia</i> were positively correlated with serum TG level. Furthermore, Proteobacteria (0.724, 95%CI: 0.567-0.849), Lactobacillaceae (0.703, 95%CI: 0.544-0.832), <i>Lactobacillus</i> (0.705, 95%CI: 0.547-0.834) and <i>Lactobacillus_salivarius</i> (0.706, 95%CI: 0.548-0.835) could distinguish H_CHO females from CON females, while Coriobacteriia (0.710, 95%CI: 0.547-0.841), Coriobacteriales (0.710, 95%CI: 0.547-0.841), Prevotellaceae (0.697, 95%CI: 0.534-0.830), <i>Roseburia</i> (0.697, 95%CI: 0.534-0.830) and <i>Roseburia_inulinivorans</i> (0.684, 95%CI: 0.520-0.820) could discriminate H_TG males from CON males. Based on the predictions of GM metabolic capabilities with the FAPROTAX database, a total of 51 functional assignments were obtained in females, while 38 were obtained in males. This functional prediction suggested that cellulolysis increased in L_HDL-C females compared with CON females, but decreased in L_HDL-C males compared with CON males.This study indicates associations of GM with serum lipid profiles, supporting the notion that GM dysbiosis may participate in the pathogenesis of dyslipidemia, and sex differences should be considered.",World journal of gastroenterology,2022,Lei Guo; Yang-Yang Wang; Ji-Han Wang; He-Ping Zhao; Yan Yu; Guo-Dong Wang; Kun Dai; Yu-Zhu Yan; Yan-Jie Yang; Jing Lv
36244970,Depression and fatigue in active IBD from a microbiome perspective-a Bayesian approach to faecal metagenomics.,"Extraintestinal symptoms are common in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and include depression and fatigue. These are highly prevalent especially in active disease, potentially due to inflammation-mediated changes in the microbiota-gut-brain axis. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between structural and functional microbiota characteristics and severity of fatigue and depressive symptoms in patients with active IBD.We included clinical data of 62 prospectively enrolled patients with IBD in an active disease state. Patients supplied stool samples and completed the questionnaires regarding depression and fatigue symptoms. Based on taxonomic and functional metagenomic profiles of faecal gut microbiota, we used Bayesian statistics to investigate the associative networks and triangle motifs between bacterial genera, functional modules and symptom severity of self-reported fatigue and depression.Associations with moderate to strong evidence were found for 3 genera (Odoribacter, Anaerotruncus and Alistipes) and 3 functional modules (pectin, glycosaminoglycan and central carbohydrate metabolism) with regard to depression and for 4 genera (Intestinimonas, Anaerotruncus, Eubacterium and Clostridiales g.i.s) and 2 functional modules implicating amino acid and central carbohydrate metabolism with regard to fatigue.This study provides the first evidence of association triplets between microbiota composition, function and extraintestinal symptoms in active IBD. Depression and fatigue were associated with lower abundances of short-chain fatty acid producers and distinct pathways implicating glycan, carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. Our results suggest that microbiota-directed therapeutic approaches may reduce fatigue and depression in IBD and should be investigated in future research.",BMC medicine,2022,Anne Kerstin Thomann; Torsten Wüstenberg; Jakob Wirbel; Laura-Louise Knoedler; Philipp Arthur Thomann; Georg Zeller; Matthias Philip Ebert; Stefanie Lis; Wolfgang Reindl
35788394,Long-lasting beneficial effects of maternal intake of sulforaphane glucosinolate on gut microbiota in adult offspring.,"Mounting evidence suggests the impact of maternal diet on the health of offspring. We reported that maternal diet of sulforaphane glucosinolate (SGS) could prevent behavioral abnormalities in offspring after maternal immune activation. The present study was designed to investigate whether the dietary intake of SGS during pregnancy and lactation influences the composition of gut microbiota in the offspring. The dietary intake of SGS during pregnancy and lactation caused significant changes in the α-diversity and β-diversity of gut microbiota in 3-week-old offspring (SGS-3W group) and 10-week-old offspring (SGS-10W group). The LEfSe algorithm identified several microbes as important phylotypes in the SGS-3W or SGS-10W groups. Predictive functional metagenomes showed that the maternal intake of SGS caused several KEGG pathways alterations with respect to the genetic information processing and metabolism. Furthermore, the plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in the SGS-10W group after the injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS: 0.5 mg/kg) were significantly lower than those of the CON-10W group. It is noteworthy that there were positive correlations between the relative abundance of the genus Blautia and IL-6 (or TNF-α) in adult offspring. Moreover, there were sex differences of gut microbiota composition in offspring. In conclusion, these data suggest that the dietary intake of SGS during pregnancy and lactation might produce long-lasting beneficial effects in adult offspring through the persistent modulation of gut microbiota. It is likely that the modulation of gut microbiota by maternal nutrition may confer resilience versus vulnerability to stress-related psychiatric disorders in the offspring.",The Journal of nutritional biochemistry,2022,Yan Wei; Lijia Chang; Guoqi Liu; Xingming Wang; Yong Yang; Kenji Hashimoto
36558405,Plasma Concentrations of Short-Chain Fatty Acids in Active and Recovered Anorexia Nervosa.,"Anorexia nervosa (AN) is one of the most lethal psychiatric disorders. To date, we lack adequate knowledge about the (neuro)biological mechanisms of this disorder to inform evidence-based pharmacological treatment. Gut dysbiosis is a trending topic in mental health, including AN. Communication between the gut microbiota and the brain is partly mediated by metabolites produced by the gut microbiota such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). Previous research has suggested a role of SCFA in weight regulation (e.g., correlations between specific SCFA-producing bacteria and BMI have been demonstrated). Moreover, fecal SCFA concentrations are reported to be altered in active AN. However, data concerning SCFA concentrations in individuals who have recovered from AN are limited. In the present study, we analyzed and compared the plasma concentrations of seven SCFA (acetic-, butyric-, formic-, isobutyric-, isovaleric-, propionic-, and succinic acid) in females with active AN (<i>n</i> = 109), recovered from AN (AN-REC, <i>n</i> = 108), and healthy-weight age-matched controls (CTRL, <i>n</i> = 110), and explored correlations between SCFA concentrations and BMI. Significantly lower plasma concentrations of butyric, isobutyric-, and isovaleric acid were detected in AN as well as AN-REC compared with CTRL. We also show significant correlations between plasma concentrations of SCFA and BMI. These results encourage studies evaluating whether interventions directed toward altering gut microbiota and SCFA could support weight restoration in AN.",Nutrients,2022,Jingjing Xu; Rikard Landberg; Catharina Lavebratt; Cynthia M Bulik; Mikael Landén; Ida A K Nilsson
35650202,Fecal microbiota transplantation from patients with rheumatoid arthritis causes depression-like behaviors in mice through abnormal T cells activation.,"Depression is common in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA); however, the precise mechanisms underlying a link between depression and RA remain unclear. Accumulating evidence suggests the role of gut-microbiota-brain axis in depression. In this study, we investigated whether collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice produce depression-like behaviors and abnormal composition of gut microbiota. Furthermore, we investigated whether fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from RA patients causes depression-like phenotypes in antibiotic cocktail (ABX)-treated mice. CIA mice displayed depression-like behaviors, increased blood levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), decreased expression of synaptic proteins in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and abnormal composition of gut microbiota. Furthermore, FMT from RA patients caused depression-like phenotypes, alterations of gut microbiota composition, increased levels of IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and downregulation of synaptic proteins in the PFC compared to FMT from healthy controls. There were correlations between relative abundance of microbiota and plasma cytokines, expression of synaptic proteins in the PFC or depression-like behaviors. Interestingly, FMT from RA patients induced T cells differentiation in Peyer's patches and spleen. Reduced percentage of Treg cells with an increase of Th1/Th2 index was observed in the mice after FMT from RA patients. These findings suggest that CIA mice exhibit depression-like behaviors, systemic inflammation, and abnormal composition of gut microbiota, and that FMT from RA patients produces depression-like behaviors in ABX-treated mice via T cells differentiation. Therefore, abnormalities in gut microbiota in RA patients may contribute to depression via gut-microbiota-brain axis.",Translational psychiatry,2022,Yaoyu Pu; Qiuping Zhang; Zhigang Tang; Chenyang Lu; Liang Wu; Yutong Zhong; Yuehong Chen; Kenji Hashimoto; Yubin Luo; Yi Liu
35981631,Antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion improves LPS-induced acute lung injury via gut-lung axis.,"Acute lung injury (ALI) is an acute inflammatory disorder. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the pathology of ALI remain elusive. An increasing evidence suggests the role of the gut-microbiota axis in the pathology of lung injury. This study aimed to investigate whether antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion could affect ALI in mice after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration.The effects of antibiotic cocktail (ABX) on ALI in the mice after intratracheally administration of LPS (5 mg/kg) were examined. Furthermore, 16s rRNA analysis and measurement of short-chain fatty acids in feces samples and metabolomics analysis of blood samples were performed.LPS significantly increased the interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of water-treated mice. Interestingly, an ABX significantly attenuated the LPS-induced increase in IL-6 in BALF and lung injury scores. Furthermore, ABX and/or LPS treatment markedly altered the α- and β-diversity of the gut microbiota. There were significant differences in the α- and β-diversity of the water + LPS group and ABX + LPS group. LEfSe analysis identified Enterococusfaecalis, Clostriumtertium, and Bacteroidescaecimyris as potential microbial markers for ABX + LPS group. Untargeted metabolomics analysis identified several plasma metabolites responsible for discriminating water + LPS group from ABX + LPS group. There were correlations between the relative abundance of the microbiome and plasma metabolites. Integrative network analysis showed correlations between IL-6 levels in BALF and several gut microbes (or plasma metabolites).These data suggest that ABX-induced microbiome depletion could protect against LPS-induced ALI via the gut-microbiota-lung axis.",Life sciences,2022,Yaeko Hashimoto; Akifumi Eguchi; Yan Wei; Hiroyo Shinno-Hashimoto; Yuko Fujita; Tamaki Ishima; Lijia Chang; Chisato Mori; Takuji Suzuki; Kenji Hashimoto
35956326,Inflammatory Signatures of Maternal Obesity as Risk Factors for Neurodevelopmental Disorders: Role of Maternal Microbiota and Nutritional Intervention Strategies.,"Obesity is a main risk factor for the onset and the precipitation of many non-communicable diseases. This condition, which is associated with low-grade chronic systemic inflammation, is of main concern during pregnancy leading to very serious consequences for the new generations. In addition to the prominent role played by the adipose tissue, dysbiosis of the maternal gut may also sustain the obesity-related inflammatory milieu contributing to create an overall suboptimal intrauterine environment. Such a condition here generically defined as ""inflamed womb"" may hold long-term detrimental effects on fetal brain development, increasing the vulnerability to mental disorders. In this review, we will examine the hypothesis that maternal obesity-related gut dysbiosis and the associated inflammation might specifically target fetal brain microglia, the resident brain immune macrophages, altering neurodevelopmental trajectories in a sex-dependent fashion. We will also review some of the most promising nutritional strategies capable to prevent or counteract the effects of maternal obesity through the modulation of inflammation and oxidative stress or by targeting the maternal microbiota.",Nutrients,2022,Francesca Cirulli; Roberta De Simone; Chiara Musillo; Maria Antonietta Ajmone-Cat; Alessandra Berry
36183483,Possible metabolic interplay between quality of life and fecal microbiota in a presenior population: Preliminary results.,"The number of people aged ≥60 y is increasing worldwide, so establishing a relationship between lifestyle and health-associated factors, such as gut microbiota in an older population, is important. This study aimed to characterize the gut microbiota of a presenior population, and analyze the association between some bacteria and quality of life with the Short Form (SF) 36 questionnaire.Participants were adult men and women ages 50 to 80 y (n = 74). In addition to the SF-36 questionnaire, fecal samples were collected in cryotubes, and 16S RNA gene sequencing was performed to characterize microbial features. Participants were classified into two groups according to SF-36 punctuation. Linear and logistic regression models were performed to assess the possible association between any bacterial bowl and SF-36 score. Receiver operating characteristics curves were fitted to define the relative diagnostic strength of different bacterial taxa for the correct determination of quality of life.A positive relationship was established between SF-36 score and Actinobacteria (P = 0.0310; R = 0.2510) compared with Peptostreptococcaceae (P = 0.0259; R = -0.2589), which increased with decreasing quality of life. Logistic regressions models and receiver operating characteristics curves showed that the relative abundance of Actinobacteria and Peptostreptococcaceae may be useful to predict quality of life in a presenior population (area under the curve: 0.71).Quality of life may be associated with the relative abundance of certain bacteria, especially Actinobacteria and Peptostreptococcaceae, which may have a specific effect on certain markers and health care, which is important to improve quality of life in older populations.","Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)",2022,Begoña de Cuevillas; José I Riezu-Boj; Itziar Abete; M Angeles Zulet; Cristina Galarregui; Carlos J Gonzalez-Navarro; Fermín I Milagro; J Alfredo Martínez; Santiago Navas-Carretero
36191374,Comparison of the chronic unpredictable mild stress and the maternal separation in mice postpartum depression modeling.,"Postpartum depression (PPD) is a serious mental health concern of new mothers worldwide. In view of the particularity of puerpera, the research on pathogenesis and drug development of PPD are highly dependent on animal models. Although both maternal separation (MS) and chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) modeling approaches have been used in PPD studies, the characteristics of the two rodent models have not been compared to explain which is more advantageous in PPD research. In this study, we applied 21-day MS and CUMS paradigms to induce mouse model of PPD and compared their differences in behavior, physiology and gut microbiota. As a result, the two models exhibited significant increases of immobility time in forced swim test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST), whereas sucrose preference index and pup weight were significantly decreased. Both displayed depression-like behaviors, and CUMS was more obvious, which demonstrated by the lower levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and higher hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis related mRNA expression (corticotropin releasing hormone, corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1) in CMUS group than that in MS group. The gut microbiota in MS and CUMS groups were significantly different in terms of the relative abundances of Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria. In conclusion, MS model and CUMS model have different performance in behavior and physiology. The CUMS model showed more obvious parameter changes, which may be more suitable for PPD induced by various social environmental factors.",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2022,Yan Zhang; Li Zhang; Birui Shi; Fulong Huang; Yinhuang Gao; Zhishuo Miao; Ke Ma; Ziyao Zhan; Wei Zou; Menghua Liu
35594949,Effects of (R)-ketamine on reduced bone mineral density in ovariectomized mice: A role of gut microbiota.,"Depression is a high risk for osteoporosis, suggesting an association between depression and low bone mineral density (BMD). We reported that the novel antidepressant (R)-ketamine could ameliorate the reduced BMD in the ovariectomized (OVX) mice which is an animal model of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Given the role of gut microbiota in depression and bone homeostasis, we examined whether gut microbiota plays a role in the beneficial effects of (R)-ketamine in the reduced BMD of OVX mice. OVX or sham was operated for female mice. Subsequently, saline (10 ml/kg/day, twice weekly) or (R)-ketamine (10 mg/kg/day, twice weekly) was administered intraperitoneally into OVX or sham mice for the six weeks. The reduction of cortical BMD and total BMD in the OVX mice was significantly ameliorated after subsequent repeated intermittent administration of (R)-ketamine. Furthermore, there were significant changes in the α- and β-diversity between OVX + saline group and OVX + (R)-ketamine group. There were correlations between several OTUs and cortical (or total) BMD. There were also positive correlations between the genera Turicibacter and cortical (or total) BMD. Moreover, there were correlations between several metabolites in blood and cortical (or total) BMD. These data suggest that (R)-ketamine may ameliorate the reduced cortical BMD and total BMD in OVX mice through anti-inflammatory actions via gut microbiota. Therefore, it is likely that (R)-ketamine would be a therapeutic drug for depressed patients with low BMD or patients with osteoporosis.",Neuropharmacology,2022,Xiayun Wan; Akifumi Eguchi; Yuko Fujita; Li Ma; Xingming Wang; Yong Yang; Youge Qu; Lijia Chang; Jiancheng Zhang; Chisato Mori; Kenji Hashimoto
36579574,The Potential Impact of Age on Gut Microbiota in Patients with Major Depressive Disorder: A Secondary Analysis of the Prospective Observational Study.,"We aimed to investigate the impact of aging on the relationship among the composition of gut microbiota, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, and the course of treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD) by analyzing the datasets from our previous study. Patients with MDD were recruited, and their stools were collected at three time points (baseline, midterm, and endpoint) following the usual antidepressant treatment. Gut microbiota were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Patients were categorized into two groups based on their age: the late-life group over 60 years and the middle-aged group under 60 years. GI symptoms were assessed with scores of item 11 of the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale. One hundred and ninety samples were collected from 32 patients with MDD. Several gut microbes had higher relative abundances in the late-life group than in the middle-aged group. In addition, the late-life group showed significantly higher diversity in the Chao1 index at baseline compared with the middle-aged group. We further found possible microbial taxa related to GI symptoms in patients with late-life depression. The abundance of several bacterial taxa may contribute to GI symptoms in the late-life depression, and our findings suggest that the therapeutic targets for the application of gut microbiota may differ depending on the age group of patients with depression.",Journal of personalized medicine,2022,Katsuma Miyaho; Kenji Sanada; Shunya Kurokawa; Arisa Tanaka; Tomoyuki Tachibana; Chiharu Ishii; Yoshihiro Noda; Shinichiro Nakajima; Shinji Fukuda; Masaru Mimura; Taishiro Kishimoto; Akira Iwanami
36079050,Intestinal Permeability and Depression in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,"Depression is a global health problem that requires an early and accurate diagnosis to ensure quick access to appropriate treatment. Among multiple psychopathological paths, recent attention has focused on analysing the brain-gut-microbiota axis. The intestinal barrier plays a key role, and dysfunctions occurring at this level have implications for mental health. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of intestinal permeability biomarkers, i.e., calprotectin, zonulin, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) and intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FAB), in relation to depression in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This is the first study of this kind taking place in Romania, Eastern Europe, with an emphasis on patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The correlations identified between depression and calprotectin and depression and LBP have the potential to shed light on the process of rapid diagnosis of depression with the help of biomarkers. Since depression is correlated with a decrease in the quality of life in patients with IBD, the need for access to appropriate treatments must be urgent.",Journal of clinical medicine,2022,Miorita Melina Iordache; Cristina Tocia; Mariana Aschie; Andrei Dumitru; Mihaela Manea; Georgeta Camelia Cozaru; Lucian Petcu; Sabina E Vlad; Eugen Dumitru; Anca Chisoi
35308288,Three Different Types of β-Glucans Enhance Cognition: The Role of the Gut-Brain Axis.,"Dietary fiber is fermented in the lower gastrointestinal tract, potentially impacting the microbial ecosystem and thus may improve elements of cognition and brain function via the gut-brain axis. β-glucans, soluble dietary fiber, have different macrostructures and may exhibit different effects on the gut-brain axis. This study aimed to compare the effects of β-glucans from mushroom, curdlan and oats bran, representing β-(1,3)/(1,6)-glucan, β-(1,3)-glucan or β-(1,3)/(1,4)-glucan, on cognition and the gut-brain axis.C57BL/6J mice were fed with either control diet or diets supplemented with β-glucans from mushroom, curdlan and oats bran for 15 weeks. The cognitive functions were evaluated by using the temporal order memory and Y-maze tests. The parameters of the gut-brain axis were examined, including the synaptic proteins and ultrastructure and microglia status in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC), as well as colonic immune response and mucus thickness and gut microbiota profiles.All three supplementations with β-glucans enhanced the temporal order recognition memory. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the post-synaptic protein 95 (PSD95) increased in the PFC. Furthermore, mushroom β-glucan significantly increased the post-synaptic thickness of synaptic ultrastructure in the PFC whilst the other two β-glucans had no significant effect. Three β-glucan supplementations decreased the microglia number in the PFC and hippocampus, and affected complement C3 and cytokines expression differentially. In the colon, every β-glucan supplementation increased the number of CD206 positive cells and promoted the expression of IL-10 and reduced IL-6 and TNF-α expression. The correlation analysis highlights that degree of cognitive behavior improved by β-glucan supplementations was significantly associated with microglia status in the hippocampus and PFC and the number of colonic M2 macrophages. In addition, only β-glucan from oat bran altered gut microbiota and enhanced intestinal mucus.We firstly demonstrated long-term supplementation of β-glucans enhanced recognition memory. Comparing the effects of β-glucans on the gut-brain axis, we found that β-glucans with different molecular structures exhibit differentia actions on synapses, inflammation in the brain and gut, and gut microbiota. This study may shed light on how to select appropriate β-glucans as supplementation for the prevention of cognitive deficit or improving immune function clinically.",Frontiers in nutrition,2022,Minmin Hu; Peng Zhang; Ruiqi Wang; Menglu Zhou; Ning Pang; Xiaoying Cui; Xing Ge; Xiaomei Liu; Xu-Feng Huang; Yinghua Yu
35013099,A pilot exploration of multi-omics research of gut microbiome in major depressive disorders.,"The pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) remains obscure. Recently, the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis's role in MDD has an increasing attention. However, the specific mechanism of the multi-level effects of gut microbiota on host metabolism, immunity, and brain structure is unclear. Multi-omics approaches based on the analysis of different body fluids and tissues using a variety of analytical platforms have the potential to provide a deeper understanding of MGB axis disorders. Therefore, the data of metagenomics, metabolomic, inflammatory factors, and MRI scanning are collected from the two groups including 24 drug-naïve MDD patients and 26 healthy controls (HCs). Then, the correlation analysis is performed in all omics. The results confirmed that there are many markedly altered differences, such as elevated Actinobacteria abundance, plasma IL-1β concentration, lipid, vitamin, and carbohydrate metabolism disorder, and diminished grey matter volume (GMV) of inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) in the MDD patients. Notably, three kinds of discriminative bacteria, Ruminococcus bromii, Lactococcus chungangensis, and Streptococcus gallolyticus have an extensive correlation with metabolome, immunology, GMV, and clinical symptoms. All three microbiota are closely related to IL-1β and lipids (as an example, phosphoethanolamine (PEA)). Besides, Lactococcus chungangensis is negatively related to the GMV of left IFG. Overall, this study demonstrate that the effects of gut microbiome exert in MDD is multifactorial.",Translational psychiatry,2022,Haoyang Zhao; Kangyu Jin; Chaonan Jiang; Fen Pan; Jing Wu; Honglin Luan; Zhiyong Zhao; Jingkai Chen; Tingting Mou; Zheng Wang; Jing Lu; Shaojia Lu; Shaohua Hu; Yi Xu; Manli Huang
36056826,Microbiome-Based Therapies in Parkinson's Disease: Can Tuning the Microbiota Become a Viable Therapeutic Strategy?,"Progressive neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD) have continued to baffle medical science, despite strides in the understanding of their pathology. The inability of currently available therapies to halt disease progression is a testament to an incomplete understanding of pathways crucial to disease initiation, progression and management. Science has continued to link the activities and equilibrium of the gut microbiome to the health and proper functioning of brain neurons. They also continue to stir interest in the potential applications of technologies that may shift the balance of the gut microbiome towards achieving a favourable outcome in PD management. There have been suggestions that an improved understanding of the roles of the gut microbiota is likely to lead to the emergence of an era where their manipulation becomes a recognized strategy for PD management. This review examines the current state of our journey in the quest to understand how the gut microbiota can influence several aspects of PD. We highlight the relationship between the gut microbiome/microbiota and PD pathogenesis, as well as preclinical and clinical evidence evaluating the effect of postbiotics, probiotics and prebiotics in PD management. This is with a view to ascertaining if we are at the threshold of discovering the application of a usable tool in our quest for disease modifying therapies in PD.",CNS & neurological disorders drug targets,2022,Adejoke Y Onaolapo; Folusho O Ojo; Anthony T Olofinnade; Joshua Falade; Ismail A Lawal; Olakunle J Onaolapo
35466109,Effects of Subdiaphragmatic Vagotomy in the MPTP-induced Neurotoxicity in the Striatum and Colon of Mice.,"Gut-microbiota-brain axis plays a role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). The subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve serves as a major modulatory pathway between the gut microbiota and the brain. However, the role of subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve in PD pathogenesis are unknown. Here, we investigated the effects of subdiaphragmatic vagotomy (SDV) on the neurotoxicity in the mouse striatum and colon after administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6- tetrahydropyridine (MPTP).Sham or SVD was performed. Subsequently, saline or MPTP (10 mg/kg × 3, 2-hour interval) was administered to mice. Western blot analysis of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine transporter (DAT) in the striatum and phosphorylated α-synuclein (p-α-Syn) in the colon was performed.Repeated administration of MPTP significantly caused reduction of TH and DAT in the striatum and increase of p-α-Syn in the colon of mice. However, SDV did not affect the reduction of TH and DAT in the striatum and increases in p-α-Syn in the colon after repeated MPTP administration.These data suggest that subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve doses not play a role in the MPTP-induced neurotoxicity in the brain and colon.",Clinical psychopharmacology and neuroscience : the official scientific journal of the Korean College of Neuropsychopharmacology,2022,Jiajing Shan; Youge Qu; Jiancheng Zhang; Li Ma; Kenji Hashimoto

35432048,The Correlation Between Probiotics and Anxiety and Depression Levels in Cancer Patients: A Retrospective Cohort Study.,"Studies have shown a correlation between gut microbiota and anxiety and depression levels. However, these studies are mainly animal studies or clinical studies of non-cancer patients, there is still a lack of relevant studies in cancer patients. The main objective of this trial was to analyze the correlation between probiotics and anxiety and depression levels in cancer patients.We screened all cancer patients consecutively admitted to the inpatient department of the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine in May 2020. A total of 292 cancer patients met our inclusion criteria. Then, we followed up all patients for 24 weeks. Patients who had incomplete data or loss of follow-up were excluded. In addition, in patients who took probiotics, those did not take probiotics consistently or did not take specific probiotics were excluded. Ultimately, the number of patients enrolled was 82 in probiotics cohort and 100 in non-probiotics cohort. The 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD-17) questionnaire was used to measure the depression levels of the patients, and we also used Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) questionnaire to assess the patients' anxiety levels. A logistic regression model was used to analyze whether the difference in baseline data of two cohorts would affect the final result.Demographic and clinical characteristics of all cancer patients enrolled in probiotics cohort and non-probiotics cohort were similar except the cancer therapy (<i>P</i> = 0.004). According to the HAMA score, we divided cancer patients into non-anxiety group (HAMA score < 14) and anxiety group (HAMA score ≥ 14). Similarly, cancer patients were also divided into non-depression group (HAMD-17 score ≤ 7) and depression group (HAMD-17 score > 7). The results demonstrated that there was no statistical difference in the proportion of patients with anxiety (6.1 and 13.0%, respectively, <i>P</i> = 0.121) and depression (30.5 and 23.0%, respectively, <i>P</i> = 0.254) between probiotics and non-probiotics cohorts. The results of logistic regression model analysis further proved that the baseline difference in cancer therapy did not affect the conclusions.Our results still suggest that there is no significant correlation between probiotics and anxiety and depression levels in cancer patients. Therefore, we do not recommend supplementing probiotics for cancer patients to prevent anxiety and depression. Moreover, high-quality RCTs are also needed to further confirm the conclusions of this study.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2022,Ziqi Ye; Yanfang Zhang; Mengfei Du; Shaojia Lu; Qingwei Zhao; Si Yang

Therefore, we prepared a study protocol for a double-blind, crossover, randomized clinical trial to determine the complex effects of human probiotics on memory, psychological, and biological measures in the elderly.We selected eligible participants using an effective electronic questionnaire containing the inclusion and exclusion criteria and a brief electronic cognitive test. One-third of the respondents with the worst cognitive scores on the electronic test are randomized to group A, starting with a 3-month probiotic intervention, and to group B, starting with a placebo. In a crossover design, both groups change their intervention/placebo status after 3 months for the next 3 months. Participants refusing longer personal assessments due to the COVID-19 pandemic were randomly allocated to one of two subgroups assessed online. Participants in both groups are matched in age, education, gender, and cognitive scores on electronic testing at baseline. At three time points, participants are assessed using a neuropsychological battery, self-report measures of mood, a physical fitness test, blood, urine, and stool samples, and actigraphy. A subset of participants also provided their biological samples and underwent the neuropsychological battery in an extended testing phase 3 months after study termination to find out the long-term effect of the intervention.This is the first trial to address the comprehensive effects of human probiotics on memory and many other measures in the elderly. We assume that the probiotic group will have better outcomes than the placebo group after the first and second trimesters. We expect that the probiotic effect will persist for the next 3 months.

35302147,<i>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</i> zz-1 exerts preventive effects on chronic unpredictable mild stress-induced depression in mice <i>via</i> regulating the intestinal microenvironment.,"Depression remains one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders, and it has been confirmed that it is related to the dysfunction of the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Manipulation of the gut microenvironment by probiotics might improve mental health and prevent stress-related psychiatric disorders. The present study aimed to determine whether <i>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</i> (<i>L. rhamnosus</i>) zz-1 could prevent the occurrence of depression and its potential mechanisms using a mouse model with chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). The results indicated that <i>L. rhamnosus</i> zz-1 intervention ameliorated CUMS-induced depression-like behaviors of mice with reduced body growth rate, lowered sucrose preference, increased immobility time, as well as decreased curiosity and mobility. Moreover, <i>L. rhamnosus</i> zz-1 significantly inhibited hormones released due to hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, alleviated CUMS-induced deficits of monoamine neurotransmitters, and increased the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB). These benefits were partially linked to the regulation of the intestinal microenvironment. <i>L. rhamnosus</i> zz-1 alleviated intestinal damage and reduced intestinal inflammation of the depressed mice. Meanwhile, <i>L. rhamnosus</i> zz-1 effectively adjusted the dysbiosis of mouse gut microbiota induced by CUMS, such as changes in the abundance of the <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> NK4A136 group, <i>Bacteroides</i>, and <i>Muribaculum</i>. Taken together, these results demonstrated that <i>L. rhamnosus</i> zz-1 was effective in preventing depression from chronic stress, adding new evidence to support the mental benefits of probiotics.",Food & function,2022,Jinzhao Xu; Mengqi Tang; Xinyu Wu; Xiangli Kong; Yini Liu; Xiaoxi Xu
36235606,Circulating Levels of Short-Chain Fatty Acids during Pregnancy and Infant Neurodevelopment.,"Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) play a key role in the gut microbiota-brain crosstalk regulating the main neurodevelopmental processes during pregnancy. The aim of this study is to investigate the longitudinal relationship between prenatal levels of the main SCFAs in maternal serum and infant cognitive development and temperament on day 40 postpartum after adjusting for several pre-, peri- and post-natal confounders.A sample of 357 healthy mother-infant pairs were followed from the beginning of pregnancy to 40 days after birth. Serum SCFA concentrations were assessed in the first and third trimester of pregnancy by LC-MS/MS; and socio-demographic, nutritional, and psychological variables were collected. At 40 days, the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-III and the Early Infancy Temperament Questionnaire were administered.Lower serum levels of acetic, butyric and isobutyric acid, mainly during the first trimester, were related to better language and psychomotor development and, in the case of butyric acid, better intensity behavior in infants. Medium levels of propionic acid were related to better scores for development, mood and temperament.These findings suggest that in a community sample of healthy pregnant women from a Mediterranean region of northern Spain, lower serum levels of SCFAs, especially in the first trimester of pregnancy, seem to be related to better infant neurodevelopment.",Nutrients,2022,Carmen Hernández-Martínez; Josefa Canals; Núria Voltas; Francisco Martín-Luján; Victoria Arija
35918353,Investigation of memory-enhancing effects of Streptococcus thermophilus EG007 in mice and elucidating molecular and metagenomic characteristics using nanopore sequencing.,"Over the past decades, accumulating evidences have highlighted the gut microbiota as a key player in the brain functioning via microbiota-gut-brain axis, and accordingly, the beneficial role of several probiotic strains in cognitive ability also have been actively investigated. However, the majority of the research have demonstrated the effects against age-related cognitive decline or neurological disease. To this end, we aimed to investigate lactic acid bacteria strains having beneficial effects on the cognitive function of healthy young mice and elucidate underlying characteristics by carrying out nanopore sequencing-based genomics and metagenomics analysis. 8-week consumption of Streptococcus thermophilus EG007 demonstrated marked enhancements in behavior tests assessing short-term spatial and non-spatial learning and memory. It was revealed that EG007 possessed genes encoding various metabolites beneficial for a health condition in many aspects, including gamma-aminobutyric acid producing system, a neurotransmitter associated with mood and stress response. Also, by utilizing 16S-23S rRNA operon as a taxonomic marker, we identified more accurate species-level compositional changes in gut microbiota, which was increase of certain species, previously reported to have associations with mental health or down-regulation of inflammation or infection-related species. Moreover, correlation analysis revealed that the EG007-mediated altered microbiota had a significant correlation with the memory traits.",Scientific reports,2022,Hyaekang Kim; Soomin Jeon; Jina Kim; Donghyeok Seol; JinChul Jo; Seoae Cho; Heebal Kim
35790976,"The effects of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) administration on the microbiome-gut-brain axis in adolescents with anorexia nervosa (the MiGBAN study): study protocol for a longitudinal, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.","Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe psychiatric disease that often takes a chronic course due to insufficient treatment options. Emerging evidence on the gut-brain axis offers the opportunity to find innovative treatments for patients with psychiatric disorders. The gut microbiome of patients with AN shows profound alterations that do not completely disappear after weight rehabilitation. In previous studies, the administration of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) resulted in effects that might be beneficial in the treatment of AN, affecting the microbiome, body weight and executive functions. Therefore, the MiGBAN study aims to examine the effects of a nutritional supplementation with PUFA on the gut microbiome and body mass index (BMI) in patients with AN.This is a longitudinal, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Within 2 years, 60 adolescent patients aged 12 to 19 years with AN will receive either PUFA or placebo for 6 months additional to treatment as usual. After 1 year, the long-term effect of PUFA on the gut microbiome and consecutively on BMI will be determined. Secondary outcomes include improvement of gastrointestinal symptoms, eating disorder psychopathology, and comorbidities. Additionally, the interaction of the gut microbiome with the brain (microbiome-gut-brain axis) will be studied by conducting MRI measurements to assess functional and morphological changes and neuropsychological assessments to describe cognitive functioning. Anti-inflammatory effects of PUFA in AN will be examined via serum inflammation and gut permeability markers. Our hypothesis is that PUFA administration will have positive effects on the gut microbiota and thus the treatment of AN by leading to a faster weight gain and a reduction of gastrointestinal problems and eating disorder psychopathology.Due to previously heterogeneous results, a systematic and longitudinal investigation of the microbiome-gut-brain axis in AN is essential.

36364950,Exploration of the Gut-Brain Axis through Metabolomics Identifies Serum Propionic Acid Associated with Higher Cognitive Decline in Older Persons.,"The gut microbiome is involved in nutrient metabolism and produces metabolites that, via the gut−brain axis, signal to the brain and influence cognition. Human studies have so far had limited success in identifying early metabolic alterations linked to cognitive aging, likely due to limitations in metabolite coverage or follow-ups. Older persons from the Three-City population-based cohort who had not been diagnosed with dementia at the time of blood sampling were included, and repeated measures of cognition over 12 subsequent years were collected. Using a targeted metabolomics platform, we identified 72 circulating gut-derived metabolites in a case−control study on cognitive decline, nested within the cohort (discovery n = 418; validation n = 420). Higher serum levels of propionic acid, a short-chain fatty acid, were associated with increased odds of cognitive decline (OR for 1 SD = 1.40 (95% CI 1.11, 1.75) for discovery and 1.26 (1.02, 1.55) for validation). Additional analyses suggested mediation by hypercholesterolemia and diabetes. Propionic acid strongly correlated with blood glucose (r = 0.79) and with intakes of meat and cheese (r > 0.15), but not fiber (r = 0.04), suggesting a minor role of prebiotic foods per se, but a possible link to processed foods, in which propionic acid is a common preservative. The adverse impact of propionic acid on metabolism and cognition deserves further investigation.",Nutrients,2022,Jeanne Neuffer; Raúl González-Domínguez; Sophie Lefèvre-Arbogast; Dorrain Y Low; Bénédicte Driollet; Catherine Helmer; Andrea Du Preez; Chiara de Lucia; Silvie R Ruigrok; Barbara Altendorfer; Ludwig Aigner; Paul J Lucassen; Aniko Korosi; Sandrine Thuret; Claudine Manach; Mercè Pallàs; Mireia Urpi-Sardà; Alex Sánchez-Pla; Cristina Andres-Lacueva; Cécilia Samieri
35704960,"Efficacy and safety of a food supplement with standardized menthol, limonene, and gingerol content in patients with irritable bowel syndrome: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.","Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects 9,2% of the global population and places a considerable burden on healthcare systems. Most medications for treating IBS, including spasmolytics, laxatives, and antidiarrheals, have low efficacy. Effective and safe therapeutic treatments have yet to be developed for IBS.This study assessed the efficacy and safety of a food supplement containing standardized menthol, limonene, and gingerol in human participants with IBS or IBS/functional dyspepsia (FD).A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.We randomly assigned 56 patients with IBS or IBS/FD to an intervention group (Group 1) or control group (Group 2) that were given supplement or placebo, respectively, in addition to the standard treatment regimen for 30 d. Three outpatient visits were conducted during the study. Symptom severity was measured at each visit using a 7×7 questionnaire. Qualitative and quantitative composition of the intestinal microbiota were assessed at visits 1 and 3 based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing.At visit 1 (before treatment), the median total 7×7 questionnaire score was in the moderately ill range for both groups, with no difference between the groups (p = 0.1). At visit 2, the total 7×7 score decreased to mildly ill, with no difference between the groups (p = 0.4). At visit 3, the total score for group 1 indicated borderline illness and for group 2 remained indicated mild illness (p = 0.009). Even though we observed some variations in gut microbiota between the groups, we did not find any statistically significant changes.The food supplement with standardized menthol, limonene, and gingerol content increased the efficacy of standard therapy in IBS and FD patients. The use of the supplement did not cause any obvious side effects.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04484467.",PloS one,2022,Vladimir T Ivashkin; Anna V Kudryavtseva; George S Krasnov; Yuri M Poluektov; Margarita A Morozova; Oleg S Shifrin; Allan G Beniashvili; Zarina A Mamieva; Alexandra L Kovaleva; Anatoly I Ulyanin; Elizaveta A Trush; Alexander G Erlykin; Elena A Poluektova

However, commonly consumed fermented and prebiotic-containing foods have not been well-tested. The aim of the present study was to determine whether consumption of fermented food and food-derived prebiotics is associated with cognitive performance, depressive, and anxiety symptoms in psychiatrically healthy medical students under psychological stress.The study protocol with data analysis plan was prospectively registered. Food consumption was evaluated with a 7-day dietary record. Cognitive performance was modeled with academic examination performance in relation to subject knowledge. Pre-exam depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, respectively.In total, 372 medical students (22.7 ± 1.1 years of age, 66% female) completed the study. No relationship was observed between cognitive performance under stress and either fermented food (adjusted β 0.02, 95% CI -0.07-0.11, <i>p</i> = 0.63) or food-derived prebiotics consumption (adjusted β -0.00, 95% CI -0.09-0.09, <i>p</i> = 0.99). High intake of fermented food was associated with more severe depressive (adjusted β 0.11, 95% CI 0.01-0.20, <i>p</i> = 0.032) and anxiety symptoms under stress (adjusted β 0.13, 95% CI 0.04-0.22, <i>p</i> = 0.0065); however, no such link was observed for food-derived prebiotics (adjusted β 0.03, 95% CI -0.07-0.13, <i>p</i> = 0.50 and -0.01, 95% CI -0.11-0.08, <i>p</i> = 0.83, for depression and anxiety, respectively).Under psychological stress in medical students, consumption of fermented food and food-derived prebiotics appears to be not associated with cognitive performance. High intake of fermented food, but not food-derived prebiotics, may be associated with severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms. The safety of fermented food in this regard therefore requires further clarification.",Frontiers in nutrition,2022,Michał Seweryn Karbownik; Łukasz Mokros; Maria Dobielska; Mateusz Kowalczyk; Edward Kowalczyk
38868440,Schizophrenia and obesity: May the gut microbiota serve as a link for the pathogenesis?,"Schizophrenia (SZ) places a tremendous burden on public health as one of the leading causes of disability and death. SZ patients are more prone to developing obesity than the general population from the clinical practice. The development of obesity frequently causes poor psychiatric outcomes in SZ patients. In turn, maternal obesity during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of SZ in offspring, suggesting that these two disorders may have shared neuropathological mechanisms. The gut microbiota is well known to serve as a major regulator of bidirectional interactions between the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. It also plays a critical role in maintaining physical and mental health in humans. Recent studies have shown that the dysbiosis of gut microbiota is intimately associated with the onset of SZ and obesity through shared pathophysiological mechanisms, particularly the stimulation of immune inflammation. Therefore, gut microbiota may serve as a common biological basis for the etiology in both SZ and obesity, and the perturbed gut-brain axis may therefore account for the high prevalence of obesity in patients with SZ. On the basis of these findings, this review provides updated perspectives and intervention approaches on the etiology, prevention, and management of obesity in SZ patients by summarizing the recent findings on the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of SZ and obesity, highlighting the role of gut-derived inflammation.",iMeta,2023,Hui Wu; Yaxi Liu; Jie Wang; Shengyun Chen; Liwei Xie; Xiaoli Wu
39295905,The butyrate-producing and spore-forming bacterial genus <i>Coprococcus</i> as a potential biomarker for neurological disorders.,"The host-intestinal microbiome interaction has gained much scientific attention in the past two decades, boosted by advances in DNA sequencing and cultivation techniques. An accumulating amount of evidence shows that gut microbes play crucial roles in gut homeostasis, immune system education, and are associated with quality-of-life indicators. Beneficial health factors are associated with the digestion of dietary fibres in the colon and the subsequent production of short-chain fatty acids, including acetate, propionate, and butyrate. <i>Coprococcus</i> is a butyrate-producing genus in the phylum Firmicutes, and its abundance is inversely correlated with several neuropsychological and neurodegenerative disorders. Case-control studies provide strong evidence of decreased abundance of <i>Coprococcus</i> spp. in depressed individuals. The species <i>Coprococcus eutactus</i> has the unique capacity to use two separate pathways for butyrate synthesis and has been found to be depleted in children with delayed language development and adults with Parkinson's disease. The combined literature on <i>Coprococcus</i> and the gut microbiota-brain axis points towards enhanced butyrate production and reduced colonisation of pathogenic clades as factors explaining its association with health effects. The genus <i>Coprococcus</i> is a promising candidate for a mental health biomarker and an interesting lead for novel dietary-based preventive therapies for specific neurological disorders.","Gut microbiome (Cambridge, England)",2023,Fleur Notting; Walter Pirovano; Wilbert Sybesma; Remco Kort
38972900,Humid heat environment causes anxiety-like disorder via impairing gut microbiota and bile acid metabolism in mice.,"Climate and environmental changes threaten human mental health, but the impacts of specific environmental conditions on neuropsychiatric disorders remain largely unclear. Here, we show the impact of a humid heat environment on the brain and the gut microbiota using a conditioned housing male mouse model. We demonstrate that a humid heat environment can cause anxiety-like behaviour in male mice. Microbial 16 S rRNA sequencing analysis reveals that a humid heat environment caused gut microbiota dysbiosis (e.g., decreased abundance of Lactobacillus murinus), and metabolomics reveals an increase in serum levels of secondary bile acids (e.g., lithocholic acid). Moreover, increased neuroinflammation is indicated by the elevated expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the serum and cortex, activated PI3K/AKT/NF-κB signalling and a microglial response in the cortex. Strikingly, transplantation of the microbiota from mice reared in a humid heat environment readily recapitulates these abnormalities in germ-free mice, and these abnormalities are markedly reversed by Lactobacillus murinus administration. Human samples collected during the humid heat season also show a decrease in Lactobacillus murinus abundance and an increase in the serum lithocholic acid concentration. In conclusion, gut microbiota dysbiosis induced by a humid heat environment drives the progression of anxiety disorders by impairing bile acid metabolism and enhancing neuroinflammation, and probiotic administration is a potential therapeutic strategy for these disorders.",Nature communications,2024,Huandi Weng; Li Deng; Tianyuan Wang; Huachong Xu; Jialin Wu; Qinji Zhou; Lingtai Yu; Boli Chen; Li'an Huang; Yibo Qu; Libing Zhou; Xiaoyin Chen

Importantly, the role of gut microbiota in the healthy longevity of the host may provide unprecedented opportunities to decipher the plasticity of lifespan on a natural evolutionary scale and shed light on using microbiota-targeted strategies to promote healthy aging and combat age-related diseases. This review investigates how gut microbiota affects healthy longevity, focusing on the mechanisms through which gut microbiota modulates it. Specifically, we focused on the ability of gut microbiota to enhance the intestinal barrier integrity, provide protection from inflammaging, ameliorate nutrientsensing pathways, optimize mitochondrial function, and improve defense against age-related diseases, thus participating in enhancing longevity and healthspan.",Science China.

Accumulating evidence suggests that the gut microbiota modulates intestinal neurotransmitter metabolism and gut-to-brain signaling, shedding light on the crucial role of the gut microbiota in brain function and the pathogenesis of various neuropsychiatric diseases, such as major depression disorder (MDD), anxiety, addiction and Parkinson's disease (PD). Despite the exciting findings, the mechanisms underlying the modulation of neurotransmitter metabolism and function by the gut microbiota are still being elucidated. In this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the existing knowledge about the role of the gut microbiota in neurotransmitter metabolism and function in animal and clinical experiments. Moreover, we will discuss the potential mechanisms through which gut microbiota-derived neurotransmitters contribute to the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric diseases, thus highlighting a novel therapeutic target for these conditions.",Microbiological research,2024,Shiyan Qu; Zijin Yu; Yaxuan Zhou; Shiyi Wang; Minqi Jia; Ti Chen; Xiaojie Zhang
38803488,"Gut microbiota, inflammatory proteins and COVID-19: a Mendelian randomisation study.","The human gut microbiota has been identified as a potentially important factor influencing the development of COVID-19. It is believed that the disease primarily affects the organism through inflammatory pathways. With the aim of improving early diagnosis and targeted therapy, it is crucial to identify the specific gut microbiota associated with COVID-19 and to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying processes. The present study sought to investigate the potential causal relationship between the gut microbiota and COVID-19, and to determine the extent to which inflammatory proteins act as mediators in this relationship.Bidirectional mendelian randomization (MR) and Two-step mediated MR analyses were applied to examine causative associations among 196 gut microbiota, 91 inflammatory proteins and COVID-19. The main analytical method used in the MR was the random effects inverse variance weighted (IVW) method. This was complemented by the Bayesian weighted Mendelian randomization (BWMR) method, which was utilized to test the hypothesis of MR. In order for the results to be deemed reliable, statistical significance was required for both methods. Validation was then carried out using an external dataset, and further meta-analyses were conducted to authenticate that the association was reliable.Results of our research indicated that seven gut microbiota were actively associated to the COVID-19 risk. Five inflammatory proteins were associated with COVID-19 risk, of which three were positively and two were negatively identified with COVID-19. Further validation was carried out using sensitivity analyses. Mediated MR results revealed that CCL2 was a possible mediator of causality of family Bifidobacteriaceae and order Bifidobacteriales with COVID-19, mediating at a ratio of 12.73%.Suggesting a genetic causation between specific gut microbiota and COVID-19, our present research emphasizes the underlying mediating role of CCL2, an inflammatory factor, and contributes to a deeper understanding of the mechanism of action underlying COVID-19.",Frontiers in immunology,2024,Yuling Chen; Chang Chen

It is known that the symbiotic interactions between the gut microbes and the host can affect mental health. The review analyzes the mechanisms and ways of action of the gut microbiota on the pathophysiology of depression. The possibility of using knowledge about the taxonomic composition and metabolic profile of the microbiota of patients with depression to select gene compositions (metagenomic signature) as biomarkers of the disease is evaluated. The use of in silico technologies (machine learning) for the diagnosis of depression based on the biomarkers of the gut microbiota is given. Alternative approaches to the treatment of depression are being considered by balancing the microbial composition through dietary modifications and the use of additives, namely probiotics, postbiotics (including vesicles) and prebiotics as psychobiotics, and fecal transplantation.

Kefir has been shown to have many beneficial health effects; however, its effect on PCOS is unknown. This study aimed to examine the effect of kefir on the intestinal microbiota and health outcomes in PCOS. In this intervention study, 17 women with PCOS consumed 250 mL/day of kefir (containing <i>Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens</i> subsp. <i>kefiranofaciens</i>, <i>Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens</i> subsp. <i>kefirgranum</i>, <i>Lactobacillus kefiri</i>, <i>Lactobacillus acidophilus</i>, <i>Lactobacillus parakefiri</i>, <i>Lactobacillus bulgaricus</i>, <i>Lactobacillus reuteri</i>, <i>Lactobacillus casei</i>, <i>Lactobacillus fermentum</i>, <i>Lactobacillus helveticus</i>, <i>Lactococcus lactis</i>, <i>Leuconostoc mesentereoides</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium bifidum</i>, <i>Streptococcus thermophilus</i>, <i>Kluyveromyces marxianus</i>, <i>Kluyveromyces lactis</i>, <i>Acetobacter pasteurianus</i>, and <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) for 8 weeks. Food consumption and physical activity records, anthropometrical measurements, quality of life, and fecal and blood samples were taken at the study's beginning and end. Quality of life in mental health (58.8 ± 15.08; 64.0 ± 15.23, respectively) and physical function (95.00 and 100.00, respectively) categories showed a significant increase after kefir intervention (<i>p</i> < .05).

38735387,Association of intestinal anti-inflammatory drug target genes with psychiatric Disorders: A Mendelian randomization study.,"Psychiatric disorders present a substantial global public health burden with limited drug options. The gut-brain axis connects inflammatory bowel diseases and psychiatric disorders, which often have comorbidities. While some evidence hints at anti-inflammatory drugs aiding in treating psychiatric conditions, the specific effects of intestinal anti-inflammatory drugs remain unclear.This study investigates the causal effect of intestinal anti-inflammatory drug targets on psychiatric disorders. We hypothesize that these drug targets may offer new insights into the treatment and prevention of such disorders. Additionally, we explore gut microbiota's mediating role between drug target genes and psychiatric disorders.We performed two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) using summary data from existing expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and protein QTL in the brain, along with public genome-wide association studies of disease. We also explored gut microbiota's mediating effect. The statistics encompassed six psychiatric disorders involving 9,725-500,199 individuals. Colocalization analysis enhanced the MR evidence.We uncovered a causal link between TPMT (a target of olsalazine) expression in the amygdala and bipolar disorder (BD) risk (odds ratio [OR] = 1.08; P = 4.29 × 10<sup>-4</sup>). This association was observed even when the sigmoid colon and whole blood eQTL were considered as exposures. Colocalization analysis revealed a shared genetic variant (rs11751561) between TPMT expression and BD, with a posterior probability of 61.6 %. Interestingly, this causal effect was influenced by a decrease in the gut microbiota abundance of the genus Roseburia (effect proportion = 10.05 %). Moreover, elevated ACAT1 expression was associated with higher obsessive-compulsive disorder risk (OR = 1.62; P = 3.64 × 10<sup>-4</sup>; posterior probability = 3.1 %).These findings provide novel targets for the treatment of psychiatric disorders, underscore the potential of repurposing olsalazine, and emphasize the importance of TPMT and ACAT1 in future drug development.",Journal of advanced research,2024,Guorui Zhao; Zhe Lu; Yundan Liao; Yaoyao Sun; Yuyanan Zhang; Zhewei Kang; Xiaoyang Feng; Junyuan Sun; Weihua Yue

Prebiotics, non-digestible food ingredients that beneficially affect the host by selectively stimulating the growth and/or activity of beneficial microorganisms, have emerged as a key modulator of this complex microbial community. This review article explores the evolution of the prebiotic concept, delineates various types of prebiotics, including fructans, galactooligosaccharides, xylooligosaccharides, chitooligosaccharides, lactulose, resistant starch, and polyphenols, and elucidates their impact on the gut microbiota composition. We delve into the mechanisms through which prebiotics exert their effects, particularly focusing on producing short-chain fatty acids and modulating the gut microbiota towards a health-promoting composition. The implications of prebiotics on human health are extensively reviewed, focusing on conditions such as obesity, inflammatory bowel disease, immune function, and mental health. The review further discusses the emerging concept of synbiotics-combinations of prebiotics and probiotics that synergistically enhance gut health-and highlights the market potential of prebiotics in response to a growing demand for functional foods. By consolidating current knowledge and identifying areas for future research, this review aims to enhance understanding of prebiotics' role in health and disease, underscoring their importance in maintaining a healthy gut microbiome and overall well-being.",International journal of molecular sciences,2024,Suyeon Yoo; Suk-Chae Jung; Kihyuck Kwak; Jun-Seob Kim

Thus, targeting the gut microbiota via dietary intake could serve as both a preventative and therapeutic strategy in improving perinatal mental health.Here, we present a protocol for a prospective cohort study that primarily aims to determine if diet quality during pregnancy is protective against postpartum depression severity. Secondary objectives will examine if microbiota- and blood-based inflammatory markers may be associated with the relationship between prenatal diet quality and postpartum depression severity, as well as with associations between additional dietary and mental health outcomes.Dietary patterns and mental health symptoms will be documented in 100 pregnant women at 4 time points during pregnancy and postpartum. Participants will also provide stool and blood samples at the same time points to determine microbiota composition and predicted function and inflammatory factors, respectively. Stool microbiota will be analyzed using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing and bioinformatics tools (QIIME 2/PICRUSt2).

Machine learning algorithms were employed to develop a classifier model, subsequently validated in an independent cohort. Mouse models of IA were established to verify the potential role of the specific metabolite identified.Distinct shifts in taxonomic and functional profiles of gut microbiota and their related metabolites were observed in different IA stages. Notably, tryptophan metabolites, particularly indoxyl sulfate (IS), were significantly higher in plasma of RIA. Meanwhile, upregulated tryptophanase expression and indole-producing microbiota were observed in gut microbiome of RIA. A model harnessing gut-microbiome-derived tryptophan metabolites demonstrated remarkable efficacy in distinguishing RIA from UIA patients in the validation cohort (AUC=0.97). Gut microbiota depletion by antibiotics decreased plasma IS concentration, reduced IA formation and rupture in mice, and downregulated matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression in aneurysmal walls with elastin degradation reduction. Supplement of IS reversed the effect of gut microbiota depletion.Our investigation highlights the potential of gut-microbiome-derived tryptophan metabolites as biomarkers for distinguishing RIA from UIA patients.

The emerging focus on the gut microbiota's role in CKD pathophysiology represents a pivotal area in nephrology; however, the evidence on this topic is limited. This observational prospective study, in the framework of the PREDIMED-Plus trial, investigates associations between gut microbiota composition and the 1-year trajectory of CKD in 343 participants aged 55-75 years with high cardiovascular risk.Kidney function was assessed at baseline and at 1-year of follow-up through the estimated glomerular filtration rate based on cystatin C (eGFR-CysC) and CKD defined by eGFR-CysC <60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. Participants were grouped based on their 1-year CKD trajectory: Group 1 maintained normal status or improved from CKD to normal, while Group 2 maintained CKD or worsened from normal to CKD. Fecal microbiota composition was assessed through 16S sequencing.We observed differences in gut microbiota composition between CKD trajectory groups. Notably, the baseline relative abundance of Lachnoclostridium and Lachnospira, both butyrate-producing genera, was lower in participants maintaining or progressing to CKD. Longitudinally, a decrease in Lachnospira abundance was associated with CKD progression. The improved Chao1 index after 1-year follow-up suggests a link between enhanced microbial richness and stable/better kidney function.The findings underscore the potential of gut microbiota analysis in non-invasively monitoring CKD, especially in older populations, and hint at future interventions targeting gut microbiota to manage CKD progression.

39375584,"Animal and plant protein intake association with mental health, tryptophan metabolites pathways, and gut microbiota in healthy women: a cross-sectional study.","Mental health is affected by tryptophane (TRP) metabolism regulation. Diet-influenced gut microbiome regulates TRP metabolism. Thus, the present study aimed to explore the relationship between type of dietary protein intake, gut microbiota, TRP metabolites homeostasis, and mental well-being in healthy women. 91 healthy females aged 18-50 were recruited based on the study protocol. Validate and reliable questionnaires assessed dietary intake and mental health. Biochemical tests and gut microbiota composition were analyzed following the manufacturer's instructions for each enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA) kit and Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) methods respectively. Regression methods were used to estimate the considered associations. The results show that in the fully adjusted model, plant protein consumption was partially inversely associated with depression risk (OR = 0.27; 95% CI: 0.06, 1.09; P = 0.06). Higher dietary animal protein intake was marginally associated with psychological distress (OR = 2.59; 95% CI: 0.91, 7.34; P = 0.07). KYN to serotonin ratio was inversely associated with animal protein consumption (ß = 1.10; 95% CI: -0.13, 2.33; P = 0.07). Firmicutes/Bacteriodetes ratio (β = -1.27 × 103, SE = 5.99 × 102, P = 0.03) was lower in the top tertile of plant protein. A partially negative correlation was found between dietary animal protein and Prevotella abundance (β = -9.20 × 1018, SE = 5.04 × 1018, P = 0.06). Overall, significant inverse associations were found between a diet high in plant protein with mental disorders, KYN levels, and Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio while adhering to higher animal protein could predispose women to psychological stress.",BMC microbiology,2024,Neda Soveid; Bahareh Barkhidarian; Mahsa Samadi; Mahsa Hatami; Fatemeh Gholami; Mir Saeid Yekaninejad; Ahmad Saedisomeolia; Maryam Karbasian; Seyed Davar Siadat; Khadijeh Mirzaei
39417049,Challenges in integrating traditional Chinese medicine and gut microbiota research for insomnia treatment.,"The gut microbiome is an extensive variety of bacteria with a range of metabolic capabilities that can be pathogenic, beneficial, or opportunistic. Changes in the gut microbiota's composition can affect the link between gut integrity and host health as well as cause disruptions to numerous neurological systems. The second most prevalent mental health problem, insomnia has a negative social and economic impact. Currently, it is becoming increasingly obvious how crucial it is to preserve the delicate balance of gut microbiota to treat illness-related symptoms like insomnia. Although traditional Chinese medicine has proposed an effective strategy against insomnia through gut microbiota alteration in animal models, studies in human models are limited. This decreases the predictive value of the studies in terms of human outcomes. This editorial places an emphasis on cultural sensitivity rather than scientific reasoning that promotes the use of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). We aim to emphasize the concern that promoting TCM could divert resources from conventional medical research, leading to suboptimal care.",World journal of clinical cases,2024,Maham Bilal; Abdulqadir J Nashwan
38975363,"Dissecting the association between gut microbiota, body mass index and specific depressive symptoms: a mediation Mendelian randomisation study.","Observational studies highlight the association between gut microbiota (GM) composition and depression; however, evidence for the causal relationship between GM and specific depressive symptoms remains lacking.We aimed to evaluate the causal relationship between GM and specific depressive symptoms as well as the mediating role of body mass index (BMI).We performed a two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis using genetic variants associated with GM and specific depressive symptoms from genome-wide association studies. The mediating role of BMI was subsequently explored using mediation analysis via two-step MR.MR evidence suggested the <i>Bifidobacterium</i> genus (β=-0.03; 95% CI -0.05 to -0.02; p<0.001 and β=-0.03; 95% CI -0.05 to -0.02; p<0.001) and Actinobacteria phylum (β=-0.04; 95% CI -0.06 to -0.02; p<0.001 and β=-0.03; 95% CI -0.05 to -0.03; p=0.001) had protective effects on both anhedonia and depressed mood. The Actinobacteria phylum also had protective effects on appetite changes (β=-0.04; 95% CI -0.06 to -0.01; p=0.005), while the Family XI had an antiprotective effect (β=0.03; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.04; p<0.001). The Bifidobacteriaceae family (β=-0.01; 95% CI -0.02 to -0.01; p=0.001) and Actinobacteria phylum (β=-0.02; 95% CI -0.03 to -0.01; p=0.001) showed protective effects against suicidality. The two-step MR analysis revealed that BMI also acted as a mediating moderator between the Actinobacteria phylum and appetite changes (mediated proportion, 34.42%) and that BMI partially mediated the effect of the <i>Bifidobacterium</i> genus (14.14% and 8.05%) and Actinobacteria phylum (13.10% and 8.31%) on both anhedonia and depressed mood.These findings suggest a potential therapeutic effect of Actinobacteria and <i>Bifidobacterium</i> on both depression and obesity.

38901183,Diverse mechanisms by which chemical pollutant exposure alters gut microbiota metabolism and inflammation.,"The human gut microbiome, the host, and the environment are inextricably linked across the life course with significant health impacts. Consisting of trillions of bacteria, fungi, viruses, and other micro-organisms, microbiota living within our gut are particularly dynamic and responsible for digestion and metabolism of diverse classes of ingested chemical pollutants. Exposure to chemical pollutants not only in early life but throughout growth and into adulthood can alter human hosts' ability to absorb and metabolize xenobiotics, nutrients, and other components critical to health and longevity. Inflammation is a common mechanism underlying multiple environmentally related chronic conditions, including cardiovascular disease, multiple cancer types, and mental health. While growing research supports complex interactions between pollutants and the gut microbiome, significant gaps exist. Few reviews provide descriptions of the complex mechanisms by which chemical pollutants interact with the host microbiome through either direct or indirect pathways to alter disease risk, with a particular focus on inflammatory pathways. This review focuses on examples of several classes of pollutants commonly ingested by humans, including (i) heavy metals, (ii) persistent organic pollutants (POPs), and (iii) nitrates. Digestive enzymes and gut microbes are the first line of absorption and metabolism of these chemicals, and gut microbes have been shown to alter compounds from a less to more toxic state influencing subsequent distribution and excretion. In addition, chemical pollutants may interact with or alter the selection of more harmful and less commensal microbiota, leading to gut dysbiosis, and changes in receptor-mediated signaling pathways that alter the integrity and function of the gut intestinal tract. Arsenic, cadmium, and lead (heavy metals), influence the microbiome directly by altering different classes of bacteria, and subsequently driving inflammation through metabolite production and different signaling pathways (LPS/TLR4 or proteoglycan/TLR2 pathways). POPs can alter gut microbial composition either directly or indirectly depending on their ability to activate key signaling pathways within the intestine (e.g., PCB-126 and AHR). Nitrates and nitrites' effect on the gut and host may depend on their ability to be transformed to secondary and tertiary metabolites by gut bacteria. Future research should continue to support foundational research both in vitro, in vivo, and longitudinal population-based research to better identify opportunities for prevention, gain additional mechanistic insights into the complex interactions between environmental pollutants and the microbiome and support additional translational science.",Environment international,2024,Menna Teffera; Alex C Veith; Sean Ronnekleiv-Kelly; Christopher A Bradfield; Maria Nikodemova; Lisa Tussing-Humphreys; Kristen Malecki
39375215,Association of the newly proposed dietary index for gut microbiota and depression: the mediation effect of phenotypic age and body mass index.,"Gut microbiota and depression have garnered attention. The dietary index for gut microbiota (DI-GM) is a newly proposed index that reflects the diversity of gut microbiota, yet its association with depression remains unstudied.Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were analyzed. Depression was assessed using Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Dietary recall data were used to calculate the DI-GM (including components beneficial and unfavorable to gut microbiota). Multivariable weighted logistic and linear regression were employed to investigate the association of DI-GM with depression and total PHQ-9 score. The potential mediating role of phenotypic age and body mass index (BMI) was explored. Secondary analyses included subgroup analyses, restricted cubic spline (RCS), and multiple imputation.A higher DI-GM and beneficial gut microbiota score were associated with a lower prevalence of depression (DI-GM: OR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.89, 0.99; beneficial gut microbiota score: OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.82, 0.94) and lower total PHQ-9 score (DI-GM: β=-0.09, 95% CI=-0.14, -0.04; beneficial gut microbiota: β=-0.15, 95% CI=-0.21, -0.08). RCS indicated a non-linear relationship between DI-GM and depression. A significant mediating effect of phenotypic age (proportion of mediation: 19.81%, 95% CI: 12.86-63.00%) and BMI (proportion of mediation: 16.49%, 95% CI: 12.87-62.00%) was observed.The newly proposed DI-GM was negatively associated with the prevalence of depression and total PHQ-9 score. Mediation analyses demonstrated a significant mediating effect of phenotypic age and BMI.",European archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience,2024,Xuan Zhang; Qinglong Yang; Jingtao Huang; Hanyuan Lin; Nan Luo; Haoxian Tang

It may also cause vascular endothelial dysfunction and androgen metabolism disorder by interfering with lipid metabolism, immunity, and endocrine regulation, leading to the occurrence of organic ED.Gut microbiota and its metabolites play an important role in the occurrence and development of ED. As a new influencing factor of ED, gut microbiota disorder is expected to become a target for treatment.",Sexual medicine reviews,2024,Quanxin Su; Qizhen Tang; Chuanyu Ma; Kenan Wang
38582194,Evolution and the critical role of the microbiota in the reduced mental and physical health associated with low socioeconomic status (SES).,"The evolution of the gut-microbiota-brain axis in animals reveals that microbial inputs influence metabolism, the regulation of inflammation and the development of organs, including the brain. Inflammatory, neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders are more prevalent in people of low socioeconomic status (SES). Many aspects of low SES reduce exposure to the microbial inputs on which we are in a state of evolved dependence, whereas the lifestyle of wealthy citizens maintains these exposures. This partially explains the health deficit of low SES, so focussing on our evolutionary history and on environmental and lifestyle factors that distort microbial exposures might help to mitigate that deficit. But the human microbiota is complex and we have poor understanding of its functions at the microbial and mechanistic levels, and in the brain. Perhaps its composition is more flexible than the microbiota of animals that have restricted habitats and less diverse diets? These uncertainties are discussed in relation to the encouraging but frustrating results of attempts to treat psychiatric disorders by modulating the microbiota.",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,2024,Graham A W Rook

39458270,Depressive Symptoms and Gut Microbiota after Bowel Preparation and Colonoscopy: A Pre-Post Intervention Study.,"Mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) is essential for visualisation of the colon during colonoscopy. Previous studies have identified changes in gut microbiota composition after MBP and colonoscopy. Considering the gut microbiota is increasingly implicated in psychiatry, we explored the potential impact of this intervention on mood and the microbiota-gut-brain axis. We conducted a pre-post intervention study in adults, with timepoints of one week before and one month after MBP and colonoscopy. Our primary outcome was change in average Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale depression sub-scores. We examined changes in average anxiety, stress, and quality of life scores and gut microbiota composition using 16S rRNA sequencing. We further explored associations between changes in depressive symptoms and gut microbiota and conducted post hoc analyses to explore potential effect modifiers. Average depressive symptom scores decreased one month post-procedure compared to baseline (n = 59; adjusted β = -0.64; 95%CI: -1.18, -0.11). Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) appeared to moderate this relationship (β = 1.78; 95%CI: 0.292, 3.26); depressive symptoms increased in those with, and decreased in those without, IBS. Reduced alpha diversity, modest effects on beta-diversity, and increases in health-associated genera were observed one month post-procedure. Increases in the CLR-transformed abundances of <i>Ruminococcaceae UCG-009</i> were associated with improvements in depressive symptoms. There is preliminary evidence of a potential mental health effect of MBP and colonoscopy, particularly for those with IBS, which may be associated with changes to the gut microbiota. Further research is required to confirm these findings and their clinical relevance.",Microorganisms,2024,Amelia J McGuinness; Martin O'Hely; Douglas Stupart; David Watters; Samantha L Dawson; Christopher Hair; Michael Berk; Mohammadreza Mohebbi; Amy Loughman; Glenn Guest; Felice N Jacka
38892694,A Cross Talking between the Gut Microbiota and Metabolites of Participants in a Confined Environment.,"Certain workplaces, like deep-sea voyages, subject workers to chronic psychological stress and circadian rhythm disorders due to confined environments and frequent shifts. In this study, participants lived in a strictly controlled confined environment, and we analyzed the effects of a confined environment on gut microbiota and metabolites. The results showed that living in confined environments can significantly alter both the gut microbiota and the gut metabolome, particularly affecting lipid metabolism pathways like glycerophospholipid metabolism. There was a significant reduction in the abundance of <i>Faecalibacterium</i> and <i>Bacteroides</i>, while <i>Blautia</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, and <i>Collinsella</i> showed significant increases. An association analysis revealed a strong correlation between changes in the gut microbiota and the metabolome. Four upregulated lipid metabolites may serve as biomarkers for damage induced by confined environments, and certain gut microbiota alterations, such as those involving <i>Faecalibacterium</i> and <i>Bacteroides</i>, could be potential psychobiotics or therapeutic targets for enhancing mental health in a confined environment.",Nutrients,2024,Xin Song; Ziying Wang; Yongjun Xia; Zheng Chen; Guangqiang Wang; Yijin Yang; Beiwei Zhu; Lianzhong Ai; Haodan Xu; Chuan Wang
39335452,Prior Appendicectomy and Gut Microbiota Re-Establishment in Adults after Bowel Preparation and Colonoscopy.,"Emerging evidence suggests that the human vermiform appendix is not a vestigial organ but rather an immunological organ of biological relevance. It is hypothesised that the appendix acts as a bacterial 'safe house' for commensal gut bacteria and facilitates re-inoculation of the colon after disruption through the release of biofilms. To date, no studies have attempted to explore this potential mechanistic function of the appendix. We conducted a pre-post intervention study in adults (n = 59) exploring re-establishment of the gut microbiota in those with and without an appendix after colonic disruption via bowel preparation and colonoscopy. Gut microbiota composition was measured one week before and one month after bowel preparation and colonoscopy using 16S rRNA sequencing. We observed between group differences in gut microbiota composition between those with (n = 45) and without (n = 13) an appendix at baseline. These differences were no longer evident one-month post-procedure, suggesting that this procedure may have 'reset' any potential appendix-related differences between groups. Both groups experienced reductions in gut microbiota richness and shifts in beta diversity post-procedure, with greater changes in those without an appendix, and there were five bacterial genera whose re-establishment post-procedure appeared to be moderated by appendicectomy status. This small experimental study provides preliminary evidence of a potential differential re-establishment of the gut microbiota after disruption in those with and without an appendix, warranting further investigation into the potential role of the appendix as a microbial safe house.",Biomedicines,2024,Amelia J McGuinness; Martin O'Hely; Douglas Stupart; David Watters; Samantha L Dawson; Christopher Hair; Michael Berk; Mohammadreza Mohebbi; Amy Loughman; Glenn Guest; Felice N Jacka
39260135,Microbiota-gut-brain axis: Natural antidepressants molecular mechanism.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a severe mental health condition characterized by persistent depression, impaired cognition, and reduced activity. Increasing evidence suggests that gut microbiota (GM) imbalance is closely linked to the emergence and advancement of MDD, highlighting the potential significance of regulating the ""Microbiota-Gut-Brain"" (MGB) axis to impact the development of MDD. Natural products (NPs), characterized by broad biological activities, low toxicity, and multi-target characteristics, offer unique advantages in antidepressant treatment by regulating MGB axis.This review was aimed to explore the intricate relationship between the GM and the brain, as well as host responses, and investigated the mechanisms underlying the MGB axis in MDD development. It also explored the pharmacological mechanisms by which NPs modulate MGB axis to exert antidepressant effects and addressed current research limitations. Additionally, it proposed new strategies for future preclinical and clinical applications in the MDD domain.To study the effects and mechanism by which NPs exert antidepressant effects through mediating the MGB axis, data were collected from Web of Science, PubMed, ScienceDirect from initial establishment to March 2024. NPs were classified and summarized by their mechanisms of action.NPs, such as flavonoids,alkaloids,polysaccharides,saponins, terpenoids, can treat MDD by regulating the MGB axis. Its mechanism includes balancing GM, regulating metabolites and neurotransmitters such as SCAFs, 5-HT, BDNF, inhibiting neuroinflammation, improving neural plasticity, and increasing neurogenesis.NPs display good antidepressant effects, and have potential value for clinical application in the prevention and treatment of MDD by regulating the MGB axis. However, in-depth study of the mechanisms by which antidepressant medications affect MGB axis will also require considerable effort in clinical and preclinical research, which is essential for the development of effective antidepressant treatments.",Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,2024,Yitong Lu; Xiaowen Yu; Zhongling Wang; Linghui Kong; Zhenyuan Jiang; Ruirui Shang; Xia Zhong; Shimeng Lv; Guangheng Zhang; Haonan Gao; Ni Yang
39092201,Stress and the gut-brain axis: an inflammatory perspective.,"The gut-brain axis (GBA) plays a dominant role in maintaining homeostasis as well as contributes to mental health maintenance. The pathways that underpin the axis expand from macroscopic interactions with the nervous system, to the molecular signals that include microbial metabolites, tight junction protein expression, or cytokines released during inflammation. The dysfunctional GBA has been repeatedly linked to the occurrence of anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors development. The importance of the inflammatory aspects of the altered GBA has recently been highlighted in the literature. Here we summarize current reports on GBA signaling which involves the immune response within the intestinal and blood-brain barrier (BBB). We also emphasize the effect of stress response on altering barriers' permeability, and the therapeutic potential of microbiota restoration by probiotic administration or microbiota transplantation, based on the latest animal studies. Most research performed on various stress models showed an association between anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors, dysbiosis of gut microbiota, and disruption of intestinal permeability with simultaneous changes in BBB integrity. It could be postulated that under stress conditions impaired communication across BBB may therefore represent a significant mechanism allowing the gut microbiota to affect brain functions.",Frontiers in molecular neuroscience,2024,Julia Morys; Andrzej Małecki; Marta Nowacka-Chmielewska
39339804,Balancing the Oral-Gut-Brain Axis with Diet.,"<b>Background:</b> The oral microbiota is the second largest microbial community in humans. It contributes considerably to microbial diversity and health effects, much like the gut microbiota. Despite physical and chemical barriers separating the oral cavity from the gastrointestinal tract, bidirectional microbial transmission occurs between the two regions, influencing overall host health. <b>Method:</b> This review explores the intricate interplay of the oral-gut-brain axis, highlighting the pivotal role of the oral microbiota in systemic health and ageing, and how it can be influenced by diet. <b>Results:</b> Recent research suggests a relationship between oral diseases, such as periodontitis, and gastrointestinal problems, highlighting the broader significance of the oral-gut axis in systemic diseases, as well as the oral-gut-brain axis in neurological disorders and mental health. Diet influences microbial diversity in the oral cavity and the gut. While certain diets/dietary components improve both gut and oral health, others, such as fermentable carbohydrates, can promote oral pathogens while boosting gut health. <b>Conclusions:</b> Understanding these dynamics is key for promoting a healthy oral-gut-brain axis through dietary interventions that support microbial diversity and mitigate age-related health risks.",Nutrients,2024,Rebecca Kerstens; Yong Zhi Ng; Sven Pettersson; Anusha Jayaraman
38922485,Characterization of Gut Microbiota in Rats and Rhesus Monkeys After Methamphetamine Self-administration.,"Methamphetamine (MA) is one of the most abused drugs globally, but the mechanism of its addiction remains unclear. Several animal studies have shown that the gut microbiota (GM) influences addictive behaviors, but the pattern of GM changes during addiction in animals of different species remains unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the association between dynamic changes in GM and MA self-administration acquisition among two classical mammals, rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) and rats, MA self-administration models. Male Sprague-Dawley rats and male rhesus monkeys were subjected to classical MA self-administration training, and fecal samples were collected before and after MA self-administration training, respectively. 16S rRNA sequencing was used for GM analyses. We found that GM changes were more pronounced in rats than in rhesus monkeys, as evidenced by more GM taxa producing significant differences before and after MA self-administration training in rats than in monkeys. We also found that the expression of the genus Clostridia_vadinBB60_group significantly decreased after MA self-administration training in both rats and rhesus monkeys. Lactobacillus changes were significantly negatively correlated with total MA uptake in rats (Pearson R =  - 0.666, p = 0.035; Spearman R =  - 0.721, p = 0.023), whereas its change was also highly negatively correlated with total MA uptake in rhesus monkeys (Pearson R =  - 0.882, p = 0.118; Spearman R =  - 1.000, p = 0.083), although this was not significant. These findings suggest that MA causes significant alterations in GM in both rhesus monkeys and rats and that the genus Lactobacillus might be a common therapeutic target for MA uptake prevention across the species.",Molecular neurobiology,2024,Li He; Jia-Hui Zhou; Huan Li; Wen-Lei Zhang; Tie-Qiao Liu; Hai-Feng Jiang; Rong-Wei Zhai; Xiao-Jie Zhang
38815661,Gut microbiota composition links to variation in functional domains across psychiatric disorders.,"Changes in microbial composition are observed in various psychiatric disorders, but their specificity to certain symptoms or processes remains unclear. This study explores the associations between the gut microbiota composition and the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) domains of functioning, representing symptom domains, specifically focusing on stress-related and neurodevelopmental disorders in patients with and without psychiatric comorbidity.The gut microbiota was analyzed in 369 participants, comprising 272 individuals diagnosed with a mood disorder, anxiety disorder, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and/or substance use disorder, as well as 97 psychiatrically unaffected individuals. The RDoC domains were estimated using principal component analysis (PCA) with oblique rotation on a range of psychiatric, psychological, and personality measures. Associations between the gut microbiota and the functional domains were assessed using multiple linear regression and permanova, adjusted for age, sex, diet, smoking, medication use and comorbidity status.Four functional domains, aligning with RDoC's negative valence, social processes, cognitive systems, and arousal/regulatory systems domains, were identified. Significant associations were found between these domains and eight microbial genera, including associations of negative valence with the abundance of the genera Sellimonas, CHKCI001, Clostridium sensu stricto 1, Oscillibacter, and Flavonifractor; social processes with Sellimonas; cognitive systems with Sporobacter and Hungatella; and arousal/regulatory systems with Ruminococcus torques (all p<sub>FDR</sub> < 0.05).Our findings demonstrate associations between the gut microbiota and the domains of functioning across patients and unaffected individuals, potentially mediated by immune-related processes. These results open avenues for microbiota-focused personalized interventions, considering psychiatric comorbidity. However, further research is warranted to establish causality and elucidate mechanistic pathways.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2024,Danique Mulder; Babette Jakobi; Yingjie Shi; Peter Mulders; Josina D Kist; Rose M Collard; Janna N Vrijsen; Phillip van Eijndhoven; Indira Tendolkar; Mirjam Bloemendaal; Alejandro Arias Vasquez
38892525,Is the Mediterranean Low Fodmap Diet Effective in Managing Irritable Bowel Syndrome Symptoms and Gut Microbiota? An Innovative Research Protocol.,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms can be effectively managed with the low FODMAP diet. However, its efficacy in reducing inflammation is not yet proven. On the contrary, the Mediterranean diet has anti-inflammatory properties with proven efficacy in treating chronic low-grade inflammation-related diseases.To publicly share our protocol evaluating the efficacy of the Mediterranean low-FODMAP (MED-LFD) versus NICE recommendations (British National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) diet in managing IBS symptoms and quality of life.Participants meeting the Rome IV criteria will be randomly assigned to MED-LFD or NICE recommendations and they will be followed for six months. Efficacy, symptom relief, quality of life and mental health will be assessed using validated questionnaires. In addition, fecal samples will be analyzed to assess gut microbiota, and to measure branched and short-chain fatty acids, and volatile organic compounds (metabolic byproducts from bacteria). Expected results and discussion: By publicly sharing this clinical study protocol, we aim to improve research quality in the field of IBS management by allowing for peer review feedback, preventing data manipulation, reducing redundant research efforts, mitigating publication bias, and empowering patient decision-making. We expect that this protocol will show that MED-LFD can effectively alleviate IBS symptoms and it will provide pathophysiology insights on its efficacy. The new dietary pattern that combines the LFD and the MED approaches allows for the observation of the synergistic action of both diets, with the MED's anti-inflammatory and prebiotic properties enhancing the effects of the LFD while minimizing its limitations.

38869657,"Effects of Bifidobacterium breve 207-1 on regulating lifestyle behaviors and mental wellness in healthy adults based on the microbiome-gut-brain axis: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.","Our study aimed to explore the efficacy of Bifidobacterium breve 207-1 on specific neurotransmitters and hormones and the ability to regulate lifestyle behaviors in healthy adults.In total, 120 healthy adults with high mental stress, overweight, insomnia, and constipation were randomly assigned to receive low-dose B. breve 207-1 (LD, n = 40), high-dose B. breve 207-1 (HD, n = 40), or placebo (n = 40) for 28 days. Fecal and blood samples were collected and questionnaires were answered before and after the trial. Neurotransmitters and serum hormones were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The gut microbiota composition was assessed using 16 S rRNA sequencing. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) concentrations were determined via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).The primary outcome of our study was changes in mental wellness, including neurotransmitters, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrena (HPA) axis hormones, and the psychological scales. The results showed that γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) increased significantly and the HPA axis hormones were suppressed overall in the probiotic groups while 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) did not change significantly. However, there was no significant change in mood scale scores. The secondary outcome focused on the ability of 207-1 to regulate the body and lifestyle of healthy adults (e.g., sleep, diet, exercise, etc.). The PSQI scores in the probiotics groups significantly decreased, indicating improved sleep quality. Meanwhile, the probiotic groups had a slight increase in exercise consumption while dietary intake stabilized. By physical examination, the participants showed weight loss although no statistically significant difference was observed between the groups. Then, validated by gut microbiota, changes in the gut microbiota were observed under the effective intervention of 207-1 while short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) increased in the LD group, particularly acetic and propionic acids. There was a slight decrease in alpha-diversity in the HD group.Bifidobacterium breve 207-1 entered the organism and affected neurotransmitter and the HPA axis hormone levels via the microbiome-gut-brain axis. Meanwhile, 207-1 supplementation improved daily lifestyle behaviors in healthy adults, which may in turn lead to changes in their bodies (e.g. weight and lipid metabolism). However, this study did not find significant mood-modulating efficacy. The mechanism of the overall study is unclear, but we hypothesize that SCFAs may be the key pathway, and more experiments are needed for validation in the future.This trial was retrospectively registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry under the accession number ChiCTR2300069453 on March 16, 2023.",European journal of nutrition,2024,Jinxing Li; Yapeng Li; Jincheng Zhao; Liang Li; Yunyi Wang; Fei Chen; Yuchen Li; Ruyue Cheng; Fang He; Xiaolei Ze; Xi Shen
38889540,Treating chronic stress and chronic pain by manipulating gut microbiota with diet: can we kill two birds with one stone?,"<b>Background:</b> Chronic stress and chronic pain are closely linked by the capacity to exacerbate each other, sharing common roots in the brain and in the gut. The strict intersection between these two neurological diseases makes important to have a therapeutic strategy aimed at preventing both to maintain mental health in patients. Diet is an modifiable lifestyle factor associated with gut-brain axis diseases and there is growing interest in its use as adjuvant to main therapies. Several evidence attest the impact of specific diets or nutrients on chronic stress-related disorders and pain with a good degree of certainty. A daily adequate intake of foods containing micronutrients such as amino acids, minerals and vitamins, as well as the reduction in the consumption of processed food products can have a positive impact on microbiota and gut health. Many nutrients are endowed of prebiotic, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and neuroprotective potential which make them useful tools helping the management of chronic stress and pain in patients. Dietary regimes, as intermittent fasting or caloric restriction, are promising, although further studies are needed to optimize protocols according to patient's medical history, age and sex. Moreover, by supporting gut microbiota health with diet is possible to attenuate comorbidities such as obesity, gastrointestinal dysfunction and mood disorders, thus reducing healthcare costs related to chronic stress or pain.<b>Objective:</b> This review summarize the most recent evidence on the microbiota-mediated beneficial effects of macro- and micronutrients, dietary-related factors, specific nutritional regimens and dietary intervention on these pathological conditions.",Nutritional neuroscience,2024,Alessia Costa; Elena Lucarini
39237483,Temperament in Early Childhood Is Associated With Gut Microbiota Composition and Diversity.,"Temperament is a key predictor of human mental health and cognitive and emotional development. Although human fear behavior is reportedly associated with gut microbiome in infancy, infant gut microbiota changes dramatically during the first 5 years, when the diversity and composition of gut microbiome are established. This period is crucial for the development of the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in emotion regulation. Therefore, this study investigated the relationship between temperament and gut microbiota in 284 preschool children aged 3-4 years. Child temperament was assessed by maternal reports of the Children's Behavior Questionnaire. Gut microbiota (alpha/beta diversity and genera abundance) was evaluated using 16S rRNA sequencing of stool samples. A low abundance of anti-inflammatory bacteria (e.g., Faecalibacterium) and a high abundance of pro-inflammatory bacteria (e.g., Eggerthella, Flavonifractor) were associated with higher negative emotionality and stress response (i.e., negative affectivity, β = -0.17, p = 0.004) and lower positive emotionality and reward-seeking (i.e., surgency/extraversion, β = 0.15, p = 0.013). Additionally, gut microbiota diversity was associated with speed of response initiation (i.e., impulsivity, a specific aspect of surgency/extraversion, β = 0.16, p = 0.008). This study provides insight into the biological mechanisms of temperament and takes important steps toward identifying predictive markers of psychological/emotional risk.",Developmental psychobiology,2024,Eriko Ueda; Michiko Matsunaga; Hideaki Fujihara; Takamasa Kajiwara; Aya K Takeda; Satoshi Watanabe; Keisuke Hagihara; Masako Myowa
38801922,The impact of depression-mediated gut microbiota composition on Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Mendelian study.,"This study uses a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to delineate the causal influence of gut microbiota on the occurrence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), concurrently assessing the potential mediating function of depression within this framework.Several two-sample MR methods were used to assess the causal repercussions of gut microbiota on the onset of both IBS and depression. Following this, gut microbiota and depression, which demonstrated notable causal associations, were integrated as exposure variables in a multivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR) framework to construct a model encompassing gut microbiota, depression, and IBS. Mediation effects were assessed by examining the indirect pathway of gut microbiota → depression → IBS.Two-sample MR analysis unveiled a statistically significant causal association (P < 0.05) between specific bacterial group within the gut microbiota, notably p_Actinobacteria(OR = 0.829225), c_Clostridia(OR = 0.798897), s_Desulfovibrio_piger(OR = 1.163912), g_Streptococcus(OR = 1.132735), c_Actinobacteria(OR = 0.829224), and the onset of IBS. In the MVMR analysis, the relationship between depression and IBS was significant across Model 3, Model 7, Model 8, and Model 13 (P < 0.05). Assessment of mediation effects revealed that c_Clostridia and o_Clostridiales indirectly impacted IBS through depression, with masking effect ratios of 168.46 % and 168.44 %, respectively.These findings underscore a resilient causal association between the composition of gut microbiota and the initiation of IBS. Furthermore, depression serves as a mediator for particular groups of gut bacteria, thereby contributing to the development of IBS. These observations imply that interventions targeting mental health may potentially alleviate the risk of IBS onset attributable to adverse configurations of gut microbiota.",Journal of affective disorders,2024,Yi Huang; Endian Zheng; Mei Hu; Xinxin Yang; Qiaoli Lan; Yingcong Yu; Beibei Xu
38848976,Deciphering the gut microbiota's (Coprococcus and Subdoligranulum) impact on depression: Network pharmacology and molecular dynamics simulation.,"Depression, a prevalent mental health condition, significantly impacts global mental impairment rates. While antidepressants are commonly used, treatment-resistant depression (TRD) poses a challenge. Emerging research highlights the role of the gut microbiota in depression through the gut-brain axis. This study identifies key genes associated with depression influenced by specific gut microbiota, Coprococcus and Subdoligranulum. Using bioinformatics tools, potential targets were elucidated, and molecular docking studies were performed. Furthermore, gene expression analysis identified hub-genes related to depression, intersecting with metabolite targets. Protein-protein interaction analysis revealed pivotal targets such as PTGS2 and MMP9. Molecular docking demonstrated 3-Indolepropionic acid's superior affinity over (R)-3-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)lactate. Physicochemical properties and toxicity profiles were compared, suggesting favorable attributes for 3-Indolepropionic acid. Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed stability and interactions of compounds with target proteins. This comprehensive approach sheds light on the complex interplay between gut microbiota, genes, and depression, emphasizing the potential for microbiota-targeted interventions in mental health management.","Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior",2024,Sarvesh Sabarathinam

Therefore, this study aimed to characterize differences in self-reported symptoms, gut microbiota composition, and wellbeing (i.e., sleep quality, mood, and physical (PHQ) and mental wellbeing) between athletes with and without GI symptoms. In addition, we assessed the potential impact of a 3-week multi-ingredient fermented whey supplement in the GI complaints group, without a control group, on the gut microbiota and self-reported GI symptoms and wellbeing. A total of 50 athletes (24.7 ± 4.5 years) with GI issues (GI group at baseline, GI-B) and 21 athletes (25.4 ± 5.3 years) without GI issues (non-GI group, NGI) were included. At baseline, there was a significant difference in the total gastrointestinal symptom rating scale (GSRS) score (24.1 ± 8.48 vs. 30.3 ± 8.82, <i>p</i> = 0.008) and a trend difference in PHQ (33.9 ± 10.7 vs. 30.3 ± 8.82, <i>p</i> = 0.081), but no differences (<i>p</i> > 0.05) were seen for other outcomes, including gut microbiota metrics, between groups. After 3-week supplementation, the GI group (GI-S) showed increased <i>Bifidobacterium</i> relative abundance (<i>p</i> < 0.05), reported a lower number of severe GI complaints (from 72% to 54%, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and PHQ declined (<i>p</i> = 0.010). In conclusion, well-trained athletes with GI complaints reported more severe GI symptoms than an athletic reference group, without showing clear differences in wellbeing or microbiota composition.

39063241,Opioid Use and Gut Dysbiosis in Cancer Pain Patients.,"Opioids are commonly used for the management of severe chronic cancer pain. Their well-known pharmacological effects on the gastrointestinal system, particularly opioid-induced constipation (OIC), are the most common limiting factors in the optimization of analgesia, and have led to the wide use of laxatives and/or peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonists (PAMORAs). A growing interest has been recently recorded in the possible effects of opioid treatment on the gut microbiota. Preclinical and clinical data, as presented in this review, showed that alterations of the gut microbiota play a role in modulating opioid-mediated analgesia and tolerability, including constipation. Moreover, due to the bidirectional crosstalk between gut bacteria and the central nervous system, gut dysbiosis may be crucial in modulating opioid reward and addictive behavior. The microbiota may also modulate pain regulation and tolerance, by activating microglial cells and inducing the release of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which sustain neuroinflammation. In the subset of cancer patients, the clinical meaning of opioid-induced gut dysbiosis, particularly its possible interference with the efficacy of chemotherapy and immunotherapy, is still unclear. Gut dysbiosis could be a new target for treatment in cancer patients. Restoring the physiological amount of specific gut bacteria may represent a promising therapeutic option for managing gastrointestinal symptoms and optimizing analgesia for cancer patients using opioids.",International journal of molecular sciences,2024,Flaminia Coluzzi; Maria Sole Scerpa; Chiara Loffredo; Marina Borro; Joseph V Pergolizzi; Jo Ann LeQuang; Elisa Alessandri; Maurizio Simmaco; Monica Rocco

The literature search for this review was conducted using PubMed and Scopus, employing keywords and phrases related to maternal stress, ethanol exposure, gut microbiota, microbiome, gut-brain axis, diet, dysbiosis, progesterone, placenta, prenatal development, immunity, inflammation, and depression to identify relevant studies in both preclinical and human research. Only a limited number of reviews were included to support the arguments. The search encompassed studies from the 1990s to the present. This review begins by exploring the role of microbiota in modulating host health and disease. It then examines how disturbances in maternal microbiota can affect the offspring's immune system. The analysis continues by investigating the interplay between stress and dysbiosis, focusing on how prenatal maternal stress influences both maternal and offspring microbiota and its implications for susceptibility to depression. The review also considers the impact of ethanol consumption on gut dysbiosis, with an emphasis on the effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on both maternal and offspring microbiota. Finally, it is suggested that maternal gut microbiota dysbiosis may be significantly exacerbated by the combined effects of stress and ethanol exposure, leading to immune system dysfunction and chronic inflammation, which could increase the risk of depression in the offspring. These interactions underscore the potential for novel mental health interventions that address the gut-brain axis, especially in relation to maternal and offspring health.",International journal of molecular sciences,2024,Rosana Camarini; Priscila Marianno; Maylin Hanampa-Maquera; Samuel Dos Santos Oliveira; Niels Olsen Saraiva Câmara
38776563,Microbiota-brain axis: Exploring the role of gut microbiota in psychiatric disorders - A comprehensive review.,"Mental illness is a hidden epidemic in modern science that has gradually spread worldwide. According to estimates from the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 10% of the world's population suffers from various mental diseases each year. Worldwide, financial and health burdens on society are increasing annually. Therefore, understanding the different factors that can influence mental illness is required to formulate novel and effective treatments and interventions to combat mental illness. Gut microbiota, consisting of diverse microbial communities residing in the gastrointestinal tract, exert profound effects on the central nervous system through the gut-brain axis. The gut-brain axis serves as a conduit for bidirectional communication between the two systems, enabling the gut microbiota to affect emotional and cognitive functions. Dysbiosis, or an imbalance in the gut microbiota, is associated with an increased susceptibility to mental health disorders and psychiatric illnesses. Gut microbiota is one of the most diverse and abundant groups of microbes that have been found to interact with the central nervous system and play important physiological functions in the human gut, thus greatly affecting the development of mental illnesses. The interaction between gut microbiota and mental health-related illnesses is a multifaceted and promising field of study.

39027446,Potential role of gut microbiota in major depressive disorder: A review.,"Interactions between the gut microbiota and host immunity are sophisticated, dynamic, and host-dependent. Scientists have recently conducted research showing that disturbances in the gut bacterial community can lead to a decrease in some metabolites and, consequently, to behaviors such as depression. Exposure to stressors dropped the relative abundance of bacteria in the genus <i>Bacteroides</i> while soaring the relative abundance of bacteria in the genus <i>Clostridium</i>, <i>Coprococcus</i>, <i>Dialister</i>, and Oscillibacter, <i>which</i> were also reduced in people with depression. Microbiota and innate immunity are in a bilateral relationship. The gut microbiota has been shown to induce the synthesis of antimicrobial proteins such as catalysidins, type C lectins, and defensins. Probiotic bacteria can modulate depressive behavior through GABA signaling. The gut microbiome produces essential metabolites such as neurotransmitters, tryptophan metabolites, and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that can act on the CNS. In the case of dysbiosis, due to mucin changes, the ratio of intestinal-derived molecules may change and contribute to depression. Psychotropics, including <i>Bifidobacterium longum</i> NCC3001, <i>Clostridium butyricum</i> CBM588, and <i>Lactobacillus acidophilus,</i> have mental health benefits, and can have a positive effect on the host-brain relationship, and have antidepressant effects. This article reviews current studies on the association between gut microbiota dysbiosis and depression. Comprehensively, these findings could potentially lead to novel approaches to improving depressive symptoms via gut microbiota alterations, including probiotics, prebiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation.",Heliyon,2024,Mansoor Khaledi; Fatemeh Sameni; Abolfazl Gholipour; Shahnaz Shahrjerdi; Reza Golmohammadi; Hadi Esmaeili Gouvarchin Ghaleh; Behnam Poureslamfar; Jaber Hemmati; Niloofar Mobarezpour; Yaser Eshaghi Milasi; Fatemeh Rad; Mahtab Mehboodi; Parviz Owlia

SD status was evaluated using the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Beck Depression Inventory 2nd version (BDI-II), the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scales of Depression (HAMD-17), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Metagenomic sequencing was utilized to identify fecal microbial profiles. Dietary patterns were discerned via factor analysis of a 25-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Logistic regression analysis and mediation analysis were performed to explore the potential links between gut microbiota, dietary patterns, and incident SD.Data on dietary habits were available for 292 participants (mean [SD] age, 22.1 [2.9] years; 216 [73.9 %] female). Logistic regression analysis revealed that dietary patterns Ⅰ (odds ratio [OR], 0.34; 95 % CI, 0.15-0.75) and IV (OR, 0.39; 95 % CI, 0.17-0.86 and OR, 0.39; 95 % CI, 0.18-0.84) were associated with reduced risk of SD. Distinct microbial profiles were observed in young adults with SD, marked by increased microbial diversity and taxonomic alterations.

In the present work, we describe some nutrigenomic effects of dietary fiber, phenolic compounds (plant secondary metabolites), and fatty acids on mental health outcomes, with emphasis on their possible interactions with genetic and epigenetic aspects. Prebiotics, through their effects on the gut microbiota, have been associated with modulation in the neuroendocrine response to stress and the facilitation of the processing of positive emotions. Some of the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms include the serotonin neurotransmitter system (<i>TPH1</i> gene) and the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (inhibition of histone deacetylases). The consumption of phenolic compounds exerts a positive role in neurocognitive domains. The evidence showing the involvement of genetic and epigenetic factors comes mainly from animal models, highlighting the role of epigenetic mechanisms through miRNAs and methyltransferases as well as the effect on the expression of apoptotic-related genes. Long-chain <i>n</i>-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA) have been mainly related to psychotic and mood disorders, but the genetic and epigenetic evidence is scarce. Studies on the genetic and epigenetic basis of these interactions need to be promoted to move towards a precision and personalized approach to medicine.",Nutrients,2024,Mariane Lutz; Pablo R Moya; Sofía Gallorio; Ulises Ríos; Marcelo Arancibia
39029984,Therapeutic potential of CBD in Autism Spectrum Disorder.,"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and interaction, as well as restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior. Despite extensive research, effective pharmacological interventions for ASD remain limited. Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychotomimetic compound of the Cannabis sativa plant, has potential therapeutic effects on several neurological and psychiatric disorders. CBD interacts with the endocannabinoid system, a complex cell-signaling system that plays a crucial role in regulating various physiological processes, maintaining homeostasis, participating in social and behavioral processing, and neuronal development and maturation with great relevance to ASD. Furthermore, preliminary findings from clinical trials indicate that CBD may have a modulatory effect on specific ASD symptoms and comorbidities in humans. Interestingly, emerging evidence suggests that CBD may influence the gut microbiota, with implications for the bidirectional communication between the gut and the central nervous system. CBD is a safe drug with low induction of side effects. As it has a multi-target pharmacological profile, it becomes a candidate compound for treating the central symptoms and comorbidities of ASD.",International review of neurobiology,2024,João F C Pedrazzi; Lucas Hassib; Frederico R Ferreira; Jaime C Hallak; Elaine Del-Bel; José A Crippa
39426041,"Comparative analysis of gut microbiota in major depressive disorder and schizophrenia during hospitalisation - the case-control, post hoc study.","The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between gut microbiota and major depressive disorder (MDD) and schizophrenia (SCZ) by comparing 36 inpatients with these conditions to 29 healthy controls (HC) matched for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI). Individuals with SCZ exhibited greater microbiota richness compared to HC (FDR P(Q)=0.028). Taxonomically, while no significant differences were observed between the microbiota of MDD and SCZ patients in a head-to-head comparison, both patient groups differed significantly when compared to HC. Interestingly, besides common patterns (such as a higher abundance of Erysipelotrichaceae UCG-003 and Streptococcus, and a lower abundance of Lachnospiraceae ND3007 group), unique patterns were exhibited only in MDD (with a higher abundance of Anaerostipes, Q=0.004) or SCZ (with a higher abundance of Sutterella, Q=0.001, and a lower abundance of Clostridium sensu stricto 1, Q=0.002). The Random Forest algorithm identified Ruminococcus torques group, Lachnospiraceae UCG-001, and Erysipelotrichaceae UCG-003 as highly discriminative features for both SCZ and MDD, while Suturella and Holdemania were unique features for SZC, and Lachnospiraceae genus CAG-56 and Anaerostipes for MDD. Additionally, between 50 % and 60 % of the differentially abundant taxa were found among the top 10 influential features in the RF models. In conclusion, while no significant differences were found between the microbiota of MDD and SCZ patients, distinct microbial patterns were found in each group when compared to HC. The study did not confirm universal microbial biomarkers reported in other studies but showed that the observed differences concern the bacteria associated with inflammation, the production of short chain fatty acids (SCFA), and the synthesis of metabolites linked to mental health (lactic acid, gamma-aminobutyric acid - GABA). The application of machine learning holds promise for further understanding the complex relationship between microbiota and these psychiatric disorders. The observed results should be treated with caution due to the limitations of this study (mainly sample size), therefore further researches under standardized environmental conditions with consistent analytical and bioinformatics approaches are warranted.",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2024,Agata Misera; Mariusz Kaczmarczyk; Igor Łoniewski; Paweł Liśkiewicz; Konrad Podsiadło; Błażej Misiak; Karolina Skonieczna-Żydecka; Jerzy Samochowiec
38983862,Current landscape of fecal microbiota transplantation in treating depression.,"Depression, projected to be the predominant contributor to the global disease burden, is a complex condition with diverse symptoms including mood disturbances and cognitive impairments. Traditional treatments such as medication and psychotherapy often fall short, prompting the pursuit of alternative interventions. Recent research has highlighted the significant role of gut microbiota in mental health, influencing emotional and neural regulation. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), the infusion of fecal matter from a healthy donor into the gut of a patient, emerges as a promising strategy to ameliorate depressive symptoms by restoring gut microbial balance. The microbial-gut-brain (MGB) axis represents a critical pathway through which to potentially rectify dysbiosis and modulate neuropsychiatric outcomes. Preclinical studies reveal that FMT can enhance neurochemicals and reduce inflammatory markers, thereby alleviating depressive behaviors. Moreover, FMT has shown promise in clinical settings, improving gastrointestinal symptoms and overall quality of life in patients with depression. The review highlights the role of the gut-brain axis in depression and the need for further research to validate the long-term safety and efficacy of FMT, identify specific therapeutic microbial strains, and develop targeted microbial modulation strategies. Advancing our understanding of FMT could revolutionize depression treatment, shifting the paradigm toward microbiome-targeting therapies.",Frontiers in immunology,2024,Qi Zhang; Yajun Bi; Boyu Zhang; Qiong Jiang; Chao Kam Mou; Lelin Lei; Yibo Deng; Yutong Li; Jing Yu; Wei Liu; Jinzhu Zhao
39015337,Investigations of microbiota composition and neuroactive pathways in association with symptoms of stress and depression in a cohort of healthy women.,"Despite mounting evidence of gut-brain involvement in psychiatric conditions, functional data remain limited, and analyses of other microbial niches, such as the vaginal microbiota, are lacking in relation to mental health. This aim of this study was to investigate if the connections between the gut microbiome and mental health observed in populations with a clinical diagnosis of mental illness extend to healthy women experiencing stress and depressive symptoms. Additionally, this study examined the functional pathways of the gut microbiota according to the levels of psychological symptoms. Furthermore, the study aimed to explore potential correlations between the vaginal microbiome and mental health parameters in young women without psychiatric diagnoses.In this cross-sectional study, 160 healthy Danish women (aged 18-40 years) filled out questionnaires with validated scales measuring symptoms of stress and depression and frequency of dietary intake. Fecal and vaginal microbiota samples were collected at the beginning of the menstrual cycle and vaginal samples were also collected at cycle day 8-12 and 18-22. Shotgun metagenomic profiling of the gut and vaginal microbiome was performed. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) was used for functional profiling and 56 Gut Brain Modules were analyzed in the fecal samples.The relative abundance in the gut of the genera <i>Escherichia</i>, <i>Parabacteroides</i>, and <i>Shigella</i> was higher in women with elevated depressive symptoms. Women with high perceived stress showed a tendency of increased abundance of <i>Escherichia</i>, <i>Shigella</i>, and <i>Blautia</i>. Amongst others, the potentially pathogenic genera, Escherichia and Shigella correlate with alterations in the neuroactive pathways such as the glutamatergic, GABAeric, dopaminergic, and Kynurenine pathways. Vaginosis symptoms were more prevalent in women reporting high levels of stress and depressive symptoms.The findings of this study support the concept of a microbiota-associated effect on the neuroactive pathways even in healthy young women. This suggest, that targeting the gut microbiome could be a promising approach for future psychiatric interventions.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2024,Zahra Bashir; Luisa W Hugerth; Maria Christine Krog; Stefanie Prast-Nielsen; Gabriella Edfeldt; Fredrik Boulund; Simon Rønnow Schacht; Inge Tetens; Lars Engstrand; Ina Schuppe-Koistinen; Emma Fransson; Henriette Svarre Nielsen
39134099,Contrasting the pharmacokinetic performance and gut microbiota effects of an amorphous solid dispersion and lipid nanoemulsion for a poorly water-soluble anti-psychotic.,"Increasing attention is being afforded to understanding the bidirectional relationship that exists between oral drugs and the gut microbiota. Often overlooked, however, is the impact that pharmaceutical excipients exert on the gut microbiota. Subsequently, in this study, we contrasted the pharmacokinetic performance and gut microbiota interactions between two commonly employed formulations for poorly soluble compounds, namely 1) an amorphous solid dispersion (ASD) stabilised by poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) K-30, and 2) a lipid nanoemulsion (LNE) comprised of medium chain glycerides and lecithin. The poorly soluble antipsychotic, lurasidone, was formulated with ASD and LNE due to its rate-limiting dissolution, poor oral bioavailability, and significant food effect. Both the ASD and LNE were shown to facilitate lurasidone supersaturation within in vitro dissolution studies simulating the gastrointestinal environment. This translated into profound improvements in oral pharmacokinetics in rats, with the ASD and LNE exerting comparable ∼ 2.5-fold improvements in lurasidone bioavailability, compared to the pure drug. The oral formulations imparted contrasting effects on the gut microbiota, with the LNE depleting the richness and abundance of the microbial ecosystem, as evidenced through reductions in alpha diversity (Chao1 index) and operational taxonomical units (OTUs). In contrast, the ASD exerted a 'gut neutral' effect, whereby a mild enrichment of alpha diversity and OTUs was observed. Importantly, this suggests that ASDs are effective solubility-enhancing formulations that can be used without comprising the integrity of the gut microbiota - an integral consideration in the treatment of mental health disorders, such as schizophrenia, due to the role of the gut microbiota in regulating mood and cognition.",European journal of pharmaceutics and biopharmaceutics : official journal of Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Pharmazeutische Verfahrenstechnik e.V,2024,Tahlia R Meola; Srinivas Kamath; Aurelia S Elz; Clive A Prestidge; Anthony Wignall; Paul Joyce
39021622,Baseline gut microbiota profiles affect treatment response in patients with depression.,"The role of the gut microbiota in the pathophysiology of depression has been explored in numerous studies, which have confirmed that the baseline gut microbial profiles of patients with depression differ from those of healthy individuals. The gut microbiome affects metabolic activity in the immune and central nervous systems and regulates intestinal ecology through the neuroendocrine system. Additionally, baseline changes in the gut microbiota differed among patients with depression who demonstrated varying treatment response. Currently, probiotics are an emerging treatment for depression; however, the efficacy of modulating the gut microbiota in the treatment of depression remains uncertain. Additionally, the mechanisms by which changes in the gut microbiota affect treatment response in patients with depression remain unclear. In this review, we aimed to summarize the differences in the baseline gut microbiota between the remission and non-remission groups after antidepressant therapy. Additionally, we summarized the possible mechanisms that may contribute to antidepressant resistance through the effects of the gut microbiome on the immune and nervous systems, various enzymes, bioaccumulation, and blood-brain barrier, and provide a basis for treating depression by targeting the gut microbiota.",Frontiers in microbiology,2024,Yingjing Xie; Hanwen Zhu; Yanling Yuan; Xuan Guan; Qinglian Xie; Zaiquan Dong
39203794,Effects of Physical Exercise on the Microbiota in Irritable Bowel Syndrome.,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a prevalent functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, and constipation. Recent studies have underscored the significant role of the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of IBS. Physical exercise, as a non-pharmacological intervention, has been proposed to alleviate IBS symptoms by modulating the gut microbiota. Aerobic exercise, such as running, swimming, and cycling, has been shown to enhance the diversity and abundance of beneficial gut bacteria, including Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. These bacteria produce short-chain fatty acids that possess anti-inflammatory properties and support gut barrier integrity. Studies involving IBS patients participating in structured aerobic exercise programs have reported significant improvements in their gut microbiota's composition and diversity, alongside an alleviation of symptoms like abdominal pain and bloating. Additionally, exercise positively influences mental health by reducing stress and improving mood, which can further relieve IBS symptoms via the gut-brain axis. Long-term exercise interventions provide sustained benefits, maintaining the gut microbiota's diversity and stability, supporting immune functions, and reducing systemic inflammation. However, exercise programs must be tailored to individual needs to avoid exacerbating IBS symptoms. Personalized exercise plans starting with low-to-moderate intensity and gradually increasing in intensity can maximize the benefits and minimize risks. This review examines the impact of various types and intensities of physical exercise on the gut microbiota in IBS patients, highlighting the need for further studies to explore optimal exercise protocols. Future research should include larger sample sizes, longer follow-up periods, and examine the synergistic effects of exercise and other lifestyle modifications. Integrating physical exercise into comprehensive IBS management plans can enhance symptom control and improve patients' quality of life.",Nutrients,2024,Chunpeng Li; Jianmin Li; Qiaorui Zhou; Can Wang; Jiahui Hu; Chang Liu
39065244,Gut Microbiota Composition Is Causally Linked to Multiple Sclerosis: A Mendelian Randomization Analysis.,"Accumulating evidence links the microbial communities inhabiting the gut to the pathophysiological processes underlying multiple sclerosis (MS). However, most studies on the microbiome in MS are correlative in nature, thus being at risk of confounding and reverse causality. Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses allow the estimation of the causal relationship between a risk factor and an outcome of interest using genetic variants as proxies for environmental exposures. Here, we performed a two-sample MR to assess the causality between the gut microbiome and MS. We extracted genetic instruments from summary statistics from three large genome-wide association studies (GWASs) on the gut microbiome (18,340, 8959, and 7738 subjects). The exposure data were derived from the latest GWAS on MS susceptibility (47,429 patients and 68,374 controls). We pinpointed several microbial strains whose abundance is linked with enhanced MS risk (<i>Actinobacteria</i> class, <i>Bifidobacteriaceae</i> family, <i>Lactobacillus</i> genus) or protection (<i>Prevotella</i> spp., <i>Lachnospiranaceae</i> genus, <i>Negativibacillus</i> genus). The largest risk effect was seen for <i>Ruminococcus Torques</i> (OR, 2.89, 95% C.I. 1.67-5, <i>p</i> = 1.51 × 10<sup>-4</sup>), while <i>Akkermansia municiphila</i> emerged as strongly protective (OR, 0.43, 95% C.I. 0.32-0.57, <i>p</i> = 1.37 × 10<sup>-8</sup>). Our findings support a causal relationship between the gut microbiome and MS susceptibility, reinforcing the relevance of the microbiome-gut-brain axis in disease etiology, opening wider perspectives on host-environmental interactions for MS prevention.",Microorganisms,2024,Valeria Zancan; Martina Nasello; Rachele Bigi; Roberta Reniè; Maria Chiara Buscarinu; Rosella Mechelli; Giovanni Ristori; Marco Salvetti; Gianmarco Bellucci
38903788,"Investigating the effects of radiation, T cell depletion, and bone marrow transplantation on murine gut microbiota.","Microbiome research has gained much attention in recent years as the importance of gut microbiota in regulating host health becomes increasingly evident. However, the impact of radiation on the microbiota in the murine bone marrow transplantation model is still poorly understood. In this paper, we present key findings from our study on how radiation, followed by bone marrow transplantation with or without T cell depletion, impacts the microbiota in the ileum and caecum. Our findings show that radiation has different effects on the microbiota of the two intestinal regions, with the caecum showing increased interindividual variation, suggesting an impaired ability of the host to regulate microbial symbionts, consistent with the Anna Karenina principle. Additionally, we observed changes in the ileum composition, including an increase in bacterial taxa that are important modulators of host health, such as <i>Akkermansia</i> and <i>Faecalibaculum</i>. In contrast, radiation in the caecum was associated with an increased abundance of several common commensal taxa in the gut, including <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> and <i>Bacteroides</i>. Finally, we found that high doses of radiation had more substantial effects on the caecal microbiota of the T-cell-depleted group than that of the non-T-cell-depleted group. Overall, our results contribute to a better understanding of the complex relationship between radiation and the gut microbiota in the context of bone marrow transplantation and highlight the importance of considering different intestinal regions when studying microbiome responses to environmental stressors.",Frontiers in microbiology,2024,Jakub Kreisinger; James Dooley; Kailash Singh; Dagmar Čížková; Lucie Schmiedová; Barbora Bendová; Adrian Liston; Alena Moudra
38875919,Antibiotic exposure and depression incidence: A cohort study of the Korean population.,"Recent research highlights the crucial role of the gut-brain axis in understanding depression etiologies. While burgeoning studies suggest an association between disruptions in gut microbiota and the development of depression, limited longitudinal studies have investigated this link. To address this gap, we conducted a retrospective cohort study using National Health Insurance Service-Health Screening Cohort (NHIS-HEALS) data in South Korea, involving 199,144 individuals aged 40-79. We examined the impact of cumulative antibiotic exposure (2004-2008) on subsequent depression incidence (2009-2013) by conducting Cox proportional hazards regressions. Our findings show an increasing depression risk with extended antibiotic exposure after adjusting for comorbidities and behavioral covariates. A broader antibiotic spectrum was associated with a higher depression risk. These trends persisted after adjusting for the original antibiotic indications. In conclusion, our study highlights the duration-dependent association between antibiotic exposure and increased depression risk, offering insights into depression etiologies and relevant novel therapeutic tools, and advocating for heightened antibiotic stewardship considering their impact on mental health.",Psychiatry research,2024,Jaewon Lee; Sun Jae Park; Seulggie Choi; Jooyoung Chang; Young Jun Park; Seogsong Jeong; Joung Sik Son; Gyeongsil Lee; Joseph C Ahn; Jihoon Andrew Kim; Sang Min Park
39125364,Maternal Fiber Intake and Perinatal Depression and Anxiety.,"(1) Background: Dietary fiber can significantly alter gut microbiota composition. The role of the gut microbiome in the Gut-Brain Axis and modulation of neuropsychiatric disease is increasingly recognized. The role of antenatal diet, particularly fiber intake, in mitigating maternal mental health disorders remains unexplored. The objective of this review is to investigate the association between maternal fiber intake and perinatal depression and anxiety (PDA). (2) Methods: A literature review of PubMed and Google Scholar was conducted using appropriate keyword/MeSH terms for pregnancy, diet, fiber, and mental health. Observational and clinical trials published between 2015 and 2021 were included and data pertaining to dietary patterns (DP), food intake, mental health, and demographic data were extracted. The top three fiber-containing food groups (FG) per study were identified using a sum rank scoring system of fiber per 100 g and fiber per serving size. The consumption of these top three fiber FGs was then ranked for each dietary pattern/group. Mental health outcomes for each study were simplified into three categories of improved, no change, and worsened. The relationship between top three fiber FGs consumed within each DP and mental health outcomes was analyzed using Spearman's correlation. (3) Results: Thirteen of fifty-two studies met the inclusion criteria. Ten (76.9%) studies assessed DPs (seven examined depression only, two examined depression and anxiety, and one examined anxiety only). Seven (53.9%) studies reported at least one significant positive relationship between mental health outcomes and DPs while three reported at least one negative outcome. Three (23.1%) studies compared intake of different food groups between depressed and non-depressed groups. In studies of DPs, the average consumption ranking of the top three fiber FGs bore a significant inverse association with mental health outcomes [r = -0.419 (95%CI: -0.672--0.078)] <i>p</i> = 0.015. In studies comparing the intake of different FGs between depressed and non-depressed groups, the consumption of top-ranking fiber foods was higher in the non-depressed groups, but significantly higher in four of the ten high fiber FGs. (4) Conclusions: This study reframes findings from previously published studies of maternal diet and mental health outcomes to focus on fiber intake specifically, using a fiber ranking system. A significant correlation between lower intake of fiber and poorer mental health outcomes warrants further investigation in future studies.",Nutrients,2024,Neda Ebrahimi; Tiffany Turner; Faith Gallant; Abinaa Chandrakumar; Roshni Kohli; Rebecca Lester; Victoria Forte; Kieran Cooley
38748594,Microbiota transplantation in restoring cesarean-related infant dysbiosis: a new frontier.,"C-section is crucial in reducing maternal and neonatal mortality when medically indicated, but one of its side effects could be the disruption of vertical transmission of maternal-infant microbiota during delivery, potentially leading to gut dysbiosis and increased disease risks in C-section infants. To address such dysbiosis, it seems reasonable to supplement ""what is missing"" during C-section procedure. This idea has prompted several clinical trials, including proof-of-concept, investigating interventions like vaginal microbial seeding, oral administration of maternal vaginal microbes and even oral administration of maternal fecal materials. Hereby, we have summarized these trials to help understand the current state of these researches, highlighting the predominantly pilot nature of most of these studies and emphasizing the need for well-designed studies with larger sample to guide evidence-based medicine in the future.",Gut microbes,2024,Sina Liu; Xiaoxia Luo; Lepeng Zhou; Ri-Hua Xie; Yan He
39187187,Is anxiety and depression transmissible? Depressed mother rats transmit anxiety- and depression-like phenotypes to cohabited rat pups through gut microbiota assimilation.,"This study is to investigate the role of gut microbiota transmission in the development of anxiety/depression in offspring exposed to maternal depression.Offspring rats were cohabitated with their depressed mother or father rats (which exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)) for 2, 4, and 6 months, the anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, and interaction/caring activities between mother/father and their pups were detected. The gut microbiota composition and its relationship with behaviors were analyzed. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) was performed to establish the gut microbiota of depressed/normal mother rats in the offspring rats to further confirm the role of ""depressive gut microbiota"" transmission in mediating the anxiety/depression in the pups.Anxiety and depression phenotypes can be transmitted from depressed mother rats to their cohabited offspring. Frequent interactions and gut microbiota assimilation were observed between rat mothers and their pups. Remodeling of the gut microbiota in pups by FMT could induce or attenuate anxiety- and depression-like phenotypes depending on the origin of the fecal microbiota. By comparison, the pups cohabiting with depressed father rats exhibited milder anxiety and depression.These data together support that depressed mothers can transmit anxiety/depression to their pups through gut microbiota assimilation, which is related to frequent interactions. Our study reinforces the significance of mental health of mothers in preventing the occurrence of childhood anxiety and depression, and pointing out the possibility of remodeling intestinal microbiota as an effective therapeutic approach for treating anxiety/depression in children.",Journal of affective disorders,2024,Huiliang Zhang; Hui Wei; Xuan Qin; Haiyue Song; Mengzhe Yang; Lun Zhang; Yi Liu; Zhuoqun Wang; Yiren Zhang; Yiwen Lai; Jiayu Yang; Yu Chen; Zhongshan Chen; Ji Zeng; Xiaochuan Wang; Rong Liu
39339649,Nutraceutical Capsules LL1 and Silymarin Supplementation Act on Mood and Sleep Quality Perception by Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis: A Pilot Clinical Study.,"Stress, unhealthy lifestyle, and sleep disturbance worsen cognitive function in mood disorders, prompting a rise in the development of integrative health approaches. The recent investigations in the gut-brain axis field highlight the strong interplay among microbiota, inflammation, and mental health. Thus, this study aimed to investigate a new nutraceutical formulation comprising prebiotics, minerals, and silymarin's impact on microbiota, inflammation, mood, and sleep quality. The study evaluated the LL1 + silymarin capsule supplementation over 180 days in overweight adults. We analyzed the fecal gut microbiota using partial 16S rRNA sequences, measured cytokine expression via CBA, collected anthropometric data, quality of life, and sleep questionnaire responses, and obtained plasma samples for metabolic and hormonal analysis at baseline (T0) and 180 days (T180) post-supplementation. Our findings revealed significant reshaping in gut microbiota composition at the phylum, genus, and species levels, especially in the butyrate-producer bacteria post-supplementation. These changes in gut microbiota were linked to enhancements in sleep quality, mood perception, cytokine expression, and anthropometric measures which microbiota-derived short-chain fatty acids might enhance. The supplementation tested in this study seems to be able to improve microbiota composition, reflecting anthropometrics and inflammation, as well as sleep quality and mood improvement.",Nutrients,2024,Aline Boveto Santamarina; Victor Nehmi Filho; Jéssica Alves de Freitas; Lucas Augusto Moysés Franco; Joyce Vanessa Fonseca; Roberta Cristina Martins; José Antônio Orellana Turri; Bruna Fernanda Rio Branco da Silva; Arianne Fagotti Gusmão; Eloísa Helena Ribeiro Olivieri; José Pinhata Otoch; Ana Flávia Marçal Pessoa
39121711,The gut-microbiome in adult Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder - A Meta-analysis.,"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental condition that persists into adulthood in the majority of individuals. While the gut-microbiome seems to be relevant for ADHD, the few publications on gut-microbial alterations in ADHD are inconsistent, in the investigated phenotypes, sequencing method/region, preprocessing, statistical approaches, and findings. To identify gut-microbiome alterations in adult ADHD, robust across studies and statistical approaches, we harmonized bioinformatic pipelines and analyses of raw 16S rRNA sequencing data from four adult ADHD case-control studies (N<sub>ADHD</sub>=312, N<sub>NoADHD</sub>=305). We investigated diversity and differential abundance of selected genera (logistic regression and ANOVA-like Differential Expression tool), corrected for age and sex, and meta-analyzed the study results. Converging results were investigated for association with hyperactive/impulsive and inattentive symptoms across all participants. Beta diversity was associated with ADHD diagnosis but showed significant heterogeneity between cohorts, despite harmonized analyses. Several genera were robustly associated with adult ADHD; e.g., Ruminococcus_torques_group (LogOdds=0.17, p<sub>fdr</sub>=4.42 × 10<sup>-2</sup>), which was more abundant in adults with ADHD, and Eubacterium_xylanophilum_group (LogOdds= -0.12, p<sub>fdr</sub>=6.9 × 10<sup>-3</sup>), which was less abundant in ADHD. Ruminococcus_torques_group was further associated with hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms and Eisenbergiella with inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity (p<sub>fdr</sub><0.05). The literature points towards a role of these genera in inflammatory processes. Irreproducible results in the field of gut-microbiota research, due to between study heterogeneity and small sample sizes, stress the need for meta-analytic approaches and large sample sizes. While we robustly identified genera associated with adult ADHD, that might overall be considered beneficial or risk-conferring, functional studies are needed to shed light on these properties.",European neuropsychopharmacology : the journal of the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology,2024,Babette Jakobi; Priscilla Vlaming; Danique Mulder; Marta Ribases; Vanesa Richarte; Josep Antoni Ramos-Quiroga; Indira Tendolkar; Philip van Eijndhoven; Janna N Vrijsen; Jan Buitelaar; Barbara Franke; Martine Hoogman; Mirjam Bloemendaal; Alejandro Arias-Vasquez
39195546,Alterations in Vagal Tone Are Associated with Changes in the Gut Microbiota of Adults with Anxiety and Depression Symptoms: Analysis of Fecal Metabolite Profiles.,"Accumulating evidence suggests that interactions between the brain and gut microbiota significantly impact brain function and mental health. In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether young, healthy adults without psychiatric diagnoses exhibit differences in metabolic stool and microbiota profiles based on depression/anxiety scores and heart rate variability (HRV) parameters. Untargeted nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabolomics was used to identify fecal metabolic profiles. Results were subjected to multivariate analysis through principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and the metabolites were identified through VIP score. Metabolites separating asymptomatic and symptomatic groups were acetate, valine, and glutamate, followed by sugar regions, glutamine, acetone, valerate, and acetoacetate. The main metabolites identified in high vagal tone (HVT) and low vagal tone (LVT) groups were acetate, valerate, and glutamate, followed by propionate and butyrate. In addition to the metabolites identified by the PLS-DA test, significant differences in aspartate, sarcosine, malate, and methionine were observed between the groups. Levels of acetoacetate were higher in both symptomatic and LVT groups. Valerate levels were significantly increased in the symptomatic group, while isovalerate, propionate, glutamate, and acetone levels were significantly increased in the LVT group. Furthermore, distinct abundance between groups was only confirmed for the Firmicutes phylum. Differences between participants with high and low vagal tone suggest that certain metabolites are involved in communication between the vagus nerve and the brain.",Metabolites,2024,Laura Pasqualette; Tatiana Kelly da Silva Fidalgo; Liana Bastos Freitas-Fernandes; Gabriela Guerra Leal Souza; Luís Aureliano Imbiriba; Leandro Araujo Lobo; Eliane Volchan; Regina Maria Cavalcanti Pilotto Domingues; Ana Paula Valente; Karla Rodrigues Miranda
39247907,Modifications in the Composition of the Gut Microbiota in Rats Induced by Chronic Sleep Deprivation: Potential Relation to Mental Disorders.,"Sleep deprivation(SD) has numerous negative effects on mental health. A growing body of research has confirmed the implication of gut microbiota in mental disorders. However, the specific modifications in mammalian gut microbiota following SD exhibit variations across different studies.Male specific-pathogen-free Wistar rats were given a modified multiple-platform exposure for 7 days of SD. Fecal samples were obtained from the control and SD groups both at baseline and after 7 days of SD. We utilized 16S rDNA gene sequencing to investigate the gut microbial composition and functional pathways in rats.Analysis of the microbiota composition revealed a significant change in gut microbial composition after chronic SD, especially at the phylum level. The relative abundances of <i>p_Firmicutes, g_Romboutsia</i>, and <i>g_Enterococcus</i> increased, whereas those of <i>p_Bacteroidetes, p_Verrucomicrobia, p_Fusobacteria, g_Akkermansia</i>, and <i>g_Cetobacterium</i> decreased in animals after chronic SD compared with controls or animals before SD. The ratio of <i>Firmicutes</i> to <i>Bacteroidetes</i> exhibited an increase following SD. The relative abundance of gut microbiota related to the functional pathways of GABAergic and glutamatergic synapses was observed to be diminished in rats following SD compared to pre-SD.Collectively, these findings suggest that chronic SD causes significant alterations in both the structural composition and functional pathways of the gut microbiome. Further researches are necessary to investigate the chronological and causal connections among SD, the gut microbiota and mental disorders.",Nature and science of sleep,2024,Li-Ming Zheng; Yan Li
38852801,Levilactobacillus brevis SG031 modulates mood-related behaviors and attenuates stress-related sleep disturbance and autonomic dysfunction via gut microbiota modulation in Wistar-Kyoto rats.,"The probiotic bacterium Levilactobacillus brevis (L. brevis) has been proposed as a potential solution to manage mood disorders and alleviate stress-related sleep disturbances. However, the underlying mechanisms of its effects have not been fully elucidated. The aim of this study was to explore the impact and potential mechanisms of L. brevis SG031 supplementation on anxiety/depression-like behaviors and stress-induced changes in sleep patterns and sleep-related autonomic function.Male Wistar-Kyoto rats were administered low, medium, or high doses of L. brevis SG031 or a vehicle for 4 weeks, followed by behavioral tests to evaluate anxiety and depression. After an additional 2 weeks of SG031 or vehicle administration, a cage-exchange paradigm was performed with 24-hour physiological signal measurements under different stress conditions. Fecal samples were collected to construct a 16S rRNA library and assess fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs).High-dose SG031 administration yielded reduced depression-like responses and enhanced social interaction in behavioral tests. It also exhibited a protective effect against stress-induced sleep disturbance characterized by decreased sleep time, increased awake time, and autonomic dysfunction during sleep. Fecal examination indicated that high-dose SG031 administration exerted beneficial effects on gut health by maintaining the gut microbial abundance, preserving stability of the microbial composition, and enriching the gut with SCFAs, which were associated with improvements in sleep and autonomic function.These findings collectively underscore the multifaceted potential of SG031 in addressing mental health and stress-related sleep challenges through the modulation of the gut microbiota.",Life sciences,2024,Chieh-Wen Chen; Hung-Chang Chen; Sheng-Chieh She; Chun-Ting Lai; Wei-Jen Chen; Terry B J Kuo; Cheryl C H Yang
38959253,Perturbations in gut microbiota composition in schizophrenia.,"Schizophrenia is a severe, complex and long-term psychiatric disorder with unclear etiology. Gut microbes influence the central nervous system via the gut-brain axis. Consequently, investigations of the relationship between gut microbes and schizophrenia are warranted. This study involved 29 patients with schizophrenia and 30 age-matched normal controls. After 16S rRNA gene sequencing and whole-genome shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we analyzed microbial diversity, composition, and function. According to 16S rRNA and metagenomic gene sequencing results, patients with schizophrenia had higher abundances of Clostridium and Megasphaera. Functional analysis showed that sphingolipid, phosphonates and phosphinates, as well as glutamine metabolism were associated with the occurrence and development of schizophrenia. Our data suggest that the gut microbiota exerts an effect on patients with schizophrenia, providing valuable insights into the potential regulation of in the context of this disorder.",PloS one,2024,YiMeng Wang; SiGuo Bi; XiaoLong Li; YuTao Zhong; DongDong Qi
39331265,Identification of hsa-miR-193a-5p-SURF4 axis related to the gut microbiota-metabolites- cytokines in lung cancer based on Mendelian randomization study and bioinformatics analysis.,"Lung cancer is a significant disease that affects people's physical and mental health. Currently, the treatment outcomes still do not meet clinical needs, and the causes of the disease are still unclear, therefore further exploration is needed.We analyzed the exposure factors of lung cancer, including gut microbiota, serum metabolites, and cytokines, through Mendelian randomization studies and bioinformatics analysis. We identified common SNPs and performed gene annotation, leading to the discovery of the key gene SURF4, which may affect the onset of lung cancer. We validated the oncogenic function and mechanism of SURF4 through public data analysis using GO and KEGG, and constructed a ceRNA network, revealing the lung cancer oncogenic pathway involving lncRNA/pseudogene-microRNA-SURF4.We first conducted a Mendelian randomization analysis on 418 gut microbiota, 1400 serum metabolites, and 41 cytokines in relation to lung cancer. We found that 16 gut microbiota, 29 serum metabolites, and 2 cytokines were closely associated with lung cancer. Further comparison of all differential SNPs revealed that rs550057 on chromosome 9 was a common SNP among these three exposure factors, indicating its crucial role in lung cancer formation. Through gene functional annotation using R language, we found that the expression of 15 genes, including SURF4, was influenced by rs550057. By querying these 15 genes from public databases for their differential expression and prognosis in lung cancer, we found significant differences in SURF4, MED22, and RPL7A. Furthermore, by querying the expression and correlation coefficients of upstream microRNAs of these three genes through the starBase website, we found that hsa-miR-193a-5p-SURF4 had the most significant effect on lung cancer. Through GO and KEGG analysis of SURF4-related genes, we identified the molecular pathways associated metabolic synthesis and microbial infection related to the promotion of lung cancer by SURF4. This validated the results of the previous Mendelian randomization study. Furthermore, we constructed a ceRNA network for SURF4 and identified two upstream differentially expressed pseudogenes and nine lncRNAs, confirming the functionality of the pseudogene/lncRNA-microRNA-SUFR4 pathway.In summary, we have elucidated the regulatory role of the pseudogene/lncRNA-microRNA-SUFR4 pathway in the progression of lung cancer, combining the research hotspots of gut microbiota-serum metabolites-cytokines. We have also confirmed the pathway and mechanism through SURF4 and its related genes promoting lung cancer formation. This may provide effective therapeutic methods for lung cancer and serve as a potential prognostic marker.",Discover oncology,2024,Jie Yu; Sibo Meng; Tiantian Xuan; Zhanmei Wang; Linli Qu; Fangli Cao; Jiaxin Li
39458509,Gut-Brain Axis and Psychopathology: Exploring the Impact of Diet with a Focus on the Low-FODMAP Approach.,"The gut-brain axis (GBA) is a bidirectional communication network connecting the central nervous system with the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, influencing both mental and physical health. Recent research has underscored the significant role of diet in modulating this axis, with attention to how specific dietary patterns can impact anxiety and depression, particularly when linked to disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBIs), like intestinal bowel syndrome (IBS).This narrative review examines the effects of specific diet regimens on the GBA and its potential role in managing psychopathology, focusing on anxiety and depression, IBS, and the low-FODMAP diet. We conducted a search on PubMed and MEDLINE by combining the following key terms: ""Gut-Brain Axis"", ""Irritable Bowel Syndrome"", ""Low FODMAP diet"", ""Mediterranean Diet"", ""Psychopathology"", ""Anxiety and Depression"", and ""Gut Microbiota"". We applied the following filters: ""Clinical Trials"", ""Randomized Controlled Trials"", ""Reviews"", ""Meta-Analyses"", and ""Systematic Reviews"". In total, 59 papers were included.Low-FODMAP diet, originally developed to alleviate GI symptoms in IBS, may also positively influence mental health by modulating the GBA and improving the gut microbiota (GM) composition. New insights suggest that combining the low-FODMAP diet with the Mediterranean diet could offer a synergistic effect, enhancing both GI and psychological therapeutic outcomes.Understanding the complex interactions between diet, the GM, and mental health opens new avenues for holistic approaches to managing psychopathology, particularly when linked to GI symptoms.",Nutrients,2024,Emanuela Ribichini; Giulia Scalese; Chiara Mocci; Carola Severi
39291634,"A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel trial to test the effect of inulin supplementation on migraine headache characteristics, quality of life and mental health symptoms in women with migraine.","Migraine is a complex neurovascular disorder characterized by recurrent headache attacks that are often accompanied by symptoms such as vomiting, nausea, and sensitivity to sound or light. Preventing migraine attacks is highly important. Recent research has indicated that alterations in gut microbiota may influence the underlying mechanisms of migraines. This study aimed to investigate the effects of inulin supplementation on migraine headache characteristics, quality of life (QOL), and mental health symptoms in women with migraines. In a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial, 80 women with migraines aged 20 to 50 years were randomly assigned to receive 10 g day<sup>-1</sup> of inulin or a placebo supplement for 12 weeks. Severity, frequency, and duration of migraine attacks, as well as depression, anxiety, stress, QOL, and headache impact test (HIT-6) scores, were examined at the start of the study and after 12 weeks of intervention. In this study, the primary outcome focused on the frequency of headache attacks, while secondary outcomes encompassed the duration and severity of headache attacks, QOL, and mental health. There was a significant reduction in severity (-1.95 <i>vs.</i> -0.84, <i>P</i> = 0.004), duration (-6.95 <i>vs.</i> -2.05, <i>P</i> = 0.023), frequency (-2.09 <i>vs.</i> -0.37, <i>P</i> < 0.001), and HIT-6 score (-10.30 <i>vs.</i> -6.52, <i>P</i> < 0.023) in the inulin group compared with the control. Inulin supplementation improved mental health symptoms, including depression (-4.47 <i>vs.</i> -1.45, <i>P</i> < 0.001), anxiety (-4.37 <i>vs.</i> -0.70, <i>P</i> < 0.001), and stress (-4.40 <i>vs.</i> -1.50, <i>P</i> < 0.001). However, no significant difference was observed between the two groups regarding changes in QOL score. This study provides evidence supporting the beneficial effects of inulin supplement on migraine symptoms and mental health status in women with migraines.

Dietary fiber pectins and prebiotics have emerged as key modulators of gut microbiota composition and function, offering potential therapeutic implications for promoting gut health and preventing intestinal inflammatory diseases. In this review, we explore the modulation of gut microbiota by dietary fiber pectins and prebiotics in infants and adults. We begin with an overview of the gut microbiota composition and function in different age groups, highlighting the factors in shaping microbial communities in both age groups, especially the effect of diet. We then delve into the impact of dietary fiber pectins and prebiotics on gut microbiota composition and function, examining their effects on digestive health, intestinal barrier integrity, immune function, metabolic health, and mental health across different life stages. We further compare how aging affects the gut function and immune system, and we discuss the main health outcomes associated with dietary fiber intake and prebiotics, including the impact on digestive health, improvement in immune function, improvement in cholesterol and glucose metabolism, weight management, mental health, and prevention of diseases. Finally, we highlight the challenges and future directions for research. By advancing the understanding of gut microbiota dynamics and translating scientific insights into clinical practice, it could harness the full potential of dietary fiber pectins and prebiotics to optimize gut health, improve overall well-being across the lifespan, and increase longevity.",Food & function,2024,Janaina Lombello Santos Donadio; João Paulo Fabi
38928361,A Narrative Review of Intestinal Microbiota's Impact on Migraine with Psychopathologies.,"Migraine is a common and debilitating neurological disorder characterized by the recurrent attack of pulsating headaches typically localized on one side of the head associated with other disabling symptoms, such as nausea, increased sensitivity to light, sound and smell and mood changes. Various clinical factors, including the excessive use of migraine medication, inadequate acute treatment and stressful events, can contribute to the worsening of the condition, which may evolve to chronic migraine, that is, a headache present on >15 days/month for at least 3 months. Chronic migraine is frequently associated with various comorbidities, including anxiety and mood disorders, particularly depression, which complicate the prognosis, response to treatment and overall clinical outcomes. Emerging research indicates a connection between alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota and mental health conditions, particularly anxiety and depression, which are considered disorders of the gut-brain axis. This underscores the potential of modulating the gut microbiota as a new avenue for managing these conditions. In this context, it is interesting to investigate whether migraine, particularly in its chronic form, exhibits a dysbiosis profile similar to that observed in individuals with anxiety and depression. This could pave the way for interventions aimed at modulating the gut microbiota for treating difficult-to-manage migraines.",International journal of molecular sciences,2024,Miriam Francavilla; Sara Facchetti; Chiara Demartini; Anna Maria Zanaboni; Chiara Amoroso; Sara Bottiroli; Cristina Tassorelli; Rosaria Greco

In addition, we applied the R programming language version 4.0.3 and Stata 15.1 software for data analysis. We also implemented the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), funnel plot analysis, Egger's test, and Begg's test to assess the risk of bias.In this study, a total of 328 studies were identified through the literature search. Among them, 117 duplicate studies were removed, and 202 studies were excluded based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Finally, 9 studies were included in the analysis, involving a total of 216 patients with esophageal carcinoma and 352 healthy controls. Four studies provided Chao1 index for quantitative consolidation (ES = 637.41, 95% CI: 549.16 to 725.66, p = 0.000, I<sup>2</sup> = 98.2%).

Seven studies [26,27,29,30,32] reported the Shannon index for quantitative consolidation (ES = 4.38, 95% CI: 3.95 to 4.81, p = 0.000, I<sup>2</sup> = 99%). At the phylum level, the abundance of Bacteroidetes(ES = 37.8, 95% CI: 25.75 to 49.85, p = 0.000, I2 = 87.2%) and Proteobacteria(ES = 7.48, 95% CI: 5.02 to 8.85, p = 0.04, I<sup>2</sup> = 2.4%) have statistical difference between ESCC and HC. There was no significant difference between ESCC and HC in the abundance of genera(p>0.05).This observational meta-analysis revealed that changes in the GM were correlated with esophageal carcinoma, and variations in some advantageous GM might involve regional differences.

38974216,Vitamin-mediated interaction between the gut microbiome and mitochondria in depression: A systematic review-based integrated perspective.,"Depression is one of the world's most prevalent mental disorders and its treatment remains suboptimal. Depression is a systemic disease with highly complex biological mechanisms. Emerging evidence points towards the involvement of mitochondria, microbiome and vitamins in its pathophysiology. Mitochondrial energy production was shown to be lowered in patients with depression. Mitochondrial energy production depends on vitamins, which are available from food, but are also synthesized by the gut microbiota. Several studies reported altered vitamin levels as well as changes in the gut microbiome composition and its vitamin metabolism in patients with depression. Therefore, the question of a connection between mitochondria and gut microbiome and vitamins influencing the mental health arises. This review aims to systematically investigate a combination of the topics - depression, mitochondria, microbiome, and vitamins - to generate an overview of a novel yet extremely complex and interconnected research field. A systematic literature search yielded 34 articles, and the results were summarized and bundled to develop this new integrative perspective on mitochondrial function mediated by the microbiome and microbiome-derived vitamins in depression. Furthermore, by discussing the research gaps this review aims to encourage innovative research approaches to better understand the biology of depression, which could result in optimized therapeutic approaches.","Brain, behavior, & immunity - health",2024,Ellen Bisle; Suchithra Varadarajan; Iris-Tatjana Kolassa
38756585,The gut-brain-axis: A positive relationship between gut microbial dysbiosis and glioblastoma brain tumour.,"The glioblastoma brain tumour (GBM) stands out as the most aggressive and resistant-to-treatment malignancy. Nevertheless, the gut-brain connection plays a pivotal role in influencing the growth and activation of the central nervous system. In this particular investigation, we aimed to assess and characterize the gut microbial ecosystem in GBM patients, both quantitatively and qualitatively. We collected faecal samples from 15 healthy volunteers and 25 GBM patients. To delve into the microbial content, we employed PCR-DGGE, targeting the V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene, and conducted qPCR to measure the levels of crucial intestinal bacteria. For a more in-depth analysis, high-throughput sequencing was performed on a selection of 20 random faecal samples (10 from healthy individuals and 10 from GBM patients), targeting the V3+V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Our findings from examining the richness and diversity of the gut microbiota unveiled that GBM patients exhibited significantly higher microbial diversity compared to healthy individuals. At the phylum level, Proteobacteria saw a significant increase, while <i>Firmicutes</i> experienced a noteworthy decrease in the GBM group. Moving down to the family level, we observed significantly elevated levels of <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i>, <i>Bacteroidaceae</i>, and <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> in GBM patients, while levels of <i>Veillonellaceae</i>, <i>Rikenellaceae</i>, and <i>Prevotellaceae</i> were notably lower. Delving into genera statistics, we noted a substantial increase in the abundance of <i>Parasutterella</i>, <i>Escherichia-Shigella</i>, and <i>Bacteroides</i>, alongside significantly lower levels of <i>Ruminococcus 2</i>, <i>Faecalibacterium</i>, and <i>Prevotella_9</i> in the GBM group compared to the control group. Furthermore, when examining specific species, we found a significant increase in <i>Bacteroides vulgatus</i> and <i>Escherichia coli</i> in the GBM group. These observations collectively indicate a marked dysbiosis in the gut microbial composition of GBM patients. Additionally, the GBM group exhibited notably higher levels of alpha diversity when compared to the control group. This increase in diversity suggests a significant bacterial overgrowth in the gut of GBM patients in contrast to the controls. As a result, this research opens up potential avenues to gain a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms, pathways, and potential treatments for GBM, stemming from the significant implications of gut microbial dysbiosis in these patients.",Heliyon,2024,Hafiz Muhammad Ishaq; Riffat Yasin; Imran Shair Mohammad; Yang Fan; Huan Li; Muhammad Shahzad; Jiru Xu
38792361,"The Potential Role of the Ketogenic Diet in Serious Mental Illness: Current Evidence, Safety, and Practical Advice.","The ketogenic diet (KD) is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet that mimics the physiological state of fasting. The potential therapeutic effects in many chronic conditions have led to the gaining popularity of the KD. The KD has been demonstrated to alleviate inflammation and oxidative stress, modulate the gut microbiota community, and improve metabolic health markers. The modification of these factors has been a potential therapeutic target in serious mental illness (SMI): bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia. The number of clinical trials assessing the effect of the KD on SMI is still limited. Preliminary research, predominantly case studies, suggests potential therapeutic effects, including weight gain reduction, improved carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, decrease in disease-related symptoms, increased energy and quality of life, and, in some cases, changes in pharmacotherapy (reduction in number or dosage of medication). However, these findings necessitate further investigation through larger-scale clinical trials. Initiation of the KD should occur in a hospital setting and with strict care of a physician and dietitian due to potential side effects of the diet and the possibility of exacerbating adverse effects of pharmacotherapy. An increasing number of ongoing studies examining the KD's effect on mental disorders highlights its potential role in the adjunctive treatment of SMI.",Journal of clinical medicine,2024,Joanna Rog; Zuzanna Wingralek; Katarzyna Nowak; Monika Grudzień; Arkadiusz Grunwald; Agnieszka Banaszek; Hanna Karakula-Juchnowicz
39158758,The Antidepressant- and Anxiolytic-Like Effects of the Phosphodiesterase Type-5 Inhibitor Tadalafil are Associated with the Modulation of the Gut-Brain Axis During CNS Autoimmunity.,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a debilitating disease that severely affects the central nervous system (CNS). Apart from neurological symptoms, it is also characterized by neuropsychiatric comorbidities, such as anxiety and depression. Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE5Is) such as Sildenafil and Tadalafil have been shown to possess antidepressant-like effects, but the mechanisms underpinning such effects are not fully characterized. To address this question, we used the EAE model of MS, behavioral tests, immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, western blot, and 16 S rRNA sequencing. Here, we showed that depressive-like behavior in Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice is due to neuroinflammation, reduced synaptic plasticity, dysfunction in glutamatergic neurotransmission, glucocorticoid receptor (GR) resistance, increased blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and immune cell infiltration to the CNS, as well as inflammation, increased intestinal permeability, and immune cell infiltration in the distal colon. Furthermore, 16 S rRNA sequencing revealed that behavioral dysfunction in EAE mice is associated with changes in the gut microbiota, such as an increased abundance of Firmicutes and Saccharibacteria and a reduction in Proteobacteria, Parabacteroides, and Desulfovibrio. Moreover, we detected an increased abundance of Erysipelotrichaceae and Desulfovibrionaceae and a reduced abundance of Lactobacillus johnsonii. Surprisingly, we showed that Tadalafil likely exerts antidepressant-like effects by targeting all aforementioned disease aspects. In conclusion, our work demonstrated that anxiety- and depressive-like behavior in EAE is associated with a plethora of neuroimmune and gut microbiota-mediated mechanisms and that Tadalafil exerts antidepressant-like effects probably by targeting these mechanisms. Harnessing the knowledge of these mechanisms of action of Tadalafil is important to pave the way for future clinical trials with depressed patients.",Journal of neuroimmune pharmacology : the official journal of the Society on NeuroImmune Pharmacology,2024,Eduardo Duarte-Silva; Alice Chevrollier Oriá; Ingrid Prata Mendonça; Igor Henrique Rodrigues Paiva; Klyvia Leuthier Dos Santos; Amanda Juliana Sales; José Roberto Botelho de Souza; Michael Maes; Sven Guenther Meuth; Christina Alves Peixoto
39303815,Metformin reprograms tryptophan metabolism via gut microbiome-derived bile acid metabolites to ameliorate depression-Like behaviors in mice.,"As an adjunct therapy, metformin enhances the efficacy of conventional antidepressant medications. However, its mode of action remains unclear. Here, metformin was found to ameliorate depression-like behaviors in mice exposed to chronic restraint stress (CRS) by normalizing the dysbiotic gut microbiome. Fecal transplants from metformin-treated mice ameliorated depressive behaviors in stressed mice. Microbiome profiling revealed that Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila), in particular, was markedly increased in the gut by metformin and that oral administration of this species alone was sufficient to reverse CRS-induced depressive behaviors and normalize aberrant stress-induced 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) metabolism in the brain and gut. Untargeted metabolomic profiling further identified the bile acid metabolites taurocholate and deoxycholic acid as direct A. muciniphila-derived molecules that are, individually, sufficient to rescue the CRS-induced impaired 5-HT metabolism and depression-like behaviors. Thus, we report metformin reprograms 5-HT metabolism via microbiome-brain interactions to mitigate depressive syndromes, providing novel insights into gut microbiota-derived bile acids as potential therapeutic candidates for depressive mood disorders from bench to bedside.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2024,Xiaoxian Xie; Wenwen Li; Ze Xiong; Junyu Xu; Tailin Liao; Lei Sun; Haoshen Xu; Mengya Zhang; Jiafeng Zhou; Wenzheng Xiong; Zhengwei Fu; Zezhi Li; Qi Han; Donghong Cui; Daniel C Anthony
38944290,Splenic nerve denervation attenuates depression-like behaviors in Chrna7 knock-out mice via the spleen-gut-brain axis.,"Growing evidence highlights the role of the spleen-brain axis in inflammation-associated depression. The α7-subtype of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7 nAChR, encoded by the Chrna7 gene) is implicated in systemic inflammation, with Chrna7 knock-out (KO) mice displaying depression-like behaviors. Yet, the influence of spleen nerve on depression-like behaviors in these KO mice remains to be elucidated.We investigated the effects of the splenic nerve denervation (SND) on depression-like behaviors, the protein expression in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and the gut microbiota composition in Chrna7 KO mice.SND markedly alleviated depression-like behaviors and the reduced expression of GluA1 and postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95) in the PFC of Chrna7 KO mice. No changes in α-diversity of gut microbiota were noted among the control, KO + sham, and KO + SND groups. However, significant differences in β-diversity of gut microbiota were noted among the groups. Notable alterations in various microbiota (e.g., Fluviimonas_pallidilutea, Maribacter_arcticus, Parvibacter_caecicola) and plasma metabolites (e.g., helicide, N-acetyl-L-aspartic acid, α-D-galactose 1-phosphate, choline, creatine) were observed between KO + sham and KO + SND groups. Interestingly, correlations were found between the relative abundance of specific microbiota and other outcomes, including synaptic proteins, metabolites and behavioral data.The underlying mechanisms remain to be fully understood.Our findings indicate that the splenic nerve contributes to depression-like phenotypes in Chrna7 KO mice via the spleen-gut-brain axis.",Journal of affective disorders,2024,Yong Yang; Akifumi Eguchi; Chisato Mori; Kenji Hashimoto
39199404,The Influence of Cecal Microbiota Transplantation on Chicken Injurious Behavior: Perspective in Human Neuropsychiatric Research.,"Numerous studies have evidenced that neuropsychiatric disorders (mental illness and emotional disturbances) with aggression (or violence) pose a significant challenge to public health and contribute to a substantial economic burden worldwide. Especially, social disorganization (or social inequality) associated with childhood adversity has long-lasting effects on mental health, increasing the risk of developing neuropsychiatric disorders. Intestinal bacteria, functionally as an endocrine organ and a second brain, release various immunomodulators and bioactive compounds directly or indirectly regulating a host's physiological and behavioral homeostasis. Under various social challenges, stress-induced dysbiosis increases gut permeability causes serial reactions: releasing neurotoxic compounds, leading to neuroinflammation and neuronal injury, and eventually neuropsychiatric disorders associated with aggressive, violent, or impulsive behavior in humans and various animals via a complex bidirectional communication of the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis. The dysregulation of the MGB axis has also been recognized as one of the reasons for the prevalence of social stress-induced injurious behaviors (feather pecking, aggression, and cannibalistic pecking) in chickens. However, existing knowledge of preventing and treating these disorders in both humans and chickens is not well understood. In previous studies, we developed a non-mammal model in an abnormal behavioral investigation by rationalizing the effects of gut microbiota on injurious behaviors in chickens. Based on our earlier success, the perspective article outlines the possibility of reducing stress-induced injurious behaviors in chickens through modifying gut microbiota via cecal microbiota transplantation, with the potential for providing a biotherapeutic rationale for preventing injurious behaviors among individuals with mental disorders via restoring gut microbiota diversity and function.",Biomolecules,2024,Yuechi Fu; Heng-Wei Cheng

Several in vitro and human studies were performed to assess their physiological potential, to find strains having psychotropic activity in humans, and to elucidate the metabolic pathways involved. In our previous in vitro study, we identified two strains Levilactobacillus brevis P30021 and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum P30025, able to produce GABA and acetylcholine, being promising candidates to provide an effect on mood and cognitive performance.To investigate the effects of probiotics in the alleviation on the cognitive performance of moderately stressed healthy adults. Secondary outcomes were related to mood improvement, production of GABA, glutamate, acetylcholine, and choline and modification of the microbiota composition.A 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study investigated the effects of a probiotic formulation (Levilactobacillus brevis P30021 and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum P30025) on psychological, memory, and cognition parameters in 44 (Probiotic = 44, Placebo = 43) adults with a mean age of 29 ± 5.7 years old by CogState Battery test. Subjects-inclusion criteria was a mild-moderate (18.7 ± 4.06) stress upon diagnosis using the DASS-42 questionnaire.Probiotic treatment had no effect on subjective stress measures. The probiotic formulation showed a significant beneficial effect on depressive symptoms by reducing cognitive reactivity to sad mood (p = 0.034). Rumination significantly improved after intake of the probiotic (p = 0.006), suggesting a potential benefit in reducing the negative cognitive effects associated with depression and improving overall mental health. When stratifying the treated subjects according to the response, we found an increase in the abundance of the probiotic genera in the gut microbiota of positive responders (p = 0.009 for Lactiplantibacillus and p = 0.004 for L.brevis). No relevant correlations were observed between the neurotransmitter concentration in the faecal sample, scores of LEIDS, DASS-42, and cognitive tests.We highlight the potential of this probiotic preparation to act as psycobiotics for the relief of negative mood feelings. The assessment of the psychotropic effects of dietary interventions in human participants has many challenges. Further interventional studies investigating the effect of these psychobiotic bacteria in populations with stressed-related disorders are required including longer period of intervention and larger sample size in order to verify the effects of the treatment on further stress-related indicators.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2024,Melania Casertano; Matthijs Dekker; Vincenzo Valentino; Francesca De Filippis; Vincenzo Fogliano; Danilo Ercolini
39386896,Unveiling the gut microbiota blueprint of schizophrenia: a multilevel omics approach.,"Schizophrenia is a persistent incurable mental disorder and is characterized by the manifestation of negative emotions and behaviors with anxiety and depression, fear and insecurity, self-harm and social withdrawal. The intricate molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain largely elusive. Accumulating evidence points towards the gut microbiota exerting an influence on brain function via the gut-brain axis, potentially contributing to the development of schizophrenia. Therefore, the objective of this study is to delineate the gut microbial composition and metabolic profile of fecal samples from individuals with schizophrenia.Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene sequencing were employed to analyze fecal metabolites and gut microbiota profiles in a cohort of 29 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and 30 normal controls. The microbial composition of fecal samples was determined through the 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and microbial α-diversity and β-diversity indices were calculated. Principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were performed to analyze the distribution of samples. The metabolites and gut microbiota exhibiting differential expression were identified through the application of biological variance criteria. Co-occurrence analysis of bacteria and metabolites was conducted using the spearman's rank correlation coefficient and visualized in a circular layout with the Cytoscape software.The findings of the study indicated a lack of substantial evidence supporting significant disparities in α-diversity and β-diversity between individuals with schizophrenia and normal controls. In terms of metabolomics, a discernible pattern in sample distribution between the two groups was observed. Our analysis has revealed 30 bacterial species and 45 fecal metabolites that exhibited notable differences in abundance between individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia and normal controls. These alterations in multilevel omics have led to the development of a co-expression network associated with schizophrenia. The perturbed microbial genes and fecal metabolites consistently demonstrated associations with amino acid and lipid metabolism, which play essential roles in regulating the central nervous system.Our results offered profound insights into the impact of imbalanced gut microbiota and metabolism on brain function in individuals with schizophrenia.",Frontiers in psychiatry,2024,DongDong Qi; Peng Liu; YiMeng Wang; XuGuang Tai; ShiFa Ma
39364125,Differences in the human gut microbiota with varying depressive symptom severity scores.,"Depression is a prevalent mental health disorder, and its incidence has increased further because of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The gut microbiome has been suggested as a potential target for mental health treatment because of the bidirectional communication system between the brain and gastrointestinal tract, known as the gut-brain axis. We aimed to investigate the relationship between the human gut microbiome and depression screening by analyzing the abundance and types of microbiomes among individuals living in Japan, where mental health awareness and support may differ from those in other countries owing to cultural factors. We used a data-driven approach to evaluate the gut microbiome of participants who underwent commercial gut microbiota testing services and completed a questionnaire survey that included a test for scoring depressive tendencies. Our data analysis results indicated that no significant differences in gut microbiome composition were found among the groups based on their depression screening scores. However, the results also indicated the potential existence of a few differentially abundant bacterial taxa. Specifically, the detected bacterial changes in abundance suggest that the Bifidobacteriaceae, Streptococcaceae, and Veillonellaceae families are candidates for differentially abundant bacteria. Our findings should contribute to the growing body of research on the relationship between gut microbiome and mental health, highlighting the potential of microbiome-based interventions for depression treatment. The limitations of this study include the lack of clear medical information on the participants' diagnoses. Future research could benefit from a larger sample size and more detailed clinical information.","Bioscience of microbiota, food and health",2024,Yuka Masamura; Ryuichi Kubo; Yuki Midorikawa; Natsuko O Shinozaki; Satoshi Watanabe; Sayumi Maekawa; Aya K Takeda; Tazro Ohta

Results indicated that <i>B. breve</i> BB05 supplementation significantly enriched (<i>p</i> < 0.05) the reduced gut microbial diversity caused by diarrhea. Diarrhea resulted in notable alterations in gut microbiota composition, as exhibited by elevated <i>Collinsella</i> and <i>Streptococcus</i>, alongside substantially decreased <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, <i>Bacteroides</i>, and <i>Prevotella</i>, while <i>B. breve</i> BB05 supplementation partially restored the compromised gut microbiota at both the phylum and genus levels, particularly by increasing <i>Bifidobacterium</i> and <i>Roseburia</i> (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Importantly, questionnaire results suggested that <i>B. breve</i> BB05 administration achieved superior efficacy in relieving diarrhea symptoms and the associated anxiety and depression in college students. An increased fecal concentration of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) was also observed in the probiotic group, while Acetylcholine (ACH), Epinephrine (EPI), and Noradrenaline/Norepinephrine (NANE) reduced, revealing the potential of <i>B. breve</i> BB05 in alleviating anxiety and depression via modulating the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Furthermore, correlation analysis suggested that the altered microbiota and fecal neurotransmitters were closely associated with the mental symptoms. These results endorse <i>B. breve</i> BB05 intervention as a promising and innovative approach to alleviate both diarrhea and mental health conditions among college students.",Nutrients,2024,Yufan Wang; Yufei Wang; Kunpeng Ding; Yuhan Liu; Dingming Liu; Weijun Chen; Xinyi Zhang; Chuanlin Luo; Hongyan Zhang; Tangchang Xu; Tingtao Chen
38963982,Jianpi Jiedu decoction suppresses colorectal cancer growth by inhibiting M2 polarization of TAMs through the tryptophan metabolism-AhR pathway.,"Traditional Chinese medicine, JianpiJiedu decoction (JPJDF), has been utilized in colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment for over forty years. The potential of JPJDF to inhibit CRC through modulation of intestinal microbiota and their metabolites remains uncertain.This study aims to further investigate the therapeutic mechanisms of JPJDF in CRC.CAC mouse models were developed using azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). Intestinal tissues and contents underwent 16S rRNA gene sequencing and untargeted metabolomics analysis. Serum levels of IL-1β and TNF-α were measured using ELISA. Immunohistochemistry was utilized to assess the expression of Ki67, ZO-1, Occludin, CD68, and CD206. Furthermore, western blotting was performed to evaluate the protein expression of AhR and NF-κB.JPJDF inhibited colorectal tumourigenesis in AOM/DSS treated mice, while also suppressing tumor cell proliferation and upregulating the expression of tight junction proteins. The results of 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis revealed that JPJDF altered intestinal microbiota composition by increasing the abundance of beneficial bacteria. Additionally, JPJDF reduced tryptophan metabolites, effectively alleviating inflammation and significantly restoring intestinal barrier function in CAC mice. Molecular biology experiments confirmed that JPJDF suppressed the expression levels of AhR and M2-type tumor-associated macrophages, thereby promoting anti-tumor immunity and exerting inhibitory effects on CAC growth.JPJDF can regulate the tryptophan metabolism-AhR pathway by modulating the gut microbiota, reducing intestinal inflammation, improving intestinal barrier function, enhancing anti-tumor immunity, and effectively inhibiting CAC growth.",International immunopharmacology,2024,Yonglong Chang; Qinling Ou; Xuhui Zhou; Kechao Nie; Piao Zheng; Jinhui Liu; Linzi Chen; Haixia Yan; Duanyang Guo; Sifang Zhang
39201866,Contributions of Artificial Intelligence to Analysis of Gut Microbiota in Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Systematic Review.,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder whose etiology is not known today, but everything indicates that it is multifactorial. For example, genetic and epigenetic factors seem to be involved in the etiology of ASD. In recent years, there has been an increase in studies on the implications of gut microbiota (GM) on the behavior of children with ASD given that dysbiosis in GM may trigger the onset, development and progression of ASD through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. At the same time, significant progress has occurred in the development of artificial intelligence (AI).The aim of the present study was to perform a systematic review of articles using AI to analyze GM in individuals with ASD. In line with the PRISMA model, 12 articles using AI to analyze GM in ASD were selected.Outcomes reveal that the majority of relevant studies on this topic have been conducted in China (33.3%) and Italy (25%), followed by the Netherlands (16.6%), Mexico (16.6%) and South Korea (8.3%).The bacteria <i>Bifidobacterium</i> is the most relevant biomarker with regard to ASD. Although AI provides a very promising approach to data analysis, caution is needed to avoid the over-interpretation of preliminary findings. A first step must be taken to analyze GM in a representative general population and ASD samples in order to obtain a GM standard according to age, sex and country. Thus, more work is required to bridge the gap between AI in mental health research and clinical care in ASD.","Children (Basel, Switzerland)",2024,Pau Climent-Pérez; Agustín Ernesto Martínez-González; Pedro Andreo-Martínez
38857554,Dietary sulforaphane glucosinolate mitigates depression-like behaviors in mice with hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury: A role of the gut-liver-brain axis.,"Nutrition has been increasingly recognized for its use in mental health. Depression is commonly observed in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD). Building on our recent findings of depression-like behaviors in mice with hepatic ischemia/reperfusion (HI/R) injury, mediated by the gut-liver-brain axis, this study explored the potential influence of dietary sulforaphane glucosinolate (SGS) on these behaviors. Behavioral assessments for depression-like behaviors were conducted 7 days post either sham or HI/R injury surgery. Dietary intake of SGS significantly prevented splenomegaly, systemic inflammation, depression-like behaviors, and downregulation of synaptic proteins in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of HI/R-injured mice. Through 16S rRNA analysis and untargeted metabolomic analyses, distinct bacterial profiles and metabolites were identified between control + HI/R group and SGS + HI/R group. Correlations were observed between the relative abundance of gut microbiota and both behavioral outcomes and blood metabolites. These findings suggest that SGS intake could mitigate depression-like phenotypes in mice with HI/R injury, potentially through the gut-liver-brain axis. Additionally, SGS, found in crucial vegetables like broccoli, could offer prophylactic nutritional benefits for depression in patients with CLD.",Journal of psychiatric research,2024,Yong Yang; Akifumi Eguchi; Chisato Mori; Kenji Hashimoto
39078446,Exploring the Potential of Probiotics and Prebiotics in Major Depression: From Molecular Function to Clinical Therapy.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) represents a complex and challenging mental health condition with multifaceted etiology. Recent research exploring the gut-brain axis has shed light on the potential influence of gut microbiota on mental health, offering novel avenues for therapeutic intervention. This paper reviews current evidence on the role of prebiotics and probiotics in the context of MDD treatment. Clinical studies assessing the effects of prebiotic and probiotic interventions have demonstrated promising results, showcasing improvements in depression symptoms and metabolic parameters in certain populations. Notably, prebiotics and probiotics have shown the capacity to modulate inflammatory markers, cortisol levels, and neurotransmitter pathways linked to MDD. However, existing research presents varied outcomes, underscoring the need for further investigation into specific microbial strains, dosage optimization, and long-term effects. Future research should aim at refining personalized interventions, elucidating mechanisms of action, and establishing standardized protocols to integrate these interventions into clinical practice. While prebiotics and probiotics offer potential adjunctive therapies for MDD, continued interdisciplinary efforts are vital to harnessing their full therapeutic potential and reshaping the landscape of depression treatment paradigms.",Probiotics and antimicrobial proteins,2024,Xin Yuan; Jianbo Chai; Wenqiang Xu; Yonghou Zhao
39461950,Microbial biomarker discovery in Parkinson's disease through a network-based approach.,"Associations between the gut microbiota and Parkinson's disease (PD) have been widely investigated. However, the replicable biomarkers for PD diagnosis across multiple populations remain elusive. Herein, we performed a meta-analysis to investigate the pivotal role of the gut microbiome in PD and its potential diagnostic implications. Six 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequence datasets from five independent studies were integrated, encompassing 550 PD and 456 healthy control samples. The analysis revealed significant alterations in microbial composition and alpha and beta diversity, emphasizing altered gut microbiota in PD. Specific microbial taxa, including Faecalibacterium, Roseburia, and Coprococcus_2, known as butyrate producers, were notably diminished in PD, potentially contributing to intestinal inflammation. Conversely, genera such as Akkermansia and Bilophila exhibited increased relative abundances. A network-based algorithm called NetMoss was utilized to identify potential biomarkers of PD. Afterwards, a classification model incorporating 11 optimized genera demonstrated high performance. Further functional analyses indicated enrichment in pathways related to neurodegeneration and metabolic pathways. These findings illuminate the intricate relationship between the gut microbiota and PD, offering insights into potential therapeutic interventions and personalized diagnostic strategies.",NPJ Parkinson's disease,2024,Zhe Zhao; Jing Chen; Danhua Zhao; Baoyu Chen; Qi Wang; Yuan Li; Junyi Chen; Chaobo Bai; Xintong Guo; Nan Hu; Bingwei Zhang; Rongsheng Zhao; Junliang Yuan
39200093,Should Pregnant Women Consume Probiotics to Combat Endocrine-Disrupting Chemical-Induced Health Risks to Their Unborn Offspring?,"Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) have become so pervasive in our environment and daily lives that it is impossible to avoid contact with such compounds, including pregnant women seeking to minimize exposures to themselves and their unborn children. Developmental exposure of humans and rodent models to bisphenol A (BPA) and other EDCs is linked to increased anxiogenic behaviors, learning and memory deficits, and decreased socio-sexual behaviors. Prenatal exposure to BPA and other EDCs leads to longstanding and harmful effects on gut microbiota with reductions in beneficial bacteria, i.e., gut dysbiosis, and such microbial changes are linked to host changes in fecal metabolites, including those involved in carbohydrate metabolism and synthesis, and neurobehavioral alterations in adulthood, in particular, social and cognitive deficits. Gut dysbiosis is increasingly being recognized as a key driver of a myriad of diseases, ranging from metabolic, cardiovascular, reproductive, and neurobehavioral disorders via the gut-microbiome-brain axis. Thus, EDCs might induce indirect effects on physical and mental health by acting as microbiome-disrupting chemicals. Findings raise the important question as to whether pregnant women should consume a probiotic supplement to mitigate pernicious effects of EDCs, especially BPA, on themselves and their unborn offspring. Current studies investigating the effects of maternal probiotic supplementation on pregnant women's health and that of their unborn offspring will be reviewed. Data will inform on the potential application of probiotic supplementation to reverse harmful effects of EDCs, especially BPA, in pregnant women unwittingly exposed to these compounds and striving to give their offspring the best start in life.",Biomedicines,2024,Cheryl S Rosenfeld
38959280,Pilot study assessing gut microbial diversity among sexual and gender minority young adults.,"Evidence supports that people identifying as a sexual or gender minority (SGMs) experience minority-related stress resulting from discrimination or expectations of prejudice, and that this is associated with increased mental and physical health problems compared to cisgender heterosexuals. However, the biological mechanisms driving minority-related stress impacts remain unknown, including the role of the gut microbiome. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the relationship between SGM status and gut microbiome health among young adults attending a 4-year university. To this end, a prospective pilot study was completed in the fall and spring semesters of 2021-22. Self-identified SGMs (N = 22) and cisgender-heterosexuals (CIS-HET, N = 43) completed in-person interviews to provide mental health data and demographic information. Nail and saliva samples were collected at the time of interview to quantify chronic and acute cortisol. Stool samples were collected within 48 hours of interview for microbiome analysis. Assessment of the gut microbiota identified a significant reduction in alpha diversity among the SGM group, even when adjusting for mental health outcome. SGM group showed trends for higher abundance of microbes in phylum Bacteroidetes and lower abundance of microbes in phyla Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria compared to the CIS-HET group. These findings support that the gut microbiome could be contributing to negative health effects among the SGM community.",PloS one,2024,Ashley Guy; Shannon McAuliffe; Robbie Cross; Yue Zhang; Richard E Kennedy; Norman R Estes; Samantha Giordano-Mooga; Christine Loyd
39293692,Depletion of the paternal gut microbiome alters sperm small RNAs and impacts offspring physiology and behavior in mice.,"The paternal environment prior to conception has been demonstrated to influence offspring physiology and behavior, with the sperm epigenome (including noncoding RNAs) proposed as a potential facilitator of non-genetic inheritance. Whilst the maternal gut microbiome has been established as an important influence on offspring development, the impact of the paternal gut microbiome on offspring development, health and behavior is largely unknown. Gut microbiota have major influences on immunity, and thus we hypothesized that they may be relevant to paternal immune activation (PIA) modulating epigenetic inheritance in mice. Therefore, male C57BL/6J mice (F0) were orally administered non-absorbable antibiotics via drinking water in order to substantially deplete their gut microbiome. Four weeks after administration of the antibiotics (gut microbiome depletion), F0 male mice were then mated with naïve female mice. The F1 offspring of the microbiome-depleted males had reduced body weight as well as altered gut morphology (shortened colon length). F1 females showed significant alterations in affective behaviors, including measures of anxiety and depressive-like behaviors, indicating altered development. Analysis of small noncoding RNAs in the sperm of F0 mice revealed that gut microbiome depletion is associated with differential expression of 8 different PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), each of which has the potential to modulate the expression of multiple downstream gene targets, and thus influence epigenetic inheritance and offspring development. This study demonstrates that the gut-germline axis influences sperm small RNA profiles and offspring physiology, with specific impacts on offspring affective and/or coping behaviors. These findings may have broader implications for other animal species with comparable gut microbiota, intergenerational epigenetics and developmental biology, including humans.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2024,Bethany A Masson; Pamudika Kiridena; Da Lu; Elizabeth A Kleeman; Sonali N Reisinger; Wendy Qin; William J Davies; Rikeish R Muralitharan; Hamdi A Jama; Simona Antonacci; Francine Z Marques; Carolina Gubert; Anthony J Hannan
39134294,Agmatine modulation of gut-brain axis alleviates dysbiosis-induced depression-like behavior in rats.,"Depression is a global health concern affecting nearly 280 million individuals. It not only imposes a significant burden on economies and healthcare systems but also manifests complex physiological connections and consequences. Agmatine, a putative neuromodulator derived primarily from beneficial gut microbes specially Lactobacillus, has emerged as a potential therapeutic agent for mental health. The microbiota-gut-brain axis is involved in the development of depression through the peripheral nervous system, endocrine system, and immune system and may be a key factor in the effect of agmatine. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the potential mechanism of agmatine in antibiotic-induced dysbiosis and depression-like behavior in rats, focusing on its modulation of the gut-brain axis. Depression-like behavior associated with dysbiosis was induced through a seven-day regimen of the broad-spectrum antibiotic, comprising ampicillin and metronidazole and validated through microbial, biochemical, and behavioral alterations. On day 8, antibiotic-treated rats exhibited loose fecal consistency, altered fecal microbiota, and depression-like behavior in forced swim test. Pro-inflammatory cytokines were elevated, while agmatine and monoamine levels decreased in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Antibiotic administration disrupted tight junction proteins in the ileum, affecting gut architecture. Oral administration of agmatine alone or combined with probiotics significantly reversed antibiotic-induced dysbiosis, restoring gut microbiota and mitigating depression-like behaviors. This intervention also restored neuro-inflammatory markers, increased agmatine and monoamine levels, and preserved gut integrity. The study highlights the regulatory role of endogenous agmatine in the gut-brain axis in broad-spectrum antibiotic induced dysbiosis and associated depression-like behavior.",European journal of pharmacology,2024,Sandip Rahangdale; Pankaj Deshmukh; Shivkumar Sammeta; Manish Aglawe; Mayur Kale; Milind Umekar; Nandkishor Kotagale; Brijesh Taksande
38968876,"A further examination of growth factors, T helper 1 polarization, and the gut microbiome in major depression: Associations with reoccurrence of illness, cognitive functions, suicidal behaviors, and quality of life.","Growth factors, T helper (Th)1 polarization, and the microbiome are involved in the pathophysiology of major depression (MDD). It remains unclear whether the combination of these three pathways could enhance the accuracy of predicting the features of MDD, including recurrence of illness (ROI), suicidal behaviors and the phenome. We measured serum stem cell factor (SCF), stem cell growth factor (SCGF), stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the ratio of serum Th1/Th2 cytokines (zTh1-zTh2), and the abundances of gut microbiome taxa by analyzing stool samples using 16S rDNA sequencing from 32 MDD patients and 37 healthy controls. The results show that serum SCF is significantly lower and VEGF increased in MDD. Adverse childhood experiences (ACE) and ROI are significantly associated with lowered SCF and increasing VEGF. Lifetime and current suicidal behaviors are strongly predicted (63.5%) by an increased VEGF/SCF ratio, Th1 polarization, a gut microbiome enterotype indicating gut dysbiosis, and lowered abundance of Dorea and Faecalobacterium. Around 80.5% of the variance in the phenome's severity is explained by ROI, ACEs, and lowered Parabacteroides distasonis and Clostridium IV abundances. A large part of the variance in health-related quality of life (54.1%) is explained by the VEGF/SCF ratio, Th1 polarization, ACE, and male sex. In conclusion, key features of MDD are largely predicted by the cumulative effects of ACE, Th1 polarization, aberrations in growth factors and the gut microbiome with increased pathobionts but lowered beneficial symbionts.",Journal of psychiatric research,2024,Michael Maes; Bo Zhou; Asara Vasupanrajit; Ketsupar Jirakran; Pavit Klomkliew; Prangwalai Chanchaem; Chavit Tunvirachaisakul; Kitiporn Plaimas; Apichat Suratanee; Jing Li; Abbas F Almulla; Sunchai Payungporn
39316970,Christensenella minuta mitigates behavioral and cardiometabolic hallmarks of social defeat stress.,"Psychological stress during early development and adolescence may increase the risk of psychiatric and cardiometabolic comorbidities in adulthood. The gut microbiota has been associated with mental health problems such as depression and anxiety and with cardiometabolic disease, but the potential role of the gut microbiota in their comorbidity is not well understood. We investigated the effects and mode of action of the intestinal bacterium Christensenella minuta DSM 32891 on stress-induced mental health and cardiometabolic disturbances in a mouse model of social defeat stress. We demonstrate that administered C. minuta alleviates chronic stress-induced depressive, anxiogenic and antisocial behavior. These effects are attributed to the bacterium's ability to modulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which mediates the stress response. This included the oversecretion of corticosterone and the overexpression of its receptors, as well as the metabolism of dopamine (DA) and the expression of its receptors (D1, D2L and D2S). Additionally, C. minuta administration reduced chronically induced inflammation in plasma, spleen and some brain areas, which likely contribute to the recovery of physical and behavioral function. Furthermore, C. minuta administration prevented chronic stress-induced cardiovascular damage by regulating key enzymes mediating liver fibrosis and oxidative stress. Finally, C. minuta increased the abundance of bacteria associated with mental health. Overall, our study highlights the potential of microbiota-directed interventions to alleviate both the physical and mental effects of chronic stress.",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2024,A Agusti; G V Molina-Mendoza; M Tamayo; V Rossini; M C Cenit; C Frances-Cuesta; V Tolosa-Enguis; E M Gómez Del Pulgar; A Flor-Duro; Y Sanz
39422256,A gut-focused perinatal dietary intervention is associated with lower alpha diversity of the infant gut microbiota: results from a randomised controlled trial.,"In experimental models, the prenatal diet influences gut microbiota composition in mothers and offspring; however, it is unclear whether this occurs in humans. We investigated the effects of a gut-focused perinatal dietary intervention on maternal and infant gut microbiota composition four weeks after birth.This randomised controlled trial randomised pregnant women to receive dietary advice as part of standard care, or additionally receive a dietary intervention focused on the Australian Dietary Guidelines and increasing prebiotic and probiotic/fermented food intakes (ACTRN12616000936426). Study assessments occurred from gestation week 26 (baseline) to four weeks postpartum (follow-up). Faecal samples, collected at baseline for mothers, and follow-up for mothers and infants, underwent 16SrRNA sequencing. The primary outcome was a between-group mean difference in infant faecal Shannon index. Secondary outcomes included between-group differences in other microbiota measures, including maternal change from baseline CLR-transformed <i>Prevotella</i> abundance.Forty-four women and 45 infants completed the study. The mean Shannon index of infants in the intervention group was -0.35 (95% CI: -0.64, -0.06, SD: 0.52) units lower than control group infants, corresponding to a medium effect size (Cohen's D: -0.74, 95% CI: -1.34, -0.13). The findings were similar using other metrics of α-diversity. There were no between-group differences in β-diversity, nor any differentially abundant taxa in infants. The intervention increased abundances of the genus <i>Prevotella</i> in mothers compared to controls.This gut-focused perinatal dietary intervention was associated with differences in the maternal and infant gut microbiota composition.

38993577,"Ageing, Cognitive Decline, and Effects of Physical Exercise: Complexities, and Considerations from Animal Models.","In our ageing global population, the cognitive decline associated with dementia and neurodegenerative diseases represents a major healthcare problem. To date, there are no effective treatments for age-related cognitive impairment, thus preventative strategies are urgently required. Physical exercise is gaining traction as a non-pharmacological approach to promote brain health. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN), a unique form of brain plasticity which is necessary for certain cognitive functions declines with age and is enhanced in response to exercise. Accumulating evidence from research in rodents suggests that physical exercise has beneficial effects on cognition through its proneurogenic capabilities. Given ethical and technical limitations in human studies, preclinical research in rodents is crucial for a better understanding of such exercise-induced brain and behavioural changes. In this review, exercise paradigms used in preclinical research are compared. We provide an overview of the effects of different exercise paradigms on age-related cognitive decline from middle-age until older-age. We discuss the relationship between the age-related decrease in AHN and the potential impact of exercise on mitigating this decline. We highlight the emerging literature on the impact of exercise on gut microbiota during ageing and consider the role of the gut-brain axis as a future possible strategy to optimize exercise-enhanced cognitive function. Finally, we propose a guideline for designing optimal exercise protocols in rodent studies, which would inform clinical research and contribute to developing preventative strategies for age-related cognitive decline.","Brain plasticity (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2024,Maria Giovanna Caruso; Sarah Nicolas; Paul J Lucassen; Joram D Mul; Olivia F O'Leary; Yvonne M Nolan
39033825,Core antibiotic resistance genes mediate gut microbiota to intervene in the treatment of major depressive disorder.,"The relationship between depression and gut microbiota remains unclear, but an important role of gut microbiota has been verified. The relationship between gut microbiota and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) may be a potential new explanatory pathway.We collected samples from 63 depressed patients and 30 healthy controls for metagenomic sequencing. The two groups' microbiota characteristics, functional characteristics, and ARG differences were analyzed.We obtained 30 differential KEGG orthologs (KOs) and their producers in 5 genera and 7 species by HUMAnN3. We found 6 KOs from Weissella_cibaria and Lactobacillus_plantaru are potentially coring functional mechanism of gut microbiota. Different metabolites including sphingolipids, pyrans, prenol lipids, and isoflavonoids also showed significance between MDD and HC. We detected 48 significantly different ARGs: 5 ARGs up-regulated and 43 ARGs down-regulated in MDD compared to HC. Based on Cox model results, Three ARGs significantly affected drug efficacy (ARG29, ARG105, and ARG111). Eggerthella, Weissella, and Lactobacillus were correlated with different core ARGs, which indicated different mechanisms in affecting MDD.The present study needs to be replicated in different ethnic groups. At the same time, a larger Chinese cohort study and detailed experimental verification are also the key to further discussion.Our findings suggest that ARGs play a role in the interplay between major depressive disorder and gut microbiota. The role of ARGs should be taken into account when understanding the relationship between depression and gut microbiota.",Journal of affective disorders,2024,Zaiquan Dong; Ke Han; Qinglian Xie; Chunting Lin; Xiaoling Shen; Yanni Hao; Jin Li; Haizhen Xu; Lin He; Tao Yu; Weihong Kuang
39371767,Exploring the Renoprotective Potential of Bioactive Nutraceuticals in Chronic Kidney Disease Progression: A Narrative Review.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a condition that is characterized by progressive loss of kidney function over time. A substantial increase in the burden of CKD is evident globally, attributed to multifactorial conditions like an expanding aging population, rising diabetes and hypertension rates, and more significant exposures to risk factors associated with the environment and lifestyle. Nutraceuticals are substances that are usually considered a food or an active part of a food that provides medical or health benefits, including the prevention and treatment of a disease. The aim is to review the positive role of nutraceuticals in managing CKD. A narrative review is generated, extracting the papers from databases like Web of Science, Scopus, ScienceDirect, ResearchGate, and PubMed. Animal and human trials focusing on the effect of different nutraceuticals on the initial stage of kidney disease, i.e., stages 1, 2, and 3 of CKD, were included. The review's outcome is understanding the effectiveness of nutraceuticals that have shown positive results in CKD conditions. Active compounds include ubiquinone, curcumin, nitrates, nitrites, lycopene, and resveratrol. These bioactive components are also beneficial for other comorbid conditions like diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular conditions that have an eminent adverse effect on CKD. Lycopene, coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), resveratrol, curcumin, and flavonoids have positively impacted CKD complications. Nutraceuticals hold great promise for individuals with CKD in the coming years, offering diverse potential benefits. These include delivering vital antioxidant and anti-inflammatory support to alleviate oxidative stress and inflammation, helping to regulate blood pressure and lipid levels for improved cardiovascular health, promoting optimal renal function to sustain kidney health, assisting in maintaining electrolyte balance, warding off complications, influencing gut microbiota for enhanced digestive well-being, and ultimately elevating the overall quality of life, for those managing CKD.",Cureus,2024,Anindita Ghosh; Arti Muley; Sakshi Bhat; Archana Ainapure
38863592,The effect of prebiotic and probiotic food consumption on anxiety severity: a nationwide study in Korea.,"Over the past decade, research has reported that diet and gut health affect anxiety symptoms through changes in the gut microbiota. Therefore, the introduction of prebiotic and probiotic food favorable for the intestinal microbiota is necessary to improve the mental health of the host. The purpose of this study was to examine the contribution of prebiotic and probiotic foods to lowering anxiety symptoms using a large, nationwide population-based database.The study population included 4,317 individuals 19 to 64 years of age who participated in the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES VII-3, 2019-2021). A food frequency questionnaire was used to evaluate prebiotic and probiotic food consumption. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment 7-item scale (GAD-7) assessed the severity of anxiety symptoms. The effect of prebiotic and probiotic food consumption on anxiety severity was analyzed using multiple logistic regression.Anxiety symptom severity was significantly lower in the highest prebiotic and/or probiotic food consumption tertiles compared to the lowest food consumption tertile. We also found a sex difference in the odds ratio for anxiety symptoms. The consumption of prebiotic food was significantly associated with the highest odds of anxiety among both men and women. However, probiotic food had a significant beneficial effect on lowering anxiety symptoms in men but not in women.Our finding suggests that prebiotic and probiotic food consumption might confer a beneficial influence on anxiety symptoms. Further research is required for a deeper understanding into the mechanisms of the positive effects of prebiotics and probiotics on anxiety.",Frontiers in nutrition,2024,Hyejin Tae; Tae-Suk Kim
38979127,Washed microbiota transplantation improves sleep quality in patients with sleep disorder by the gut-brain axis.,"The clinical impact of washed microbiota transplantation (WMT) from healthy donors in sleep disorder (SD) patients is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effect of WMT in SD patients.The clinical data were collected from patients with different indications receiving 1-3 courses of WMT, divided into two groups by 7 points of PSQI scale. The score of PQSI and SF-36 scale was used to assess the improvement in sleep quality and life quality among patients with sleep disorders following WMT. Finally, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was performed on fecal samples of patients with sleep disorders before and after WMT.WMT significantly improved sleep quality in patients with sleep disorder in the short and medium term. WMT significantly improved sleep latency, sleep time and total score in the short term. WMT significantly improved sleep quality and total score in the medium term. In terms of sleep quality and sleep latency, the improvement value also increased with the increase of treatment course, and the improvement effect of multiple treatment course was better than that of single and double treatment course. In the total score, the improvement effect of double and multiple treatment was better than that of single treatment. WMT also improved quality of life in the sleep disorder group. WMT significantly improved general health, vitality, social function and mental health in the short term. WMT significantly improved role-physical, general health, vitality, and mental health in the medium term. WMT regulated the disturbed gut microbiota in patients with sleep disorders. In the normal sleep group, WMT had no effect on the decline of sleep quality in the short, medium and long term, and had an improving effect on the quality of life.WMT could significantly improve sleep quality and life quality in patients with sleep disorders with no adverse events. The improvement in sleep quality resulting from WMT could lead to an overall enhancement in life quality. WMT could be a potentially effective treatment for patients with sleep disorders by regulating the gut microbiota.",Frontiers in neuroscience,2024,Hongxin He; Manqing Li; Yifan Qiu; Zhiqing Wu; Lei Wu
39360531,The Mechanisms and Quality Markers of Anti-rheumatoid Arthritis of Traditional Chinese Medicine.,"RA is a recurrent autoimmune disease that has significant adverse effects on the physical and mental health of patients. Traditional Chinese medicine has shown significant advantages in the prevention and treatment of RA. Numerous clinical and experimental studies have confirmed that traditional Chinese medicine components have clear therapeutic effects and minimal adverse reactions in treating RA. The research on traditional Chinese medicine for the prevention and treatment of RA has become a hot topic in the field of autoimmune diseases.The related references about the mechanisms and Q-markers of anti-RA of traditional Chinese medicine in this review were collected from Willy, SpringLink, Web of Science, Elsevier, PubMed, SciFinder, Scopus, ACS publications, Baidu Scholar, Google Scholar, and CNKI.The traditional Chinese medicine components such as terpenoids, flavonoids, and alkaloids have significant anti-RA effects, and their mechanisms are mainly to inhibit NF-κB signaling pathway, inhibit the proliferation of RA fibroblasts like synovial cells, and regulate Th1/Th2 cell balance, and so on. Predicting and studying the Q-markers of traditional Chinese medicine anti-RA by plant phylogeny and chemical componentss, traditional medicinal properties, pharmacokinetics, component measurability, correlation between composition and efficacy, and gut microbiota will provide scientific foundations for the research and further development of anti-RA traditional Chinese medicine.The active components of traditional Chinese medicine exhibited the characteristic of multiple mechanisms in the treatment of RA, such as terpenoids had anti-angiogenesis effects, flavonoids had anti-inflammatory and cartilage protective effects, and alkaloids had antiinflammatory and analgesic effects. The proposal of Q-markers for anti-RA provided new research ideas for promoting the development of new drugs for anti-RA and ensuring the safety and effectiveness of clinical medications.",Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening,2024,Mozili Adu; Yongwei Qiu; Qinge Ma; Guoyue Zhong; Jia-Zeng Guo; Rongrui Wei

39126817,"Interplay of yoga, physical activity, and probiotics in irritable bowel syndrome management: A double-blind randomized study.","This study aimed to explore the synergistic impact of online yoga, mindfulness practices, and probiotics on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) by evaluating changes in physical fitness, mental health, and gut microbiota composition.The six-week randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial included 31 IBS patients categorized into three groups: online yoga with probiotics (EP), online yoga with a placebo (EC), and probiotics only (P). Assessments involved physical fitness tests, subjective questionnaires (IBS-QOL, BSRS-5), and gut microbiome analysis.Participants self-collected stool samples and were given a set of questionnaires at baseline and after six weeks of intervention. Their symptoms were measured by changes in the gut microbiota, physical fitness and quality of life, and psychological well-being.The EP group demonstrated improved cardiovascular endurance (P < 0.001) and a significant reduction in Klebsiella bacterial strains (P < 0.05). Both the EP and EC groups exhibited significantly decreased IBS-QOL scores (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively), indicating enhanced quality of life. While BSRS-5 scores decreased in both groups, the reduction was statistically insignificant.Integrating online yoga, mindfulness practices, and probiotics demonstrated comprehensive benefits for IBS patients. This intervention improved physical fitness and mental well-being and positively influenced gut microbiota composition. The study highlights the potential of this multifaceted approach in managing IBS symptoms and enhancing overall health, emphasizing the relevance of the gut-muscle-brain axis in understanding and addressing IBS complexities.Taiwanese Registry of Institutional Review Board IRBHP210009/CH11000259.",Complementary therapies in clinical practice,2024,Wei-Cheng Chao; Jen-Chieh Huang; San-Land Young; Ching-Lin Wu; Jui-Chi Shih; Lun-De Liao; Bill Cheng
38806681,Temperature-dependent differences in mouse gut motility are mediated by stress.,"Researchers have advocated elevating mouse housing temperatures from the conventional ~22 °C to the mouse thermoneutral point of 30 °C to enhance translational research. However, the impact of environmental temperature on mouse gastrointestinal physiology remains largely unexplored. Here we show that mice raised at 22 °C exhibit whole gut transit speed nearly twice as fast as those raised at 30 °C, primarily driven by a threefold increase in colon transit speed. Furthermore, gut microbiota composition differs between the two temperatures but does not dictate temperature-dependent differences in gut motility. Notably, increased stress signals from the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis at 22 °C have a pivotal role in mediating temperature-dependent differences in gut motility. Pharmacological and genetic depletion of the stress hormone corticotropin-releasing hormone slows gut motility in stressed 22 °C mice but has no comparable effect in relatively unstressed 30 °C mice. In conclusion, our findings highlight that colder mouse facility temperatures significantly increase gut motility through hormonal stress pathways.",Lab animal,2024,Alvin Han; Courtney Hudson-Paz; Beatriz G Robinson; Laren Becker; Amanda Jacobson; Julia A Kaltschmidt; Jennifer L Garrison; Ami S Bhatt; Denise M Monack
38931307,Microbiome and Metabolite Analysis Insight into the Potential of Shrimp Head Hydrolysate to Alleviate Depression-like Behaviour in Growth-Period Mice Exposed to Chronic Stress.,"Chronic stress (CS) endangers the physical and mental health of adolescents. Therefore, alleviating and preventing such negative health impacts are a top priority. This study explores the effect of feeding shrimp head hydrolysate (SHH) on gut microbiota, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and neurotransmitters in growing C57BL/6 mice subjected to chronic unpredictable mild stress. Mice in the model group and three SHH groups were exposed to CS for 44 days, distilled water and SHH doses of 0.18, 0.45, 0.90 g/kg·BW were given respectively by gavage daily for 30 days from the 15th day. The results showed that SHH can significantly reverse depression-like behaviour, amino acids degradation, α diversity and β diversity, proportion of Firmicutes and Bacteroidota, abundance of genera such as <i>Muribaculaceae</i>, <i>Bacteroides</i>, <i>Prevotellaceae_UCG-001</i>, <i>Parabacteroides</i> and <i>Alistipes</i>, concentration of five short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), 5-HT and glutamate induced by CS. <i>Muribaculaceae</i> and butyric acid may be a controlled target. This study highlights the potential and broad application of SHH as an active ingredient in food to combat chronic stress damage.",Nutrients,2024,Lianhua Hu; Weichang Ye; Qi Deng; Chen Wang; Jinjin Luo; Ling Huang; Zhijia Fang; Lijun Sun; Ravi Gooneratne
39360283,From gut to brain: unveiling probiotic effects through a neuroimaging perspective-A systematic review of randomized controlled trials.,"The gut-brain axis, a bidirectional communication network between the gastrointestinal system and the brain, significantly influences mental health and behavior. Probiotics, live microorganisms conferring health benefits, have garnered attention for their potential to modulate this axis. However, their effects on brain function through gut microbiota modulation remain controversial. This systematic review examines the effects of probiotics on brain activity and functioning, focusing on randomized controlled trials using both resting-state and task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) methodologies. Studies investigating probiotic effects on brain activity in healthy individuals and clinical populations (i.e., major depressive disorder and irritable bowel syndrome) were identified. In healthy individuals, task-based fMRI studies indicated that probiotics modulate brain activity related to emotional regulation and cognitive processing, particularly in high-order areas such as the amygdala, precuneus, and orbitofrontal cortex. Resting-state fMRI studies revealed changes in connectivity patterns, such as increased activation in the Salience Network and reduced activity in the Default Mode Network. In clinical populations, task-based fMRI studies showed that probiotics could normalize brain function in patients with major depressive disorder and irritable bowel syndrome. Resting-state fMRI studies further suggested improved connectivity in mood-regulating networks, specifically in the subcallosal cortex, amygdala and hippocampus. Despite promising findings, methodological variability and limited sample sizes emphasize the need for rigorous, longitudinal research to clarify the beneficial effects of probiotics on the gut-brain axis and mental health.",Frontiers in nutrition,2024,Annachiara Crocetta; Donato Liloia; Tommaso Costa; Sergio Duca; Franco Cauda; Jordi Manuello
38866914,"Elevated fecal calprotectin is associated with gut microbial dysbiosis, altered serum markers and clinical outcomes in older individuals.","Fecal calprotectin is an established marker of gut inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Elevated levels of fecal calprotectin as well as gut microbial dysbiosis have also been observed in other clinical conditions. However, systemic and multi-omics alterations linked to elevated fecal calprotectin in older individuals remain unclear. This study comprehensively investigated the relationship between fecal calprotectin levels, gut microbiome composition, serum inflammation and targeted metabolomics markers, and relevant lifestyle and medical data in a large sample of older individuals (n = 735; mean age ± SD: 68.7 ± 6.3) from the TREND cohort study. Low (0-50 μg/g; n = 602), moderate (> 50-100 μg/g; n = 64) and high (> 100 μg/g; n = 62) fecal calprotectin groups were stratified. Several pro-inflammatory gut microbial genera were significantly increased and short-chain fatty acid producing genera were decreased in high vs. low calprotectin groups. In serum, IL-17C, CCL19 and the toxic metabolite indoxyl sulfate were increased in high vs. low fecal calprotectin groups. These changes were partially mediated by the gut microbiota. Moreover, the high fecal calprotectin group showed increased BMI and a higher disease prevalence of heart attack and obesity. Our findings contribute to the understanding of fecal calprotectin as a marker of gut dysbiosis and its broader systemic and clinical implications in older individuals.",Scientific reports,2024,Sebastian Heinzel; Jenna Jureczek; Veera Kainulainen; Anni I Nieminen; Ulrike Suenkel; Anna-Katharina von Thaler; Christoph Kaleta; Gerhard W Eschweiler; Kathrin Brockmann; Velma T E Aho; Petri Auvinen; Walter Maetzler; Daniela Berg; Filip Scheperjans
39392025,"Microbiological bases of obsessive‑compulsive disorder - the role of viruses, bacteria, and parasites in the onset and progression of OCD.","Obsessive‑compulsive disorder (OCD) is a current topic of discussion nowadays. OCD presents a variety of different etiologies including environmental, viral, cognitive, or genetic aspects. In this article, we focused on the possible correlation between various infectious diseases as well as generally the relationship between viruses, bacteria, and parasites, and an increased OCD risk. In this narrative review, we analyzed different types of articles found on PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus, as well as the articles of the National Institute of Mental Health. Searching criteria included articles from 1991 till the end of November, research involving human and animal patients (including monkeys and rats), and research published in English. Research showed a relationship between Herpes simplex virus, Rubella virus, Human immunodeficiency virus, Borna disease virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Toxoplasma gondii, streptococcal infections, as well as gut microbiota and increased OCD risk. The possible mechanisms of this relation include neuroinflammation, brain tissue damage, autoimmune processes, and impairments in neurotransmitter levels. Infections caused by Varicella zoster virus, Measles virus, Mumps virus, Epstein‑Barr virus, Cytomegalovirus, or Borrelia Burgdorferi may also contribute to the increased risk of OCD. Reports showed an increased frequency of OCD occurrence in a group of infected people compared to a healthy group. However, there is no evidence of the influence of Influenza virus, Coxsackie virus, Poliovirus, Parvovirus B19, Enterovirus 71, West Nile virus, Treponema Pallidum, or Toxocara infections on the OCD risk. There is a significant relationship between various infectious diseases and an increased OCD risk.

39346901,"Supplementation with <i>Lactobacillus helveticus</i> NS8 alleviated behavioral, neural, endocrine, and microbiota abnormalities in an endogenous rat model of depression.","Major depressive disorder is a condition involving microbiota-gut-brain axis dysfunction. Increasing research aims to improve depression through gut microbiota regulation, including interventions such as probiotics, prebiotics, and fecal microbiota transplants. However, most research focuses on exogenous depression induced by chronic stress or drugs, with less attention given to endogenous depression. Additionally, research on gut mycobiota in depression is significantly less than that on gut bacteria.In the present study, Wistar-Kyoto rats were used as an endogenous depression and treatment-resistant depression model, while Wistar rats served as controls. Differences between the two rat strains in behavior, gut bacteria, gut mycobiota, nervous system, endocrine system, immune system, and gut barrier were evaluated. Additionally, the effects of <i>Lactobacillus helveticus</i> NS8 supplementation were investigated.Wistar-Kyoto rats demonstrated increased depressive-like behaviors in the forced swimming test, reduced sucrose preference in the sucrose preference test, and decreased locomotor activity in the open field test. They also exhibited abnormal gut bacteria and mycobiota, characterized by higher bacterial α-diversity but lower fungal α-diversity, along with increased butyrate, L-tyrosine, and L-phenylalanine biosynthesis from bacteria. Furthermore, these rats showed dysfunction in the microbiota-gut-brain axis, evidenced by a hypo-serotonergic system, hyper-noradrenergic system, defective hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, compromised gut barrier integrity, heightened serum inflammation, and diminished gut immunity. A 1-month <i>L. helveticus</i> NS8 intervention increased the fecal abundance of <i>L. helveticus</i>; reduced the abundance of <i>Bilophila</i> and Debaryomycetaceae; decreased immobility time but increased climbing time in the forced swimming test; reduced hippocampal corticotropin-releasing hormone levels; decreased hypothalamic norepinephrine levels; increased hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor dopamine, and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid content; and improved the gut microbiota, serotonergic, and noradrenergic system.The depressive phenotype of Wistar-Kyoto rats is not only attributed to their genetic context but also closely related to their gut microbiota. Abnormal gut microbiota and a dysfunctional microbiota-gut-brain axis play important roles in endogenous depression, just as they do in exogenous depression. Supplementing with probiotics such as <i>L. helveticus</i> NS8 is likely a promising approach to improve endogenous depression and treatment-resistant depression.",Frontiers in immunology,2024,Husile Alatan; Shan Liang; Yosuke Shimodaira; Xiaoli Wu; Xu Hu; Tao Wang; Jia Luo; Katsunori Iijima; Feng Jin
38896988,Hyperglycemia and cognitive impairments anticipate the onset of an overt type 2 diabetes-like phenotype in TALLYHO/JngJ mice.,"Type 2 Diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disorder characterized by chronic hyperglycemia, resulting from deficits in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. Whilst the role of insulin in the peripheral nervous system has been ascertained in countless studies, its role in the central nervous system (CNS) is emerging only recently. Brain insulin has been lately associated with brain disorders like Alzheimer's disease, obsessive compulsive disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Thus, understanding the role of insulin as a common risk factor for mental and somatic comorbidities may disclose novel preventative and therapeutic approaches. We evaluated general metabolism (glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, energy expenditure, lipid metabolism, and polydipsia) and cognitive capabilities (attention, cognitive flexibility, and memory), in adolescent, young adult, and adult male and female TALLYHO/JngJ mice (TH, previously reported to constitute a valid experimental model of T2DM due to impaired insulin signaling). Adult TH mice have also been studied for alterations in gut microbiota diversity and composition. While TH mice exhibited profound deficits in cognitive flexibility and altered glucose metabolism, we observed that these alterations emerged either much earlier (males) or independent of (females) a comprehensive constellation of symptoms, isomorphic to an overt T2DM-like phenotype (insulin resistance, polydipsia, higher energy expenditure, and altered lipid metabolism). We also observed significant sex-dependent alterations in gut microbiota alpha diversity and taxonomy in adult TH mice. Deficits in insulin signaling may represent a common risk factor for both T2DM and CNS-related deficits, which may stem from (partly) independent mechanisms.",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2024,Martina Presta; Francesca Zoratto; Danique Mulder; Angela Maria Ottomana; Edoardo Pisa; Alejandro Arias Vásquez; David A Slattery; Jeffrey C Glennon; Simone Macrì
39089603,"Enhanced cerebral blood flow similarity of the somatomotor network in chronic insomnia: Transcriptomic decoding, gut microbial signatures and phenotypic roles.","Chronic insomnia (CI) is a complex disease involving multiple factors including genetics, gut microbiota, and brain structure and function. However, there lacks a unified framework to elucidate how these factors interact in CI. By combining data of clinical assessment, sleep behavior recording, cognitive test, multimodal MRI (structural, functional, and perfusion), gene, and gut microbiota, this study demonstrated that enhanced cerebral blood flow (CBF) similarities of the somatomotor network (SMN) acted as a key mediator to link multiple factors in CI. Specifically, we first demonstrated that only CBF but not morphological or functional networks exhibited alterations in patients with CI, characterized by increases within the SMN and between the SMN and higher-order associative networks. Moreover, these findings were highly reproducible and the CBF similarity method was test-retest reliable. Further, we showed that transcriptional profiles explained 60.4 % variance of the pattern of the increased CBF similarities with the most correlated genes enriched in regulation of cellular and protein localization and material transport, and gut microbiota explained 69.7 % inter-individual variance in the increased CBF similarities with the most contributions from Negativicutes and Lactobacillales. Finally, we found that the increased CBF similarities were correlated with clinical variables, accounted for sleep behaviors and cognitive deficits, and contributed the most to the patient-control classification (accuracy = 84.4 %). Altogether, our findings have important implications for understanding the neuropathology of CI and may inform ways of developing new therapeutic strategies for the disease.",NeuroImage,2024,Xiaofen Ma; Junle Li; Yuping Yang; Xiaofan Qiu; Jintao Sheng; Ningke Han; Changwen Wu; Guang Xu; Guihua Jiang; Junzhang Tian; Xuchu Weng; Jinhui Wang
39456245,Altered Gut Microbiota Patterns in Young Children with Recent Maltreatment Exposure.,"The brain and the intestinal microbiota are highly interconnected and especially vulnerable to disruptions in early life. Emerging evidence indicates that psychosocial adversity detrimentally impacts the intestinal microbiota, affecting both physical and mental health. This study aims to investigate the gut microbiome in young children in the immediate aftermath of maltreatment exposure.Maltreatment exposure was assessed in 88 children (ages 3-7) using the Maternal Interview for the Classification of Maltreatment [MICM]. Children were allocated to three groups according to the number of experienced maltreatment categories: no maltreatment, low maltreatment, and high maltreatment exposures. Stool samples were collected and analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing.Children subjected to high maltreatment exposure exhibited lower alpha diversity in comparison to those with both no and low maltreatment exposure (Simpson Index, Tukey post hoc, <i>p</i> = 0.059 and <i>p</i> = 0.007, respectively). No significant distinctions in beta diversity were identified. High maltreatment exposure was associated with the enrichment of several genera from the class Clostridia (<i>Clostridium, Intestinibacter, Howardella</i> and <i>Butyrivibrio</i>) and the depletion of the genus <i>Phocaeicola</i> (class Bacteriodia).Severe maltreatment exposure is associated with alterations in the gut microbiota of young children. Longitudinal trajectories of intestinal microbiota composition in the context of maltreatment may reveal important insights related to psychiatric and somatic health outcomes.",Biomolecules,2024,Gergana Karaboycheva; Melanie L Conrad; Peggy Dörr; Katja Dittrich; Elena Murray; Karolina Skonieczna-Żydecka; Mariusz Kaczmarczyk; Igor Łoniewski; Heiko Klawitter; Claudia Buss; Sonja Entringer; Elisabeth Binder; Sibylle M Winter; Christine Heim
39452233,"Pharmacists' Knowledge, Perception, and Prescribing Practice of Probiotics in the UAE: A Cross-Sectional Study.","The human body is a complex and interconnected system where trillions of microorganisms, collectively known as the gut microbiota, coexist with these cells. Besides maintaining digestive health, this relationship also impacts well-being, including immune function, metabolism, and mental health. As frontline healthcare providers, pharmacists are pivotal in promoting the benefits of probiotics for immune support. This study explored pharmacists' knowledge, perception, and practice behavior in the UAE towards the implication of probiotic application beyond digestive health, such as cardiovascular and mental health impacts and their diverse dosage forms.An online self-administered survey was distributed among pharmacists in the UAE. Data were collected through personal visits to pharmacies, where pharmacists were approached and asked to complete the questionnaire. The sample size included 407 pharmacists, determined using the formula for proportions with a 95% confidence level and a 5% margin of error. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 29. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize demographic characteristics and survey responses. The knowledge levels were categorized into poor, moderate, and good. Chi-square analysis was employed to investigate associations between demographic factors and knowledge levels, with a significance level set at <i>p</i> < 0.05, enhancing the robustness of the study's findings.This study included 407 completed eligible responses. About 63.56% of participants were female, with 52.1% employed in pharmacy chains. While 91.2% of pharmacists recognized probiotics' role in immune support, only 30% were aware of their cardiovascular benefits. Moreover, chewing gum was the least known dosage form of probiotics, recognized by only 16.7% of respondents. Additionally, only 57% of the participants recognized liposomes as a dosage form. In practice, most pharmacists recommended storing probiotics at room temperature, accounting for 66.6%. The most prevalent misconception encountered in the pharmacy setting was the belief that probiotics are primarily intended for gastrointestinal tract problems, at 79.1% of the respondents. Regarding perception, the agreement was observed regarding the safety of probiotics for all ages. Perceived barriers included the high cost of probiotics, with the majority (86.5%) indicating this as a significant obstacle, while lack of demand was identified as the minor barrier by 64.6%. Additionally, an association was found at a significance level of <i>p</i> < 0.05 with knowledge, gender, educational level, type and location of pharmacy, and source of information.The study highlights knowledge gaps in pharmacists' understanding of probiotic applications beyond digestive health, particularly cardiovascular health and depression. Targeted educational interventions are necessary to address these gaps. The findings underscore the importance of ongoing professional development for pharmacists, enhancing their role in patient education and the promotion of probiotics for overall health.","Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)",2024,Maram O Abbas; Hanan Ahmed; Eisha Hamid; Dyshania Padayachee; Menah Talla Abdulbadia; Sohila Khalid; Ahmed Abuelhana; Bazigha K Abdul Rasool
39217732,"Investigating the bacterial profiles of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Actinobacteria, Fusobacterium, Firmicutes, and Bacteroides in stool samples from patients with severe depression and healthy individuals.","Depression is a multifaceted mental health disorder with complex etiology and significant global burden. Recent research indicates that the gut microbiota plays a role in the pathophysiology of depression, highlighting the potential role of specific bacterial species in influencing mood and cognitive function. In this study, we aimed to investigate the presence, copy numbers, and Ct values of selected bacterial species in stool samples from depressed patients (n=50) compared to control subjects (n=50). Our findings revealed significant differences in the abundance of Fusobacterium spp., Bifidobacterium spp., Lactobacillus spp., Bacteroidetes phylum, Firmicutes phylum, and Actinobacteria spp. between the two groups. Dysregulation of the gut microbiota, characterized by decreased presence of beneficial bacteria (e.g., Bifidobacterium spp., Lactobacillus spp.) and altered abundance of potentially pathogenic bacteria (e.g., Fusobacterium spp.), may contribute to the development or exacerbation of depression. These findings support the emerging concept of the gut-brain axis and its role in mental health. However, further research is needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms and explore the therapeutic potential of microbiota-targeted interventions for depression. Understanding the intricate interplay between the gut microbiota and depression could pave the way for novel treatment strategies and personalized approaches in mental health care.",Psychoneuroendocrinology,2024,Fatemeh Arbabi; Reza Shapoury; Fakhri Haghi; Habib Zeighami; Reza Pirzeh

Furthermore, 1 Hz LF-TMS-treatment partially recovered chronic stress induced changes of microbiotas, such as the abundance of <i>Chloroflexi</i>, <i>Actinobacteria</i>.These results manifested that LF-TMS treatment can improve the anhedonic behaviors caused by CUMS in mice, which are connected with regulating the related intestinal microbial community disturbance, including species diversity, structure of gut microbiota, and species composition.",Alpha psychiatry,2024,Linyin Gao; Xiangwei Zhao; Lei Wu; Chuan Liu; Ran Ding; Haitao Wang; Xueliang Shang
38960388,Beneficial effect of GABA-producing Lactiplantibacillus strain LPB145 isolated from cheese starters evaluated in anxiety- and depression-like behaviours in rats.,"In a previous study, we reported the in vitro potential probiotic and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) production, of several strains from a collection of Lactiplantibacillus (Lpb) strains within the community of natural whey starters from the artisanal cheese industry. GABA is a non-protein amino acid widely distributed in nature and produced in animals, plants, and microorganisms. However, the best known role of GABA is its function as the major inhibitory neurotransmitter of the central nervous system. Preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that the GABAergic system has a relevant role in mental health disorders, such as anxiety and major depression. The modulation of the GABAergic system has been suggested as a potential strategy for treatment, one such mechanism of modulation is the influence of the microbiota-gut-brain axis through probiotic treatments. The present study was designed to investigate the in vivo probiotic potential of LPB145, a Lactiplantibacillus strain previously characterised as a GABA-producing potentially probiotic strain. Therefore, we evaluated the behavioural effects of chronic oral administration of LPB145 on rats' anxiety- and depression-like behaviours, using the elevated plus maze, open field, and the forced swimming test. The impact of LPB145 strain treatment on the gut microbiota structure and diversity was assessed to discern a possible mechanism of action of the LPB145 treatment through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Our results showed that LPB145 administration induced an antidepressive-like behaviour without changes in locomotor activity. In contrast, the treatment did not modify the experimental anxiety. The structure and diversity of the intestinal microbiota remained unaffected by the treatment when compared to the control. However, specific clades that could be implicated in the behavioural changes did show differences in their relative abundance. These findings provide evidence regarding the potential of probiotic strains isolated from alimentary sources, to modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis and positively impact mental health.",Beneficial microbes,2024,J Lozano; S Fabius; S Fernández-Ciganda; J Urbanavicius; C Piccini; C Scorza; P Zunino
39313515,Oral administration of astilbin mitigates acetaminophen-induced acute liver injury in mice by modulating the gut microbiota.,"Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose-induced acute liver injury (ALI) is characterized by extensive oxidative stress, and the clinical interventions for this adverse effect remain limited. Astilbin is an active compound found in the rhizome of Smilax glabra Roxb. with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. Due to its low oral bioavailability, astilbin can accumulate in the intestine, which provides a basis for the interaction between astilbin and gut microbiota (GM). In the present study we investigated the protective effects of astilbin against APAP-induced ALI by focusing on the interaction between astilbin and GM. Mice were treated with astilbin (50 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>·d<sup>-1</sup>, i.g.) for 7 days. After the last administration of astilbin for 2 h, the mice received APAP (300 mg/kg, i.g.) to induce ALI. We showed that oral administration of astilbin significantly alleviated APAP-induced ALI by altering the composition of GM and enriching beneficial metabolites including hydroxytyrosol (HT). GM depletion using an ""antibiotics cocktail"" or paraoral administration of astilbin abolished the hepatoprotective effects of astilbin. On the other hand, administration of HT (10 mg/kg, i.g.) caused similar protective effects in APAP-induced ALI mice. Transcriptomic analysis of the liver tissue revealed that HT inhibited reactive oxygen species and inflammation-related signaling in APAP-induced ALI; HT promoted activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway to combat oxidative stress following APAP challenge in a sirtuin-6-dependent manner. These results highlight that oral astilbin ameliorates APAP-induced ALI by manipulating the GM and metabolites towards a more favorable profile, and provide an alternative therapeutic strategy for alleviating APAP-induced ALI.",Acta pharmacologica Sinica,2024,Qin Yang; Wen-Hao He; Li Xie; Tao Chen; Ruo-Fan Liu; Jia-Jia Hu; Jia-Yin Guo; Guo-Zhu Tan; Fu-Ling Wu; Peng Gu; Peng Chen; Yu Chen
38737108,Cucurbitacin E Alleviates Colonic Barrier Function Impairment and Inflammation Response and Improves Microbial Composition on Experimental Colitis Models.,"Cucurbitacins, which are found in a variety of medicinal plants, vegetables and fruits, were known for their diverse pharmacological and biological activities, including anticancer, anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. Cucurbitacin E, one of the major cucurbitacins, was recently proved to inhibit inflammatory response.To explore the therapeutic effects of cucurbitacin E on colitis and the underlying mechanisms, male mice drunk water containing 2.5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) to establish colitis model and administrated with cucurbitacin E during and after DSS treatment. The disease activity index was scored and colonic histological damage was observed. Intestinal tight junction and inflammatory response were determined. 16S rRNA and transcriptome sequencing were performed to analyze gut microbiota composition and gene expression, respectively.We found that cucurbitacin E alleviated DSS-induced body weight loss and impaired colonic morphology. Cucurbitacin E decreased the expression of inflammatory cytokines and cell apoptosis, and maintained barrier function. Additionally, cucurbitacin E retrieved DSS-induced alterations in the bacterial community composition. Furthermore, a variety of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) caused by cucurbitacin E were enriched in several pathways including the NFκB and TNF signaling pathways as well as in Th17 cell differentiation. There was a close relationship between DEGs and bacteria such as <i>Escherichia-Shigella</i> and Muribaculaceae.Our results revealed that cucurbitacin E may exert protective effects on colitis via modulating inflammatory response, microbiota composition and host gene expression. Our study supports the therapeutic potential of cucurbitacin E in colitis and indicates that gut microbes are potentially therapeutic targets.",Journal of inflammation research,2024,Fengxia Zhan; Wei Song; Yong Fan; Fangjian Wang; Qian Wang

However, the complex interplay of various factors underlying the development and progression of MDD poses significant challenges. Our previous study demonstrated improvements in cognitive functions in MDD patients undergoing treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) supplemented with Lactobacillus plantarum 299v (LP299v).To elucidate the biochemical mechanisms underlying cognitive functions improvements, we explored underlying metabolic changes. We employed multi-platform metabolomics, including LC-QTOF-MS and CE-TOF-MS profiling, alongside chiral LC-QqQ-MS analysis for amino acids.Supplementation of SSRI treatment with LP299v intensified the reduction of long-chain acylcarnitines, potentially indicating improved mitochondrial function. LP299v supplementation reduced N-acyl taurines more than four times compared to the placebo, suggesting a substantial impact on restoring biochemical balance. The LP299v-supplemented group showed increased levels of oxidized glycerophosphocholine (oxPC). Additionally, LP299v supplementation led to higher levels of sphingomyelins, L-histidine, D-valine, and p-cresol.This exploratory study suggests potential metabolic pathways influenced by LP299v supplementation. However, the need for further research hinders the ability to draw definitive conclusions.Observed metabolic changes were linked to mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, oxidative stress, and gut microbiota disruption. Despite the subtle nature of this alterations, our research successfully detected these differences and connected them to the metabolic disruptions associated with MDD. Our findings emphasise the intricate relationship between metabolism, gut microbiota, and mental health prompting further research into the mechanisms of action of probiotics in MDD treatment.",Journal of affective disorders,2024,Joanna Godzien; Bartlomiej Kalaska; Leszek Rudzki; Cecilia Barbas-Bernardos; Justyna Swieton; Angeles Lopez-Gonzalvez; Lucyna Ostrowska; Agata Szulc; Napoleon Waszkiewicz; Michal Ciborowski; Antonia García; Adam Kretowski; Coral Barbas; Dariusz Pawlak
